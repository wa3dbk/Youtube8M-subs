00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:08.069
 hello to all and welcome except here 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.880
 rapid 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.139
 I will show you today 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.639
 should be small bites of 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.900
 goats you'll see the recipe is 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.320
 easy and fast 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.190
 So let's go then for 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.320
 butchers with goat 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.900
 we will need an apple 2 spoons 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.119
 tablespoon flaxseed 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.710
 goat cheese 2 tablespoons seeds 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.170
 sesame 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.369
 a pinch of pepper 1 and a spoon 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.369
 chopped chive soup 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.650
 so I start by peeling my apple 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.650
 is emptied inside 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.899
 so for this recipe take a 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.340
 little apple if you only have 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.469
 big apples in this case just take that 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.149
 half so here I'll charge in 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.239
 small cubes 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.640
 so the cut first in two and then 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.730
 still in two on the length 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.420
 here and there I will avoid small 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.420
 cubes 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.960
 Well, I start by making sticks 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:26.240
 and then I cut in the other direction 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.240
 here to avoid them in very small 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.200
 here I am ridding them in my bowl 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.759
 go on we go after the recipe 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.860
 so here I take my sticks here and 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.659
 I stuff them so I try to remove 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.560
 the biggest of the crust one even though 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.560
 rest a little is not very serious 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.340
 here and then I cut small 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.340
 pieces directly in the know 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.500
 so with my fork I'm going 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.500
 the crazy crush looks really puree 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.450
 so here is always think to leave 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.330
 your room temperature log 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.920
 if you have ever forgotten or 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.500
 is really cold in this case past 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.930
 lightly in the microwave then there 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.290
 I add my apples that I have 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:54.530
 cut into small cubes 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:59.210
 here and there I mix we have it now 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:02.110
 so I pepper and here I 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.110
 continues to mix 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.430
 now I'm going to film my preparation 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.430
 and put it ten minutes in the freezer 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.830
 so that's it I took out my preparation 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:24.330
 of the co-founder so my cheese got 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.980
 firmed up then I'm going to planned and so 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.130
 a little cheese and apples and 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.260
 I deformed my balls here after 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.090
 I prepared a small bowl with water 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.930
 very cold to avoid precisely 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.220
 to have cheese that sticks to the hands 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:47.530
 so we try to make balls 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:51.510
 identical to that's me I continue well 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.510
 immediately and we are right now 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.900
 in this is it now we will be able 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.200
 spend their dresses age 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.170
 so here I 'm going to take a pain is 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.770
 there go directly into my seeds 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:08.890
 of his men 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:10.060
 here I put a fork here because 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.920
 we want to really play on 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.930
 textures in having crunchy fondant 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.930
 Juicy is really what we 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.150
 research 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:24.880
 here I put that aside 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:27.130
 then I take a ball and I pass 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.800
 a chive so do not hesitate to re 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.000
 so put the cheese balls at 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.240
 freezer if you find that they 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:41.860
 have passed ferment here that I put it 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.200
 with the other boulin and then I take 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.720
 a ball that I spend in my seeds 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.690
 of flax then these are flax seeds 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.140
 who are stuffed with omega 3 very good 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.140
 for health 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:59.020
 now we will sublimate our 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.719
 preparation 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.719
 so the idea is to put 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:07.960
 spoons here to deposit so by 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:11.860
 above the mills here I have the ball 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.349
 to sesame people file one with the 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.780
 flaxseed and we're going to bring some 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:20.229
 color with a ball here if you 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.780
 do you want here and there we have a 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.639
 superb plate 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.370
 this is fantastic in any case me 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.810
 I hope I have convinced your taste buds 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:34.770
 that's it with my super easy recipes 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.770
 eh we 'll go to tasting 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.610
 m 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.980
 so we have crunchy creamy and 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.200
 the freshness brought by the apple 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:59.480
 it's really fantastic it's worth 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:06:00.680
 downright detour super good that's it 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.540

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.460
