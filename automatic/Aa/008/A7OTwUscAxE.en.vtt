00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello today we'll see what 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.059
 plus lithium batteries and 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.570
 unlike lead firstly okay 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.469
 containers and 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.299
 but stress is good but the most 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.210
 the main thing because of what everyone is chasing 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.550
 for flying because it is light weight 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:23.369
 we know a lot of lead weights and 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.260
 lithium batteries are film 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.820
 batteries they weigh much less 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:34.680
 so let's see here we have with you 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:37.040
 from five banks with 10 batteries each 5 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:43.710
 sections rather 10 batteries 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:47.989
 here she can count weighs 2 and 2 38 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.940
 a kilogram but what is it heavy 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.789
 respectively together this block and 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.730
 this block weighs these 2 2 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.210
 section 360 20 amps 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.460
 weighs about five pounds a 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:08.810
 now let's see how much it weighs 7 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.810
 or 9 amps on how much we have 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.340
 so 34th then 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.030
 Well to be honest, we like 9 amps well who 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.070
 in the course then write a comment 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.890
 let's see how much one weighs 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.770
 7 or 9 amp lead battery 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.570
 hours for example here we have 20 amps 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.880
 hours weighs 2 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.420
 556 is even heavier than this one 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.170
 section 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.120
 but here we have 20 ampere hours and 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.900
 and the voltage is a little higher than this 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.700
 battery 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:54.880
 Well, here 18 volts here we have 14 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:59.740
 respectively 12 and 14 12 18 18 and 12 in 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:03.030
 general thought is understandable in the first place 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.700
 big mistake of many who make 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.920
 things like that 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.140
 the frame is killed precisely for excess weight 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.020
 not only do you sit on the wheel hanging 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.940
 so more wire controllers and another plus 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.080
 Here are many batteries 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.360
 18 ampers 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.890
 but they are very heavy and, respectively, 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.530
 it turns out the cheapest option here 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.760
 I don't have 100 batteries now 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.180
 80100 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.180
 with a capacity of more than 20 amperes 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.959
 spoke rounded to 20 amps and all this 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.280
 weighs much less than on 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:43.329
 how much is 6 such here 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.349
 battery pair paralleled and 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:52.689
 36 volts can say I don't know how much 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:55.319
 it turns out 6 almost five times this 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:58.150
 everything is four times harder 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:02.639
 lead than molded the same 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:06.939
 capacity even can more so 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:08.739
 think for yourself decide where am I 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:11.799
 Many guys have already given the idea 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:14.319
 I took advantage of it makes me happy 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.299
 turns in any city you can find 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.269
 block batteries and at very 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.930
 cheap and it is accordingly crafts 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.939
 just crafts will not end the same way 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.370
 Soon it will probably go what we will 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:31.510
 buy non-working equipment 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:34.269
 well electrical engineering there mopeds there still 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.459
 anything of a bicycle due to the fact that 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.650
 they people have batteries they are there for 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.879
 pennies will heat them 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.979
 principal amount 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:46.299
 Generally in electrical engineering takes 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:48.400
 batteries and buy there for 5 10 thousand 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.299
 rubles even to the firm 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:56.470
 such pieces of 500 batteries well sense 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:59.379
 then buy them new when you can 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.560
 fine dial 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:05.819
 a bunch of batteries and basically happy 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.060
 this is such a small video 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:13.359
 let's hold on we break through we all yes 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.819
 will we all be able everything will be much 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:20.199
 cheaper 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:22.510
 everything will be fine for someone I am very lucky 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.810
 I know that the place was written off with me 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.430
 people who are for pennies 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.070
 finds someone who generally finds free 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.960
 Someone in general, the company for the gift give well 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:39.639
 it's generally just over I don't know 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:42.340
 lucky so everything can be for free 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.469
 This is the most free energy. 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.660
 that everyone will come up with a perpetual motion machine and here 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:48.270
 the most about 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.430
 well, that's right from our side 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.010
 we use something that usually throws out 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.890
 Now imagine yes, but so little 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.140
 distract from the topic for example computer 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.240
 firms yeah rejected a bunch there 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.690
 batteries yes and send them passed on 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.590
 processing accordingly is resources 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.370
 spent on processing 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.140
 and if we take first and firm nothing 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.510
 does not lose and minato there to pay money 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.790
 or something else there for recycling 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:18.390
 spent or take them even to gasoline 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:22.170
 waste they just give us and we them 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:24.930
 We use and where can I use 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.730
 so I suspect not the time for example 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.450
 which they stood in laptops 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:35.370
 because there is a completely different one 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:37.620
 technology technology apologize then 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.250
 there seems to be done to me specifically 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.990
 so that they no longer work there 2 5 years 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:46.590
 in many there it just does not seem stupid 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.440
 we set a time limit 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.930
 get a chance so huge just 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.230
 just a huge few just 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.900
 thinks about it turn off I do not know 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.450
 language i knew it was such a klondike yes i 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.610
 would and when i had the first 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.280
 battery nimh they gave me 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:08.520
 not just lay for 10 years I would have 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.620
 then maybe something came up here on 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.620
 this optimistic note i am with you 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.580
 say goodbye to everyone thank you for your attention to all 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.580
 good luck everyone bye
