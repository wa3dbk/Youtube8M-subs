00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
make a simple pair of earrings out of

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.879 
make a simple pair of earrings out of
carnelian<00:00:10.559> beads<00:00:11.719> so<00:00:12.719> first<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.380> need<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.650> head

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
carnelian beads so first you need a head

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.070 
carnelian beads so first you need a head
pin<00:00:15.619> and<00:00:16.619> basically<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:17.820> just<00:00:17.850> find<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.810> bead

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
pin and basically you just find a bead

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.160 
pin and basically you just find a bead
and<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.890> want<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.420> try<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.449> find<00:00:21.720> beads<00:00:22.050> that

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
and you want to try to find beads that

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.960 
and you want to try to find beads that
match<00:00:22.529> up<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:23.039> your<00:00:23.189> earrings<00:00:23.580> won't<00:00:23.820> be

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
match up so your earrings won't be

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.779 
match up so your earrings won't be
lopsided<00:00:26.000> you<00:00:27.000> just<00:00:28.010> place<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.250> bead<00:00:29.460> onto

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
lopsided you just place the bead onto

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.770 
lopsided you just place the bead onto
the<00:00:30.090> head<00:00:30.300> pin<00:00:31.099> and<00:00:32.099> it'll<00:00:33.030> stay<00:00:33.390> there

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
the head pin and it'll stay there

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.400 
the head pin and it'll stay there
because<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.290> head<00:00:34.440> pin<00:00:34.649> will<00:00:35.340> hold<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.700> on

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.840

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.799 

make<00:00:48.570> your<00:00:48.750> perfect<00:00:49.199> loop<00:00:53.390> pull<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.629> wire

around you can make the loop as big as
you<00:01:00.510> like<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:01.079> prefer<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.579> be<00:01:02.699> pretty

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
you like I prefer for it to be pretty

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.170 
you like I prefer for it to be pretty
small<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:04.710> then<00:01:05.190> you<00:01:05.309> want<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.549> take<00:01:05.729> your<00:01:05.940> ear

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
wire connect it to your loop and then

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:30.899 
wire connect it to your loop and then
you'll<00:01:17.009> need<00:01:17.190> your<00:01:17.340> flat<00:01:17.580> nose<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.210> finish

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909

you want to make sure that you keep the

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:43.200 
you want to make sure that you keep the
loop<00:01:34.420> tight<00:01:34.869> next<00:01:35.649> to<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.039> bead<00:01:42.030> crimp<00:01:43.030> the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
loop tight next to the bead crimp the

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.090 
loop tight next to the bead crimp the
loop<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.920> then<00:01:44.920> you<00:01:45.159> take<00:01:45.429> your<00:01:47.100> cutting

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
loop and then you take your cutting

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.880 
loop and then you take your cutting
pliers<00:01:48.399> to<00:01:49.109> cut<00:01:50.109> the<00:01:50.319> remaining<00:01:50.649> excess<00:01:51.099> off

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.039 

and<00:01:56.890> then<00:01:57.789> just<00:01:57.969> to<00:01:58.119> make<00:01:58.299> sure<00:01:58.329> that<00:01:58.840> little

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
and then just to make sure that little

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.160 
and then just to make sure that little
tail<00:01:59.469> doesn't<00:02:00.240> stick<00:02:01.240> out<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:01.750> take<00:02:01.990> the

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
tail doesn't stick out you take the

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.459 
tail doesn't stick out you take the
chain<00:02:02.409> nose<00:02:02.679> and<00:02:03.009> crimp<00:02:03.610> it<00:02:03.729> down<00:02:03.879> again<00:02:04.469> and

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
chain nose and crimp it down again and

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.569 
chain nose and crimp it down again and
there<00:02:06.429> you<00:02:06.520> have<00:02:06.579> the<00:02:08.069> simplest<00:02:09.069> of<00:02:09.190> earrings
