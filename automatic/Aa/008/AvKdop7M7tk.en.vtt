 the plane of the president of bolivia evo 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.849
 morals made a landing 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.460
 emergency in austria they do not 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:15.549
 allow them to land in France and in 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.470
 portugal according to the rumors that there are up 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.530
 now in various media 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.020
 edward or single could be on board the 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.210
 presidential plane and that's why it 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.770
 I would have denied him then we're going to 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.180
 adjust to sight how good it is 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:36.120
 the president leaving moral when 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:38.450
 it was in the air france the same 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.160
 inexplicably 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:46.790
 communicates to us that the 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.950
 overflight authorization by the 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.770
 French territory we had this 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.900
 authorization us 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:58.890
 no explanation 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:05.160
 then the president has been forced 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:07.500
 to land in Vienna then we 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.000
 we communicate with the authorities that 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.390
 we have sent our note of 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.400
 protest to the government of portugal 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.430
 we have moved through our 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.430
 ambassadors in europe so that we 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:25.020
 they can give some explanation they 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.970
 they say it's technical issues but then 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.270
 of some communications with some 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.560
 authorities informed us that 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:39.710
 there would be some unfounded suspicions of 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:43.260
 that Mr. Snowden would be on that ship 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:47.810
 We not know us 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:53.330
 this lie has been invented 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:56.780
 someone wants to hurt our country 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:00.940
 it's information that they 've been 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:05.740
 circulating wrong information 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:09.649
 intended to harm the country 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.800
 We consider that with this attitude 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.680
 that we want to denounce the community 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:21.230
 international agreement that the 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.760
 air traffic rights not only 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.540
 traffic rights have been violated 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.030
 aerial 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.959
 we already had the respective 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.390
 authorization 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.590
 we have requested following the 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.349
 international protocol norms 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.599
 we do not know where they come from this 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.879
 malicious information is 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.750
 sovereign lie 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:48.200
 we are finding out portugal has to 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.170
 explain to us france has to 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:56.599
 explain why they have canceled 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:59.560
 besides the plane is a French plane the 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.390
 pilots have been trained in france- 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.010
 that we are in communications with the 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.880
 authorities 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.739
 we consider that possibly root 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.550
 of the president's statements 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:16.940
 morals that in case the lord 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:21.260
 snowden ask for asylum we go 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:24.140
 to analyze they want to intimidate us is a 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.900
 discrimination towards our president 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.180
 It has jeopardized the life of 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.160
 president president was already in flight 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.580
 we had the respective one 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.519
 authorization when it was already missing for 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.610
 enter French territory less than 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:45.390
 one hour they tell us that it has been 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:48.180
 canceled the overflight authorization 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.990
 we can not lie to the 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.000
 international community when one 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.400
 acquires this flight authorization 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.040
 landing is because he has given all the 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.890
 information of those who travel in that 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.990
 plane who are the crew of that 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.990
 airplane 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.660
 and knowing all this information they 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.890
 give this authorization we can not 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.400
 we lie to the food 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.560
 international carrying passengers 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.690
 ghosts that's why we want to express 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.170
 our annoyance 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.630
 we want to express this our our 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.780
