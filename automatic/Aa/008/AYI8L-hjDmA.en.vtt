this entire episode was set up pretty

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.370 
this entire episode was set up pretty
much<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.279> was<00:00:26.430> set<00:00:27.000> up<00:00:27.029> for<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.869> events<00:00:28.230> to

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
much it was set up for the events to

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.259 
much it was set up for the events to
happen<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.130> sort<00:00:29.369> from<00:00:29.580> what<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.789> could<00:00:29.970> see

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
happen in the sort from what I could see

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.510 
happen in the sort from what I could see
going<00:00:30.539> down<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.859> there's<00:00:32.279> something

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
going down is that there's something

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.580 
going down is that there's something
going<00:00:32.759> down<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.329> 11th<00:00:33.719> floor<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
going down in the 11th floor and in the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.350 
going down in the 11th floor and in the
middle<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.010> episode<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.610> find<00:00:35.820> out<00:00:36.120> that

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
middle of the episode we find out that

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.030 
middle of the episode we find out that
these<00:00:36.630> ghouls<00:00:36.960> are<00:00:37.230> starting<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.680> form

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
these ghouls are starting to form

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.490 
these ghouls are starting to form
together<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.730> make<00:00:39.059> parties<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.930> take<00:00:40.200> down

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
together and make parties to take down

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.740 
together and make parties to take down
the<00:00:40.739> dubs<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.640> that's<00:00:42.030> exactly<00:00:42.300> what's<00:00:42.600> going

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
the dubs so that's exactly what's going

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.810 
the dubs so that's exactly what's going
on<00:00:42.960> right<00:00:43.200> now<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.890> I'm<00:00:43.980> guessing<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.399> bunch<00:00:44.670> of

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
on right now so I'm guessing a bunch of

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.090 
on right now so I'm guessing a bunch of
different<00:00:45.210> special<00:00:45.629> task<00:00:45.960> force<00:00:46.320> people<00:00:46.739> from

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
different special task force people from

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.740 
different special task force people from
you<00:00:47.340> know<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> agencies<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.120> organizations

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
you know the agencies and organizations

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.470 
you know the agencies and organizations
that<00:00:48.870> are<00:00:48.930> anti<00:00:49.530> ghouls<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:50.460> probably<00:00:50.730> go<00:00:51.120> and

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
that are anti ghouls can probably go and

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.569 
that are anti ghouls can probably go and
take<00:00:51.750> down<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.079> 11-4<00:00:52.649> that's<00:00:52.890> exactly<00:00:53.370> what

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
take down the 11-4 that's exactly what

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.610 
take down the 11-4 that's exactly what
is<00:00:53.730> going<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:54.120> here<00:00:54.600> but<00:00:55.020> what<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.410> see

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
is going on here but what you see

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.709 
is going on here but what you see
building<00:00:56.070> up<00:00:56.250> at<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.579> end<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.329> episode

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
building up at the end of this episode

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.080 
building up at the end of this episode
is<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.170> certain<00:00:59.070> goals<00:00:59.309> like<00:00:59.640> big-name

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
is that certain goals like big-name

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.970 
is that certain goals like big-name
ghouls<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:00.719> Jason<00:01:01.350> or<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.680> looks<00:01:01.829> like

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
ghouls like Jason or it looks like

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.670 
ghouls like Jason or it looks like
tokhes<00:01:02.460> brother<00:01:02.789> are<00:01:03.180> trying<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.930> find<00:01:04.170> Rize

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
tokhes brother are trying to find Rize

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.710 
tokhes brother are trying to find Rize
and<00:01:04.949> use<00:01:05.280> her<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.760> probably<00:01:06.119> win<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.510> war

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
and use her to probably win this war

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.980 
and use her to probably win this war
that's<00:01:07.020> going<00:01:07.320> down<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.790> had

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
that's going down and so we had

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.510 
that's going down and so we had
foreshadowing<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.380> episode<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.950> war<00:01:11.100> so

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
foreshadowing of this episode of war so

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.010 
foreshadowing of this episode of war so
that's<00:01:11.820> exactly<00:01:12.119> what's<00:01:12.360> going<00:01:12.540> down<00:01:12.810> right

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
that's exactly what's going down right

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.690 
that's exactly what's going down right
now<00:01:13.080> there's<00:01:13.380> gonna<00:01:13.500> be<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.680> war<00:01:13.920> between<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
now there's gonna be a war between the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.179 
now there's gonna be a war between the
11th<00:01:15.090> Lord<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.900> ducks<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.770> what<00:01:17.040> is

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
11th Lord and the ducks that is what is

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.469 
11th Lord and the ducks that is what is
happening<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.000> find<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.420> very

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
happening and I find that very

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.570 
happening and I find that very
intriguing<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.380> how<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.740> was<00:01:19.890> introduced<00:01:20.340> I

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
intriguing of how that was introduced I

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.249 
intriguing of how that was introduced I
felt<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.150> they<00:01:21.270> did<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> good<00:01:21.689> job<00:01:21.750> of

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
felt like they did a good job of

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.380 
felt like they did a good job of
building<00:01:22.680> up<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.920> tension<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.820> episode

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
building up the tension of this episode

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.050 
building up the tension of this episode
and<00:01:24.659> as<00:01:24.990> always<00:01:25.320> I'm<00:01:25.710> an<00:01:25.860> anime<00:01:26.280> only<00:01:26.610> watcher

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
and as always I'm an anime only watcher

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.850 
and as always I'm an anime only watcher
so<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.240> don't<00:01:27.540> know<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:27.960> they<00:01:28.080> skipped<00:01:28.409> over<00:01:28.560> any

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
so I don't know if they skipped over any

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.620 
so I don't know if they skipped over any
details<00:01:29.310> or<00:01:29.460> not<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.210> I'm<00:01:30.299> gonna<00:01:30.390> leave<00:01:30.570> that

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
details or not so I'm gonna leave that

night ghoul it was built up a lot and
pretty<00:02:43.579> much<00:02:43.760> if<00:02:44.030> I<00:02:44.269> think<00:02:44.689> about<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:45.109> the

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
pretty much if I think about it the

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.539 
pretty much if I think about it the
different<00:02:45.530> information<00:02:45.680> I've<00:02:46.069> gotten<00:02:46.430> with
