years
really<00:00:13.769> it's<00:00:14.040> under<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.549> umbrella<00:00:14.969> of

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
really it's under the umbrella of

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.380 
really it's under the umbrella of
encaustic<00:00:16.049> painting<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.910> really<00:00:18.180> has<00:00:18.359> a

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
encaustic painting and it really has a

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.080 
encaustic painting and it really has a
really<00:00:18.810> an<00:00:19.350> excellent<00:00:19.890> tradition<00:00:20.609> behind<00:00:20.760> it

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
really an excellent tradition behind it

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.730 
really an excellent tradition behind it
so<00:00:21.240> certainly<00:00:21.570> something<00:00:22.170> well<00:00:22.529> worth

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
so certainly something well worth

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.170 
so certainly something well worth

beautiful smell to it

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.799 
beautiful smell to it
and<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.050> really<00:00:40.320> good<00:00:40.559> if<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:41.510> add<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.780> to

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
and this is really good if you add it to

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.350 
and this is really good if you add it to
your<00:00:42.989> medium<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.770> just<00:00:44.070> go<00:00:44.370> ahead<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.329> can

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
your medium I just go ahead and you can

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.229 
your medium I just go ahead and you can
melt<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.989> add<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> little<00:00:47.039> bit<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.309> turps<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.090> it

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
melt it add a little bit of turps to it

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.229 
melt it add a little bit of turps to it
maybe<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.719> little<00:00:48.899> bit<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.410> damar<00:00:50.129> as<00:00:50.370> well<00:00:50.670> and

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
maybe a little bit of damar as well and

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.850 
maybe a little bit of damar as well and
what<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.840> really<00:00:52.050> does<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.350> give<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.829> a

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
what this really does is give you a

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.060 
what this really does is give you a
really<00:00:53.280> nice<00:00:53.699> rich<00:00:54.270> matte<00:00:54.840> surface<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.920> also

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
really nice rich matte surface it also

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.580 
really nice rich matte surface it also
builds<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> paint<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.360> little<00:00:57.449> bit<00:00:57.719> too<00:00:57.899> and

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
builds up the paint a little bit too and

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.060 
builds up the paint a little bit too and
it's<00:00:59.160> really<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.969> guess<00:01:00.809> realistic<00:01:01.739> painters

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
it's really I guess realistic painters

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.070 
it's really I guess realistic painters
could<00:01:02.340> use<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.879> or<00:01:03.149> people<00:01:03.629> who<00:01:03.719> do<00:01:03.899> more

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
could use it or people who do more

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.990 
could use it or people who do more
representational<00:01:04.860> type<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.189> work<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:05.519> it's

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
representational type of work but it's

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.270 
representational type of work but it's
really<00:01:06.330> more<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:06.990> category<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.680> guess<00:01:08.010> of

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
really more in the category I guess of

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.520 
really more in the category I guess of
people<00:01:08.880> who<00:01:08.970> want<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.210> build<00:01:09.420> up<00:01:09.570> services<00:01:10.170> as

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
people who want to build up services as

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.320 
people who want to build up services as
far<00:01:10.799> as<00:01:10.890> abstract<00:01:11.430> painting<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.299> can

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
far as abstract painting you can

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.300 
far as abstract painting you can
certainly<00:01:12.659> see<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.049> real<00:01:13.320> good<00:01:13.530> case<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:14.070> this

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
certainly see a real good case of this

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.450 
certainly see a real good case of this
in<00:01:14.549> Jasper<00:01:15.450> Johns<00:01:15.689> work<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.500> his<00:01:16.680> flags<00:01:17.040> and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
in Jasper Johns work in his flags and

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.310 
in Jasper Johns work in his flags and
his<00:01:17.610> targets<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:18.930> really<00:01:19.049> see<00:01:19.290> that

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
his targets so you can really see that

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.080 
his targets so you can really see that
but<00:01:19.530> something<00:01:19.950> really<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.310> experiment<00:01:20.939> with

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
but something really to experiment with

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.980 
but something really to experiment with
is<00:01:21.299> these<00:01:21.570> these<00:01:22.320> beeswax<00:01:23.180> blocks<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.630> I

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
is these these beeswax blocks and I

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.840 
is these these beeswax blocks and I
happen<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.530> get<00:01:25.710> these<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:26.070> eBay<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.580> can

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
happen to get these on eBay you can

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.580 
happen to get these on eBay you can
really<00:01:27.090> get<00:01:27.330> some<00:01:27.390> really<00:01:27.780> good<00:01:27.960> deals<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.470> it
