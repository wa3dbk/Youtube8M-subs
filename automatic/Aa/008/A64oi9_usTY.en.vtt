00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.620
 abbreviated wireless local area network 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.240
 wifi or wifi in many countries 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.950
 refers to a wireless network 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.190
 based on radio technology 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.350
 working wi-fi is at the highest possible level 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.970
 data throughput optimized and as 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.539
 technical standard under the 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:30.580
 term aceto 802.11 described 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:33.399
 the additions are a g n or ac 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.380
 manifestations of this specification mostly 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.480
 with the aim of the transfer performance 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.190
 and reach further increase 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.800
 to allow special applications 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.800
 or the use of certain radio 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.170
 frequency bands 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.239
 Wi-Fi connections work with 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.430
 different channels each one 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.900
 specific frequency range within 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.850
 cover a frequency band 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.310
 are two or more 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.290
 networks in close proximity to each other 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.300
 they should be different 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.580
 far apart are the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.990
 frequency ranges so that they spark 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.570
 do not disturb each other 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.820
 the further the channels of the networks 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.620
 separated from each other the better 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.990
 is in principle the expected one 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.360
 performance so the data rate and 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.850
 radio coverage between the fritz box 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.770
 and the individual wlan terminals 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.229
 can be reached 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.990
 the channel separation is however 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.630
 just a factor also play distances 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.869
 the illumination or radio coverage 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.329
 inside buildings disturbances and 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.350
 of course the network components themselves 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.990
 a role 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.509
 the fritzbox tries the optimal 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.520
 to find frequency ranges even by 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.009
 they are nearby networks 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.200
 and other radio waves detects changes 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.409
 They automatically become a free or only 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.470
 little used channel and she sums up 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.149
 according to used standard several 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.310
 Frequency ranges together even more 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:04.070
 to achieve higher data rates 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.420
 is in densely populated radio rooms 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.399
 a clean separation of 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.190
 Frequency ranges not always possible and 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.370
 especially structural conditions the walls 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.270
 moisture in the walls or even 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.520
 Reinforced concrete ceilings within your own 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.110
 Housing often complicate the 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.360
 conditions for a maximum 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.340
 Transmission speed in wifi network 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.800
 but the fritz box offers you one 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.780
 set of options and tools with 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.000
 you recognize potential problems and 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.800
 a best possible performance for the 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.800
 achieve data transmission 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.170
 about the user interface of her 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.450
 Fritz box you with any 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.590
 browser under the address fritz point 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.290
 call box 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.450
 via the menu entry wlan 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.990
 first to the fundamental 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.570
 Settings for the wireless network 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.930
 switch models in some fritzbox 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.810
 here you can choose the 2 4 gigahertz 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.600
 Frequency band the 5 ghz frequency band or 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.340
 Both bands are active in parallel and can 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.720
 in addition, the name of the 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.110
 change radio network 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.330
 the so-called ssid serves you 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.980
 network based on the name of others 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.260
 wlan networks to distinguish 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.750
 This is also for participants outside 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.770
 your home network visible if this 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.170
 option is activated 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.330
 devices already with their fritz box 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.820
 are connected via wi-fi here 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.800
 displayed and also the current 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.340
 data rate of the respective connection 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.890
 you can read it here 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.690
 in the area of radio channel you can use the 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.510
 Settings to a frequency band 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.940
 individually determined as already said 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.739
 the fritzbox tries the optimal 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.550
 settings for your environment yourself 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.650
 to find 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.530
 They should therefore first check whether 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.780
 The real need exists here 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.420
 to change preset values 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.410
 you can watch the wlan monitor 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.959
 fritzbox help 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.060
 he gives you an overview of the 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.400
 within reach radio and 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.110
 sources of interference in the respective 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.240
 frequency range that other wlan can 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.360
 But networks are also microwaves 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.980
 herde baby monitor bluetooth devices and 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.799
 even radars 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.160
 they recognize the possible disturbances 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.960
 by clicking on this button 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.780
 the channel used by your fritzbox 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.690
 is displayed here blue other wlan 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.750
 radio networks appear yellow gray bars 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.460
 indicate through other wireless networks 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.470
 influenced channels 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.540
 it should be as few as possible 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.000
 give intersections 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.550
 is it wireless network the 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.290
 their ssi announcing the public 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.830
 then they will be in here again 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.000
 a list view listed 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.340
 maybe they recognize that 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.990
 networks from their neighborhood and 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.000
 If you need help with the 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.950
 operator on the use of further 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.080
 lie apart the frequency ranges 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.830
 communicate and the radio channel 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.350
 Adjust settings accordingly 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.720
 here they may be 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.450
 better suitable channel for your wifi 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.670
 select manually depending on fritz box 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.610
 Model settings can be something 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.139
 look different 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.590
 support your network devices the 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:25.340
 to date the fastest 802.11 n standards 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:28.130
 or ac you can select these here 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.110
 in the 5 gigahertz band you benefit 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.540
 not just from a larger selection 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.090
 but also essential 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.750
 less interference from neighboring 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.970
 radio networks 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.160
 Finally, a few tips ever 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.950
 after environment further influence on the 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.200
 have the power of your wlan 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.360
 it is normal that most 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.130
 smartphones or tablets are not included 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.550
 be connected at full data rate 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.380
 can 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.840
 because they often do not own the 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.760
 technical requirements around here 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.190
 to be able to draw on the full 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.820
 As an encryption, they should be in one 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.320
 wlan if possible use wpa2 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.450
 older devices the only wpa 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.100
 Encryption can support you 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.650
 without loss of security or 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:15.510
 speed even in mixed mode 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:18.730
 is called wpa wpa2 encryption operate 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:21.030
 Data rates above 54 megabits per second 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:24.030
 require wpa2 as 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.030
 encryption method
