00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
now I thought especially based off of

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.779 
now I thought especially based off of
the<00:00:26.250> 360<00:00:27.000> version<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:27.599> was<00:00:27.840> gonna<00:00:28.080> be

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
the 360 version this was gonna be

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.910 
the 360 version this was gonna be
straight<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:30.300> know<00:00:30.480> converging<00:00:31.140> from<00:00:31.349> 14

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
straight you know converging from 14

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.060 
straight you know converging from 14
yeah<00:00:32.340> I'm<00:00:32.520> not<00:00:32.759> quite<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.440> moose<00:00:37.739> a

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
yeah I'm not quite the the moose a

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.790 
yeah I'm not quite the the moose a
creation<00:00:38.640> suite<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> lot<00:00:39.510> different

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
creation suite is a lot different

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.090 
creation suite is a lot different
they've<00:00:41.930> taken<00:00:42.930> away<00:00:43.430> some<00:00:44.430> move<00:00:44.640> locations

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
they've taken away some move locations

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.680 
they've taken away some move locations
that<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.250> used<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:50.390> doing<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> move

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
that we used to have so doing the move

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.979 
that we used to have so doing the move
says<00:00:52.020> now<00:00:52.730> especially<00:00:53.730> with<00:00:54.059> conversions<00:00:54.809> you

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
says now especially with conversions you

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.279 
says now especially with conversions you
know<00:00:55.170> have<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:56.210> kind<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.270> pick<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.629> choose<00:00:57.870> I

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
know have to kind of pick and choose I

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.410 
know have to kind of pick and choose I
guess<00:00:58.649> was<00:00:58.890> more<00:00:59.129> important<00:00:59.640> based<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.120> what

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
guess was more important based on what

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.850 
guess was more important based on what
era<00:01:00.750> or<00:01:02.390> what<00:01:03.390> timeline<00:01:03.960> for<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.409> person<00:01:04.769> I'm

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
era or what timeline for the person I'm

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.170 
era or what timeline for the person I'm
going<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:06.500> like<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:07.920> one<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.939> is

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
going for like but this one this is

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.210 
going for like but this one this is
geared<00:01:09.479> towards<00:01:10.020> Mordor<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.950> crows

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220
