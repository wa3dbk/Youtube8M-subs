hey youtube this is just a quick video
of<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:05.250> new<00:00:05.720> fluval<00:00:06.720> nano<00:00:06.930> tank<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:08.040> simple

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
of the new fluval nano tank a simple

of the new fluval nano tank a simple
spec<00:00:09.120> three<00:00:10.370> the<00:00:11.370> box<00:00:13.400> the<00:00:14.400> capacity<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.030> two

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
spec three the box the capacity is two

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.450 
spec three the box the capacity is two
point<00:00:15.570> six<00:00:15.960> gallons<00:00:16.440> which<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:16.980> bigger

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
point six gallons which is bigger

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.460 
point six gallons which is bigger
obviously<00:00:17.910> than<00:00:18.060> this<00:00:18.150> fluval<00:00:18.539> spec<00:00:18.779> too<00:00:18.960> but

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
obviously than this fluval spec too but

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.790 
obviously than this fluval spec too but
otherwise<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:19.890> basically<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.250> same<00:00:20.490> tank

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
otherwise it's basically the same tank

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.779 
otherwise it's basically the same tank
the<00:00:22.800> dimensions<00:00:23.220> are<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.550> course<00:00:23.760> bigger<00:00:25.789> it's

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
the dimensions are of course bigger it's

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.930 
the dimensions are of course bigger it's
about<00:00:27.109> 11<00:00:28.109> inches<00:00:28.199> high<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:31.520> the<00:00:32.520> part<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
about 11 inches high and the part of the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.830 
about 11 inches high and the part of the
tank<00:00:33.180> where<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.450> fish<00:00:33.690> reside<00:00:34.370> is<00:00:35.540> eight<00:00:36.540> by

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
tank where the fish reside is eight by

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.389 
tank where the fish reside is eight by
eight<00:00:36.870> square<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.800> then<00:00:38.489> diagonally<00:00:40.070> it's<00:00:41.070> 11

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
eight square and then diagonally it's 11

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.810 
eight square and then diagonally it's 11
inches<00:00:41.700> across<00:00:43.340> which<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.489> pretty<00:00:44.640> good

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
inches across which is a pretty good

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.060 
inches across which is a pretty good
size<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.270> then<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.660> filtration<00:00:46.469> system<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
size and then a filtration system is the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
size and then a filtration system is the
same<00:00:47.250> as<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.489> other<00:00:47.640> fluval<00:00:48.149> spec<00:00:48.420> tanks<00:00:50.090> has

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.780 
compartment pump goes on the other side
of<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> compartment<00:01:02.989> here's<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.049> pump<00:01:04.790> which

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
of the compartment here's the pump which

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.510 
of the compartment here's the pump which
has<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.380> switch<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.530> side<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:08.040> control<00:01:08.400> the

has a switch on the side to control the
power<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:10.020> pump<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.790> into<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> beta<00:01:12.090> you

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
power of the pump and into the beta you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.390 
power of the pump and into the beta you
should<00:01:12.390> definitely<00:01:12.540> set<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.040> as<00:01:14.040> low<00:01:14.280> as

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
should definitely set it as low as

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.190 
should definitely set it as low as
possible<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:15.000> then<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.570> flow<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.810> still

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
possible and then if the flow is still

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.980 
possible and then if the flow is still
too<00:01:16.350> strong<00:01:16.790> I've<00:01:17.790> heard<00:01:17.970> people<00:01:19.490> just<00:01:20.490> take<00:01:20.820> a

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
too strong I've heard people just take a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.109 
too strong I've heard people just take a
little<00:01:21.990> piece<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.590> filter<00:01:22.860> block<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
little piece of the filter block of the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.899 
little piece of the filter block of the
foam<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:25.400> kind<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.460> stuff<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.880> there

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
foam and just kind of stuff it in there

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.240 
foam and just kind of stuff it in there
or<00:01:27.299> some<00:01:27.509> other<00:01:27.630> piece<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.680> filter<00:01:28.860> foam<00:01:29.100> that

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
or some other piece of filter foam that

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.609 
or some other piece of filter foam that
you<00:01:29.369> might<00:01:29.520> have<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:32.100> light<00:01:32.310> is

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
you might have and the light is

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.590 
you might have and the light is
different<00:01:34.619> than<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> fluval<00:01:35.130> spec<00:01:35.400> to

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.910 

you<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.470> slide<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.830> into<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.460> spec<00:01:41.759> slot

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:54.340 

then<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.310> knob<00:01:48.290> tightens<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:51.020> there<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.259> I

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
then this knob tightens it there it is I

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.350 
then this knob tightens it there it is I
did<00:01:55.350> plug<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.680> light<00:01:55.830> in<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.360> pretty

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
did plug the light in and it is pretty

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
did plug the light in and it is pretty
bright<00:01:57.659> there's<00:01:58.290> 31<00:01:58.560> LEDs<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.159> it<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:04.200> lid

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
bright there's 31 LEDs on it the lid

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.270 
bright there's 31 LEDs on it the lid
fits<00:02:04.590> pretty<00:02:04.830> well<00:02:06.799> for<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.860> little<00:02:08.009> we're

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
fits pretty well for a little we're

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.250 
fits pretty well for a little we're
going<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:11.610> then<00:02:11.880> there's<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.330> adapter<00:02:13.110> for

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
going and then there's the adapter for

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.970 
going and then there's the adapter for
the<00:02:13.319> light<00:02:16.580> I'm<00:02:18.230> going<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.319> be<00:02:19.410> switching<00:02:19.800> my

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
the light I'm going to be switching my

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.620 
the light I'm going to be switching my
beta<00:02:20.250> into<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:20.700> tank<00:02:20.940> from<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.330> current

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
beta into this tank from this current

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.070 
beta into this tank from this current
tank<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.060> will<00:02:24.239> get<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.390> video<00:02:24.540> up<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:24.900> that

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
tank and I will get a video up of that

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.449 
tank and I will get a video up of that
hopefully<00:02:25.890> soon<00:02:26.130> um<00:02:27.590> also<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:28.890> tank<00:02:29.100> is<00:02:29.250> not

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
hopefully soon um also this tank is not

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.670 
hopefully soon um also this tank is not
in<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.940> store<00:02:30.180> yet<00:02:30.390> it's<00:02:31.260> not<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.440> I've<00:02:31.650> seen
