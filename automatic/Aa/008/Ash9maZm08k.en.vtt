00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
technology is super cool it rotates and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.550 
technology is super cool it rotates and
pulsates<00:00:27.180> at<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.570> same<00:00:27.750> time<00:00:28.019> they<00:00:28.289> call<00:00:28.529> it

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
dual motions so what happens is as it

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.350 
dual motions so what happens is as it
rotates<00:00:34.350> around<00:00:34.860> your<00:00:35.280> face<00:00:35.520> as<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.880> cleanse

it's actually cleansing by rotating and
then<00:00:39.629> wiping<00:00:40.170> away<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.739> oil<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.640> makeup<00:00:41.850> with

then wiping away the oil and makeup with
the<00:00:42.329> pulsations<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.350> also<00:00:43.530> has<00:00:43.770> two<00:00:44.070> settings

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340

when that's gentle cleansing and one

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.020 
when that's gentle cleansing and one
that<00:00:46.860> gives<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> deeper<00:00:47.550> cleanse<00:00:47.820> so

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
skin zone timer which i think is very

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.200 
skin zone timer which i think is very
smart<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.680> when<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.860> turn<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.670> cleanses

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
smart so when you turn it on it cleanses

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.200 
smart so when you turn it on it cleanses
you<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.479> lasts<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.110> minute<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:31.530> your<00:01:31.740> face

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
you it lasts for a minute on your face

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.350 
you it lasts for a minute on your face
and<00:01:33.210> every<00:01:33.570> 20<00:01:33.960> seconds<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.560> pauses<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.090> was

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
and every 20 seconds it pauses so it was

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.850 
and every 20 seconds it pauses so it was
a<00:01:36.390> slight<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.810> know<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.020> move<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.590> another

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
a slight you know to move on to another

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.010 
a slight you know to move on to another
zone<00:01:38.159> move<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.000> another<00:01:39.240> zone<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.900> can

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
zone move on to another zone and you can
