00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:04.690
 I'm from the Luc Nuclear Power Plant you were in 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.510
 Top their big earthquake 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.829
 It must be early but it is not all that 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:13.199
 Of the tiger 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.509
 Fireworks display 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.989
 Mobile phone from the prefecture 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:22.310
 And flooded lightning plans for rivers 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.649
 If you do high fat rate everyone will gather 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.449
 I am singing hard 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.789
 But 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.160
 A loud noise comes from the nuclear power plant and everyone is t 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.280
 The nuclear power plant may have been fiercely shut down 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.290
 I rushed and measured the entrance fee around the nuclear power plant 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.170
 Because I did not want so much 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.660
 I chose not military 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.750
 I understood 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.910
 But the site is still painful in the stomach 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.890
 Now I'm going to do something about it 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.590
 Go to the site of nuclear power 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.390
 I am Makimizu 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.430
 Nuclear distribution is different from drainage and real estate people 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.690
 The right foot is 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.050
 It's important 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.750
 I'm out of medicine 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.550
 Although there was also a dangerous time 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.810
 Anyway as I do not get well 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.120
 Doctor 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.420
 Good luck to you 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.420
 And many times if I'm out there minutes 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.040
 It will spread a little 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.520
 However, this smell disappears immediately and the people of the country realize the safety 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.810
 It is said that I can not do it 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.539
 Isn't it difficult to use numbers? 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.310
 I'm not worried but 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.310
 The smell of the city is because the technology group can be expected 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.940
 By the way, the old three mile island of America is also big 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.900
 I have had the same person 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.310
 Even then, there is no way out 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.479
 The name came out from time to time in Chernobyl 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.670
 That was really fine 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.259
 It's the same after having told that it was given a challenge 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.679
 In Japan, even the second-ranked boat that was running around 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.450
 The big incident like Chernobyl cher 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.080
 I don't think it happens 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.119
 In addition, Japan's nuclear power plant first 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.689
 Because I also put on a suit 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:12.600
 Even if the launch is coming out 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.659
 Then install until 10 days 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:15.719
 Something like that 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.129
 I guess it won't happen 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.179
 If you can offer to strangers more than yen 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:23.120
 I might think of it 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.419
 I'm really sorry but I will attend 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:29.419
 I had to go there and killed 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:32.329
 What I think is really great 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.579
 The nuclear power crane 2033 doctors who are now 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.919
 Near a nuclear power plant where molecules are likely to come out 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:40.849
 If you hold close to a full day 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.289
 Life will be dangerous 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.799
 I'm giving medicines in turn 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.939
 Though efficiency is bad when we change by turns 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:51.779
 For Mr. Photon's health 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:53.779
 I can not help you 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:56.269
 If you have Komatsu, it's okay not to start 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.489
 Because I think it is not 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.039
 But in fact 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:03.379
 Germany will not clean up the leaked things 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.459
 But I think it's happening with great momentum to help 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.309
 There was no money after 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:10.539
 Anyway 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:13.539
 The most important thing is to put in a cool tempura ward 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:16.389
 Let's finish it with Suzu-Oda 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.349
 Everyone is working hard 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:19.290
 Yup 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.879
 If you are news. 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.689
 Thirty numbers and autograph session 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:24.739
 If you can hear it somehow 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.000
 I think it's a prank mixed with Pak Seri 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:31.369
 And doing it 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:32.819
 For coverage of the nuclear power plant 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.219
 Seems to be grateful 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:36.779
 I will also explain the worst 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:37.599
 that is 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.999
 Leakage Challenge mode also because the molecule has help inside 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:44.440
 Those who still can not be on the agenda of Chernobyl cher 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.400
 There is no need to remove the military far away, but this person advanced 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.450
 It may disappear or 53 Kanaya may have some effect on vegetables 

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:55.979
 If I do not do my best from now on 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.549
 There are people in Fukushima who can not 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.869
 Will be 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:04.319
 That is what Mr. Hoshide are desperately working hard 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.119
 I think 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:09.239
 However, it is a match for about 2 days 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.479
 Get over there 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:15.489
 I will ride when the peaceful lives of the people of Fukushima come back 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:20.009
 That's what I've received from my man's energy up to now 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:23.559
 And I think it's something everyone can do 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.509
 All right 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:28.930
 With time, the same medium near the site 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:29.910
 Forever 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:30.570
 Use
