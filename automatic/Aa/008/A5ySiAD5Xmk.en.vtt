and<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:08.129> have<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.310> think<00:02:08.399> about<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.729> best

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
and you have to think about the best

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.490 
and you have to think about the best
case<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:09.270> worst<00:02:09.420> case<00:02:09.629> scenarios<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.289> what's

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
case in worst case scenarios so what's

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.680 
case in worst case scenarios so what's
the<00:02:10.739> worst<00:02:11.430> case<00:02:11.610> scenario

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
the worst case scenario

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.740 
the worst case scenario
if<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:13.080> eat<00:02:13.230> too<00:02:13.380> many<00:02:13.470> carbohydrates<00:02:13.710> well

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
if you eat too many carbohydrates well

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.230 
if you eat too many carbohydrates well
what<00:02:15.750> happens<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.920> start<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.340> add<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:17.910> lot

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
what happens is you start to add a lot

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.590 
what happens is you start to add a lot
of<00:02:18.270> fat<00:02:18.510> on<00:02:18.590> your<00:02:19.590> body

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
of fat on your body

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.090 
of fat on your body
can't<00:02:21.600> transport<00:02:22.260> nutrients<00:02:22.830> into<00:02:23.010> the

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
can't transport nutrients into the

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.100 
can't transport nutrients into the
muscle<00:02:23.490> cells<00:02:23.700> anymore<00:02:24.060> because<00:02:24.210> you

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
muscle cells anymore because you

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.620 
muscle cells anymore because you
decrease<00:02:25.560> your<00:02:25.590> insulin<00:02:26.100> sensitivity<00:02:26.520> so<00:02:27.120> it

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
decrease your insulin sensitivity so it

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.830 
decrease your insulin sensitivity so it
continues<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:29.240> transport<00:02:30.240> nutrients<00:02:30.660> into

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
continues to transport nutrients into

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.140 
continues to transport nutrients into
the<00:02:30.930> fat<00:02:31.080> cells<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:34.040> from<00:02:35.040> there<00:02:35.250> your<00:02:35.610> level

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
the fat cells and from there your level

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.630 
the fat cells and from there your level
of<00:02:36.270> inflammation<00:02:37.130> increases<00:02:38.130> your<00:02:38.310> total

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
of inflammation increases your total

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.400 
of inflammation increases your total
body<00:02:38.730> chronic<00:02:39.210> inflammation<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.140> leads

body chronic inflammation and that leads

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.640 
body chronic inflammation and that leads
to<00:02:40.700> various<00:02:41.700> health<00:02:41.940> issues<00:02:42.330> like<00:02:42.650> decreased

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.560

that on the other hand if you start with

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.680 
that on the other hand if you start with
really<00:03:09.780> low<00:03:10.200> carbohydrates<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.520> you<00:03:12.510> lose

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
really low carbohydrates and you lose

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.630 
really low carbohydrates and you lose
some<00:03:12.870> muscle<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.410> lose<00:03:13.620> some<00:03:13.860> weight<00:03:14.070> you

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
some muscle you lose some weight you

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.729 
some muscle you lose some weight you
don't<00:03:14.940> feel<00:03:15.360> good<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:16.470> can<00:03:16.880> gradually<00:03:17.880> add

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
don't feel good you can gradually add

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.880 
don't feel good you can gradually add
carbohydrates<00:03:19.739> back<00:03:19.950> in<00:03:20.250> on<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:21.560> really<00:03:22.560> slow

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
carbohydrates back in on a really slow

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.090 
carbohydrates back in on a really slow
gradual<00:03:23.700> basis<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:25.050> see<00:03:25.290> what<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:25.980> most

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
gradual basis to see what the most

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.340 
gradual basis to see what the most
amount<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.520> carbohydrates<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.360> can<00:03:27.870> have

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
amount of carbohydrates you can have

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.890 
amount of carbohydrates you can have
while<00:03:28.830> still<00:03:29.280> building<00:03:29.730> muscle<00:03:30.300> efficiently

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
while still building muscle efficiently

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.000 
while still building muscle efficiently
and<00:03:31.550> burning<00:03:32.550> fat<00:03:32.730> at<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:32.970> same<00:03:33.030> time<00:03:34.010> right

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
and burning fat at the same time right

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.270 
and burning fat at the same time right
so<00:03:35.670> there's<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:35.910> benefit<00:03:36.450> in<00:03:36.770> starting<00:03:37.770> low<00:03:37.950> and

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
so there's a benefit in starting low and

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.130 
so there's a benefit in starting low and
then<00:03:38.489> gradually<00:03:39.330> building<00:03:39.840> up<00:03:40.020> and<00:03:41.989> for<00:03:42.989> some

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
then gradually building up and for some

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.330 
then gradually building up and for some
reason<00:03:43.380> people<00:03:43.530> just<00:03:43.800> don't<00:03:43.890> see<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.220> logic

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
reason people just don't see the logic

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.570 
reason people just don't see the logic
of<00:03:44.640> that<00:03:44.700> they<00:03:45.300> say<00:03:45.570> okay<00:03:46.250> you<00:03:47.250> know<00:03:47.370> I'm

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
of that they say okay you know I'm

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.600 
of that they say okay you know I'm
bulking<00:03:47.850> now<00:03:48.209> I'm<00:03:48.600> gonna<00:03:48.840> add<00:03:49.050> in<00:03:49.290> 300<00:03:50.190> 400

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
bulking now I'm gonna add in 300 400

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.949 
bulking now I'm gonna add in 300 400
grams<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:50.910> carbohydrates<00:03:51.390> and<00:03:51.510> I'm<00:03:51.630> gonna<00:03:51.720> eat

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
grams of carbohydrates and I'm gonna eat

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.890 
grams of carbohydrates and I'm gonna eat
until<00:03:52.140> I<00:03:52.260> get<00:03:52.470> fucking<00:03:52.860> fat<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.459> then<00:03:54.150> when<00:03:54.870> I

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
until I get fucking fat and then when I

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.400 
until I get fucking fat and then when I
feel<00:03:55.140> like<00:03:55.380> such<00:03:56.010> shit<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:57.000> my<00:03:57.300> energy<00:03:57.780> is<00:03:57.930> so

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
feel like such shit and my energy is so

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.699 
feel like such shit and my energy is so
fuckin<00:03:58.890> bad<00:03:59.130> that<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.269> don't<00:04:00.750> want<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:01.290> fuckin

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
fuckin bad that I don't want to fuckin

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.410 
fuckin bad that I don't want to fuckin
do<00:04:01.950> this<00:04:02.190> anymore<00:04:02.459> then<00:04:03.030> I'm<00:04:03.090> gonna<00:04:03.209> decide

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
do this anymore then I'm gonna decide

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.170 
do this anymore then I'm gonna decide
you<00:04:03.660> know<00:04:03.780> what<00:04:03.930> it's<00:04:04.290> time<00:04:04.500> for<00:04:04.530> a<00:04:04.739> cut<00:04:05.180> when

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
you know what it's time for a cut when

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.090 
you know what it's time for a cut when
the<00:04:06.300> reality<00:04:06.690> is<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:07.320> can<00:04:07.470> do<00:04:07.590> both<00:04:07.769> at<00:04:07.980> the

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
the reality is you can do both at the

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.979 
the reality is you can do both at the
same<00:04:08.310> time<00:04:08.340> if<00:04:09.239> you<00:04:09.420> just<00:04:09.600> use<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:09.840> little

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
same time if you just use a little

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.890 
same time if you just use a little
fucking<00:04:10.380> common<00:04:10.739> sense<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.420> you<00:04:12.420> start<00:04:12.690> low

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
fucking common sense and you start low

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.780 
fucking common sense and you start low
and<00:04:13.200> then<00:04:13.590> gradually<00:04:14.070> bring<00:04:14.220> yourself<00:04:14.550> higher

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
and then gradually bring yourself higher

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.370 
and then gradually bring yourself higher
and<00:04:15.269> then<00:04:15.750> when<00:04:15.840> you<00:04:15.900> get<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.049> little<00:04:16.290> bit
