streaks alternate mode or jet mode is
well<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:07.049> jet<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.560> it<00:00:07.649> looks<00:00:07.799> more<00:00:07.950> like<00:00:08.160> a

in<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:14.040> mode<00:00:14.250> he<00:00:14.519> does<00:00:14.790> have<00:00:15.179> an<00:00:15.360> attack<00:00:15.660> mode

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
in this mode he does have an attack mode

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.220 
in this mode he does have an attack mode
where<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:17.070> pull<00:00:17.340> back<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.420> will<00:00:18.600> open<00:00:19.080> up

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
where you pull back this it will open up

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.679 
where you pull back this it will open up
the<00:00:19.650> or<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.160> push<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.490> forward<00:00:20.760> I'm<00:00:20.850> sorry<00:00:21.090> you

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
the or you push it forward I'm sorry you

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.269 
the or you push it forward I'm sorry you
push<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.050> forward<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.740> will<00:00:22.769> open<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
push it forward and it will open the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.870 
push it forward and it will open the
fuselage<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.060> fire<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.630> two<00:00:24.750> missiles<00:00:25.880> and

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
fuselage and fire the two missiles and

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.439 
fuselage and fire the two missiles and
actually<00:00:27.240> that's<00:00:27.480> pretty<00:00:27.750> cool<00:00:28.070> so<00:00:29.269> in<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
actually that's pretty cool so in the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.040 
actually that's pretty cool so in the
vehicle<00:00:30.779> mode

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
vehicle mode

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.229 
vehicle mode
I<00:00:31.080> actually<00:00:31.380> really<00:00:31.830> dig<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.700> vehicle<00:00:33.090> mode

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
I actually really dig the vehicle mode

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.970 
I actually really dig the vehicle mode
there's<00:00:33.480> not<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> lot<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:33.989> robot<00:00:34.380> kibble<00:00:34.770> but

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
there's not a lot of robot kibble but

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.830 
there's not a lot of robot kibble but
you'll<00:00:35.219> see<00:00:35.430> why<00:00:35.579> in<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.790> second<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.360> it's<00:00:36.780> a

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
you'll see why in a second and it's a

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.530 
you'll see why in a second and it's a
very<00:00:37.110> nice<00:00:37.410> plane<00:00:38.340> mode<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.820> think<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.510> a

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
very nice plane mode I think this is a

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.389 
very nice plane mode I think this is a
better<00:00:39.840> plane<00:00:40.290> mode<00:00:40.559> than<00:00:40.860> some<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.280> other

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
better plane mode than some of the other

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.360 
better plane mode than some of the other
Beast<00:00:41.670> Machines<00:00:41.879> planes<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:42.719> got<00:00:43.370> but

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
Beast Machines planes that we got but

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.100 
Beast Machines planes that we got but
that's<00:00:44.550> just<00:00:44.700> my<00:00:44.879> opinion<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.719> reason<00:00:45.840> is

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
that's just my opinion the reason is

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.990 
that's just my opinion the reason is
it's<00:00:46.289> more<00:00:46.530> cohesive<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.700> think<00:00:47.879> it

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
it's more cohesive and I just think it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.750 
it's more cohesive and I just think it
looks<00:00:48.149> better<00:00:48.360> plus<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.320> little<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:49.739> ha<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
looks better plus the little like ha the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.430 
looks better plus the little like ha the
little<00:00:51.120> zentradi<00:00:52.969> zentradi<00:00:53.969> powerup<00:00:55.070> laser

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
little zentradi zentradi powerup laser

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.349 
little zentradi zentradi powerup laser
motif<00:00:58.440> there<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:59.010> really<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.090> let's<00:01:00.239> go

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
motif there I really like so let's go

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.840 
motif there I really like so let's go
ahead<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.600> get<00:01:00.690> them<00:01:00.780> transformed<00:01:01.699> start<00:01:02.699> by

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
ahead and get them transformed start by

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.660 
ahead and get them transformed start by
just<00:01:03.090> folding<00:01:03.570> out<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.840> legs<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:08.400> to

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
just folding out the legs and I like to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:17.450 
just folding out the legs and I like to
fold<00:01:09.540> these<00:01:09.869> wings<00:01:10.229> back<00:01:11.540> fold<00:01:12.540> them<00:01:12.750> out<00:01:16.460> and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
fold these wings back fold them out and

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.020 
fold these wings back fold them out and
then<00:01:18.090> come<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.420> here<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.930> just<00:01:19.729> pop<00:01:20.729> those

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
then come in here and just pop those

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.219 
then come in here and just pop those
apart<00:01:21.570> fold<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.740> out<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.310> down<00:01:24.080> fold<00:01:25.080> that

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
apart fold that out and down fold that

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.210 
apart fold that out and down fold that
around<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.920> down<00:01:27.290> slide<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.470> head<00:01:28.619> up<00:01:31.220> and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
around and down slide the head up and

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.090 
around and down slide the head up and
we'll<00:01:32.460> put<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> missiles<00:01:33.000> back

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
we'll put the missiles back

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.230 
we'll put the missiles back
unfortunately<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.220> figure<00:01:35.520> as<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.909> can<00:01:36.060> see

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
unfortunately this figure as you can see

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.929 
unfortunately this figure as you can see
does<00:01:36.509> suffer<00:01:36.840> from<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.320> no<00:01:37.619> real<00:01:37.920> hand<00:01:38.340> syndrome

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
does suffer from a no real hand syndrome

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.840 
does suffer from a no real hand syndrome
which<00:01:39.600> was<00:01:39.840> prevalent<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.860> beast<00:01:41.189> wars<00:01:41.490> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
which was prevalent in beast wars and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.819 
which was prevalent in beast wars and
summer<00:01:42.420> respect<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.079> beast<00:01:43.259> machines<00:01:43.470> with

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
summer respect and beast machines with

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.950 
summer respect and beast machines with
some<00:01:44.040> figures<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:45.090> really<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.600> unfortunate

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
some figures that really is unfortunate

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.530 
some figures that really is unfortunate
because<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.619> figure<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.100> quite<00:01:47.460> nice<00:01:47.850> other

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
because this figure is quite nice other

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.469 
because this figure is quite nice other
than<00:01:48.810> having<00:01:48.990> these<00:01:49.229> giant<00:01:50.030> hands<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.210> arms

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
than having these giant hands and arms

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.690 
than having these giant hands and arms
the<00:01:52.170> rest<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.560> figure<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.979> very<00:01:53.009> nicely

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
the rest of the figure is very nicely

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.760 
the rest of the figure is very nicely
proportioned<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.840> would<00:01:55.259> have<00:01:55.350> loved<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.649> have

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
proportioned I would have loved to have

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.840 
proportioned I would have loved to have
seen<00:01:55.829> an<00:01:56.250> actual<00:01:56.520> maybe<00:01:57.149> arm<00:01:57.509> as<00:01:58.049> opposed<00:01:58.469> to

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
seen an actual maybe arm as opposed to

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.840 
seen an actual maybe arm as opposed to
guns<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.329> uh<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.950> claw<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.340> grabby

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
guns and uh and the claw of grabby

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.719 
guns and uh and the claw of grabby
thingy<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.740> could<00:02:04.740> see<00:02:04.920> why<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.130> figure<00:02:05.549> was

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
thingy I could see why this figure was

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.770 
thingy I could see why this figure was
not<00:02:05.759> used<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.899> show<00:02:07.229> at<00:02:07.649> all<00:02:08.450> he<00:02:09.450> does<00:02:09.599> have

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
not used in the show at all he does have

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.930 
not used in the show at all he does have
a<00:02:09.810> pretty<00:02:10.050> cool<00:02:10.319> head

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
a pretty cool head

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.940 
a pretty cool head
it's<00:02:11.940> very<00:02:12.120> shark<00:02:12.750> like<00:02:13.170> head<00:02:13.440> and

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
it's very shark like head and

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.460 
it's very shark like head and
very<00:02:14.220> Jeff<00:02:14.580> like<00:02:15.000> which<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.870> appropriate

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
very Jeff like which is appropriate

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.960 
very Jeff like which is appropriate
considering<00:02:16.860> who<00:02:17.099> he<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.550> he<00:02:17.610> has<00:02:17.760> some

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
considering who he is and he has some

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.360 
considering who he is and he has some
decent<00:02:18.120> light-piping<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.800> actually<00:02:20.010> do

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
decent light-piping and I actually do

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.500 
decent light-piping and I actually do
like<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:20.730> figure<00:02:21.050> but<00:02:22.050> I<00:02:22.380> have<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.190> say<00:02:23.510> the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
like this figure but I have to say the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.870 
like this figure but I have to say the
fact<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:24.930> he<00:02:25.050> has<00:02:25.200> no<00:02:25.440> hands<00:02:26.130> whatsoever<00:02:26.670> is

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
fact that he has no hands whatsoever is

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.979 
fact that he has no hands whatsoever is
a<00:02:26.940> detriment<00:02:27.599> and<00:02:28.310> he<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.790> really<00:02:30.420> lacking<00:02:30.630> in

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
a detriment and he is really lacking in

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.690 
a detriment and he is really lacking in
poseability<00:02:31.530> these<00:02:32.100> bits<00:02:32.400> are<00:02:32.550> on<00:02:32.670> a

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
poseability these bits are on a

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.190 
poseability these bits are on a
ball-joint<00:02:33.000> but<00:02:33.450> there's<00:02:33.780> not<00:02:33.959> much<00:02:34.170> you

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
ball-joint but there's not much you

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.170 
ball-joint but there's not much you
could<00:02:34.470> do<00:02:34.620> about<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.670> only<00:02:35.880> thing<00:02:36.060> that

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
could do about it the only thing that

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.610 
could do about it the only thing that
you<00:02:36.330> could<00:02:36.450> really<00:02:36.630> do<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:36.989> pretend<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.470> this

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
you could really do is pretend that this

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.229 
you could really do is pretend that this
is<00:02:37.800> actually<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.220> gun<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.700> have<00:02:38.850> him<00:02:38.970> sitting

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
is actually a gun and have him sitting

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.030 
is actually a gun and have him sitting
here<00:02:39.420> going<00:02:39.569> like<00:02:39.810> yeah<00:02:42.590> anyway<00:02:43.590> uh

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
here going like yeah anyway uh

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.610 
here going like yeah anyway uh
I<00:02:44.700> do<00:02:44.880> like<00:02:45.209> this<00:02:45.330> figure<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.900> if<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.290> can<00:02:46.440> get

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
I do like this figure and if you can get

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.110 
I do like this figure and if you can get
a<00:02:46.650> hold<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:47.010> him<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.250> will<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.580> for<00:02:47.819> a<00:02:47.850> few

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
a hold of him I will it for a few

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.570 
a hold of him I will it for a few
dollars<00:02:48.239> he's<00:02:48.660> worth<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.080> but<00:02:49.709> I<00:02:49.980> wouldn't<00:02:50.370> go

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
dollars he's worth it but I wouldn't go

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.030 
dollars he's worth it but I wouldn't go
seeking<00:02:51.120> him<00:02:51.269> out<00:02:51.420> he's<00:02:51.720> not<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.350> great<00:02:52.680> and

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
seeking him out he's not that great and

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.410 
seeking him out he's not that great and
if<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.310> have<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.459> problem<00:02:53.850> with<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.090> no<00:02:54.209> real

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
if you have a problem with the no real

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.539 
if you have a problem with the no real
hand<00:02:54.660> syndrome<00:02:54.959> you're<00:02:55.650> not<00:02:55.890> really<00:02:56.160> going<00:02:56.400> to

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
hand syndrome you're not really going to

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.449 
hand syndrome you're not really going to
like<00:02:56.730> this<00:02:56.970> figure<00:02:57.180> but<00:02:58.019> I<00:02:58.290> kind<00:02:59.069> of<00:02:59.160> dig<00:02:59.310> him

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
like this figure but I kind of dig him

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.090 
like this figure but I kind of dig him
but<00:03:00.299> at<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.480> same<00:03:00.660> point<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:01.110> really<00:03:01.799> wish<00:03:01.980> he

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
but at the same point I really wish he

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.880 
but at the same point I really wish he
had<00:03:02.280> some<00:03:02.489> hands
