00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:07.479
 that looks to see what tranquility that 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.250
 we have on the mac desk what 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:11.260
 beautiful 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.299
 if you want to know how to put this 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.690
 animated wallpaper stay a while 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.690
 with me 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.920
 hello very good to all and welcome to the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.270
 youtube channel and healthy captive I am 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.390
 be that you can find me on twitter 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.670
 by navas 10 and on facebook by aysén a 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.530
 code and how are you seeing in my 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.860
 desk of the sea ​​the truth is that it is 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.630
 a complete beauty is spectacular 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.670
 be quietly listening to this 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.860
 sound so good and also be watching 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.630
 these waves so relaxing when I 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.100
 I put to work with the sea 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.140
 the truth is that apart from this topic 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.510
 we have many others I will recommend 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.030
 an application to put wallpapers 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.580
 animated on your mac the application will 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.140
 call my living from stop is a 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.600
 application that is available on the mac 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.390
 app store that has a price of about 18 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.330
 euros approximately but that is worth every 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.030
 cent of euro that costs the truth is 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.440
 which is very reassuring we are going to do 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.759
 a little bit revised let's go here 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.890
 up because up here we have the 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.660
 icon where are we going to configure all the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.220
 animated wallpapers this is the incognito 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.020
 let's get out of here and let's see 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.729
 a little bit what options do we have with the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.800
 first option let's say it sounds 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.380
 the sound of the sea that you have heard 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.479
 beginning of the video because nothing you are going to 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.290
 can remove and put with this option 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.300
 here 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.520
 option here we are going to disable the 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.530
 agreeable wallpaper and it would look 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.230
 the wallpaper that we had in 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.700
 the mac normally not from here this 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.630
 it's pretty good to record videos to 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.980
 me at least it will go very well 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.770
 because from here I will be able to hide 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.470
 all the icons that I have in the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.200
 desk so you can see this background 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.910
 animated so beautiful from here be sham 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.080
 settings we will be able to configure the 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.460
 scenes and we will be able to configure 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.110
 also the application let's go 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.640
 first here so it 's a little bit all 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.050
 what we have by default when 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.780
 we install the application they come all 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.700
 these issues of agreement we can take the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.410
 that we want the truth is that 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.670
 it's a real wonder we're going to 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.320
 change the subject to change the subject 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.270
 we have to make a double tap 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.770
 we make a double tap for example in this 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.740
 wallpaper and notice that automatically 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.420
 let's change it to note that it is also 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.670
 very beautiful is very relaxing there are others 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.680
 that really are very spectacular one 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.420
 I like it a lot although I do not know if it's 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.160
 relaxing or stressful 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.150
 the truth is that it is very beautiful this 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.829
 example, we can fix that we are going to change it 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.920
 is the truth is that this one I love is 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.510
 super nice we also have another effect 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.840
 that is also pretty good that is 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.150
 as well as fire as in flames not this 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.189
 for example if we are cold then nothing 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.780
 hey we put this in the background and it seems 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.950
 that is a bit psychological not but 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.510
 it seems that we are going to enter a little more 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.430
 in heat not the truth that is enough 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.329
 cool and you hear every wallpaper 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.099
 animated has a sound 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.989
 obviously relaxing okay but 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.640
 has a sound according to the image or 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.140
 the video that we are seeing we are not going to 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.060
 catch another the last one that I 'm going to 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.819
 teach to notice that this also 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.489
 love is a sunrise or sunset no 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.400
 I'm clear but the truth is very, very 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.349
 nice we have several cities options 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.819
 in this tab also not from here 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.650
 doing a double is going to take the 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.700
 scene that we want not here 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.769
 we have when we select a 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.269
 incognito we can make a preview voucher 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.099
 to watch the video or from here 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.599
 we have three and with milestones do not notice that 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.939
 with the first one here we are going to put it 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.500
 in a way so that periodically they go 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:26.930
 jumping the intros is as if 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.760
 we chose the ones in the shots above 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.859
 the ones we like the most and every 30 minutes 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.919
 every 10 minutes each when we 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.930
 let's say you are going to change the wallpaper from 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.849
 here is something similar from here 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.730
 change the script will see the 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.469
 screensaver of agreement is also 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.269
 pretty good and here we are going to do a 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:46.609
 relax mode we will be able to choose all 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.439
 those temps that are super relaxing 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.180
 and we are going to be able to put it that also 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:52.340
 periodically rotating is not very 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.950
 similar to the first option but good 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.170
 At least that's how we have two modes for 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.959
 can customize and have two modes 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.389
 different if we like to have several 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.950
 custom wallpaper not good we go 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:06.049
 to go to the adjustments because from here 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.609
 we are going to configure the whole application 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.200
 from here we will configure not by 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.609
 defect with this option we will do 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.280
 that the animated wallpaper looks at 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.480
 perfection but will consume cpu because 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.680
 you will be constantly working 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.660
 well, as if we are reproducing a 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.009
 video in the end do not notice that from here 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.530
 let's make it look a little worse 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:23.090
 the video the wallpaper but that the cpu not 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.949
 be punished whether you are not 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.810
 working so much I do not have it on 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.949
 I already look pretty good here 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.810
 good here to notice that we can the 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.949
 iconic change it I have it put like this 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.080
 which is how you have seen but we can 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:35.330
 put it to hide that you do not see either 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.320
 so that it appears here with this tone of 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.360
 colour 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.460
 I have here those that are 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.340
 automatically download the scenes 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.139
 the blows but animated 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.430
 actions if you do not download the 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.440
 I have also had the wallpaper 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.970
 second time I installed it fix that 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.410
 here we have a download option 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.780
 missing scènes and from here we go to 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.790
 download all the wallpapers here we have 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.100
 the first way where we are going to be able 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.600
 configure that what we do 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.370
 we have selected with the first and with 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.080
 milestone that I have told you before we will be able to 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.400
 tell him that every 30 minutes for example 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.020
 then go rotating between the different 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.360
 scenes not me this I'm going to leave it fixed 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.100
 here we can configure the screen to know 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.100
 notice that we can modify the brightness 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.750
 of the activated wallpaper and here we have the 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.280
 another way with we will also be able to 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.810
 serenity mode where we are also going to 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.790
 to be able to tell him to rotate 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.500
 periodically at a certain time and 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.210
 so this is not quite good for 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.320
 do a schedule at night 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.790
 maybe we want to be a little bit more 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.530
 calm we put something relaxing by the 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.750
 day we want to activate we can put 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.669
 well something a little that activates us 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.889
 a little more I 'm not to your liking 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.660
 but these are the options that the 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.430
 application the truth is that it is a 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.990
 wonder has little more 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.610
 from here we're just going to go to 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.289
 the configuration and from here 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.260
 we are simply going to be able to change 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:46.300
 scene randomly among all the 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.100
 that you have to agree that this one 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.910
 It is also very nice with this option 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.670
 We are going to leave 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.950
 website to buy more world papers 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.570
 animated by default come 28 from 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.250
 agreement if you want to buy one more 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.590
 Nothing simply put you here 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.480
 You see what there is and you can buy the one 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.920
 you want this is the coolest thing about 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.870
 all because we can create a 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.030
 animated wallpaper we can make a video 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.290
 with the iphone to the mac and with this 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.420
 option we will be able to create our 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.460
 own animated wallpaper to fix you 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.200
 we give this to this option and we're going to 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.360
 choose the video we will catch to catch the 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.280
 video that Alberto did for the apolo 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.800
 friday for the intro of the friday no 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.690
 note that it is simply this we can 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.460
 tell where we want it to start and 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.470
 where we want it to end or how much 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.930
 we want it to last, these are not the 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.460
 options here we will put a name and here 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.830
 We put the author a description 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.750
 we would give to seif and we would keep watch 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.240
 that the intro that was made Alberto is 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.410
 spectacularly cool not good then 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.120
 nothing does not have much more the application 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.310
 simply from here we will be able to 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.560
 activate the sleep mode the serenity mode 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.080
 this I have told you before or remove the 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.310
 application is very simple but of 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.450
 true that if you want to relax or if 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.920
