on human health

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.820 
on human health
that's<00:01:23.850> vaccination<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.350> may<00:01:25.470> not<00:01:25.649> know

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
that's vaccination so you may not know

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.620 
that's vaccination so you may not know
this<00:01:26.040> but<00:01:26.310> vaccines<00:01:26.759> are<00:01:26.939> actually<00:01:27.240> not<00:01:27.420> big

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
this but vaccines are actually not big

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.240 
this but vaccines are actually not big
moneymakers<00:01:28.289> they're<00:01:28.439> not<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:28.799> cancer

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
moneymakers they're not like cancer

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.420 
moneymakers they're not like cancer
drugs<00:01:29.549> they<00:01:30.090> are<00:01:30.530> important<00:01:31.530> tools<00:01:32.039> for

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
drugs they are important tools for

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.300 
drugs they are important tools for
protecting<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.420> saving<00:01:33.810> lives<00:01:34.039> but<00:01:35.039> as<00:01:35.159> it

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
protecting and saving lives but as it

turns<00:01:35.520> out<00:01:35.789> many<00:01:36.240> companies<00:01:36.750> don't<00:01:37.170> want<00:01:37.259> to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
turns out many companies don't want to

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.340 
turns out many companies don't want to
invest<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:37.950> vaccinology<00:01:38.820> simply<00:01:39.630> because<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
invest in vaccinology simply because the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.320 
invest in vaccinology simply because the
returns<00:01:40.740> are<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.220> not<00:01:41.549> big<00:01:41.759> enough<00:01:41.789> a<00:01:42.149> few

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
returns are just not big enough a few

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.779 
returns are just not big enough a few
years<00:01:42.539> ago<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:43.049> discovered<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.369> way<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.640> making

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
years ago I discovered a way of making

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.809 
years ago I discovered a way of making

polysaccharide vaccines only Gerald was

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:49.730 
polysaccharide vaccines only Gerald was
capable<00:01:48.330> of<00:01:48.630> really<00:01:48.929> seeing<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.350> potential

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740

of this methodology any investment has

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.430 
of this methodology any investment has
