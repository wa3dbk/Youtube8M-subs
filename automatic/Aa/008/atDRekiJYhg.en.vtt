00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.289 
just over top of it like that and that
pretty<00:02:11.830> much<00:02:11.920> does<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.370> here<00:02:12.760> I'll<00:02:12.880> see<00:02:13.090> if<00:02:13.209> I

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
so I guess um it's kind of bit of a

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.060 
so I guess um it's kind of bit of a
little<00:03:43.440> pain<00:03:43.740> but<00:03:44.370> there<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.120> go
