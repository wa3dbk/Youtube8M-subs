00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
any dramatic results so far that's

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.629 
any dramatic results so far that's
because<00:04:40.259> I<00:04:40.349> haven't<00:04:40.380> been<00:04:40.650> working<00:04:40.770> out<00:04:41.250> like

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
because I haven't been working out like

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.249 
because I haven't been working out like
I<00:04:41.789> should<00:04:42.060> so<00:04:42.810> um<00:04:43.400> I'm<00:04:44.810> going<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:45.930> figure<00:04:46.169> out

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
I should so um I'm going to figure out

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.649 
I should so um I'm going to figure out
ways<00:04:46.380> to<00:04:46.440> help<00:04:46.860> me<00:04:47.009> get<00:04:47.580> motivated<00:04:48.030> for<00:04:48.479> that

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:48.659 
ways to help me get motivated for that

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:51.170 
ways to help me get motivated for that
and<00:04:48.900> then<00:04:49.440> hopefully<00:04:49.800> I'll<00:04:50.669> start<00:04:50.970> seeing

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
and then hopefully I'll start seeing

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.779 
and then hopefully I'll start seeing
some<00:04:51.419> more<00:04:51.570> results<00:04:51.930> but<00:04:52.199> no<00:04:53.099> once<00:04:53.430> up<00:04:53.610> at<00:04:53.729> a

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
some more results but no once up at a

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:55.460 
some more results but no once up at a
time<00:04:53.970> and<00:04:54.210> I<00:04:54.300> think<00:04:54.509> that<00:04:54.659> I'm<00:04:54.750> not<00:04:54.930> doing<00:04:55.199> that

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
time and I think that I'm not doing that

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.409 
time and I think that I'm not doing that
bad<00:04:56.419> once<00:04:57.419> again<00:04:57.690> thanks<00:04:58.199> guys
