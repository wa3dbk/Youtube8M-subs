00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
for $35 EG one was 36 I think so 35 and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.830 
for $35 EG one was 36 I think so 35 and
36<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.210> cost<00:00:33.420> me<00:00:33.540> about<00:00:33.860> $73<00:00:34.860> all<00:00:35.070> up<00:00:35.840> but

there they're all snails so I'm not sure
what<00:02:02.009> type<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.549> snails<00:02:03.000> they<00:02:03.240> are<00:02:03.420> but<00:02:03.810> I'm

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
what type of snails they are but I'm

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.670 
what type of snails they are but I'm
hoping<00:02:04.770> they<00:02:05.040> don't<00:02:05.100> actually<00:02:05.399> eat<00:02:05.820> my<00:02:05.969> plants

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
hoping they don't actually eat my plants

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.660 
hoping they don't actually eat my plants
because<00:02:07.680> they're<00:02:07.920> also<00:02:08.039> detect<00:02:08.489> purpose

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
because they're also detect purpose

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.900 
because they're also detect purpose
my<00:02:10.030> tank<00:02:10.680> and<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:11.740> think<00:02:11.890> I<00:02:11.950> got<00:02:12.099> them<00:02:12.220> with<00:02:12.430> the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
my tank and I think I got them with the

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.710 
my tank and I think I got them with the
lace<00:02:13.090> phone<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:14.560> i<00:02:14.590> bought<00:02:15.720> actually

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
lace phone that i bought actually

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.089 
lace phone that i bought actually
couldn't<00:02:16.900> be<00:02:16.959> in<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.140> neck<00:02:17.260> in<00:02:17.410> Doris<00:02:17.739> because

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
couldn't be in the neck in Doris because

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.760 
couldn't be in the neck in Doris because
got<00:02:18.880> that<00:02:19.030> from<00:02:19.180> someone<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.870> yeah<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.560> think

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
got that from someone and yeah I think

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:21.990 
got that from someone and yeah I think
oh<00:02:20.920> but<00:02:21.130> they<00:02:21.250> must<00:02:21.430> have<00:02:21.520> come<00:02:21.700> with<00:02:21.849> that

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
oh but they must have come with that

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.839 
oh but they must have come with that
even<00:02:22.239> though<00:02:22.360> i<00:02:22.390> rinsed<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:24.400> yeah<00:02:24.580> it's<00:02:24.790> a

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
even though i rinsed it so yeah it's a

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.309 
even though i rinsed it so yeah it's a
bit<00:02:24.970> of<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.150> bummer<00:02:25.420> but<00:02:25.750> what<00:02:25.930> can<00:02:26.050> you<00:02:26.140> do

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
bit of a bummer but what can you do

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.290 
bit of a bummer but what can you do
there<00:02:26.860> snails<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.459> they<00:02:27.580> pretty<00:02:27.760> much<00:02:27.850> legs

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
there snails and they pretty much legs

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.960 
there snails and they pretty much legs
everywhere<00:02:28.600> so<00:02:28.989> it's<00:02:29.890> almost<00:02:30.010> impossible<00:02:30.310> to

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
everywhere so it's almost impossible to

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.559 
everywhere so it's almost impossible to
prevent<00:02:31.510> them<00:02:31.810> but<00:02:32.340> yeah<00:02:33.340> anyway<00:02:33.760> takes

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
prevent them but yeah anyway takes

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.410 
prevent them but yeah anyway takes
looking<00:02:34.840> pretty<00:02:35.050> good<00:02:35.760> air<00:02:36.760> bubbles<00:02:37.150> on<00:02:37.269> that

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
looking pretty good air bubbles on that

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.870 
looking pretty good air bubbles on that
vinyl<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:38.019> kind<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.260> annoying<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.739> huge<00:02:39.190> dot

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
vinyl I kind of annoying that huge dot

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.110 
vinyl I kind of annoying that huge dot
right<00:02:40.090> there<00:02:40.120> where<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.630> gap<00:02:41.470> is<00:02:42.120> someone

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
right there where the gap is someone

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.449 
right there where the gap is someone
have<00:02:43.209> to<00:02:43.390> redo<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:44.050> eventually<00:02:44.560> but<00:02:45.400> I

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
have to redo that eventually but I

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.789 
have to redo that eventually but I
