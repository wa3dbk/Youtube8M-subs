after<00:00:35.010> metal<00:00:35.430> gear<00:00:35.550> solid<00:00:35.760> four<00:00:36.210> what<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:36.960> found

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
after metal gear solid four what I found

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.780 
after metal gear solid four what I found
there's<00:00:37.559> not<00:00:37.680> even<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.950> mention<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.430> solid

snake<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.300> game<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.750> yeah<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.469> all

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680

snake in the game so yeah this is all
right<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.280> think<00:00:41.520> he's<00:00:41.640> never<00:00:41.850> been<00:00:42.090> better

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
right and I think he's never been better

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.779 
right and I think he's never been better
he<00:00:43.020> was<00:00:43.230> cool<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.800> tragic<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.370> stuff<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
he was cool and tragic and stuff and

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.790 
he was cool and tragic and stuff and
four<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.360> he<00:00:45.420> really<00:00:45.629> shines<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:46.410> he's<00:00:46.770> a

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
four but he really shines here he's a

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.529 
four but he really shines here he's a
fully<00:00:47.160> developed<00:00:47.399> character<00:00:48.030> who<00:00:48.120> can<00:00:48.270> act<00:00:48.420> in

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
fully developed character who can act in

both<00:00:48.690> hilarious<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.410> serious<00:00:49.980> ways<00:00:50.219> now<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
both hilarious and serious ways now to

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.910 
both hilarious and serious ways now to
say<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.239> least<00:00:51.390> he's<00:00:51.840> really<00:00:52.410> improved<00:00:52.559> from

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920

how<00:00:53.070> he<00:00:53.129> was<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.430> Metal<00:00:53.760> Gear<00:00:53.789> Solid<00:00:54.030> 2<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.690> fact

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
how he was in Metal Gear Solid 2 in fact

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.569 
how he was in Metal Gear Solid 2 in fact
I<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.320> all<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.800> characters<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.460> game

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
I like all the characters in this game

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.670 
I like all the characters in this game
but<00:00:57.000> sadly<00:00:57.510> most<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.930> them<00:00:58.050> don't<00:00:58.230> get<00:00:58.469> much

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
but sadly most of them don't get much

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.799 
but sadly most of them don't get much
screen<00:00:59.010> time<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.579> some<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.149> fight<00:01:00.510> just

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
screen time and some you fight just

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.869 
screen time and some you fight just
after<00:01:01.199> meeting<00:01:01.559> them<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:02.250> being<00:01:02.579> said<00:01:02.820> I

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
after meeting them that being said I

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.280 
after meeting them that being said I
think<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.270> best<00:01:03.449> new<00:01:03.629> character<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.170> this

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
think the best new character in this

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.170 
think the best new character in this
game<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> senator<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.430> saying<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:06.000> more

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
game is the senator and saying a more

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.640 
game is the senator and saying a more
would<00:01:06.299> be<00:01:06.330> spoiling<00:01:06.930> things<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.350> are<00:01:07.439> not

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
would be spoiling things that are not

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.770 
would be spoiling things that are not
with<00:01:07.950> spoiling<00:01:08.490> as<00:01:08.610> he<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.880> very<00:01:09.270> involved

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
with spoiling as he is very involved

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.230 
with spoiling as he is very involved
with<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.960> game's<00:01:10.140> awesome<00:01:10.380> ending<00:01:11.240> seriously

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
with the game's awesome ending seriously

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.850 
with the game's awesome ending seriously
