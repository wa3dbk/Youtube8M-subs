00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
of age so we're doing right up to the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.090 
of age so we're doing right up to the
age<00:02:00.330> of<00:02:00.360> about<00:02:00.570> 23<00:02:01.229> or<00:02:01.350> 23

age<00:02:05.009> groups<00:02:05.340> are<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.610> rit<00:02:05.790> i'd<00:02:06.270> like<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.479> think

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
age groups are the rit i'd like to think

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.289 
age groups are the rit i'd like to think
that<00:02:06.930> we<00:02:07.290> would<00:02:07.470> have<00:02:07.530> four<00:02:08.130> or<00:02:08.280> five<00:02:08.459> boys<00:02:08.850> who

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.299 
that we would have four or five boys who
