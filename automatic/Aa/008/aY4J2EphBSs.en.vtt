00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hi to all youtube friends then 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.700
 perfect from sacred vestments this new one 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:12.179
 video today I am here to tell you about a 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:15.269
 really fantastic bunch since when 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.240
 he had left but thanks to some papers 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.400
 who have been announced is not well known 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.800
 when they come out, maybe you know but me 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.750
 I don't know so forgive really can 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.119
 become a decent deck an act 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.309
 really loud eg grow 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.430
 really new really big guys 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.920
 from the title what could the mickey think 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.300
 mag guys there was talking about 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.190
 blood will go like this with a bunch that 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.110
 poor thing does nothing but I have to say 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.690
 that these supports in my opinion yes 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.610
 they can play 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.399
 let's start with these cards I found 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.160
 on denis network because I didn't like it 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.710
 as much to do the research as it is a bit 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.410
 hard to find and I found these 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.260
 three cards or cg for now only on di 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.170
 yesterday the network so for me we can 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.920
 talk about these then then we have 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.659
 a unique fusion is a magic fusion 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.939
 indeed we are talking about descent which is the thing 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:18.869
 bigger than all the cyber dragons 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:24.180
 infinite in practice a 2100 rank 6 2100 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:26.400
 rank 6 defense 1600 then what is there 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.070
 to say this monster's costumes this 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.860
 monster can use as show 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.509
 material xyz the good cyber nova then 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.970
 it helps us to lower it much more easily 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.930
 the branch boiled by way of gay bregoli 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.640
 dry then this paper the dry in 200 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.869
 attachment points for every material he has 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.399
 under it then already exalt every effect 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.920
 and always stronger by three this is the 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.990
 first the second is that once for 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.659
 turn with choose yes a monster in 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.880
 attack we control and attack 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.229
 just below as a patria lipsis monster 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.869
 that is, this way in practice can appear 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:06.119
 I don't know how long they run but the third guys 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.170
 and that makes the quasar there once for 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.069
 shift when during any 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.260
 turn when an effect or inactive ie 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.349
 the activation of something can detach 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.200
 a material to deny and destroy 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:23.340
 so a monster and boys 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.340
 crazy crazy 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.930
 it's crazy this monster then we have the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.050
 rapper rules that can be done with 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.459
 two monsters is a food level fusion 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.130
 which can be done with two or more 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.420
 show cyber dragon this 2 o'clock thing 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.370
 more yield thanks also to the fact that 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.290
 however we have more monsters than on 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.690
 cemetery ground are considered 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.160
 so cyber brava can be there 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.290
 helpful but for what 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:03:00.160
 because in practice when I read call 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.720
 we can target areas a number equal to 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.569
 number of monsters we used 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.390
 to make the merger ferry those 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.880
 speed trap and then destroy them guys 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.310
 in a sense we can do the 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.890
 storm to our opponent who's 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.340
 these times these days is not that 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.799
 false great because network sets a 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.579
 fuck some annoying trap though 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:27.700
 we can remove it or sticazzi 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:32.410
 we can crack cyber networks 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:36.609
 small companies and just 2100 then we can 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:39.100
 also send up to two light monsters 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.440
 mac machine to the cemetery to make him 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.790
 earn an additional even strike 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.160
 to the number of cards we sent 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.040
 then from there to send for pulis 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.959
 example the cores that can be 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.180
 removed you uncovered make us a 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.560
 range that from the madonna to evoke i 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.950
 cyber lakes then start over at 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.260
 beat hard and then give you targets to 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.209
 cemetery because then they go up a card 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.549
 magic melting the magic card the third 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.430
 paper I told you in practice there 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:09.549
 allows you to conjure up your own fusion 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:13.660
 from our extra mac banning monsters 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:15.160
 from the hand or from the ground or even together with the 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.080
 cemetery we can also use 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.250
 therefore it shows the cemetery doubly 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.810
 useful because 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.510
 however we form cemetery grates 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.580
 the effect of rampage or with 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.010
 as the game progresses we can create 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.140
 the most diverse mergers and we can 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.130
 recover lost party by pulling 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.810
 there are as big as a house 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.150
 how have you seen these three guys up 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.730
 these three supports are perfect 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.090
 tuning with the deck we also remember 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:46.840
 the infiniti jx is being a 2100 that of 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:49.240
 base found 23 is not much like 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.780
 attack but what comes to our aid there 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.400
 the fact that we can come to help 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.030
 use the cyber networks that we 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.090
 we would have already set up thanks to the 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.580
 our departures with cores to remove the 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.490
 drake and take us that will help us how 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.230
 subsequently to protect a cyber 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.910
 good at destruction is the battle 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.830
 which have effects then what 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.110
 happens we can arms in black holes 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.080
 from my jackies leaving the rapper 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:20.169
 so don't waste material 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.000
 obviously it will be we say useful for 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.450
 the player and know how to play at the moment 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.490
 quite right 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:28.960
 the paper to take out the infinite but 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.450
 at the same time of the defined players 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:36.720
 will have to be good at exploiting his 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:40.780
 effects because obviously it is not simple 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.400
 knowing how to say I let you pass this but 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.610
 I leave you and I won't let you pass 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.280
 this one who played six will know 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.740
 certainly what I'm talking about 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.979
 they usually try to get him out 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.860
 the infinite when they have at least two 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:59.350
 cards that can get you off ours 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:04.990
 or they have a strategy like that 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:07.090
 strong that you to prevent tv smashing 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.370
 land in the fog and then drive you out 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:13.150
 in gap with these guys in a certain 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:15.580
 sense is not that I make big 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.440
 against detaching, however, it does do for a 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.020
 opponent with appropriate precautions 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:25.060
 knows how to wander around it knows from impellers 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.380
 but it can make you save time for 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.650
 they tried to k 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.750
 next and it really is a real thing 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.390
 great thing yes I like these already 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:38.650
 create me two years for and with the dragon 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:41.500
 gaia really can be resentful 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:44.470
 this deck maybe us if only 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:47.110
 keep it free libya hidden who knows 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:50.170
 never the konami that makes you a 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:53.170
 gift and bring you a card of 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:56.410
 cards that really can make you of 

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:58.210
 logo let out this deck you see 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.840
 what do you think of these below 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.090
 supports 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.890
 leave a nice thumb I can 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.620
 to be honest I am satisfied with me 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:07.270
 like them and tell me a google what they do 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.700
 think through the 8 thousand teachers 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:12.960
 instinctive and commented beautiful writing 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.960
 row from vichy for 36
