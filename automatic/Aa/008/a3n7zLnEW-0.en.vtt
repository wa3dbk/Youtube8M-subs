00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.280
 and 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:19.880
 and how about he went to his lord happy rodeo 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:22.820
 in this new photoshop tutorial 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.230
 and we are going to learn how to make an image 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.230
 animated gif 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.600
 good 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:35.310
 let's 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:39.240
 make 1 file or let's see an image 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:43.250
 let's put a luxe width to 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:47.680
 any size 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.680
 use a square document 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.780
 800 x 800 of the solution provided that 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.530
 give for play when transparent 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.530
 good 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.619
 what we are going to do for example we are going to 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.009
 make a brief example of an image of 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.009
 animal 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.630
 people this in black 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.960
 now let's duplicate the layer by 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.960
 example 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:28.380
 four or five times every five times 45 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:30.719
 and let's paint never 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.570
 this layer we are going to paint it another color 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.570
 since this is going to be this is going 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.270
 to make it or the image animates oria 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.469
 the color 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.469
 now let's put 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.920
 this 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.070
 now let's put 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.810
 a green 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.369
 here 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.369
 and finally let's put 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.700
 a gray 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.420
 well we have these five colors and what 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:19.010
 what we are going to do is to pass this 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.959
 black to this gray but it's not going to be not going 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.790
 to pass quickly but it will happen 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:29.319
 in the middle the red 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:32.709
 the blue almost celestial and the green 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:36.819
 good to encourage it will be the menu 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:41.560
 window and let's put what it says 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:45.220
 animation but to create this box 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:50.680
 and we are going to create 3 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:54.370
 frame you could say train or 55 say 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.190
 5 layers frames in the first 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.450
 frame we are going to 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.210
 let's make the background 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:09.340
 black let's select the second 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:11.490
 for white the black the white the 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.490
 Red 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:20.760
 although red now we select the 3 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:25.300
 and we put the celestial one 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:28.970
 4 green and 5 gray 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:32.790
 as if we see this play button 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.520
 I'm going to do the animation 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.680
 all right 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.320
 is the number of times that has been 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.480
 repeat what I put configure here can 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.000
 be infinite three times once or 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.510
 we can put another one we can put a 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.460
 number that we want for example 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.010
 Let it be six times to repeat six 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:57.049
 times and that approaching repeat 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.049
 that is, 12 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:07.460
 4 5 and 6 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:10.740
 and well he left us infinite so that 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.980
 repeat on farms sometimes 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:16.180
 and good finally we are going to learn to 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.209
 save it 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.680
 although the file and if we can save 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:25.620
 how to save will not work 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:29.460
 then let's put save for web 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:35.600
 and devices or we can use the shortcut 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.600
 alt + maius more control more s but good 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.810
 well I 'm not going to paste this box 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.710
 now let's put hits in suppose 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.710
 save 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:53.689
 good to paste this box and here we go to 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.569
 put the name 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:58.929
 here the name and with the point extension 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:58.929
 biz 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.800
 or put save 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.890
 an agreement that will close us 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.890
 automatically 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.360
 good finally what we are going to do is 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:23.800
 see the result of our video 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:27.790
 animated good let's double click that we 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.890
 will open the windows gallery 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:34.870
 which is the pre-finished actions on 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:36.449
 all the images but this does not not not 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:42.499
 will see 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:42.499
 because it does not encourage animation 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.110
 let's see 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.510
 but it does not make the animation 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:06:00.880
 now if there are symptoms because because the 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:04.840
 holguin in windows 7 windows 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.730
 of view in the 8 this happens but in 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.390
 windows xp can be opened normally 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:13.020
 with double purpose 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:15.300
 now to be able to open it we are going to 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:19.069
 drag it 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.069
 to our browser 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.970
 let's see the field we have the beer 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.639
 in this trunk 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.990
 okay 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:44.879
 I do not know why it gets stuck but in mind 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.879
 because the heat is blindness 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.500
 you take the good one I do not know I'm recording 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:59.500
 but I'm good 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:09.110
 well without recording well here I wanted to show 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:11.840
 some examples of guides that can do 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.780
