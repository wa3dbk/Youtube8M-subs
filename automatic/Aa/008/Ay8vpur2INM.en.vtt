00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
that as quick as you possibly can so it

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.560 
that as quick as you possibly can so it
should<00:01:01.859> look<00:01:01.890> something<00:01:02.190> like<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.609> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
should look something like that and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.390 
should look something like that and
what's<00:01:03.840> gonna<00:01:03.960> happen<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.769> do<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.129> fast

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
what's gonna happen is if you do it fast

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.760 
what's gonna happen is if you do it fast
enough<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:06.330> gonna<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.020> kill<00:01:07.260> cam<00:01:07.500> it

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
enough it's gonna in the kill cam it

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.670 
enough it's gonna in the kill cam it
won't<00:01:08.100> show<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.729> actual<00:01:09.420> EXO<00:01:09.840> shield<00:01:10.110> pop<00:01:10.409> out

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
won't show the actual EXO shield pop out

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.890 
won't show the actual EXO shield pop out
it's<00:01:11.189> just<00:01:11.400> gonna<00:01:11.520> show<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.119> normal<00:01:12.450> shield

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
it's just gonna show the normal shield

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.080 
it's just gonna show the normal shield
pretty<00:01:13.170> much<00:01:13.320> morph<00:01:13.710> into<00:01:14.310> your<00:01:14.430> EXO<00:01:14.820> shield

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
pretty much morph into your EXO shield

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.359 
pretty much morph into your EXO shield
if<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.390> makes<00:01:15.600> sense<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:17.100> thing<00:01:17.250> is

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
if that makes sense but the thing is

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.800 
if that makes sense but the thing is
you've<00:01:17.490> got<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.700> do<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.880> really<00:01:18.119> faster<00:01:18.659> to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
you've got to do it really faster to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.109 
you've got to do it really faster to
work<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.979> timing<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.490> really<00:01:20.939> really

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
work and the timing is really really

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.120 
work and the timing is really really
weird<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.479> get<00:01:21.570> used<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.409> do<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.009> a

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
weird to get used to do it I do have a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.710 
weird to get used to do it I do have a
couple<00:01:23.280> decent<00:01:23.490> example<00:01:23.729> shops<00:01:24.210> obviously

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
couple decent example shops obviously
