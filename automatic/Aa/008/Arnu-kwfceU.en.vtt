come<00:00:16.619> out<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:16.859> one<00:00:16.980> piece<00:00:17.010> if<00:00:17.340> he<00:00:17.430> hit<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.670> car

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.950 

luckily<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> Formula<00:00:23.970> One<00:00:24.090> car<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.480> not<00:00:24.720> as

you<00:00:29.490> know<00:00:29.689> robust<00:00:30.830> in<00:00:31.830> all<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.309> components

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
you know robust in all the components

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.720 
you know robust in all the components
but<00:00:33.239> mainly<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.079> chassis<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.739> chassis<00:00:35.309> is

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
but mainly on the chassis the chassis is

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.830 
but mainly on the chassis the chassis is
our<00:00:36.920> survival<00:00:37.920> cell<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.300> structure

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
our survival cell so is the structure

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.020 
our survival cell so is the structure
that<00:00:39.989> protects<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.710> driver<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.790> main

that protects the driver the main
component<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.320> monocoque<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:44.850> monocoque

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
component is the monocoque the monocoque

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.590

made and composed together you can think

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.650 
made and composed together you can think
about<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:58.309> monocoque<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.149> survivor

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
about the monocoque so the survivor

invention<00:01:27.119> about<00:01:27.900> 30<00:01:28.170> years<00:01:28.439> ago<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.770> still

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
invention about 30 years ago it still

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.800 
invention about 30 years ago it still
used<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.430> aluminium<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.450> was<00:01:30.600> really

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
used to be aluminium and that was really

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.899 
used to be aluminium and that was really
very<00:01:31.170> very<00:01:31.320> dangerous<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.009> nowadays<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
very very dangerous and nowadays the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.640 
very very dangerous and nowadays the
monocoque<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.420> really<00:01:33.659> my<00:01:34.200> little<00:01:34.320> safety

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
monocoque is really my little safety

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.069 
monocoque is really my little safety
cell<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.189> know<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.549> really<00:01:35.990> helps<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> lot

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
cell you know and it really helps a lot

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.290 
cell you know and it really helps a lot
to<00:01:37.380> prevent<00:01:37.560> injuries

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
to prevent injuries

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.060 
to prevent injuries
the<00:01:39.630> great<00:01:39.840> thing<00:01:40.080> about<00:01:40.110> from<00:01:40.500> one<00:01:40.650> today<00:01:40.890> is

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
the great thing about from one today is

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.920 
the great thing about from one today is
that<00:01:41.250> technology<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.180> advanced<00:01:42.660> and<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
that technology is so advanced and the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.200 
that technology is so advanced and the
safety<00:01:43.290> has<00:01:44.010> been<00:01:44.160> worked<00:01:44.400> on<00:01:44.580> so<00:01:44.790> much<00:01:44.940> that

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
safety has been worked on so much that

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.550 
safety has been worked on so much that
we<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.720> get<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.020> cars<00:01:46.230> and<00:01:46.320> feel

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
we can get in the cars and feel

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.590 
we can get in the cars and feel
completely<00:01:46.860> safe<00:01:47.100> there's<00:01:47.520> lots<00:01:47.730> of<00:01:47.850> drivers

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
completely safe there's lots of drivers

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.730 
completely safe there's lots of drivers
that<00:01:48.780> have<00:01:48.900> crashed<00:01:49.170> over<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> years

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
that have crashed over the years

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.470 
that have crashed over the years
particular<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.580> the<00:01:50.670> last<00:01:50.820> couple<00:01:50.970> years<00:01:51.120> some

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
particular in the last couple years some

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.600 
particular in the last couple years some
big<00:01:51.930> crashes<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.560> they've<00:01:53.100> got<00:01:53.340> up<00:01:53.460> and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
big crashes and they've got up and

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.650 
big crashes and they've got up and
walked<00:01:53.700> away<00:01:53.910> and<00:01:54.240> including<00:01:54.870> myself<00:01:55.370> of

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
walked away and including myself of

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.200 
walked away and including myself of
course<00:01:57.660> all<00:01:58.110> these<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.440> safety<00:01:59.190> development<00:02:00.030> a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
course all these a safety development a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.660 
course all these a safety development a
safety<00:02:00.690> job<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.229> not<00:02:01.410> done<00:02:01.470> only<00:02:01.770> Formula<00:02:02.460> one

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
safety job is not done only Formula one

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.200 
safety job is not done only Formula one
is<00:02:03.030> very<00:02:03.330> important<00:02:03.960> also<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:04.740> road<00:02:05.010> cars<00:02:05.369> or

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
is very important also on road cars or

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.290 
is very important also on road cars or
car<00:02:06.690> so<00:02:06.900> we<00:02:07.170> can<00:02:07.320> speak<00:02:07.590> about<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:08.369> survival

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300
