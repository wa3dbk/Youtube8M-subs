two more and some other dungeons I think

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.920 
two more and some other dungeons I think
in<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> main<00:01:28.860> dungeons<00:01:29.570> they<00:01:30.570> would<00:01:30.750> most

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
in the main dungeons they would most

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.960 
in the main dungeons they would most
likely<00:01:31.229> be<00:01:31.590> one<00:01:31.799> where<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.579> would<00:01:32.729> have<00:01:32.880> to

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
likely be one where you would have to

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.550 
likely be one where you would have to
unlock<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> main<00:01:33.840> dungeons<00:01:34.259> where<00:01:34.439> you

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
unlock like the main dungeons where you

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.140 
unlock like the main dungeons where you
unlock<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.509> door<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.960> claws<00:01:37.939> so<00:01:38.939> yeah

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
unlock the door with the claws so yeah

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.539 
unlock the door with the claws so yeah
that's<00:01:39.509> all<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.750> know<00:01:39.869> for<00:01:40.140> now<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.470> will<00:01:41.430> keep
