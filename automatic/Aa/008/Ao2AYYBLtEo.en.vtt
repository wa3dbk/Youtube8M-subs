00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
gonna have a 4.3 inch 800 by 480 display

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.459 
gonna have a 4.3 inch 800 by 480 display
which<00:01:01.969> is<00:01:02.120> not<00:01:02.269> the<00:01:02.449> best<00:01:02.480> on<00:01:02.899> the<00:01:02.989> market<00:01:03.319> that

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
which is not the best on the market that

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.030 
which is not the best on the market that
comes<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:04.190> translates<00:01:04.670> to<00:01:04.820> a<00:01:04.850> PPI<00:01:05.210> of<00:01:05.420> around

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
comes the translates to a PPI of around

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.920 
comes the translates to a PPI of around
217<00:01:07.040> which<00:01:07.580> is<00:01:07.730> like<00:01:08.090> I<00:01:08.180> said<00:01:08.360> not<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.750> best

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
217 which is like I said not the best

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.240 
217 which is like I said not the best
display<00:01:09.290> on<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.470> market<00:01:09.799> it's<00:01:09.950> a<00:01:10.040> very

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
display on the market it's a very

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.880 
display on the market it's a very
mid-range<00:01:10.970> display<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:12.470> type<00:01:12.619> of<00:01:12.649> display

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
mid-range display the type of display

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.429 
mid-range display the type of display
you'll<00:01:13.159> see<00:01:13.310> on<00:01:13.399> a<00:01:13.430> low<00:01:13.729> to<00:01:14.030> mid-range<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:15.020> mid

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
you'll see on a low to mid-range and mid

eight hundred million power battery is
very<00:01:22.640> good<00:01:23.119> for<00:01:23.479> a<00:01:23.509> display<00:01:23.869> of<00:01:24.110> this<00:01:24.369> caliber

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
very good for a display of this caliber

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.730 
very good for a display of this caliber
and<00:01:25.969> it's<00:01:26.750> not<00:01:26.869> gonna<00:01:27.020> look<00:01:27.170> it's<00:01:27.380> not<00:01:27.560> gonna

not the top of the line processor it's

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.539 
not the top of the line processor it's
more<00:01:42.289> low<00:01:42.710> to<00:01:42.770> mid-range

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
more low to mid-range

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.100 
more low to mid-range
it's<00:01:43.850> actually<00:01:44.149> leaning<00:01:44.390> towards<00:01:44.960> the
