unit in my hand is the O's onyx unit
that<00:00:16.480> everybody<00:00:17.020> is<00:00:17.230> talking<00:00:17.439> about<00:00:17.770> this

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
that everybody is talking about this

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.909 
that everybody is talking about this
unit<00:00:19.060> is<00:00:19.180> very<00:00:19.630> effective<00:00:20.290> in<00:00:20.529> eliminating

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919 
unit is very effective in eliminating

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.839 
unit is very effective in eliminating
human<00:00:21.610> order<00:00:22.329> how<00:00:23.140> it<00:00:23.349> does<00:00:23.560> it<00:00:23.770> is<00:00:24.040> actually

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
human order how it does it is actually

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.210 
human order how it does it is actually
taking<00:00:25.270> Oh<00:00:25.390> -<00:00:25.509> which<00:00:26.200> is<00:00:26.380> oxygen<00:00:27.099> and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
taking Oh - which is oxygen and

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.280 
taking Oh - which is oxygen and
splitting<00:00:28.029> it<00:00:28.149> with<00:00:28.300> an<00:00:28.540> electrical<00:00:29.020> current

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
splitting it with an electrical current

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.220 
splitting it with an electrical current
this<00:00:30.040> oh<00:00:30.220> 3<00:00:30.550> is<00:00:30.669> very<00:00:30.910> unstable<00:00:31.270> and<00:00:31.869> it<00:00:32.020> wants

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
this oh 3 is very unstable and it wants

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.250 
this oh 3 is very unstable and it wants
to<00:00:32.290> grab<00:00:32.710> everything<00:00:33.370> so<00:00:34.030> you<00:00:34.719> are<00:00:34.809> actually

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
to grab everything so you are actually

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.139 
to grab everything so you are actually
setting<00:00:35.530> this<00:00:35.739> unit<00:00:36.100> up<00:00:36.219> at<00:00:36.489> a<00:00:36.550> 45<00:00:37.120> degree

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
setting this unit up at a 45 degree

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.049 
setting this unit up at a 45 degree
angle<00:00:37.449> with<00:00:38.050> the<00:00:38.440> wind<00:00:38.710> so<00:00:39.250> that<00:00:39.429> as<00:00:39.670> the<00:00:39.850> wind

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
angle with the wind so that as the wind

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.209 
angle with the wind so that as the wind
blows<00:00:40.390> it<00:00:40.719> actually<00:00:41.019> blows<00:00:41.230> your<00:00:41.440> scent<00:00:41.739> into

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
blows it actually blows your scent into

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.369 
blows it actually blows your scent into
this<00:00:42.399> curtain<00:00:42.969> of<00:00:43.179> o3

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
this curtain of o3

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.459 
this curtain of o3
the<00:00:45.039> o3<00:00:45.670> is<00:00:45.699> actually<00:00:46.210> heavier<00:00:46.690> than<00:00:46.899> air<00:00:47.170> so

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
the o3 is actually heavier than air so

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.310 
the o3 is actually heavier than air so
it<00:00:47.620> actually<00:00:48.280> drops<00:00:48.699> creating<00:00:49.660> this<00:00:49.809> curtain

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
it actually drops creating this curtain

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.200 
it actually drops creating this curtain
so<00:00:50.710> you<00:00:50.769> want<00:00:51.039> to<00:00:51.129> make<00:00:51.249> sure<00:00:51.280> that<00:00:51.699> your<00:00:51.820> unit

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
so you want to make sure that your unit

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.709 
so you want to make sure that your unit
is<00:00:52.420> at<00:00:52.660> a<00:00:53.019> 45<00:00:53.140> degree<00:00:53.920> angle<00:00:54.070> so<00:00:54.670> that<00:00:55.329> it<00:00:55.570> can

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
is at a 45 degree angle so that it can

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.660 
is at a 45 degree angle so that it can
create<00:00:55.960> that<00:00:56.199> curtain<00:00:56.620> and<00:00:56.800> also<00:00:57.219> that<00:00:57.370> is<00:00:57.489> it

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
create that curtain and also that is it

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.059 
create that curtain and also that is it
is<00:00:57.850> going<00:00:58.059> with<00:00:58.510> the<00:00:58.749> wind<00:00:58.780> it<00:00:59.230> is<00:00:59.260> okay<00:00:59.710> to<00:01:00.039> put

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:00.069 
is going with the wind it is okay to put

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:03.059 
is going with the wind it is okay to put
the<00:01:00.339> unit<00:01:00.670> upside<00:01:01.179> down<00:01:01.510> if<00:01:01.929> the<00:01:02.530> fan<00:01:02.800> noise

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:03.069 
the unit upside down if the fan noise

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:05.880 
the unit upside down if the fan noise
bothers<00:01:03.460> you<00:01:03.909> normally<00:01:04.600> on<00:01:04.809> a<00:01:04.839> windy<00:01:05.379> day<00:01:05.409> or

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
if there's a little bit of wind let's

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.660 
if there's a little bit of wind let's
say<00:01:07.329> between<00:01:07.509> three<00:01:08.079> to<00:01:08.710> eight<00:01:08.860> miles<00:01:09.100> an<00:01:09.310> hour

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
say between three to eight miles an hour

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.090 
say between three to eight miles an hour
you<00:01:09.759> don't<00:01:10.000> normally<00:01:10.240> hear<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:10.840> fan<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.829> fan

by the way do not be concerned it is a

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.530 
by the way do not be concerned it is a
white<00:01:14.409> noise<00:01:14.710> so<00:01:15.189> the<00:01:15.610> animals<00:01:16.149> are<00:01:16.329> not

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
white noise so the animals are not

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.160 
white noise so the animals are not
alarmed<00:01:16.840> by<00:01:17.110> that<00:01:17.320> in<00:01:17.590> other<00:01:17.890> words<00:01:18.130> as<00:01:18.460> they

alarmed by that in other words as they

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.859 
alarmed by that in other words as they
get<00:01:20.170> closer<00:01:20.469> to<00:01:20.829> the<00:01:20.979> unit<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:21.700> pitch<00:01:22.570> of<00:01:22.780> the

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
get closer to the unit the pitch of the

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.840 
get closer to the unit the pitch of the
sound<00:01:23.140> actually<00:01:23.770> varies<00:01:24.100> accordingly<00:01:24.640> it's

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
sound actually varies accordingly it's

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.580 
sound actually varies accordingly it's
kind<00:01:25.060> of<00:01:25.090> like<00:01:25.240> hearing<00:01:25.689> traffic<00:01:26.320> in<00:01:26.500> a

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
kind of like hearing traffic in a

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.770 
kind of like hearing traffic in a
distance<00:01:27.070> as<00:01:27.219> you<00:01:27.430> walk<00:01:27.640> closer<00:01:28.000> to<00:01:28.329> it<00:01:28.450> it<00:01:28.630> is

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
distance as you walk closer to it it is

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.139 
distance as you walk closer to it it is
a<00:01:28.990> white<00:01:29.350> noise<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:30.520> not<00:01:30.729> something<00:01:31.060> that's

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
a white noise it's not something that's

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.450 
a white noise it's not something that's
gonna<00:01:31.360> startle<00:01:31.960> them<00:01:32.110> like<00:01:32.320> a<00:01:32.350> clang<00:01:33.219> or<00:01:33.430> a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
gonna startle them like a clang or a

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.179 
gonna startle them like a clang or a
bang<00:01:33.729> or<00:01:33.969> maybe<00:01:34.570> ticking<00:01:35.409> your<00:01:35.590> release<00:01:36.009> on
