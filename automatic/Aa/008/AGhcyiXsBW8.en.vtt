00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 very good guys the video today is going to 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.890
 be a short video you will see a 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.240
 application that is very fast it looks very 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.040
 fast but nevertheless it is a 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.660
 application that I believe should be 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.759
 be to the channel since it can be very 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.530
 efficient for many let's open the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.540
 phones with the passage of time are gone 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.400
 deteriorating and the application that we are going to 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.650
 show today in the video is going to 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.539
 allow to test the screen of 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.920
 our phone is to say if any 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.220
 part of our screen that is 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.369
 inactive there is some dead pixel so 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.369
 nothing 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.780
 good so let's start and see 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.340
 the application the link so gray 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.140
 below the description to download 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.090
 totally free and as commented to the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.160
 principle will be very very fast 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.050
 we simply access the application and 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.430
 We are going to give you a start test 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.540
 appear this kind of panel and 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.790
 what we have to do is 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.010
 touch all the points and this way the 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.390
 application will know if any part of the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.390
 screen that does not work correctly 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.760
 ah 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.020
 once and we have completed it we will 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.810
 leave here an image and once we 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.909
 come out we can slide down 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.799
 we must go doing this until they pass 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.729
 all the colors since you will want 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.729
 our screen 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.939
 and at the end you have not heard 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.710
 personified as a kind of sound is 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.509
 would indicate that on our phone is 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.520
 perfectly in this case because no 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.159
 they have no inactive zone and they do not 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.600
 they would have no dead pixel this is not 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.770
 a test that I recommend for example 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.600
 do every day nor all the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.729
 weeks or every month but like 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.740
 do it once every six months or a 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.570
 once a year on our phone yes that 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.700
 It would be advisable to know if 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.590
 our screen is in a good condition 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.420
 so nothing if you liked it you already know 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.830
 that you can leave us a like you can 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.570
 comment that you think this 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.560
 application and nothing guys remember that 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.690
