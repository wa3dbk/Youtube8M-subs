00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.239

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.170
 Beat all the ingredients very 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.960
 well then we are going to add a cup 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.640
 of carbonized mineral or gas water and 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.190
 we beat it super well until we 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.199
 stay like this and we 'll let it rest 10 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.969
 We are also little minutes two or three 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.430
 panko cups that is ground bread or 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.740
 flour for the Japanese style 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.260
 and the sliced onions and what are we going to 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.310
 do is we're going to dip into the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.900
 mixture 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.940
 this mix that already has to be more or 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.520
 less thick we are going to put the onions 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.440
 and then mixing in the bank or in the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.860
 ground bread and then in a small dish 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.860
 cleansed 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.940
 since we have all the rings of 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.700
 onion and now we're going to put 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.450
 fry in vegetable or olive oil the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.450
 that you prefer 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.369
 It is very important that stress 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.920
 checking and as soon as you see they are already 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.409
 almost all of you are going to flip 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.150
 both here and you're going to put them in a 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.400
 dish with a napkin so that it 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.510

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.910

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.760
 some french potatoes and sweet potatoes 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.580
 baked for this we need potatoes 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.170
 or sweet potato potatoes and what we're going to do 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.240
 is that we are going to peel it and then we go 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.030
 starting the sweet potato and the potatoes in 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.770
 Band-Aids or whatever you like me 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.250
 like strips and we will add 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.140
 olive oil rosemary leaves salt 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.080
 sea ​​and quite and it is already that the sweet potato 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.420
 It is very sweet and paprika or any other 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.250
 chile powder we close it and beat it 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.320
 super super good remember that the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.020
 measurements are not exact you go there 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.360
 calculating to your liking and in a little chat 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.870
 and let's put up ideality and 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.480
 we put our sweet potato potatoes more or 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.820
 less like that and the same thing we do for 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.400
 french fries or french fries 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.070
 let's put a little bag 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.380
 we add olive oil afterwards 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:53.440
 Little garlic to taste rosemary leaves 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.610
 also in salt and pepper ok all this 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.800
 it's some societies where you like a 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.110
 you add another one and so 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.450
 we beat super super well and put it in 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.580
 the same face horita and these potatoes are 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.130
 a little more healthy we are not going to 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.950
 fry this we're going to bake it and they're going to 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.340
 see that they are delicious we put 20 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.100
 minutes in 350 degrees 10 minutes first 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.680
 and then we turn them over and then others 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.300
 10 minutes remember that each oven is 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.340
 differently so you have to be 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.290
 checking that your chips are 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.060
 that should not be burned have to 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.930
 to be golden brown and toasted but not 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.730
 burned 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.620
 I decided to present it in a few glasses 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.450

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.820
