00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.879
 4 Let 's take a look at the checkpoints in Chapter 6 Profit and Loss Statement at this time. 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.680
 I'll do it 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:14.910
 In Chapter 5, we discuss the allocation of assets and the connection of the income statement. 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.199
 I told you. 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:23.730
 At this time, you should start with sales now for each item 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:27.900
 How many points do you need to check and how to get two points? 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:33.510
 I'll explain some of the things you can connect. 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:36.630
 The sales portion is now the first item that comes out in the income statement. 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.800
 So if the sales are the same, 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:45.210
 I do not have anything to analyze, but I can do this. 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.190
 Is a starting point for corporate value . 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.250
 You have to enter. 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.750
 What it says is that the sales of two said elements consist Are 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.600
 You can divide 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:01.320
 We have the price of the product and each and every product. 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.710
 Then it anneunya how to sell the quantity then, so we usually 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:09.719
 The price is called p Price. 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:14.399
 Quantity 4 q This is the very essence of the defendant and the pie faction. 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:19.409
 So, this sales is the thing that eventually raises the price 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:21.179
 The size of that revenue is going to start increasing the corporate value sales Size 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.950
 Otherwise, 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:29.850
 Even if the price is constant , we increase the quantity a lot. 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.619
 After selling 2 million units of 1 million units and then getting saturated in domestic market 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:39.409
 Whether it is possible to enter overseas markets or not, 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:44.399
 Of corporate value is crucial to judging whether the enterprise value can continue to grow. 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:48.389
 So it's basically spring. 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.159
 One can see a little divided into three types of degree I'm having a first 

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:53.729
 Well, 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.759
 If the cyclical fluctuations is zero now it is divided into two 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:02.299
 There are cases, such as zero fluctuations 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.299
 Depending on the game, the sales gangbang appears to be quite large. 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.560
 If you like the game 2 Gando enterprises in the interests of the big big big enough sales fluctuations 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.700
 The fluctuations are quite large. 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.080
 That did talk about fairly large bottle of minutes so the price fluctuation of the stock price 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.520
 A thing called 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:24.290
 Lift the boom as eoye What's ivory is moving approximately 30% Moisture 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:29.210
 When the stock price is low compared to 3 times 5 times , 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:33.830
 When you enter more colossal price in case the colossal peak of up to 50% or 80% 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:38.720
 So the whole range of fluctuations is quite significant 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:42.230
 It's quite difficult for the novice investors to start at the beginning 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.550
 This is a very cyclical companies but most investors are again a lot of money 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:52.070
 If you lose 2 if you are investing in companies of business fluctuations give me mainly 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:54.500
 These things, which worked in shipbuilding, chemistry or steel , 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:03:00.020
 It's one of the biggest companies 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:02.030
 In the case of companies with variable business models , 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.930
 When we split it, 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:12.459
 The price will become abnormal when the economy becomes hai and the price of recession 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.459
 The parts about falling and price fluctuations happen basically once 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:21.130
 In the quantitative part was that I now show three goals, why wrong with you 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.440
 Quantity itself has been blocked so much that it can continue to do so 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:28.750
 It is not a concept of form claims 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:32.950
 This quantity is also increased so too has the demand eoga true fact that soaring prices 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:36.160
 Because we have a lot more structure, we split it up as an enhancement type. 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:40.060
 Beat leaves are mainly generated in the supply and demand mismatch, so mwonyamyeon 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:44.620
 The industries that need large-scale facility investment are mainly concerned. 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:49.660
 As I mentioned earlier , it is not the same as Chosun, steel or chemistry. 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:53.920
 Companies are now in great demand, 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:58.150
 Even if you start the deed now, it will be 2 years and 3 years for the factory 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:02.680
 And now the sikineunde Ahn continued through the building pretty long period of commissioning 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:07.690
 In contrast, if the economy enters recession, 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.880
 Demand is not revealed, so the price plummeted and the price plummeted 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.630
 Part sales decrease 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:17.650
 But because you've invested a lot of equipment , you're going to get a lot of money . 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:23.890
 The cost is reflected all the way, and this structure is reversed. 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:26.680
 In addition, if the time comes a little later, 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:30.190
 The vendors are starting to close the door now. 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:34.360
 Or started to reduce the amount of grateful production. 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.340
 The world line starts with what is, or is withdrawn from the withdrawal of that company to start 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.510
 When it booms again 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:44.380
 This again, the number of companies increased and the money was secured again. 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:48.400
 There are these big fluctuations, so you're going to 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:52.870
 It's important to see where companies are of this type. 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:57.450
 Boneunya earlier sales by businesses spent a cyclical type snowballs when prices 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.450
 You need to approach it with a different concept .
