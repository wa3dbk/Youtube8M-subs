00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.250
 nine people i am the city ​​with two 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.980
 new video material today is about that 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.900
 bad company 2 weapons handling i have 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.010
 the game always appears and I will 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.840
 at the end still a reference to battlefield 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.039
 4 but we'll see you then 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.320
 should consider currently 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.910
 I warn you about weapons selection limited 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.490
 ask for a new account for it 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.109
 but I'm still all very good 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.519
 Reminder I had so 200 games 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.960
 hours in before a bit more 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.669
 So I can still some things 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.070
 I would like to remember and would like to do that now 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.219
 what are you talking about? 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.980
 I learned in bed company 2 is that 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.120
 they are really getting weapons there 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.950
 Feel incredibly different in the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.480
 Battlefield 3 takes place personally 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.280
 weapons that are very similar 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.989
 but here in bed came her second was 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.000
 everything always really difficult of one 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.340
 weapon to move to the next because they 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.410
 we have really big ones of the style 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.329
 built-in differences 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.430
 example storm rifles there are seven 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.410
 storm rifles and including four 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.090
 different damage model that's real 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.040
 that's what it looks like most of the time 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.049
 the higher the firing rate the lower 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.060
 Damage that means f2000 is the highest there 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.890
 fire wheel 850 euro 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.049
 minute really did not judge 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.270
 hurt the evening for 90 lowest 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.380
 firing rate with 601 reported makes it 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.240
 the highest damage here, for example 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.860
 20 simple principle 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.600
 and even though we have such a system 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.330
 which is why it is extremely damaging 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.040
 Fire rate is all that is pretty good 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.229
 valens among each other 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.270
 there are weapons that sting out that 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.000
 for example, 36 for example 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.320
 ultra-precise the saga 12 has melee 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.329
 just an extreme impact 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.850
 some say snipers are too 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.170
 strong so good some say community 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.899
 in the end, that's not right 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.630
 normal but otherwise altogether so 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.040
 Categories among each other are on a large scale 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.570
 and not all badly formed so 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.759
 I find, for example, the storm rifles 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.950
 You can really do any assault rifle there 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.930
 Take that is not necessarily normal 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.430
 sounds so violent nowadays 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.869
 Battlefield 3 for example, I would 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.399
 his say or the storm from there 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.750
 better and there are worse ones there say 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.259
 I, for example, I prefer the im 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.759
 In 1671 3971 come in bed the two are 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.049
 there are more great seven weapons to 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.590
 I have no plan which I 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.450
 should take 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.160
 they are all good and that was that 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.250
 special could not swim any 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.110
 take a weapon 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.450
 and could with the weapon just immediately 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.150
 well be good on bed for three 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.310
 also be good with her but in the world 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.740
 the 2 came no unfairness 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.630
 So there is not the thing weapon 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.010
 the ultra advantage now is clear 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.930
 which is better and better in this area 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.880
 this area gets better but it will 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.110
 possible so really unfair or feels 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.110
 Not really by a 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.090
 weapon is disadvantaged and that is very good 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.740
 what namely bed to get even 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.209
 The micro börsting is particularly powerful 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.610
 Michael basting is it so if 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.350
 I quite small bars macher never 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.030
 like battlefield 3 for example with the 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.110
 scan ten shots you have to cut out 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.130
 Take a break for a while 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.870
 bang out another ten 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.510
 that will not get far as two 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.860
 pretty much not at the end 4 3 itself 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.150
 Do you make this micro per stick 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.040
 actually not at all 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.950
 stop it before you do that distance 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.170
 maybe just with the choice 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.360
 the whole special effect had the micro 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.910
 börsting but in bed buy nothing knows 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.040
 it is almost a duty to kick back there 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.050
 is relatively high are also so 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.060
 bit random this time, so this time 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.410
 The weapon really strikes everywhere 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.520
 and you can really see that 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.870
 I have that often enough 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.549
 I 'm doing continuous fire the thing 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.630
 It is everywhere the weapon just by 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.340
 on the opponent something like that 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.890
 and so also were there succeeds 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.780
 this micro börsting that is as I said 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.840
 a cent is not really that 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.519
 only as 5er burst some fireburst oz 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.350
 is really just a single ball the 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.360
 you really shoot every ball 1 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.530
 and then the weapons arrive too 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.150
 otherwise it is really difficult 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.500
 Scatter or recoil makes you 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.299
 really a dash through the bill 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.459
 and above all, you do that too 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.310
 short distances like battlefield 3 do 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.989
 I just because no one say good at 10 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.690
 meter I do not need that over 20 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.070
 perhaps the two so come as you can 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.450
 your self at 20 meters can be continuous fire 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.299
 make nothing synonymous yes there would be 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.380
 really firing every single one and that 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.450
 a mechanic is this demanding 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.230
 I also find it motivating and very motivating 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.019
 so I find the michaela 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.329
 makes this michael basting very nice 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.970
 In any case, a lot of fun and can 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:13.329
 you like to see more often, why come 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.160
 I insist on it in battlefield 4 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.329
 possibility that we have something more in this 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.340
 direction again 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.959
 it will not be as blatant as in bed 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.190
 the two come the plaster that 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.840
 Guess now and me 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.010
 most likely appreciate it that way 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.880
 but the recoil of the weapon 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.840
 is already much higher so am16 the 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.820
 in battlefield 3 for example 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.320
 Conclusion have the gene battlefield 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.030
 many things come from the good 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.170
 already beat up and there you have to 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.250
 always take care a little bit how 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.390
 We either do that one says 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.730
 Dauerfeuer nothing was an idea for a coach 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.200
 below what does not work so well or 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.910
 I also do the micro börsting 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.020
 some try each the bowl 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.630
 to put exactly 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.240
 even at a high rate to a 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.010
 Statement from a dice employee 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.320
 slow firearms are at continuous fire 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.570
 more accurate and stable than weapons with 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.400
 same caliber and handset fire rate 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.430
 Of course you can understand that 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.750
 permanent fire has with still fully not rate 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.060
 more than for sense and what you have to 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.560
 Instead, just do the brushing 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.110
 thing is how hard you have to do that 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.580
 make rich 5s burst I doubt it 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.190
 but sometimes very strong, I think that will 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.720
 ultimately be so that these 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.790
 must publicly be quite small which one 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.300
 really needs to fire every single room 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.710
 which is a bit more demanding 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.210
 really a habituation but I have to 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.080
 say it's pretty fast so I have 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.270
 me back very quickly 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.590
 found the other and it is 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.830
 actually my eyes also very much 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.110
 motivating that has violent at 43 zb 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.820
 we really have all the weapons in part 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.070
 could brush very long and that 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.170
 Handling not so demanding for me 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.650
 how is the two in the bed come 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.170
 case is 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.030
 you have to remember that in the band fear 3 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.680
 the recoil is the more accurate 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.780
 appears and looks so years after 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.360
 right up world come two water 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.310
 More towards the edges 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.530
 and in bed we have the mix 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.410
 Both of us have the highest sap 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.840
 fighting and we have just the recoil 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.730
 that we can recognize so we have 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.830
 double-sided see the mix 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.060
 as it is otherwise 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.550
 I recommend you just once 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.140
 if you come to bed the two are 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.940
 you would always like to have fun with it 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.990
 bed come 2 games do not synonymous Yes 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.150
 but I find one from time to my round 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.750
 to play a bit to refresh 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.250
 fun too 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.690
 was that how much did it do now ? 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.100
 claim again and also kemal 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.780
 that two do not even have me 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.000
 once to try from time to time again 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.500
 maybe this mechanic too 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.390
 to get used to maybe in 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.090
 battlefield 4 could occur around one 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.350
 practicing a bit of energy is bad 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.700
 That's why I would recommend you 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.550
 Just come back to bed the two 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.190
 called out 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.480
 well of course I liked the video 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.860
 I will be happy with the reviews 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.860
 and yes you see three people
