00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:02.920
 we are accompanied d 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.790
 marisio 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.380
 yepes 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.089
 e in the chair that we normally use for 

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:10.499
 for these programs where it appears 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:14.609
 name the names of our accompanying guests we have put weights 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:16.269
 instead of putting you 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:17.939
 there was last name 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:19.380
 while the Poles 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.339
 if we have proposed the name of 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:23.250
 these posts 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.189
 how it is used analogously we have done well is to say because as is customary 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.230
 the team on board one of the factors for which we have put in a break 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.700
 I think it would be nonsense I will tell you so 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.170
 is that your name 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.250
 of Polish origin is your black ops 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.620
 our employees time but not everything is possible but not what we have wanted 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.870
 intentionally in this case 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.960
 with your husband's name as if it were your own name 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.940
 and now it seems to change 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.270
 you worry about annual cap 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.060
 corporation could be too caramelized 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.930
 in 2013 together for a film walk but you have managed to form 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.409
 a kind of family peace 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.540
 solution which all the sixth month and the ministers substituting the voice for 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:06.450
 instruments such civil 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.049
 by the way camus many cases of 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.049
 Christmas for example one of our great 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.690
 congratulations highlights together how you get it just happened besides you suffered 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.960
 acted in which apparently gives parents and children we have a 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.700
 only such different sectors education is as different as you get 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.310
 that the budget 3 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.450
 the armchair in some way in which a family tradition or follow the line of 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.500
 from his parents 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.240
 I do not know how it is known because these three children true that the instrument 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.910
 sustenance of your taste for music 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.900
 surely same vision they know 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.700
 maybe even better than me 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.030
 a cost that coexists more with the children when I am traveling and 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.570
 the jasmine bride you leave the deference of hierarchy cadaqués that the wedges have 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.870
 attended sacred art 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.370
 almost that to read and write 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.370
 as a consequence of this event efe 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.479
 this morning at home is a music constantly one of those beaches of 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.070
 come down with me 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.769
 but never lilly class suffered 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.739
 they learned suffered 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.720
 We played, played, did not play, it was a gym, it was a black and 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.019
 a white cries 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.859
 so 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:25.129
 I did them the least I do not say I tried but I thought a music method 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.839
 tell me method of where you studied for children 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:32.919
 that afterwards has been formed and that this method already exists 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:33.799
 I did not make it 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.189
 but that really 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:40.219
 It's not like those things that are invented twice in life 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:42.759
 He has created a method that he has insisted on 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:44.969
 i this means a result 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:47.969
 exceptional result at home we live 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:52.799
 min since he makes that long trip down with the tour of the United States 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.739
 Tineo are waiting for him to come back 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.669
 the days pass the calendar 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:58.889
 and preparing your arrival 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.880
 many of those three days of parades 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.880
 the port calendar the president valcárcel 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:05.690
 in each commune 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.320
 for some reason that tragedy lasted until one more day 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.129
 very much after learning to be very much 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.879
 pirates wait 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.919
 to return artist and give 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.079
 small to large companies efe 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.649
 to be with him 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:26.879
 created so fallacious that happiness is familiar is a gift received is 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:29.609
 it's a gift 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.609
 because any profile contact 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.469
 a guitar times the common woman 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:38.329
 so that his secret services contracts the guitar s 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.749
 one 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:41.489
 two 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.639
 what serves 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.429
 for the awakening 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:47.329
 you especially like the adjustment process 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.789
 at some point I love it so that whenever it is so attacked 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:52.799
 Is there anything new 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:53.969
 equal democracy
