00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.920

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.380
 I bring a very special video the news 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.490
 of the week if new dragon game 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.160
 ball z for this 2014 gave the news 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.470
 this week and today they have opened the 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.870
 official website of this game where 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.670
 will be giving more news at the moment 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.879
 has no name is simply called 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.160
 dragon ball new project yes you know 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.140
 which is likely to come out this 2014 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.690
 probably by the end of the year but not 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.340
 they know nothing else they have left the orient 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.720
 for a scan 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.880
 with a few pictures of the game and how 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.790
 you can see but yes there are things a 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.480
 so interesting for example in this 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.530
 we see something whose old age is fighting 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.870
 for the mythical battle to fight the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.140
 earth and down here we see a character 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.360
 that does not have anything to do with the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.160
 history of dragon ball zo sea has the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.710
 trick clothes a coat and the hair of 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.990
 super saiyan in red color this 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.610
 it can mean that it is very likely or 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.869
 be I would dare to make sure that 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.360
 this game is going to have creator of 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.340
 characters because your virus is a 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.680
 totally picturesque character does not paint 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.660
 nothing here in the middle is surely 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.909
 our I would take it as a 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.670
 confirmation that you will have 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.610
 character creator as I say 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.310
 and good few pictures more little fighting 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.250
 against freezer boku fighting against 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.530
 cell and nothing or this is what you can 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.720
 see the step have not taught much 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.430
 after this month derive any 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.900
 trailer teaching something more today that month 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.510
 comes 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.040
 and the dates of departures 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.830
 still nothing is known or when they are going to 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.930
 say nothing but 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.970
 so it could be for this 2014 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.280
 and I have more to say apart from the 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.409
 few images that there is that the 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.940
 creator of characters and value 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:16.560
 a lot to this game I said it will come out 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:19.240
 for plate 34 and xbox 360 they do not say anything 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.340
 from xbox one 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.470
 did not know yet do not know if it will come out 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.150
 for xbox one to gather all the time 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.600
 safe ps3 pc 4 xbox s 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.600
 I'm going to leave it 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.850
 of the official website in the 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.860
 description for you to enter and see what 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.940
 what you want although there are not many 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.330
 things but good and will update 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.760
 and little more to say it I do not say to say is 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.700
 that I like at least the graphics like 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.520
 How do the shadows looks 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.900
 quite more to the anime than others 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.550
 shadows that we could have for 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.640
 example in tracing those of the ultimate 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.260
 tenkaichi or in the battle or yes 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.400
 moment what you see are some 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.870
 graphics a little more faithful 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.239
 lighting as the shadows of the 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.390
 characters is a detail that is very 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.920
 well at the moment what I see I like already 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.780
 we will see trailers to see what is the 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.989
 game mode I hope it's a way 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.989
 of game 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.250
 we'll see the characters there but 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.500
 good will be the first dragon game 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.970
 ball for the generation of play 4x what 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.020
 which as I said one of Granada 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.230
 moment 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.870
 and that's it, I'll upload videos 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.480
 when they go out more 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.340
 the news more news when they leave 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.959
 the characters would dispute to do 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.659
 analysis as I did 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.810
 kill them and the characters that come out 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:47.140
 and the things that you see and so you 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.180
 I bring this channel 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.670
 and well, it has not been everything to give 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.530
 laical video if you liked favorites 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.530
 and share it and see it again
