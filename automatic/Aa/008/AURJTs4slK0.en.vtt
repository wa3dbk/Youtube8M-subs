but from what I've seen this is only a

Ainsworth<00:03:52.120> has<00:03:52.570> left<00:03:53.049> us<00:03:53.260> a<00:03:53.380> little<00:03:53.799> bit<00:03:54.100> of<00:03:54.220> a

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
Ainsworth has left us a little bit of a

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.030 
Ainsworth has left us a little bit of a
quarry<00:03:55.180> over<00:03:55.329> here<00:03:55.600> just<00:03:56.019> to<00:03:56.230> test<00:03:56.470> it<00:03:56.680> out<00:03:56.799> so

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
quarry over here just to test it out so

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.620 
quarry over here just to test it out so
we're<00:03:57.190> going<00:03:57.310> to<00:03:57.400> go<00:03:57.519> over<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:57.940> test<00:03:58.359> it<00:03:58.540> out

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
we're going to go over and test it out

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.289 
we're going to go over and test it out
compared<00:03:59.109> to<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.320> iron<00:03:59.890> pick<00:04:00.160> so<00:04:00.700> let's<00:04:01.030> look

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
compared to a iron pick so let's look

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.680 
compared to a iron pick so let's look
for<00:04:01.540> iron<00:04:02.200> pick<00:04:03.130> and<00:04:03.340> we<00:04:04.000> are<00:04:04.030> going<00:04:04.359> to<00:04:04.540> as<00:04:04.660> you

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
for iron pick and we are going to as you

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.960 
for iron pick and we are going to as you
can<00:04:04.870> see<00:04:05.049> they<00:04:05.200> both<00:04:05.410> have<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.709> same<00:04:05.739> plus<00:04:06.549> for

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
can see they both have the same plus for

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.330 
can see they both have the same plus for
attack<00:04:07.329> damage<00:04:07.540> so<00:04:08.140> basically<00:04:08.769> they<00:04:09.040> will<00:04:09.220> be

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
attack damage so basically they will be

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.530 
attack damage so basically they will be
the<00:04:09.489> same<00:04:09.730> so<00:04:10.450> oh<00:04:10.690> oh<00:04:11.880> it<00:04:12.880> would<00:04:13.090> help<00:04:13.269> if<00:04:13.450> I

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
the same so oh oh it would help if I

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.120 
the same so oh oh it would help if I
wasn't<00:04:13.780> in<00:04:14.019> creative<00:04:14.470> we're<00:04:14.560> gonna<00:04:14.680> test<00:04:14.980> this

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
wasn't in creative we're gonna test this

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.710 
wasn't in creative we're gonna test this
out<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.489> have<00:04:16.090> a<00:04:16.390> look

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
out and have a look

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.409 
out and have a look
so<00:04:16.930> it's<00:04:17.079> quiet<00:04:17.410> it's<00:04:17.650> quite<00:04:17.919> quick<00:04:18.419> compared

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
so it's quiet it's quite quick compared

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.380 
so it's quiet it's quite quick compared
to<00:04:19.630> a<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:21.430> seems<00:04:21.669> to<00:04:21.820> be<00:04:21.910> a<00:04:21.940> little<00:04:22.090> bit<00:04:22.210> quicker

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
to a it seems to be a little bit quicker

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.390 
to a it seems to be a little bit quicker
than<00:04:22.660> an<00:04:22.720> iron<00:04:22.960> pickaxe<00:04:23.440> or<00:04:23.830> such<00:04:24.070> as<00:04:24.250> my

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
than an iron pickaxe or such as my

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.270 
than an iron pickaxe or such as my
imagination<00:04:24.840> I<00:04:25.840> think<00:04:26.470> personally<00:04:26.890> it<00:04:27.039> looks

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
imagination I think personally it looks

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.279 
imagination I think personally it looks
much<00:04:27.490> better<00:04:27.669> but<00:04:28.000> as<00:04:28.120> I<00:04:28.330> said<00:04:28.570> a<00:04:28.599> lot<00:04:28.870> of<00:04:28.990> stuff

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
much better but as I said a lot of stuff

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.290 
much better but as I said a lot of stuff
in<00:04:29.440> this<00:04:29.560> is<00:04:29.710> only<00:04:30.280> beta<00:04:30.820> textures<00:04:31.570> so

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
in this is only beta textures so

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.999 
in this is only beta textures so
we'll<00:04:32.509> probably<00:04:32.750> be<00:04:32.960> retexture<00:04:33.530> later<00:04:33.800> on

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
we'll probably be retexture later on

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.200 
we'll probably be retexture later on
when<00:04:34.370> it<00:04:34.490> comes<00:04:34.520> up<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.240> 1.0<00:04:36.020> release<00:04:37.210> now

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
when it comes up to the 1.0 release now

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.210 
when it comes up to the 1.0 release now
next<00:04:38.960> we<00:04:39.259> are<00:04:39.409> moving<00:04:39.590> on<00:04:39.800> to<00:04:39.860> one<00:04:40.039> of<00:04:40.099> the<00:04:40.159> most

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
next we are moving on to one of the most

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.559 
next we are moving on to one of the most
beloved<00:04:40.580> characters<00:04:40.789> and<00:04:41.120> obviously<00:04:41.419> the

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:41.569 
beloved characters and obviously the

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:43.480 
beloved characters and obviously the
main<00:04:41.750> character<00:04:42.139> which<00:04:42.500> is<00:04:42.530> Queen<00:04:42.979> Elsa

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
main character which is Queen Elsa

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
herself as it is she is a passive mob

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.490 
herself as it is she is a passive mob
she<00:04:46.580> has<00:04:46.759> no<00:04:46.970> real<00:04:47.300> powers<00:04:47.720> except<00:04:48.319> for<00:04:48.440> the

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
she has no real powers except for the

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.080 
she has no real powers except for the
fact<00:04:48.680> that<00:04:48.830> she<00:04:49.039> is<00:04:49.069> like<00:04:49.370> Olaf<00:04:49.580> when<00:04:49.940> she

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
fact that she is like Olaf when she

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.089 
fact that she is like Olaf when she
walks<00:04:50.389> on<00:04:50.629> ground<00:04:51.199> the<00:04:51.620> ground

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
walks on ground the ground

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:54.640 
walks on ground the ground
turns<00:04:52.520> into<00:04:52.669> snow<00:04:53.169> unfortunately<00:04:54.169> she<00:04:54.500> does

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
turns into snow unfortunately she does

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.619 
turns into snow unfortunately she does
not<00:04:54.860> turn<00:04:55.430> I<00:04:55.580> actually<00:04:55.909> do<00:04:56.150> you<00:04:56.210> know<00:04:56.270> what<00:04:56.449> I

00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:56.629 
not turn I actually do you know what I

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.839 
not turn I actually do you know what I
think<00:04:57.139> she<00:04:57.319> might<00:04:57.500> turn<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:58.099> water<00:04:58.520> into<00:04:58.819> ice

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
think she might turn the water into ice

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:00.909 
think she might turn the water into ice
we<00:04:59.270> will<00:04:59.419> test<00:04:59.569> that<00:04:59.690> out<00:04:59.900> in<00:05:00.080> a<00:05:00.259> few<00:05:00.500> minutes

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
we will test that out in a few minutes

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.820 
we will test that out in a few minutes
but<00:05:01.250> she<00:05:01.550> has<00:05:01.789> drop<00:05:02.180> offs<00:05:02.389> as<00:05:02.569> well<00:05:02.930> her<00:05:03.650> main

but she has drop offs as well her main
drop<00:05:04.009> off<00:05:04.220> is<00:05:04.430> else's<00:05:05.030> power<00:05:05.509> which<00:05:06.139> is<00:05:06.349> a

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
drop off is else's power which is a

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.339 
drop off is else's power which is a
potion<00:05:07.569> something<00:05:08.569> you<00:05:08.719> probably<00:05:08.930> don't<00:05:09.199> want

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
potion something you probably don't want

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.619 
potion something you probably don't want
to<00:05:09.409> drink<00:05:09.620> but<00:05:09.949> else's<00:05:10.340> power<00:05:10.580> is<00:05:10.909> then<00:05:11.180> used

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:11.629 
to drink but else's power is then used

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:13.959 
to drink but else's power is then used
to<00:05:11.810> create<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.650> wand<00:05:13.069> of<00:05:13.340> winters<00:05:13.699> power
