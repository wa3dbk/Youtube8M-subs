it's grown
exponentially<00:00:53.410> the<00:00:53.680> ours<00:00:53.980> had<00:00:54.219> a<00:00:54.250> very<00:00:54.550> kind

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
exponentially the ours had a very kind

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.700 
exponentially the ours had a very kind
of<00:00:55.449> funny<00:00:55.629> place<00:00:55.899> right<00:00:56.109> now<00:00:56.230> it's<00:00:56.440> in<00:00:56.590> between

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
of funny place right now it's in between

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.110

and<00:01:00.120> I'm<00:01:00.809> going<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.079> reality

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
and I'm going to reality

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.049 
and I'm going to reality
and<00:01:02.200> it's<00:01:02.380> going<00:01:02.530> to<00:01:02.680> intersect<00:01:03.040> other<00:01:03.580> forces

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
and it's going to intersect other forces

simultaneously

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.050
