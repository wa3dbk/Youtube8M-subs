00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.639 
rose-hulman Institute of Technology I
actually<00:00:45.359> got<00:00:46.359> a<00:00:46.389> very<00:00:46.659> good<00:00:46.809> scholarship<00:00:47.260> and

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
actually got a very good scholarship and

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.590 
actually got a very good scholarship and
wanted<00:00:47.920> to<00:00:47.979> stay<00:00:48.249> in<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.670> state<00:00:48.940> to<00:00:48.969> use<00:00:49.389> that

wanted to stay in the state to use that

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.169 
wanted to stay in the state to use that
scholarship<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:51.280> that<00:00:51.489> was<00:00:51.639> one<00:00:51.789> of<00:00:51.819> the<00:00:51.940> major

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:52.179

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
reasons I chose her was home and I knew

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.399 
reasons I chose her was home and I knew
that<00:00:53.949> it<00:00:54.249> was<00:00:54.429> the<00:00:55.210> best<00:00:55.449> place<00:00:55.659> for<00:00:55.899> me<00:00:56.019> in<00:00:56.049> the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
that it was the best place for me in the

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:59.520 
that it was the best place for me in the
state<00:00:56.710> and<00:00:57.429> I<00:00:57.909> honestly<00:00:58.870> didn't<00:00:59.260> know<00:00:59.319> where<00:00:59.499> I

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
state and I honestly didn't know where I

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.729 
state and I honestly didn't know where I
go<00:00:59.859> if<00:01:00.039> I<00:01:00.159> went<00:01:00.370> out<00:01:00.579> of<00:01:00.699> state<00:01:00.940> anyway<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:02.530> how

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
go if I went out of state anyway for how

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.289 
go if I went out of state anyway for how
young<00:01:02.979> the<00:01:03.100> department<00:01:03.549> was<00:01:03.699> when<00:01:03.940> I<00:01:03.969> went

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
young the department was when I went

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.179 
young the department was when I went
here<00:01:04.570> they<00:01:05.079> really<00:01:05.350> had<00:01:05.500> an<00:01:05.560> incredible<00:01:05.979> grasp

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
here they really had an incredible grasp

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.249 
here they really had an incredible grasp
of<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.610> things<00:01:06.850> i<00:01:07.060> would<00:01:07.119> need<00:01:07.390> either<00:01:07.630> in

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
of the things i would need either in

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.440 
of the things i would need either in
industry<00:01:08.799> or<00:01:08.950> in<00:01:09.070> graduate<00:01:09.610> school<00:01:09.640> I<00:01:10.149> really

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
industry or in graduate school I really

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.029 
industry or in graduate school I really
got<00:01:10.630> a<00:01:10.869> solid<00:01:11.259> background<00:01:11.530> in<00:01:11.890> chemistry

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
got a solid background in chemistry

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.920 
got a solid background in chemistry
solid<00:01:12.700> background<00:01:12.850> in<00:01:13.119> physics<00:01:13.299> a<00:01:13.630> solid

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
solid background in physics a solid

solid background in physics a solid
background<00:01:14.020> in<00:01:14.380> math<00:01:14.560> but<00:01:14.860> my<00:01:15.310> main<00:01:15.490> advice

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
background in math but my main advice

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.370 
background in math but my main advice
would<00:01:16.090> be<00:01:16.149> to<00:01:16.299> take<00:01:17.100> advantage<00:01:18.100> of<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:20.200> math

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
would be to take advantage of the math

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.719 
would be to take advantage of the math
department<00:01:20.409> and<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.250> computer<00:01:21.460> science

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
department and the computer science

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.880 
department and the computer science
department<00:01:22.270> here<00:01:22.420> rose-hulman<00:01:22.750> so<00:01:23.530> this<00:01:23.740> is

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890

much<00:01:51.970> harder<00:01:52.210> in<00:01:52.390> hindsight<00:01:52.690> to<00:01:52.900> go<00:01:52.990> back<00:01:53.170> and

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
much harder in hindsight to go back and

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.230 
much harder in hindsight to go back and
try<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.560> teach<00:01:53.800> yourself<00:01:53.980> something<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:55.000> one

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
try to teach yourself something the one

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.980 
try to teach yourself something the one
thing<00:01:55.450> that<00:01:55.510> really<00:01:55.660> comes<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.770> mind<00:01:56.800> is<00:01:57.550> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
thing that really comes to mind is the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.390 
thing that really comes to mind is the
work<00:01:58.990> ethic<00:01:59.230> that<00:01:59.650> I<00:01:59.680> developed<00:01:59.920> here<00:02:00.370> at

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
work ethic that I developed here at

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.730 
work ethic that I developed here at
rose-hulman<00:02:00.820> just<00:02:01.360> being<00:02:01.600> taught<00:02:02.410> how<00:02:02.440> to

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
rose-hulman just being taught how to

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.350 
rose-hulman just being taught how to
study<00:02:03.160> and<00:02:03.750> have<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.890> endurance<00:02:06.280> I<00:02:06.880> guess

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
study and have the endurance I guess

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.300 
study and have the endurance I guess
honestly<00:02:07.720> to<00:02:08.350> study<00:02:08.649> as<00:02:08.800> long<00:02:09.010> as<00:02:09.130> it's

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
honestly to study as long as it's

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.190 
honestly to study as long as it's
required<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:10.149> do<00:02:10.270> well<00:02:10.479> in<00:02:10.600> medical<00:02:10.990> school

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
required to do well in medical school

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.280 
required to do well in medical school
and<00:02:11.440> then<00:02:12.250> I<00:02:12.640> did<00:02:12.880> study<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.570> little<00:02:13.780> bit<00:02:13.900> for

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
and then I did study a little bit for

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.680 
and then I did study a little bit for
the<00:02:14.770> MCAT<00:02:15.310> which<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.910> admission<00:02:16.300> test<00:02:16.540> in

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
the MCAT which is the admission test in

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.950 
the MCAT which is the admission test in
medical<00:02:17.050> school<00:02:17.760> but<00:02:18.760> overall<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.510> would<00:02:19.840> say

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
medical school but overall I would say

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.830 
medical school but overall I would say
that<00:02:20.260> my<00:02:20.710> courses<00:02:21.370> prepared<00:02:21.850> me<00:02:22.090> adequately

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
that my courses prepared me adequately

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.810 
that my courses prepared me adequately
without<00:02:23.650> much<00:02:24.100> extra<00:02:24.610> work<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:27.130> course<00:02:27.460> load

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
without much extra work the course load

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.780 
without much extra work the course load
was<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.810> lot<00:02:29.740> of<00:02:29.770> course<00:02:30.220> but<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.610> seemed

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
was a lot of course but it seemed

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.390 
was a lot of course but it seemed
appropriate<00:02:31.770> for<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:32.860> transition<00:02:33.340> of

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
appropriate for the transition of

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.800 
appropriate for the transition of
medical<00:02:33.730> school<00:02:33.850> because<00:02:34.240> I<00:02:34.360> was<00:02:34.510> used<00:02:34.690> to

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
medical school because I was used to

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.060 
medical school because I was used to
studying<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:36.100> know<00:02:36.250> most<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.510> night<00:02:38.070> most

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
studying you know most of the night most

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.240 
studying you know most of the night most
days<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.550> week<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:41.560> was<00:02:41.709> easier<00:02:42.160> for

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
days of the week so that was easier for

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.250 
days of the week so that was easier for
me<00:02:42.520> when<00:02:42.940> I<00:02:42.970> got<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.330> medical<00:02:43.690> school<00:02:43.900> because

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
me when I got to medical school because

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.930 
me when I got to medical school because
he<00:02:44.290> really<00:02:44.709> have<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:45.070> devote<00:02:45.340> your<00:02:45.550> life<00:02:45.580> to

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
he really have to devote your life to

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.420 
he really have to devote your life to
medical<00:02:46.300> school<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:46.920> basically<00:02:47.920> study<00:02:48.250> all

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
medical school and basically study all

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.210 
medical school and basically study all
this<00:02:48.580> time<00:02:48.760> now<00:02:49.590> getting<00:02:50.590> their<00:02:50.830> foot<00:02:51.070> in<00:02:51.190> the

employers<00:02:54.340> quickly<00:02:54.760> learn<00:02:54.970> just<00:02:55.300> how

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
employers quickly learn just how

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.660 
employers quickly learn just how
prepared<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:56.050> rose<00:02:56.260> home<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.650> gret<00:02:56.860> is<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.340> how

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
prepared a rose home and gret is and how

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.449 
prepared a rose home and gret is and how
valuable<00:02:57.970> they<00:02:58.450> can<00:02:58.480> be<00:02:58.780> from<00:02:59.080> day<00:02:59.290> one<00:02:59.560> at

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
valuable they can be from day one at

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.770 
valuable they can be from day one at
least<00:03:00.610> when<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:00.820> was<00:03:00.940> here<00:03:01.090> every<00:03:01.300> apply<00:03:01.540> file

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
least when I was here every apply file

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.290 
least when I was here every apply file
it<00:03:01.989> just<00:03:02.170> had<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:02.470> do<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.310> senior<00:03:03.670> thesis<00:03:04.030> with

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
it just had to do a senior thesis with

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.360 
it just had to do a senior thesis with
in<00:03:04.750> a<00:03:04.780> lab<00:03:04.989> so<00:03:05.320> all<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.530> us<00:03:05.709> had<00:03:05.890> at<00:03:06.010> least<00:03:06.130> a

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
in a lab so all of us had at least a

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.640 
in a lab so all of us had at least a
year<00:03:06.730> of<00:03:06.850> hands-on<00:03:07.239> research<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:08.170> was

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
year of hands-on research so I was

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.229 
year of hands-on research so I was
fantastic<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:09.400> in<00:03:09.550> addition<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:10.090> those

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
fantastic and in addition to those

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.400 
fantastic and in addition to those
experiences<00:03:11.050> I<00:03:11.320> am<00:03:12.010> fitted<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:13.410> research

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
experiences I am fitted to research

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.050

that's<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.150> concern<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:33.540> mine<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:34.110> stay<00:03:34.350> at<00:03:34.709> the

that's a concern of mine to stay at the
top<00:03:34.950> of<00:03:35.010> my<00:03:35.250> class<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:35.850> that<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.030> don't<00:03:36.150> close

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
top of my class so that I don't close

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.030 
top of my class so that I don't close
any<00:03:36.570> doors<00:03:36.930> along<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.320> way<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.770> I've<00:03:40.770> made

any doors along the way and I I've made

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.180 
any doors along the way and I I've made
that<00:03:41.250> transition<00:03:41.459> well<00:03:42.030> that's<00:03:42.570> my<00:03:43.190> education

that transition well that's my education
so<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:45.989> differently<00:03:46.670> if<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:47.820> were<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:47.970> start

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
it all over again today college that is

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
probably get more exposure to medicine

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.050 
probably get more exposure to medicine

other than that I can't really think of

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.820 
other than that I can't really think of
anything<00:04:05.850> curriculum<00:04:06.630> wise<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:07.200> change<00:04:07.470> I
