I say rather than out here pollinating
them<00:00:45.710> that's<00:00:46.710> why<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:47.039> got<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.460> many<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:48.000> them

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
them that's why we got so many of them

them that's why we got so many of them
there's<00:00:49.260> some<00:00:49.410> reason<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.950> don't<00:00:50.100> get<00:00:50.190> out

there's some reason if you don't get out

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.069 
there's some reason if you don't get out
hand<00:00:50.579> here<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:50.850> pollinate<00:00:51.329> these<00:00:51.570> things<00:00:51.840> you

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
hand here and pollinate these things you

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.439 
hand here and pollinate these things you
don't<00:00:52.170> get<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.410> lot<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.980> don't<00:00:53.430> know<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:54.090> just

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
don't get a lot I don't know this just

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.830 
don't get a lot I don't know this just
the<00:00:54.930> way<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.469> guess<00:00:55.879> as<00:00:56.879> most<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.660> time

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
the way it is I guess as most of time

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.689 
the way it is I guess as most of time
should<00:00:58.079> he<00:00:58.199> start<00:00:58.440> opening<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
should he start opening up in the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.959 
should he start opening up in the
afternoon<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:01.219> don't<00:01:02.219> know<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.489> bees<00:01:02.730> are

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
afternoon I don't know if the bees are

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.520 
afternoon I don't know if the bees are
gone<00:01:03.149> or<00:01:03.629> what's<00:01:04.080> supposed<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.439> be

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
gone or what's supposed to be

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.660 
gone or what's supposed to be
pollinating<00:01:05.100> these<00:01:05.250> things<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:05.790> anyway<00:01:07.670> we

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
pollinating these things but anyway we

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.280

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
do it by hand and the results are they

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.469 
do it by hand and the results are they
just<00:01:13.530> keep<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:13.920> growing<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.119> look
