00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 Hello everyone and fines this new video 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.010
 then this video regarding some 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.750
 the organization this time I want to do 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.349
 see how they went to organize the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.540
 merci story I used boxes 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.859
 I have to assemble anyway found more or 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.300
 less everywhere 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.330
 all this wave of my heart 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.150
 accessories therefore the steve belts was 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:28.260
 injured share costumes the various 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.269
 scarves splits from scarves so that 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.579
 when I have to dress anyway vi 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.110
 easy to find things myself 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.649
 now I leave the video is immediately 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.320
 You have been placed after weeks of new hello 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.219
 here they are these boxes here and 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.300
 now let's go see what's inside 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.410
 before the appeals I wanted to see you again 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.539
 even so because they really are 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.780
 absolutely corpse space get cashed 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.940
 in an electorate perfectly and therefore 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.420
 seen at least really a lot and a lot 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.420
 space 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.780
 here it is we start from the first where 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.339
 play all put on the scarf then 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.189
 all the scarves in the ass from one's own 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.640
 peak fine lines 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.450
 instead I look for a scarf that 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.159
 only in this box only 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.710
 so it does not confuse it with le 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.490
 scarves with certain snow various pages 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.560
 denies saying this here and according to I have it 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.689
 open because they do not love impossible 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.610
 I could not open then played here 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.400
 put all my shoes instead 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.030
 so the veres are not those 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.630
 heavy but let's say those in the middle of 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.600
 season 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.070
 put them in this box 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.409
 inside this box put instead 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.720
 de cinture then sonata divide sinti 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.250
 for this step the summer belts 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.259
 then we start from the assumption that I 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.960
 I don't use a lot and belts are not 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.430
 a great stuff belts and maybe 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.159
 I also believe I really need it 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:58.740
 because in reality hardly pardo e 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:03.990
 pants, however, closed brackets 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:06.570
 I wanted to tell you that then this box here 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.890
 now I'm going to put it in the back 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.289
 part of italy from the mother that anyway 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.200
 will no longer be a thing I have to have a 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.510
 handy but it will become the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.550
 which out of season so I will pull 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.420
 in front of the box where I will have the belts 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.270
 winter and here it is here is the box 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.489
 then winter belts 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.489
 that now I was in front of the part 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.379
 front and I'll use practically 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.090
 until it arrives in the spring 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.580
 because in any case they are all with belts 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.830
 quite incorrect and admits been 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.950
 really 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.550
 I always try to eliminate the black and of 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.840
 use everything that brings you color 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.190
 so even the belts if you put 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.380
 a belt must be a belt 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.510
 colored obviously always combined then 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.150
 in this vast set the costumes also 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.240
 this of course if I have no intention 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.580
 of my taking a pool course a 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.810
 well known book here too 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:13.430
 they should be put away so I will always put them back 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.980
 in the back part of the fair wardrobe 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.670
 still costumes costumes and costume costume 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:25.430
 always before so many questions then 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:28.130
 now I will put them away and nothing for it 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.350
 finished these guys are my box I 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.990
 I found it very well I tell you study 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.030
 because it's really a lot easier 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.150
 find the stuff because if it should be given 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.860
 mix everything in the quarry more for 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.030
 I greet you and I promise week 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.030
 next with new age videos
