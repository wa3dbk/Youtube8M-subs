00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.580
 good afternoon dear channel viewers 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.039
 newspaper grower video today we are with you 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.140
 we will form a bush and a tomato matter 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.980
 the fact that tomatoes are capable of much 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.660
 grow out of the bosom of each leaflet 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.019
 grows over snack which forms 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.600
 stalk on it grow new stepchildren and 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:37.860
 if we do not intervene in time 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.589
 bush formation 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.320
 then all the power of the plant to spend on 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:44.519
 the formation of green mass and not on growth and 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.370
 fruit ripening 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:50.549
 Yes, and the leaves themselves shading each other 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.940
 will wither away to hurt and as a result 

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:56.970
 we will not get a good harvest 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.479
 Immediately make a reservation not all tomatoes require 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.119
 our intervention will start in order 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:04.530
 tomato varieties and hybrids are 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:07.110
 indeterminate semi determinant 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.470
 and determinant this information should 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.050
 be indicated on the seed packaging sometimes 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.950
 manufacturers simply label them as 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.680
 tall 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.930
 medium tall and undersized varieties and 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.820
 hybrids 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.540
 indeterminate tall have 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.890
 unrestricted growth of the main stem 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.350
 it is indeterminate 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.050
 or tall tomatoes form into one 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.880
 the stem that is all stepchildren 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:38.700
 without exception, delete what stepchildren 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.970
 stepchild is a side escape all lateral 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.340
 shoots on tomato plants grow 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.990
 from the sinuses leaflets in order to 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.510
 to distinguish the leaf from the stepson 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.060
 should just take a closer look 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.110
 on the bush, the stepson never grows on 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.570
 bare stems 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.150
 the leaflet will always grow first and 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.010
 just from the bosom of the leaf 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.250
 that is, from the place which is located 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.500
 between the leaves of the main stem will be 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.810
 grow escape parcels 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.869
 rather rapidly increasing in 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.420
 sizes remove stepsons better in 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.850
 morning hours preferably in the sun 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.810
 weather that barankina plant quickly 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.450
 healed essentially need to break off and 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.390
 insert a small stump to this 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.910
 the place is not the growth of a new messenger as I have already 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.550
 spoke on indeterminant varieties and 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.610
 hybrids remove all stepchildren without 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.280
 exceptions thus form 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.650
 plants in one stem 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.340
 remove necessary and lower leaves by 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.340
 one two a week when they 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.150
 practically no longer needed by the plant for 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.890
 ventilation of the lower part of the plant to 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.470
 the moment the fruit grows on the first 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.470
 brushes usually finish removing all 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.440
 leaves to it should not be allowed 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.830
 dead leaves itself due to the possibility 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.110
 fungal infection now let's talk about 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.220
 semi determinant average tall 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.950
 varieties and hybrids 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.130
 determinant sexes can at any time 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.519
 complete forged finish your height in 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:18.209
 the most unexpected moment such tomatoes 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.400
 it is better to lead in 2 stalks for this we 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.670
 leave the stepson who is under 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.040
 first floral brush and shape out 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.010
 him second degree 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.730
 removing the rest of the stepsons except 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.480
 top 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.430
 as I said the main stem of the tomato 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.430
 polo determinant new varieties can 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.760
 complete that is finish growing in 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.880
 any moment and when this happens and 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.790
 if this happens this upper stepson 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:52.290
 replace main stem and continue 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:55.110
 evolve and if we see that the main 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.739
 the stem continues to grow there and this 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:01.350
 stepchild just remove the bottom 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.989
 We also remove the leaves. 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.959
 gradually so that by the time of sprouting 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.450
 fruits on the lower hand all the leaves were 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.090
 removed before her 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.590
 and some determinant varieties 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.190
 determinant tomatoes or how them 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.380
 called 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.019
 undersized differs in that 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.260
 stop growing after tying 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.620
 a certain number of brushes 45 like 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.460
 rule they do not grow as 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.530
 previous 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.410
 and therefore many gardeners do not have them at all 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.830
 parcel but if you want to receive 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.880
 early harvest is a bit better 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:45.050
 defuse the bush and form into 3 stalks 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:47.419
 leaving the strongest by themselves well and 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.430
 The second half of August is 2 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.169
 Leningrad region need 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.440
 pinch all the tops 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.070
 so we stop plant growth and the whole 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.910
 the energy 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:01.360
 direct to the ripening of the fruit but what 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.370
 to do if you don't want to stick 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:08.660
 tie forming bush and tomatoes and 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:12.080
 Would you like to decide but the table to get delicious 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.780
 and early tomatoes and personally grown by you 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.590
 there is a way you need to grow 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.990
 shtambovy tomatoes shtambovy tomatoes it 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.840
 variety of determinants GOVERNMENTAL only 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.240
 they are shorter and sturdy 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.240
 here they just do not require either 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.389
 tying not cradle at me they 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.400
 grow right outside 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.860
 although in the north of the Leningrad region to 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.260
 in such a cold summer I doubt that 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:44.110
 something grows but i wish you 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.110
 good harvest and all the best 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.890
