00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
and formaldehyde infuses keratin into

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.270 
and formaldehyde infuses keratin into
the<00:01:03.120> hair<00:01:03.390> cuticle<00:01:03.719> I've<00:01:04.500> read<00:01:04.799> somewhere<00:01:05.129> not

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
too long ago that the more formaldehyde

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.530 
too long ago that the more formaldehyde
there<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.310> longer<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.909> treatment<00:01:09.330> lasts

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.780 
eyes like crazy because it contained
high<00:01:51.420> levels<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.990> formaldehyde<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:53.100> at<00:01:53.610> that

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
high levels of formaldehyde and at that

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.520 
high levels of formaldehyde and at that
time<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.180> really<00:01:54.420> do<00:01:54.509> not<00:01:54.659> know<00:01:54.840> much<00:01:55.020> about<00:01:55.079> it

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
time I really do not know much about it

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.219 
time I really do not know much about it
I<00:01:55.710> also<00:01:56.430> didn't<00:01:56.939> like<00:01:56.969> having<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.570> flat<00:01:57.840> iron

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
I also didn't like having that flat iron

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.190 
I also didn't like having that flat iron
set<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.880> 450<00:01:59.880> degrees<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.390> was<00:02:00.509> way<00:02:00.780> too<00:02:00.840> high

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
set to 450 degrees that was way too high

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.800 
set to 450 degrees that was way too high
but<00:02:01.920> unfortunately<00:02:02.610> we<00:02:02.759> set<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.329> way<00:02:03.540> in

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
but unfortunately we set that way in

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.080 
but unfortunately we set that way in
order<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.530> infuse<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.130> keratin<00:02:05.579> into<00:02:05.969> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
order to infuse the keratin into the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.479 
order to infuse the keratin into the
hair<00:02:06.299> cuticle<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:06.990> my<00:02:07.320> hair<00:02:07.590> really<00:02:07.979> did<00:02:08.310> not
