hair to prepare it for the style so once

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.830 
hair to prepare it for the style so once
my<00:00:29.160> hair<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.400> all<00:00:29.519> tangled<00:00:29.550> I'm<00:00:30.179> spritzing<00:00:30.630> it

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
my hair is all tangled I'm spritzing it

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.100 
my hair is all tangled I'm spritzing it
with<00:00:30.990> water<00:00:31.579> because<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.910> helps<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.570> reshape

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
with water because it helps to reshape

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.049 
with water because it helps to reshape
your<00:00:34.260> curls<00:00:34.649> if<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.550> your<00:00:35.670> hair<00:00:35.790> damp

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
your curls if you have your hair damp

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.450 
your curls if you have your hair damp
I'm<00:00:36.750> making<00:00:37.110> sure<00:00:37.230> not<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.469> like<00:00:37.680> soak<00:00:38.010> my<00:00:38.219> hair

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
I'm making sure not to like soak my hair

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.240 
I'm making sure not to like soak my hair
because<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:39.000> will<00:00:39.149> take<00:00:39.360> forever<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.440> dry<00:00:40.559> so

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
because it will take forever to dry so

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.490 
because it will take forever to dry so
just<00:00:41.460> get<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:42.120> damp<00:00:42.660> but<00:00:42.989> make<00:00:43.170> sure<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.379> get

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
just get it damp but make sure you get

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.680 
just get it damp but make sure you get
like<00:00:43.680> all<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.219> underneath<00:00:44.550> areas<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.480> stuff

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
like all the underneath areas and stuff

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.940

using this sack is like a flexi roll an

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.280 
using this sack is like a flexi roll an
alternative<00:02:26.490> because<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.820> don't<00:02:26.970> have<00:02:27.150> any<00:02:27.360> so

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
alternative because I don't have any so

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.620 
alternative because I don't have any so
I'm<00:02:28.620> literally<00:02:29.370> just<00:02:29.520> wrapping<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.390> end<00:02:30.510> of

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
I'm literally just wrapping the end of

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.360 
I'm literally just wrapping the end of
my<00:02:30.750> hair<00:02:30.960> around<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.530> stock<00:02:31.740> as<00:02:31.980> if<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.250> were

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
my hair around the stock as if it were

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.890 
my hair around the stock as if it were
like<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.700> flexi<00:02:33.090> rod<00:02:33.270> or<00:02:33.510> like<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.080> stick<00:02:34.650> and

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
like a flexi rod or like a stick and

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.260 
like a flexi rod or like a stick and
then<00:02:36.900> I'm<00:02:37.400> rolling<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.520> sack<00:02:38.700> up<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:39.030> little

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
then I'm rolling the sack up a little

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.070 
then I'm rolling the sack up a little
bit<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:42.030> kind<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.270> pin<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.480> hair<00:02:42.720> against

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
bit to kind of pin the hair against

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.570 
bit to kind of pin the hair against
itself<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.620> doesn't<00:02:43.860> come<00:02:43.980> out<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.430> then

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
itself so it doesn't come out and then

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.120 
itself so it doesn't come out and then
I'm<00:02:44.760> just<00:02:44.850> going<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.300> tie<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.630> sack<00:02:45.959> in<00:02:46.740> a

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
I'm just going to tie the sack in a

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.800 
I'm just going to tie the sack in a
little<00:02:47.370> knot

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.420 

so<00:02:51.319> what<00:02:51.440> does<00:02:51.560> I'm<00:02:51.620> gonna<00:02:51.770> do<00:02:51.950> is<00:02:52.190> help<00:02:52.370> keep

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
so what does I'm gonna do is help keep

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.550 
so what does I'm gonna do is help keep
the<00:02:52.670> ends<00:02:52.819> of<00:02:52.880> my<00:02:52.970> hair<00:02:53.050> curled<00:02:54.050> or<00:02:54.230> at<00:02:54.290> least<00:02:54.440> a

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
the ends of my hair curled or at least a

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.780 
the ends of my hair curled or at least a
little<00:02:54.680> bit<00:02:54.890> so<00:02:55.040> they're<00:02:55.190> just<00:02:55.280> not<00:02:55.430> stick

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
little bit so they're just not stick

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.970 
little bit so they're just not stick
straight<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.360> it<00:02:56.720> doesn't<00:02:56.990> work<00:02:57.110> afterward

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.470 

now<00:03:00.980> I'm<00:03:01.310> basically<00:03:01.520> I'm<00:03:01.760> just<00:03:02.090> going<00:03:02.360> to

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
now I'm basically I'm just going to

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.790 
now I'm basically I'm just going to
repeat<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:02.990> other<00:03:03.080> side<00:03:03.380> I<00:03:03.410> added<00:03:03.770> a

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
repeat to the other side I added a

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.350 
repeat to the other side I added a
little<00:03:04.010> bit<00:03:04.100> more<00:03:04.250> water<00:03:04.400> because<00:03:04.670> it<00:03:04.760> dried<00:03:05.090> I

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
little bit more water because it dried I

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.600 
little bit more water because it dried I
was<00:03:05.600> doing<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.020> first<00:03:06.230> side<00:03:06.440> so<00:03:07.220> just<00:03:07.430> repeat

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
was doing the first side so just repeat

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.400 
was doing the first side so just repeat
everything<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:08.330> second<00:03:08.600> side<00:03:08.750> except<00:03:09.230> I'm

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
everything to the second side except I'm

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.340 
everything to the second side except I'm
not<00:03:09.880> French<00:03:10.880> twisting<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.510> I'm<00:03:11.720> just<00:03:11.959> twisting

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
not French twisting it I'm just twisting

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:19.990 
not French twisting it I'm just twisting
it

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:45.699 

this

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.949 

in<00:03:46.400> a<00:03:46.459> bitch<00:03:46.700> face<00:03:46.909> going<00:03:47.120> hard<00:03:47.420> in<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.599> paint

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
in a bitch face going hard in the paint

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.660 
in a bitch face going hard in the paint
ain't<00:03:48.260> no<00:03:48.439> change<00:03:48.769> so<00:03:49.069> what<00:03:49.159> I'm<00:03:49.280> still<00:03:49.459> like

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
ain't no change so what I'm still like

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.490 
ain't no change so what I'm still like
the<00:03:50.060> bathroom<00:03:50.510> when<00:03:50.659> I<00:03:50.719> came<00:03:50.780> out<00:03:51.049> real<00:03:51.260> life

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
the bathroom when I came out real life

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.140 
the bathroom when I came out real life
cancer<00:03:51.980> real<00:03:52.189> life

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.400 

so<00:03:56.150> basically<00:03:56.480> this<00:03:56.690> is<00:03:56.750> what<00:03:56.989> it<00:03:57.080> looks<00:03:57.290> like

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
so basically this is what it looks like

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.870 
so basically this is what it looks like
when<00:03:57.590> you're<00:03:57.650> done<00:03:57.770> twisting<00:03:58.220> again<00:03:58.520> I<00:03:58.550> didn't

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
when you're done twisting again I didn't

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.940 
when you're done twisting again I didn't
pay<00:03:58.970> too<00:03:59.030> much<00:03:59.180> attention<00:03:59.360> to<00:03:59.810> the<00:04:00.050> top<00:04:00.260> just

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
pay too much attention to the top just

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.260 
pay too much attention to the top just
because<00:04:01.010> I'm<00:04:01.250> not<00:04:01.400> wearing<00:04:01.610> this<00:04:01.700> out<00:04:01.910> but<00:04:02.180> if

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
because I'm not wearing this out but if

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.760 
because I'm not wearing this out but if
you<00:04:02.300> were<00:04:02.569> going<00:04:02.900> to<00:04:02.989> wear<00:04:03.080> it<00:04:03.200> as<00:04:03.290> a<00:04:03.349> hairstyle

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
you were going to wear it as a hairstyle

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.559 
you were going to wear it as a hairstyle
you<00:04:03.830> might<00:04:03.950> want<00:04:04.099> to<00:04:04.160> make<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:05.120> French<00:04:05.360> part

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
you might want to make the French part

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.240 
you might want to make the French part
look<00:04:05.720> better<00:04:05.900> so<00:04:06.349> now<00:04:06.380> this<00:04:06.770> is<00:04:06.920> a<00:04:07.010> few<00:04:07.160> hours

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
look better so now this is a few hours

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.979 
look better so now this is a few hours
later<00:04:07.489> they<00:04:07.910> probably<00:04:08.180> did<00:04:08.420> not<00:04:08.450> wait<00:04:08.750> long

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
later they probably did not wait long

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.680 
later they probably did not wait long
enough<00:04:09.020> we<00:04:09.440> until<00:04:09.770> it's<00:04:09.920> dry<00:04:10.360> so<00:04:11.360> I'm<00:04:11.540> just

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:31.690 
gonna undo the twist and show you guys
how<00:04:15.950> it<00:04:16.010> looks<00:04:29.080> really<00:04:30.080> loose<00:04:30.320> waves<00:04:30.889> lash

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700

how it looks really loose waves lash
curls<00:04:32.090> and<00:04:32.389> like<00:04:32.630> I<00:04:32.780> said<00:04:32.840> there<00:04:33.770> were<00:04:33.830> some

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
curls and like I said there were some

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.680 
curls and like I said there were some
pieces<00:04:34.160> still<00:04:34.520> damp<00:04:34.820> so<00:04:35.270> I<00:04:35.300> should<00:04:35.630> have

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
pieces still damp so I should have

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.590 
pieces still damp so I should have
waited<00:04:36.160> even<00:04:37.160> longer<00:04:37.460> than<00:04:37.700> I<00:04:37.729> did<00:04:37.940> but<00:04:38.180> you

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
waited even longer than I did but you

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.460 
waited even longer than I did but you
know<00:04:38.780> I<00:04:38.810> was<00:04:39.200> anxious<00:04:40.780> so<00:04:41.780> I<00:04:41.810> just<00:04:42.050> an<00:04:42.169> up<00:04:42.320> close

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
know I was anxious so I just an up close

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.730 
know I was anxious so I just an up close
of<00:04:42.710> how<00:04:42.830> it<00:04:43.790> looks<00:04:47.320> and<00:04:48.320> you'll<00:04:48.470> see<00:04:48.620> pictures

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
of how it looks and you'll see pictures

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.020 
of how it looks and you'll see pictures
at<00:04:49.040> the<00:04:49.130> end<00:04:49.160> but<00:04:49.430> it<00:04:49.520> turns<00:04:49.700> out<00:04:49.850> different

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
at the end but it turns out different

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.120 
at the end but it turns out different
like<00:04:50.360> every<00:04:50.630> time<00:04:50.810> I<00:04:50.930> do<00:04:50.990> it<00:04:51.229> this<00:04:51.740> wasn't<00:04:51.979> my

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
like every time I do it this wasn't my

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.560 
like every time I do it this wasn't my
favorite<00:04:52.490> time<00:04:52.669> but<00:04:52.970> you'll<00:04:53.120> see<00:04:53.270> some<00:04:53.300> of<00:04:53.510> the

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
favorite time but you'll see some of the

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.020 
favorite time but you'll see some of the
other<00:04:53.660> ways<00:04:54.020> it's<00:04:54.229> turned<00:04:54.440> out<00:04:57.490> and<00:04:58.490> I<00:04:58.789> didn't

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
other ways it's turned out and I didn't

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.850 
other ways it's turned out and I didn't
really<00:04:59.120> like<00:04:59.240> it<00:04:59.360> so<00:04:59.720> I<00:04:59.750> just<00:04:59.990> took<00:05:00.500> some<00:05:00.560> of

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
really like it so I just took some of

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.610 
really like it so I just took some of
the<00:05:00.950> main<00:05:01.190> curls<00:05:01.640> and<00:05:01.820> twisted<00:05:02.630> them<00:05:02.780> like

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
the main curls and twisted them like

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.380 
the main curls and twisted them like
finger<00:05:03.919> curled<00:05:04.190> them<00:05:04.340> really<00:05:04.640> tightly<00:05:04.910> and

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
finger curled them really tightly and

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.390 
finger curled them really tightly and
then<00:05:05.810> I<00:05:06.380> twisted<00:05:06.680> those<00:05:06.830> all<00:05:07.010> together<00:05:07.160> and

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
then I twisted those all together and

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.469 
then I twisted those all together and
pulled<00:05:07.610> them<00:05:07.729> apart<00:05:07.850> so<00:05:08.090> you<00:05:08.300> see<00:05:08.510> that<00:05:10.479> just
