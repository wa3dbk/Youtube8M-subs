00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
consideration for this review what I

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:55.429 
consideration for this review what I
will<00:05:53.969> be<00:05:54.119> factoring<00:05:54.569> in<00:05:54.719> is<00:05:54.929> the<00:05:55.229> root<00:05:55.409> cause

00:05:55.429 --> 00:05:55.439 
will be factoring in is the root cause

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:57.739 
will be factoring in is the root cause
of<00:05:55.769> those<00:05:56.189> issues<00:05:56.429> the<00:05:57.029> need<00:05:57.300> for<00:05:57.719> a

00:05:57.739 --> 00:05:57.749 
of those issues the need for a

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:00.350 
of those issues the need for a
persistent<00:05:58.499> internet<00:05:59.009> connection<00:05:59.579> now

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360

obviously<00:06:00.749> there's<00:06:00.959> an<00:06:01.139> added<00:06:01.439> emphasis<00:06:01.889> on

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:02.099 
obviously there's an added emphasis on

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:04.129 
obviously there's an added emphasis on
multiplayer<00:06:02.519> here<00:06:02.939> but<00:06:03.209> there's<00:06:03.449> also<00:06:03.719> no

multiplayer here but there's also no
