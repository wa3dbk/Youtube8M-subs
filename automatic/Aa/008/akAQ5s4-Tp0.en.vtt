00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
measures to see that quality steel is

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.670 
measures to see that quality steel is
good<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.410> by<00:01:58.410> the<00:01:58.470> standards<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.190> our<00:02:00.090> buyers

good and by the standards of our buyers
then<00:02:01.680> we<00:02:02.460> cut<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:04.040> then<00:02:05.040> we<00:02:05.220> measure<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:07.010> then

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
then we cut it then we measure it then

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:14.210 
then we cut it then we measure it then
it<00:02:08.160> goes<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:09.830> forging<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:13.260> have<00:02:13.530> several

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
it goes to forging you have several

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.310 
it goes to forging you have several
process<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.600> forging<00:02:17.810> then<00:02:18.810> we<00:02:18.900> measure<00:02:19.110> it

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
process of forging then we measure it

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.930 
process of forging then we measure it
again<00:02:20.930> then<00:02:21.930> goes<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.830> our<00:02:22.950> mechanical

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
again then goes to our mechanical

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.420 
again then goes to our mechanical
Department<00:02:24.230> then<00:02:25.230> we<00:02:25.350> measure<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.769> again<00:02:26.160> and

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
Department then we measure it again and

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.590 
Department then we measure it again and
we'll<00:02:26.580> sandblasting<00:02:27.650> heat<00:02:28.650> treatments<00:02:29.340> and

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
we'll sandblasting heat treatments and

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.750 
we'll sandblasting heat treatments and
many<00:02:30.600> other<00:02:30.840> measures<00:02:31.590> that<00:02:31.860> were<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.550> are

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
many other measures that were that are

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.270 
many other measures that were that are
very<00:02:32.970> important<00:02:33.870> for<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.530> quality<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.070> the

and the quality control of the project

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.000 
and the quality control of the project
you<00:02:38.519> inputs<00:02:39.000> invest<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:40.140> lot<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.440> money<00:02:40.590> in

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
you inputs invest a lot of money in

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.100 
you inputs invest a lot of money in
laboratory<00:02:41.430> because<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.420> control<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.959> the

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
laboratory because the control of the
