00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.800
 south of Brazil the south of chile some 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:34.240
 parts of Bolivia and noticed that a lot 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:39.130
 people used 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:42.330
 the mate made of pumpkin maybe yes 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.330
 and the grass 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:51.630
 watch as we say in argentina grass 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:55.550
 which is similar to tea but from South America 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:58.690

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:04.400

 we say light bulb if the mate if the mate 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:25.860
 and the grass or grass itself 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.020
 then we need 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.859

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.859
 two thirds of grass 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.260
 in the mate 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.000
 we can thus remove the bulb a 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.000
 moment 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:56.570

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.140
 but do not boil 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.140
 inside the kettle 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:34.400
 they will notice if as the grass grows if 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.400

 where formerly the Guarani Indians 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.680

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:37.079

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.710
 they take sweet in some provinces they 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.640
