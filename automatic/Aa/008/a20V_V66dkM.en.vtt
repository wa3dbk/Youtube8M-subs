looking it's looking at this guy yeah it
comes<00:02:00.630> down<00:02:00.900> into<00:02:01.320> land<00:02:01.619> back<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.299> occasionally

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
comes down into land back a occasionally

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.420 
comes down into land back a occasionally
will<00:02:03.390> fall<00:02:03.570> into<00:02:03.689> like<00:02:03.840> little<00:02:03.869> cubby<00:02:04.530> which<00:02:05.100> I

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
will fall into like little cubby which I

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.460 
will fall into like little cubby which I
don't<00:02:05.880> know<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.450> main<00:02:06.600> goal<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.960> for<00:02:07.350> it

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
like none of these needs are going to

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.990 
like none of these needs are going to
work<00:03:37.829> first<00:03:38.100> try<00:03:38.400> you're<00:03:38.609> gonna<00:03:38.670> have<00:03:38.880> to

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
work first try you're gonna have to

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.860 
work first try you're gonna have to
practice<00:03:39.510> them<00:03:39.720> stuff<00:03:40.250> yeah<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.609> then<00:03:42.450> so

practice them stuff yeah and then so

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.039 
practice them stuff yeah and then so
after<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.680> load<00:03:44.280> back<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.910> my<00:03:45.030> position<00:03:45.569> because

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
after I load back to my position because

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.170 
after I load back to my position because
this<00:03:46.620> is<00:03:46.769> strapped<00:03:47.160> mode<00:03:47.400> like<00:03:47.700> this<00:03:47.970> isn't

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
this is strapped mode like this isn't

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.809 
this is strapped mode like this isn't
what<00:03:48.450> pro<00:03:48.660> mod<00:03:48.840> actually<00:03:49.200> is<00:03:49.319> like<00:03:49.640> by<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.670> way

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
what pro mod actually is like by the way

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.229 
what pro mod actually is like by the way
and<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:52.109> usually<00:03:52.590> pick<00:03:53.130> broken<00:03:53.850> wall<00:03:54.030> right

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
and I usually pick broken wall right

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.920

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
little bit more reliable and getting a

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.230 
little bit more reliable and getting a
kill<00:04:31.110> than<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.890> other<00:04:32.010> one<00:04:32.220> yeah<00:04:32.580> but<00:04:33.090> it's

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240

if you can get it down faster like the
fact<00:06:54.470> you<00:06:54.620> get<00:06:54.710> up<00:06:54.830> sandbags<00:06:55.039> the<00:06:55.669> better<00:06:55.850> here

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
fact you get up sandbags the better here

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.560
