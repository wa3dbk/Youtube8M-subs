into focusing on what I had to do but I

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.580 
into focusing on what I had to do but I
obviously<00:00:42.390> stopped<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.079> turned<00:00:43.170> around<00:00:43.320> and

obviously stopped and turned around and

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.959 
obviously stopped and turned around and
looked<00:00:43.710> at<00:00:43.890> him<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.309> kind<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.520> make<00:00:44.670> sure<00:00:44.700> if

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
game yeah I had a very conscious effort

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.950 
game yeah I had a very conscious effort
in<00:01:29.700> between<00:01:30.000> my<00:01:30.119> last<00:01:30.360> start<00:01:30.659> against<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
in between my last start against the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.920 
in between my last start against the
Yankee's<00:01:31.820> before<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> no-hitter<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.570> had

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
Yankee's before the no-hitter I had

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.450 
Yankee's before the no-hitter I had
really<00:01:34.320> good<00:01:34.500> stuff<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.040> feel<00:01:35.189> like<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.369> was

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
really good stuff but I feel like I was

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.280 
really good stuff but I feel like I was
a<00:01:35.490> little<00:01:35.640> bit<00:01:35.729> too<00:01:35.850> amped<00:01:36.090> up<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.659> my<00:01:37.049> whole

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
a little bit too amped up so my whole

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.899 
a little bit too amped up so my whole
goal<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.740> between<00:01:38.040> stars<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.549> calm<00:01:38.759> myself

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
goal in between stars is to calm myself

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.520

a<00:02:31.620> better<00:02:31.709> pitcher<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.550> hopefully<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.209> can

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
a better pitcher and hopefully I can

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.060 
a better pitcher and hopefully I can
take<00:02:33.570> away<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.870> lot<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.200> things<00:02:34.470> from<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.740> last

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
start and carry them over as long as I

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.110 
start and carry them over as long as I
continue<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.100> pitch<00:02:38.340> because<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:38.640> felt<00:02:38.910> really

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
continue to pitch because I felt really

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.360
