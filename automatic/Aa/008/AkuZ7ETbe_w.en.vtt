00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 yep hello how are you doing today 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.470
 wanted to give you some basic tips 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.080
 to preserve and maintain your 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.179
 neoprene the name is not a piece that 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.830
 all triathletes we need now 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.929
 We can be more professional or more 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.060
 amateurs that we need a neoprene 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.609
 for our tests is very important 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.990
 then train with him not only 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.029
 catch up to the test because there 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.070
 a series of things that in this we 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.439
 we have to accustom as for example 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.900
 for resistance to the arm to the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.520
 stroke that is different as the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.410
 buoyancy good a series of things 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.750
 that we have to get used to 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.550
 that this would be another chapter so 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.649
 as now the seasons of 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.750
 summer training ends and has already begun 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.090
 to be the time to train with 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.789
 I 'm going to give you some tips 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.379
 basic how to extend the life of 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.329
 this is what I'm going to do the first time 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.550
 before using it after having a 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.010
 time saved the neoprene by the part 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.379
 interior carries a series of fibers that 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.300
 being saved by not using it 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.940
 dry then it is very important that 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.350
 before the first use we remove it 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.960
 we have to soak with 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.119
 and let it dry and we already have it 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.710
 ready for the first use you can 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.869
 happen if we do not do it because at 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.759
 put us as it is dry that 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.500
 let's hit a pull and with this pull 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.270
 provoke or a bite or that 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.490
 directly break the neoprene very 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.409
 well we have prepared neoprene 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.560
 for the first use so we'll go to 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.380
 train we will use it and then very very very 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.899
 important the next step is always 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.909
 clean the neoprene remove with water 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.860
 sweet all the remains of sand that 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.539
 there may be and all the remains of salt 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.460
 although you see it clean 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.740
 really there there are remains of salt and there 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.289
 that eliminating them with fresh water forms very 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.119
 easy to remove them in the bathtub all 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.280
 we have at home a shower a bathtub in 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.470
 the bathtub is great because the first of 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.020
 all we are going to do is submerge the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.179
 neoprene if it's very very very dirty what 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.970
 What we can do is put a little 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.860
 of neutral ham let it rinse about 15 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.770
 minutes and then proceed to the withdrawal 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.690
 of all waste with the same 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.159
 shower phone so let's go to 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.130
 keep in mind that it is totally 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.500
 clean on the outside and totally clean 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.110
 inside and also by the zones of the 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.120
 creams 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.060
 once we have cleaned it what 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.280
 we have to do is dry it then 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.000
 to do what we will do is put it 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.010
 on a hanger and dry it we hang it and what 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.140
 we have to dry in an area where there 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.600
 touch the sun the neoprene with the sun 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.460
 dry out that means that you can 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.590
 study if we re dry lose 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.450
 elasticity once the neoprene is 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.460
 dry what we are going to do is save it 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.950
 but we're not going to keep it inside the 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.300
 We will keep the bag or folded 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.550
 the same hanger 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.350
 inside the closet another very subject 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.540
 important to keep in mind and that many 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.940
 Sometimes we ignore it so that 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.190
 there is friction during the race 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.140
 competition or the training we put on 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.660
 Vaseline around the neck area and the 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.540
 area of the arms Vaseline are very 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.209
 bad Vaseline can break us the 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.239
 neoprene then you have to use a type 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.620
 of special oil for wetsuits at 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.300
 final does not stop being a kind of 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.670
 petroleum jelly but that is intended for 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.590
 wetsuits for example a roll such that 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.630
 well apart from being special to 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.820
 Neoprene is super easy to apply 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.620
 we just have to give it a little no 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.110
 it's so much for the ease of applying 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.989
 but for the components so look 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.390
 a special oil for neoprene how 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.239
 a neoprene is folded we put the neoprene 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.690
 upside down first of all we doubled 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:35.530
 the legs once we have bent the 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:39.849
 legs we bend the sleeves so that 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.280
 so and then we make a fold and 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.750
 another sheet we have the neoprene 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.610
 perfectly folded as I have 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.920
 taught and now let's see how what 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.709
 we transport there are a series of 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.379
 special bags like for example these 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.940
 they have a kind of grid and this 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.099
 means they are prepared to 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.230
 can move them so much to go swimming 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.910
 which is dry enough to return this way 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.090
 somehow the water is draining 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:08.049
 and they do not remain encharcados there in a sea 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.000
 of water and waste goes and then the 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.750
 more practical way I think this is 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.750
 type of bag 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.360
 another very very important issue is how do we 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.000
 we put the neoprene this already has a 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.949
 video apart these days soon 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.069
 let's go train with borja with day 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.690
 Peter and like Peter and hodei as 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:36.310
 they are starting in this triathlon 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.530
 I think it's going to be a very good occasion 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.400
 to show you how you have to put 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.280
 a neoprene to prevent this from happening 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.430
 these are pinches here you have the 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.650
 pinch if we repair it on time it's not going 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.150
 to spend nothing if we do not repair it this 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.729
 new brake then we're going to have to 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.250
 throw it out soon so in the next 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:00.099
 I'm going to show you how to put a video 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.440
 neoprene and how to repair neoprene and 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:04.539
 with this the video of today and the video that 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.430
 I'm going to do soon you already have a 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:08.740
 master and you know how you have to 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.500
 take care of your good neoprene guys 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.569
 Now you only need to train you 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.000
 I highly recommend training in the sea 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.469
 It is very good to make a pool for 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.289
 do technique but we need to win 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:22.180
 water safety in the sea does not have 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.979
 nothing to do swim in the pool that 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.390
 the sea and the day of competition many 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.700
 Sometimes we go with 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.580
 of hours of swimming in the sea so 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.610
 apart from everything try to swim in the sea 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:36.580
 feel free is a brutal sensation 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.320
 and always be accompanied and in the 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.600
 description I will also leave you a 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.950
 video that I made of tips like to 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.380
 swim in the sea that you also have to 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.240
 keep in mind what I always say to 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:50.040
 enjoy that are two days and see you 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.040
 in the next video a kiss
