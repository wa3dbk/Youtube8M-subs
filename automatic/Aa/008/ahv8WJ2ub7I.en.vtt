00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
off the ledge because you'll fall and

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.030 
off the ledge because you'll fall and

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
bottom of the map we couldn't really

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.039 
bottom of the map we couldn't really
tell<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.670> was<00:01:26.700> looking<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.570> little<00:01:27.689> closer

what<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.360> think<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.720> was<00:01:51.869> maybe<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.320> guys

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
what you think it was maybe you guys

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.950 
what you think it was maybe you guys
could<00:01:52.710> zoom<00:01:52.979> in<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.310> some<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:54.420> we<00:01:54.450> really

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
could zoom in on it some but we really

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.170 
could zoom in on it some but we really
had<00:01:55.170> no<00:01:55.409> idea<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:56.369> was<00:01:56.520> kind<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.759> cool<00:01:56.969> too

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
had no idea it was kind of cool too

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.399 
had no idea it was kind of cool too
because<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.509> were<00:01:57.570> shooting<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:58.079> grenades

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
because we were shooting like grenades

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.929 
because we were shooting like grenades
down<00:01:58.829> on<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.490> grenades<00:01:59.790> would

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
down on to it the grenades would

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.459 
down on to it the grenades would
actually<00:02:00.240> go<00:02:00.360> all<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.689> way<00:02:00.719> down<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.350> and

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
actually go all the way down to it and

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.319 
actually go all the way down to it and
explode<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.460> I'm<00:02:02.579> also<00:02:02.759> going<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.060> show<00:02:03.270> you

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
explode but I'm also going to show you

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.090 
explode but I'm also going to show you
an<00:02:03.509> easy<00:02:03.689> way<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.960> get<00:02:04.170> outside<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.829> level

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
an easy way to get outside the level

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.160 
an easy way to get outside the level
beyond<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.579> fence<00:02:05.820> now<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.600> wall<00:02:06.930> breach

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
beyond the fence now the wall breach

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.229 
beyond the fence now the wall breach
itself<00:02:07.829> can<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.099> done<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.520> multiplayer<00:02:08.970> but

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
itself can be done in multiplayer but

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.580 
itself can be done in multiplayer but
this<00:02:09.450> part<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.899> glitch<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.259> have<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.500> be
