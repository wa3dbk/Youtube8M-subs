00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
lot cheaper to buy than buying the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.900 
lot cheaper to buy than buying the
ready-made<00:00:46.559> concentrate<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.430> literally

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
ready-made concentrate it's literally

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.760 
ready-made concentrate it's literally
half<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.420> price<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.260> we're<00:00:49.410> just<00:00:49.440> going<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
half the price so we're just going to

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.069 
half the price so we're just going to
open<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.190> up<00:00:50.420> and<00:00:51.420> you're<00:00:51.750> going<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:51.989> be

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
open this up and you're going to be

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.660 
open this up and you're going to be
using<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.469> pressure<00:00:52.680> cooker<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.489> make

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
using the pressure cooker just to make

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.220 
using the pressure cooker just to make
speed<00:00:54.059> things<00:00:54.300> up<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.570> little<00:00:54.690> bit<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.110> of

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
speed things up a little bit but of

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.470 
speed things up a little bit but of
course<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.800> do<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> stove<00:00:56.480> but

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
course you can do it on the stove but

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.849 
course you can do it on the stove but
it'll<00:00:57.719> take<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> little<00:00:58.050> longer<00:00:58.350> time<00:00:58.680> but

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
it'll take a little longer time but

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.189 
it'll take a little longer time but
that's<00:00:59.010> okay<00:00:59.370> it's<00:00:59.520> possible<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.210> usually

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
that's okay it's possible and usually

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.979 
that's okay it's possible and usually
it's<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> solid<00:01:01.739> block<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.840> break<00:01:03.840> it

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
it's a solid block so just break it

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.299 
it's a solid block so just break it
apart<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.680> want<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.890> break<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.189> into

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
apart and you want to break it into

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.640 
apart and you want to break it into
small<00:01:05.640> small<00:01:05.760> chunks<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:09.290> this<00:01:10.290> one<00:01:10.470> does

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
small small chunks and this one does

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.510 
small small chunks and this one does
have<00:01:10.680> seeds<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.640> has<00:01:11.820> fiber<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.860> you

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
have seeds that it has fiber so but you

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.490 
have seeds that it has fiber so but you
know<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.790> way<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:14.970> do<00:01:15.180> get<00:01:15.390> tamarind<00:01:15.930> without

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
know the way you do get tamarind without

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.320 
know the way you do get tamarind without
seeds<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.040> fiber<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.580> that's<00:01:17.850> what's<00:01:18.030> okay

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
seeds and fiber so that's what's okay

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.730 
seeds and fiber so that's what's okay
there<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.750> go<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.110> we're<00:01:19.229> going<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.409> put<00:01:19.530> two

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
there you go and we're going to put two

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.039 
there you go and we're going to put two
cups<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.130> water<00:01:20.310> into<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:23.780> so<00:01:24.780> we're<00:01:24.869> going<00:01:24.960> to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
cups of water into it so we're going to

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.480 
cups of water into it so we're going to
close<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.680> are<00:01:25.830> going<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.040> allow<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.310> to

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
close it and we are going to allow it to

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.490 
close it and we are going to allow it to
whistle<00:01:26.880> three<00:01:27.180> times<00:01:27.420> these<00:01:27.869> really<00:01:28.350> want

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
whistle three times these really want

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.679 
whistle three times these really want
this<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:29.159> tamarind<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.610> become<00:01:29.850> really<00:01:30.329> soft

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
this the tamarind to become really soft

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.870 
this the tamarind to become really soft
and<00:01:30.960> nice<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.439> then<00:01:31.920> turn<00:01:32.189> off<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> stove<00:01:32.640> and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
and nice and then turn off the stove and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.520 
and nice and then turn off the stove and
allow<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.270> pressure<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.780> go<00:01:33.900> down<00:01:34.049> by<00:01:34.259> itself

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
allow the pressure to go down by itself

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.560 
allow the pressure to go down by itself
so<00:01:35.250> our<00:01:35.310> pressure<00:01:35.490> cooker<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.939> off<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.360> stove

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
so our pressure cooker is off the stove

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.899 
so our pressure cooker is off the stove
and<00:01:36.810> all<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.049> pressure<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.409> gone<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.880> it<00:01:38.880> is

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
and all the pressure is gone and it is

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.200 
and all the pressure is gone and it is
safe<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.180> open<00:01:40.790> whew

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
safe to open whew

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.480 
safe to open whew
it's<00:01:43.200> nice<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.619> cooked<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.280> we're<00:01:44.399> just

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
it's nice and cooked and we're just

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.090 
it's nice and cooked and we're just
going<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.759> take<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.229> little<00:01:46.229> playdough<00:01:46.590> masher

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
going to take a little playdough masher

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.819 
going to take a little playdough masher
and<00:01:47.369> just<00:01:47.729> again<00:01:48.689> loosen<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.259> up<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.470> little<00:01:49.590> bit

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
and just again loosen it up a little bit

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.469 
and just again loosen it up a little bit
so<00:01:50.189> potato<00:01:50.460> masher<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> great<00:01:51.180> way<00:01:51.420> to

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
so potato masher is a great way to

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.270 
so potato masher is a great way to
loosen<00:01:51.960> all<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.200> pulp<00:01:52.560> that's<00:01:52.890> around<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
loosen all the pulp that's around the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.280 
loosen all the pulp that's around the
tamron<00:01:53.670> without<00:01:54.240> having<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.600> use<00:01:54.750> your<00:01:54.780> hands

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
tamron without having to use your hands

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.020 
tamron without having to use your hands
of<00:01:55.439> course<00:01:56.009> we<00:01:56.130> do<00:01:56.280> use<00:01:56.460> your<00:01:56.610> hands<00:01:56.880> at<00:01:57.000> some

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
of course we do use your hands at some

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.940 
of course we do use your hands at some
point<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.600> time<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:58.200> really<00:01:58.290> hot<00:01:58.799> right

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
point in time but it's really hot right

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.580 
point in time but it's really hot right
now<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.000> good<00:02:00.329> way<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.450> do<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.659> get<00:02:01.500> it

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
now so this is good way to do it get it

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.950 
now so this is good way to do it get it
done<00:02:01.710> quickly<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:03.450> what<00:02:03.570> you're<00:02:03.659> going<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.810> do

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
done quickly so what you're going to do

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.870 
done quickly so what you're going to do
is<00:02:04.049> we've<00:02:04.229> got<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> colander<00:02:04.740> over<00:02:04.890> here<00:02:05.399> and

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
is we've got a colander over here and

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.910 
is we've got a colander over here and
we're<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.210> using<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.600> bowl<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.200> you're<00:02:07.799> going

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
we're just using a bowl and you're going

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.469 
we're just using a bowl and you're going
to<00:02:07.950> just<00:02:08.129> transfer<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:08.849> here

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
to just transfer this here

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.410 
to just transfer this here
just<00:02:09.780> allow<00:02:09.990> you<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.200> strain<00:02:11.090> so<00:02:12.090> basically

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
just allow you to strain so basically

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.110 
just allow you to strain so basically
you<00:02:12.569> want<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.840> fiber<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.730> seeds<00:02:14.730> out<00:02:14.970> of

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
you want the fiber and the seeds out of

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.400 
you want the fiber and the seeds out of
there<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.480> if<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.780> need<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:16.080> we<00:02:16.260> have<00:02:16.380> a

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
little bit of cold water here we can

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.970 
little bit of cold water here we can
kind<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.810> use<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.200> clean<00:02:19.410> up<00:02:19.590> our<00:02:19.739> pressure

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
kind of use it to clean up our pressure

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.460 
kind of use it to clean up our pressure

to allow the pulp to just flow through a

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.160 
to allow the pulp to just flow through a
little<00:02:28.050> bit<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.730> help<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.850> along<00:02:30.020> you<00:02:31.020> can

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
back again it goes in our strainer and

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.050 
back again it goes in our strainer and
this<00:03:25.380> time<00:03:25.530> I'm<00:03:25.620> going<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:25.829> use<00:03:25.920> my<00:03:26.040> hands<00:03:26.400> it's

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
a little better and here it is I've

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.220 
a little better and here it is I've
squeezed<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.350> daylights<00:03:34.739> out<00:03:34.950> of<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:36.230> so

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
you're going to just put this away this

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.180 
you're going to just put this away this
is<00:03:38.760> now<00:03:38.940> trash<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:40.109> you<00:03:40.380> know<00:03:40.590> that<00:03:40.829> all<00:03:41.010> the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
is now trash and you know that all the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.819 
is now trash and you know that all the
pulp<00:03:41.370> is<00:03:41.519> gone<00:03:41.700> because<00:03:42.150> while<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:43.200> know<00:03:43.680> Joe

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
pulp is gone because while I know Joe

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.259 
pulp is gone because while I know Joe
was<00:03:43.950> squeezing<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:44.579> if<00:03:44.820> you<00:03:44.940> looked<00:03:45.120> at

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
was squeezing it and if you looked at

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.880 
was squeezing it and if you looked at
the<00:03:45.420> water<00:03:45.630> coming<00:03:45.930> down<00:03:46.049> it<00:03:46.470> was<00:03:46.560> like<00:03:46.590> really

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
the water coming down it was like really

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.740 
the water coming down it was like really
clear<00:03:47.310> liquid<00:03:47.670> coming<00:03:47.850> out<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:48.269> all<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.570> plug

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
clear liquid coming out so all the plug

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.050 
clear liquid coming out so all the plug
is<00:03:48.989> gone<00:03:49.260> out<00:03:49.410> of<00:03:49.500> there<00:03:49.790> so<00:03:50.790> you're<00:03:50.880> going<00:03:51.000> to

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
is gone out of there so you're going to

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.720 
is gone out of there so you're going to
use<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.329> same<00:03:51.600> pressure<00:03:52.170> cooker<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.799> I'm

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
use the same pressure cooker and I'm

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.370 
use the same pressure cooker and I'm
going<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:53.940> transfer<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.510> pulp<00:03:54.750> back<00:03:55.049> in<00:03:55.260> here

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
going to transfer the pulp back in here

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.360 
going to transfer the pulp back in here
now<00:03:58.380> there's<00:03:58.560> no<00:03:58.680> reason<00:03:58.950> why<00:03:59.100> we're<00:03:59.280> doing

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
now there's no reason why we're doing

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.120 
now there's no reason why we're doing
this<00:03:59.579> one<00:03:59.880> is<00:04:00.090> because<00:04:00.870> we<00:04:01.019> added<00:04:01.260> extra<00:04:01.950> water

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
this one is because we added extra water

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.880 
this one is because we added extra water
to<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:02.579> and<00:04:02.910> you<00:04:03.720> want<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:04.109> to<00:04:04.230> boil<00:04:04.440> you<00:04:04.680> want

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
to it and you want it to boil you want

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.370 
to it and you want it to boil you want
to<00:04:04.980> keep<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.280> tamarind<00:04:06.019> you<00:04:07.019> know<00:04:07.109> for<00:04:07.350> a

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
to keep the tamarind you know for a

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.470 
to keep the tamarind you know for a
while<00:04:07.650> so<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.340> don't<00:04:08.549> want<00:04:08.700> any<00:04:08.910> kind<00:04:09.389> of

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
while so you don't want any kind of

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.590 
while so you don't want any kind of
bacteria<00:04:10.440> or<00:04:10.500> germs<00:04:10.829> and<00:04:11.340> all<00:04:11.459> going<00:04:12.269> into<00:04:12.389> it

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
bacteria or germs and all going into it

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.319 
bacteria or germs and all going into it
and<00:04:12.780> you<00:04:12.840> want<00:04:12.989> it<00:04:13.109> to<00:04:13.230> cook<00:04:13.350> well<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:14.329> the

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
and you want it to cook well and the

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:16.460 
and you want it to cook well and the
other<00:04:15.450> reason<00:04:15.840> is<00:04:15.959> we<00:04:16.139> used

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
other reason is we used

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.340 
other reason is we used
hands<00:04:16.709> so<00:04:17.549> again<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:18.090> want<00:04:18.390> to<00:04:18.450> keep<00:04:18.690> it<00:04:18.989> safe

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
hands so again you want to keep it safe

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.740 
hands so again you want to keep it safe
and<00:04:19.650> you<00:04:19.739> make<00:04:19.890> sure<00:04:20.010> it<00:04:20.100> boils<00:04:20.430> well<00:04:20.640> and<00:04:20.880> also

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
and you make sure it boils well and also

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.590 
and you make sure it boils well and also
reduce<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.620> amount<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:24.090> that<00:04:24.120> way<00:04:24.420> it's

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
reduce the amount so that way it's

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.660 
reduce the amount so that way it's
easier<00:04:25.140> to<00:04:25.290> keep<00:04:25.470> mind<00:04:25.890> and<00:04:26.160> it's

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
easier to keep mind and it's

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.850 
easier to keep mind and it's
concentrated<00:04:27.090> rate<00:04:27.540> with<00:04:27.690> yes<00:04:27.870> so<00:04:28.530> back<00:04:28.710> on

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
concentrated rate with yes so back on

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.990 
concentrated rate with yes so back on
the<00:04:28.890> stove<00:04:29.190> and<00:04:29.400> we're<00:04:29.580> just<00:04:29.640> going<00:04:29.850> to<00:04:29.910> allow

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
the stove and we're just going to allow

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.320 
the stove and we're just going to allow
it<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.270> boil<00:04:30.950> so<00:04:31.950> here's<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.460> paste<00:04:32.820> or<00:04:33.210> the

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
it to boil so here's the paste or the

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.330 
it to boil so here's the paste or the
concentrate<00:04:33.930> and<00:04:34.170> once<00:04:34.740> it<00:04:34.830> came<00:04:34.980> to<00:04:35.130> a<00:04:35.160> boil

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
concentrate and once it came to a boil

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.490 
concentrate and once it came to a boil
we<00:04:35.610> allowed<00:04:35.820> it<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:36.090> boil<00:04:36.270> for<00:04:36.300> just<00:04:36.720> one<00:04:37.080> more

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
we allowed it to boil for just one more

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.320 
we allowed it to boil for just one more
minute<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:38.100> we're<00:04:38.760> going<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:38.910> turn<00:04:39.060> off<00:04:39.210> the

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
minute and we're going to turn off the

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.180 
minute and we're going to turn off the
stove<00:04:39.540> and<00:04:40.400> allow<00:04:41.400> it<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:41.640> cool<00:04:41.790> down<00:04:42.000> now<00:04:43.190> so

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
stove and allow it to cool down now so

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.400 
stove and allow it to cool down now so
here's<00:04:44.430> our<00:04:44.580> equipped<00:04:44.910> tamarind<00:04:45.510> pulp<00:04:45.780> and

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
here's our equipped tamarind pulp and

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.670 
here's our equipped tamarind pulp and
you<00:04:47.130> can<00:04:47.310> actually<00:04:47.490> cook<00:04:48.180> it<00:04:48.360> further<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:49.110> you

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
you can actually cook it further and you

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.650 
you can actually cook it further and you
know<00:04:49.770> keep<00:04:50.010> letting<00:04:50.490> it<00:04:50.640> cook<00:04:50.940> and<00:04:51.180> cook<00:04:51.330> until

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
know keep letting it cook and cook until

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.390 
know keep letting it cook and cook until
it<00:04:51.750> reduces<00:04:52.230> further<00:04:52.470> and<00:04:52.890> then<00:04:53.100> you'll<00:04:53.250> get

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
it reduces further and then you'll get

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.850 
it reduces further and then you'll get
the<00:04:53.550> actual<00:04:53.730> tamarind<00:04:54.360> concentrate<00:04:54.660> but<00:04:55.650> one

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
the actual tamarind concentrate but one

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.500 
the actual tamarind concentrate but one
thing<00:04:56.010> that<00:04:56.040> we<00:04:56.220> found<00:04:56.430> over<00:04:56.760> time<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.360> we

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
bought those jars of tamarind

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.380

you can take some and it mixes in with
your<00:05:13.440> food<00:05:13.530> really<00:05:13.770> well<00:05:13.980> so<00:05:14.250> that's<00:05:14.400> one

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
your food really well so that's one

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.040 
your food really well so that's one
benefit<00:05:14.880> of<00:05:14.910> keeping<00:05:15.270> it<00:05:15.360> this<00:05:15.480> consistency

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
benefit of keeping it this consistency

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.360 
benefit of keeping it this consistency
but<00:05:16.290> if<00:05:16.380> you<00:05:16.470> want<00:05:16.650> to<00:05:16.740> go<00:05:16.800> further<00:05:17.040> then

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
but if you want to go further then

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.580 
but if you want to go further then
that's<00:05:17.550> absolutely<00:05:17.880> fine<00:05:18.300> too<00:05:18.570> so<00:05:18.840> what<00:05:19.500> you

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
that's absolutely fine too so what you

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.510 
that's absolutely fine too so what you
going<00:05:19.680> to<00:05:19.740> do<00:05:19.860> is<00:05:20.010> we're<00:05:20.130> going<00:05:20.160> to<00:05:20.280> allow<00:05:20.460> it

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
going to do is we're going to allow it

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.370 
going to do is we're going to allow it
to<00:05:20.580> cool<00:05:20.880> down<00:05:20.910> absolutely<00:05:21.600> and<00:05:22.050> then<00:05:22.140> you<00:05:22.230> can

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
to cool down absolutely and then you can

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.270 
to cool down absolutely and then you can
just<00:05:22.590> put<00:05:22.710> it<00:05:22.800> in<00:05:22.860> a<00:05:22.980> jar<00:05:23.250> or<00:05:24.000> a<00:05:24.060> container<00:05:24.540> and

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
just put it in a jar or a container and

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.820 
just put it in a jar or a container and
you<00:05:26.280> can<00:05:26.310> keep<00:05:26.640> it<00:05:26.760> in<00:05:26.820> the<00:05:26.940> refrigerator<00:05:27.830> and

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
you can keep it in the refrigerator and

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.310 
you can keep it in the refrigerator and
or<00:05:29.310> you<00:05:29.490> can<00:05:29.669> even<00:05:29.790> freeze<00:05:30.150> it<00:05:30.450> the<00:05:30.930> tamron

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
or you can even freeze it the tamron

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.960 
or you can even freeze it the tamron
does<00:05:31.440> not<00:05:31.650> freeze<00:05:31.979> so<00:05:32.190> that's<00:05:32.400> the<00:05:32.550> advantage

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
does not freeze so that's the advantage

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.670 
does not freeze so that's the advantage
and<00:05:33.120> you<00:05:33.180> put<00:05:33.330> it<00:05:33.419> in<00:05:33.510> the<00:05:33.600> freezer<00:05:33.810> you<00:05:34.200> just

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
and you put it in the freezer you just

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.920 
and you put it in the freezer you just
pull<00:05:34.830> it<00:05:34.919> out<00:05:35.040> still<00:05:35.640> workable<00:05:36.300> you<00:05:36.750> don't

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
pull it out still workable you don't

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.180 
pull it out still workable you don't
have<00:05:37.050> to<00:05:37.140> worry<00:05:37.229> about<00:05:37.320> it<00:05:37.560> but<00:05:37.680> a<00:05:37.890> lot<00:05:38.100> of

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
have to worry about it but a lot of

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.520 
have to worry about it but a lot of
times<00:05:38.340> you<00:05:38.460> have<00:05:38.640> issues<00:05:39.419> with<00:05:39.630> our<00:05:39.660> fridge

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
times you have issues with our fridge

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.409 
times you have issues with our fridge
space<00:05:40.740> so<00:05:41.460> you<00:05:41.520> could<00:05:41.910> put<00:05:42.030> it<00:05:42.090> in<00:05:42.180> the<00:05:42.240> freezer

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
space so you could put it in the freezer

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.330 
space so you could put it in the freezer
so<00:05:42.900> that's<00:05:43.620> one<00:05:43.830> thing<00:05:44.040> and<00:05:44.190> the<00:05:44.310> other

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
so that's one thing and the other

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.300 
so that's one thing and the other
advantage<00:05:45.000> of<00:05:45.120> doing<00:05:45.450> this<00:05:45.600> is<00:05:46.020> that<00:05:46.320> the

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
advantage of doing this is that the

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.430 
advantage of doing this is that the
calendars<00:05:47.760> already<00:05:48.030> cooked<00:05:48.300> so<00:05:48.540> the<00:05:49.169> raw

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
calendars already cooked so the raw

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.650 
calendars already cooked so the raw
smell<00:05:49.919> is<00:05:50.160> gone<00:05:50.490> so<00:05:51.000> you<00:05:51.060> don't<00:05:51.360> have<00:05:51.419> to<00:05:51.540> cook

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
smell is gone so you don't have to cook

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.180 
smell is gone so you don't have to cook
it<00:05:51.810> as<00:05:51.930> much<00:05:52.169> when<00:05:52.440> you<00:05:52.530> cook<00:05:52.740> in<00:05:52.860> your<00:05:52.979> clothes

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
it as much when you cook in your clothes

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.850 
it as much when you cook in your clothes
that's<00:05:53.970> it's<00:05:54.419> a<00:05:54.479> great<00:05:54.720> you<00:05:55.080> know<00:05:55.200> time<00:05:55.590> saver
