00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 he 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.170
 with the completely new 308 second 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.210
 generation 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.950
 that peugeot uses that name put it 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.570
 notice big steps and those steps 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.980
 are put on, among other things 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.599
 weight saving 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.189
 by using a new one 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.770
 bottom group 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.680
 and in addition new engines and such 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.150
 308 with this new engine we are now driving 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.570
 and we are immediately dealing with the 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.040
 second body variant, the 308 sw 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.660
 per so says the letters are not before 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.330
 station wagon, but that's it 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.700
 of course a version that in 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.829
 the netherlands very popular middle class 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.230
 station wagon become very businesslike 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.890
 driven are typical lease cars and 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.510
 hence that Peugeot with this 308 sw 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.129
 especially going to score so because there 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.020
 a diesel version is with 14 percent 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.210
 addition 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.789
 and you will not be surprised 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.309
 we are therefore not driving in preparation 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.500
 namely with the new 1.2 liter 3 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.550
 cylinder turbo and that returns Peugeot 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.130
 the 3 times 8 immediately with 110 and 130 hp and 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.080
 therefore the less power is 1.6 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.590
 liters in the program now 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.590
 deleted 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.720
 No 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.650
 the combination of such a lightweight 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.760
 bodywork and relatively modest 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.680
 engine 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.750
 that naturally yields enormous benefits 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.980
 on fuel consumption 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.050
 and that is why we are not surprised 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.060
 that this car settle for the 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.310
 about one liter every 15 km 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.619
 in addition, turbo engine is now fairly smooth 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.119
 in 10 seconds it goes to 100 and 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.680
 also true top speed 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.020
 there are no complaints the engine is 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.950
 naturally coupled with a smooth 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.289
 switching six-speed 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.790
 and that is another component 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.480
 contributes to reducing the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.480
 fuel for her 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.190
 with watch this fashion become that 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.080
 new middle class station wagon 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.990
 stand out from each other with regard to 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.510
 the contents of the luggage compartment 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.700
 Peugeot is not quite at the top 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.600
 but that is just below with a volume 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.150
 that varies from 610 to no less than 16 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.260
 160 liters and that is just huge there 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.260
 you as a family 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.520
 at the same time it is striking that that car with 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.730
 a length of less than 4 meters 60 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.470
 is not huge but by its what 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.880
 lower roof compared to the previous one 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.620
 generation 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.450
 that car looks very elegant and 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.770
 I even dare to say that the nicer 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.770
 is then the 508 sw 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.930
 the interior yes that of course 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.940
 about a year ago at our 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.840
 first introduction to the 308 up 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.910
 viewed 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.770
 Peugeot has made it into a sport 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.590
 because the handlebars are as small as possible 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.570
 make use of dashboard instruments 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.670
 place height so that you can handle it 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.970
 on tachometer and speedometer 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.300
 looks that requires some adjustments 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.080
 but you get used to it fairly quickly 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.210
 controls there had the Peugeot 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.640
 used to be enough of those 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.290
 all on the central screen and 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.520
 therefore it is very quiet 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.520
 interior has become pleasant 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.989
 I 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.410
 space for luggage that we said 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.169
 he has 308 sw sufficient for that 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.030
 passengers also have enough space 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.100
 seats are excellent are good 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.840
 conceivable so in that respect fine 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.430
 for each other at peugeot 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.889
 comfort of that car is also complete 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.410
 matching the backseat time 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.330
 legroom good headroom especially with 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.669
 these verses with a glass roof 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.790
 who doesn't quite like that is 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.790
 Unfortunately 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:59.270
 on the whole, that is 308 sw 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.640
 a nice looking car that is nice and 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.250
 drives comfortably on a modern French 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.840
 way that an economical gasoline engine 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.300
 you also qualify 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.340
 for a 20% addition 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.250
 and that for that business market too 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.590
 is available with a 14% diesel and 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.670
 then for prices that are just competitive 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.930
 are from the market 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.180
 yes then we can of course 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.990
 easily predict that we will use that 308 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.580
 sw 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.090
 lots of cars on the dutch roads 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.090
 go see 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.070
 No
