00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.260
 cup 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.410
 the pursuit 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.410
 frisia away 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.359

 he clearly stands in the way 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.470
 so you have to wait for new projects 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.690
 and that campsite 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.090

 the woman became known as a result of which an official report was filed 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.060
