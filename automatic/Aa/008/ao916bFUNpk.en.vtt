she was so so present so there and she
was<00:00:07.649> almost<00:00:07.890> vibrating<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:08.820> mean<00:00:08.940> it<00:00:09.030> was<00:00:09.150> that

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
was almost vibrating I mean it was that

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.390 
was almost vibrating I mean it was that
she<00:00:09.690> wasn't<00:00:09.929> vibrating<00:00:10.769> but<00:00:10.920> it<00:00:11.010> was<00:00:11.160> almost

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
she wasn't vibrating but it was almost

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.610 
she wasn't vibrating but it was almost
as<00:00:11.670> seemed<00:00:12.059> as<00:00:12.240> if<00:00:12.360> she<00:00:12.450> was<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:12.929> she<00:00:13.290> kind<00:00:13.530> of

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
as seemed as if she was and she kind of

as seemed as if she was and she kind of
I<00:00:13.740> felt<00:00:13.920> as<00:00:14.130> if<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.400> when<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.759> got<00:00:15.000> close<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.420> her

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
I felt as if I when I got close to her

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
sucked right into her world and she did

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.150 
sucked right into her world and she did
this<00:00:21.390> by<00:00:21.779> finding<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.890> way<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.310> be<00:00:23.789> vulnerable

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160

almost<00:00:27.109> empty<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.260> body<00:00:28.500> said<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.390> it<00:00:30.390> was

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
almost empty the body said that it was

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.380 
almost empty the body said that it was
possible<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.109> pull<00:00:31.410> somebody<00:00:32.059> in<00:00:33.059> with<00:00:33.420> you

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390

she was the one that moved you to move
that<00:00:38.160> way<00:00:38.430> because<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.510> weren't

that way because you weren't

herself and in people you pull up so

herself and in people you pull up so
high<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.329> center<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.899> when<00:01:04.379> there<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.589> no

more<00:01:06.000> lift<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:07.200> go<00:01:07.409> off<00:01:07.650> into<00:01:08.040> space<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
more lift you go off into space on the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.530 
more lift you go off into space on the
side<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:11.159> as<00:01:11.340> though<00:01:11.610> you're<00:01:12.510> being

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
side and it's as though you're being

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.060 
side and it's as though you're being
pulled<00:01:13.409> into<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.549> air<00:01:14.960> it's<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.110> balance<00:01:16.500> with

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
pulled into the air it's a balance with

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.740 
pulled into the air it's a balance with
movement<00:01:17.610> with<00:01:17.759> movement<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.360> then<00:01:18.630> you

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
movement with movement and then you

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.899 
movement with movement and then you
would<00:01:18.930> catch<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.500> tilt<00:01:19.799> into<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.189> contraction

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
would catch that tilt into a contraction

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.719 
would catch that tilt into a contraction
that<00:01:21.119> yes<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.900> needed<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.500> stretch<00:01:22.950> so

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
that yes and you needed that stretch so

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.980 
that yes and you needed that stretch so
that<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.150> contraction<00:01:24.930> gave<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.990> dark

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
that the contraction gave it the dark

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.270 
that the contraction gave it the dark
pull<00:01:28.579> the<00:01:29.579> opposite

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
pull the opposite

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.550 
pull the opposite
it<00:01:32.150> was<00:01:32.270> very<00:01:32.390> interesting<00:01:32.780> that<00:01:32.990> some<00:01:33.260> people

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
it was very interesting that some people

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.490 
it was very interesting that some people
had<00:01:33.710> been<00:01:33.860> tired<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:34.490> nuts<00:01:35.260> and<00:01:36.260> we're<00:01:36.470> very

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
had been tired and nuts and we're very

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.609 
had been tired and nuts and we're very
embarrassed<00:01:37.250> by<00:01:37.310> anything<00:01:37.700> they<00:01:37.909> had<00:01:38.090> to<00:01:38.240> do

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
embarrassed by anything they had to do

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.789 
embarrassed by anything they had to do
physically<00:01:39.619> person<00:01:40.520> really<00:01:40.759> emerged<00:01:41.799> through

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
physically person really emerged through

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.350 
physically person really emerged through
the<00:01:42.860> movement<00:01:43.310> she<00:01:43.790> used<00:01:43.909> to<00:01:43.970> do<00:01:44.150> that

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
the movement she used to do that

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.980 
the movement she used to do that
Julliard<00:01:44.900> a<00:01:45.110> lot<00:01:45.680> anyway<00:01:46.750> when<00:01:47.750> she<00:01:47.780> would

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
Julliard a lot anyway when she would

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.609 
Julliard a lot anyway when she would
have<00:01:48.200> people<00:01:48.440> say<00:01:49.119> one<00:01:50.119> and<00:01:50.899> it<00:01:51.170> wasn't<00:01:51.350> from<00:01:51.530> a

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
have people say one and it wasn't from a

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.139 
have people say one and it wasn't from a
deep<00:01:51.860> enough<00:01:52.159> place<00:01:52.430> you<00:01:52.610> know<00:01:52.759> it<00:01:52.820> would<00:01:53.000> be

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
deep enough place you know it would be

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.870 
deep enough place you know it would be
too<00:01:53.360> much<00:01:53.540> one<00:01:54.290> up<00:01:54.619> here<00:01:54.920> then<00:01:55.159> finally<00:01:55.820> it

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
too much one up here then finally it

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.190 
too much one up here then finally it
would<00:01:55.970> get<00:01:56.149> deeper<00:01:56.570> and<00:01:56.600> deeper<00:01:56.720> from

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
would get deeper and deeper from

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.249 
would get deeper and deeper from
underneath<00:01:57.500> him<00:01:57.860> a<00:01:58.040> real<00:01:58.369> one<00:01:59.000> you<00:01:59.899> know<00:02:00.049> which

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
underneath him a real one you know which

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.990 
underneath him a real one you know which
and<00:02:00.619> that's<00:02:00.920> just<00:02:01.130> yeah<00:02:01.490> made<00:02:01.970> the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
and that's just yeah made the

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.230 
and that's just yeah made the
contraction<00:02:02.690> via<00:02:02.840> exhale<00:02:03.500> right<00:02:04.240> the

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
contraction via exhale right the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.060 
contraction via exhale right the
important<00:02:05.630> thing<00:02:05.810> is<00:02:05.929> to<00:02:05.960> put<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.530> brakes<00:02:06.800> on

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
important thing is to put the brakes on

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.710 
important thing is to put the brakes on
as<00:02:07.310> you<00:02:07.429> come<00:02:07.670> around<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.119> front<00:02:08.209> and

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
as you come around to the front and

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.790 
as you come around to the front and
whether<00:02:08.959> it's<00:02:09.140> a<00:02:09.229> fist<00:02:09.619> or<00:02:10.870> evoking<00:02:11.870> spewing

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
whether it's a fist or evoking spewing

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.479 
whether it's a fist or evoking spewing
forth

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
forth

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.059 
forth
it's<00:02:14.120> almost<00:02:14.300> speaking<00:02:14.930> in<00:02:15.080> tongues<00:02:15.380> by<00:02:15.860> now

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
it's almost speaking in tongues by now

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.690 
it's almost speaking in tongues by now

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
stop the contraction to the front each

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.430 
stop the contraction to the front each
time<00:02:24.220> as<00:02:25.220> she<00:02:25.519> comes<00:02:25.819> in<00:02:26.120> before<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:27.050> duet<00:02:27.410> and

characteristic tilt you feel free to say

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.289 
characteristic tilt you feel free to say
see<00:02:32.390> now<00:02:32.600> I<00:02:32.930> tilted<00:02:33.800> so<00:02:34.069> that<00:02:34.100> I<00:02:34.459> ended<00:02:34.970> right

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
see now I tilted so that I ended right

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.610 
see now I tilted so that I ended right
on<00:02:35.570> her<00:02:36.230> knee<00:02:37.239> so<00:02:38.239> that<00:02:38.269> there<00:02:38.540> was<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.690> contact

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
on her knee so that there was a contact

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.979 
on her knee so that there was a contact
there<00:02:39.709> rather<00:02:40.070> than<00:02:40.250> just<00:02:40.459> a<00:02:41.030> single<00:02:41.299> so<00:02:41.900> you

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
there rather than just a single so you

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.509 
there rather than just a single so you
actually<00:02:42.170> touched<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:42.950> were<00:02:43.040> in<00:02:43.130> front<00:02:43.400> of

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
actually touched and were in front of

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.880 
actually touched and were in front of
her<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:44.030> was<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.870> tilt<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.290> same<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.590> mean

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
her and was the tilt the same I mean

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.390 
her and was the tilt the same I mean
heard<00:02:46.310> it<00:02:46.489> was<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.760> torso<00:02:47.420> further<00:02:47.720> over<00:02:48.400> the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
heard it was the torso further over the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.160 
heard it was the torso further over the
torso<00:02:49.730> was<00:02:50.090> further<00:02:50.360> over<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.019> leg

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
torso was further over and the leg

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.710 
torso was further over and the leg
wasn't<00:02:51.530> quite<00:02:51.709> so<00:02:51.920> high<00:02:52.070> I<00:02:52.340> think<00:02:53.299> it's<00:02:53.600> the

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
wasn't quite so high I think it's the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.300 
wasn't quite so high I think it's the
kind<00:02:53.959> of<00:02:54.019> thing<00:02:54.290> that<00:02:54.320> if<00:02:54.560> a<00:02:54.620> dancer<00:02:54.980> gets<00:02:55.100> the

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
kind of thing that if a dancer gets the

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.860 
kind of thing that if a dancer gets the
concept<00:02:55.549> they'll<00:02:55.940> have<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.209> make<00:02:56.360> it<00:02:56.510> up<00:02:56.630> out

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
concept they'll have to make it up out

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.710 
concept they'll have to make it up out
of<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.650> same<00:02:57.920> moves<00:02:58.250> but<00:02:59.239> it<00:02:59.329> will<00:02:59.420> be<00:02:59.540> very

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
of the same moves but it will be very

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.319 
of the same moves but it will be very
personal<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.320> them<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:03.970> Martha<00:03:04.970> Graham's
