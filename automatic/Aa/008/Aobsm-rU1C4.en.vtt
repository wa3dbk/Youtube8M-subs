00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.160

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.960
 video that we are working on right now 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.039
 the forums of hello 4 looking for this type 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.039
 of code but if the first thing we're going to 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.170
 do is go to halo waypoint or before 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:37.649
 that nothing has to end the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.199
 episodes of Spartans but the code 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.659
 It's not going to work, we're just going to go 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:46.049
 to halo waypoint since we are in halo 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:49.229
 waypoint let's press x twice 

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:52.709
 here in this time to who as they are 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:55.019
 watching tighten x and here again and it's going to 

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:56.729
 come out to finish I do not know if they remember the 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.690
 video I did previously of holloway 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:02.459
 with the trick of one hundred thousand credits 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.400
 it's going to be the same thing we're going to enter 

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:06.870
 new codes but the first code that 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.200
 you are going to enter 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:13.500
 the oni 1 this is the first code that 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.710
 you are going to enter if you do not enter that code 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.050
 this one you can not redeem more codes 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.320
 I only recommend you guys to enter 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.050
 this code oni one first and already 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.820
 then they will enter these two codes 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.820
 reid in one and reid in two 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.270
 here are watching me guys enter the 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.850
 two codes of the kingdom one and the king of 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.130
 two and if we're still looking at the 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.380
 floors gel or four code 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.390
 King den's helmet still we can not 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.430
