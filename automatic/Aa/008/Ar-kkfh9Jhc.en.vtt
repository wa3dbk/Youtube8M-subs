 hello how about youtube friends like 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.440
 are you welcome to a new 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.080
 Minecraft tutorial this time 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.450
 We'll show how you can make a 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.090
 block exchanger like this that 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.250
 we have here guys let's show them 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.869
 here quickly as they can appear in 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.090
 screen we have this wall 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.239
 completely flat but if we sting 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.770
 here to the lever are exchanged for a 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.809
 block of balloons are how they can 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.809
 appreciate and if we sting you again it 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.180
 disappears that is very beautiful and what 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.610
 we can put with any block that 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.060
 can be put on a piston let's go here 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.050
 quickly to do the test 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.050
 let's go here 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:58.290
 to break this and we put a table here and 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.080
 now we will itch it is exchanged 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.310
 one another is very cool you can also 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.380
 be 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.380
 any kind of wood 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.480
 here we can also change this put 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.480
 a crystal if they want 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.630
 in short everything that grabs a piston 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.300
 sticky we can put it for 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.790
 exchange between one and another is very 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.220
 nice and it really worth and boys 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.740
 I have a news to them since many 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.170
 people have asked me to make a house 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.990
 automatic then let's make a new 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.420
 series that is going to be called building the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.030
 automatic house and it will consist of 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.670
 do brixton tutorials we are going to 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.400
 build a new house let's put 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.040
 all these circuits to make a 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.530
 automatic house when we finish the 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.150
 I'm going to share the world with you 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.070
 download it so nothing 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.020
 friends let's start quickly by 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.270
 here with the tutorial so neither more nor 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.860
 more we start well friends we're going to 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.930
 start quickly here by putting 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.640
 the two blocks that we want to be 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.010
 exchange in this case I'm going to put 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.710
 a board here and we're going to put a table 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.450
 here we will quickly break here 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.360
 and let's put it below 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:19.099
 let's put a sticky piston like that 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.680
 guys and here we are going to break 12 we put 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.379
 a point of reston and here we are going to put 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.300
 a block of rex ton well guys here 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.849
 right away we're going to put a piston 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.620
 sticky and here quickly we're going to 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:37.340
 break 12 like this and we're going to put another 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.060
 piston here guys come and we put a 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.150
 lever 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.629
 we react 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.460
 we do not activate new and they are already exchanged 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:53.040
 between one and another good 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:56.610
 now if we want to hide all this what 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.730
 What we can do is suppose that 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.000
 this is the wall 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.620
 suppose that is so 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.300
 what they can do is 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:13.230
 grab here what is mixed 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:18.390
 and put this like this 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.560
 so and so they come and here quickly 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.959
 put a lever 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.140
 and if it stings it works perfectly 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.090
 It's very simple and it's really worth it 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.790
 so nothing my friends a little 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.860
