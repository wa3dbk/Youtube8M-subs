 support roles this time mix of 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.970
 soup teams move hook max himself 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.460
 wonders how he was honored 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.820
 mvps title was not an impressive game on 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.130
 and not 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.210
 but the thrash game provided it 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.520
 not bad when 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.170
 and the status of the most valuable on the fifth 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.030

 lc100 the most anticipated match of the past 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.370
 week became team solomid standoff 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.469
 and g got no secret to anyone what 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.780
 Dyrus and his team came out victorious 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.090
 from this meeting or even will 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.739
 correctly say Bergson and he was not given 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.770
 which has become quite problematic for 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.109
 guys from villages g according to dexter 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.090
 boarding choice they olaf might 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.560
 significantly spoil life is not given and 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.150
 even provide strength g victory de phisher 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.950
 from the fact that the team is now 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.110
 finally know what you can 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.909
 contrast tranndle on top 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.040
 lines of course this is jakks 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.110
 thanks zeon sparta well for that which 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.299
 provided two victories timu mouth on 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.430
 past week american league 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.409
 I wonder if anyone will try 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.040
 European word liners use 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.320
 jax in the coming week lcs fragen 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.479
 tried to find out from the current location why 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.240
 lulu is so popular in korean 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.280
 stage yes yes there is a possibility that it is not 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.040
 Aleksich became innovator this champion 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.070
 midlane and yes he was the first to bring 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.710
 its on the European lcs but not the fact that he 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.970
 the first to unleash its potential is bad 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.950
 docks turn did not 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.689
 rant on this topic but just 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.770
 shared with a tier of champions for each 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.689
 positions characteristic of the Korean scene 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.700
 wikis are often criticized as well 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.920
 time also start to roll others 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.020
 players on the theme of addiction century to cards 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.790
 stone last week he almost 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.259
 quarreled with edward who accused 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.729
 river up is that instead of playing in 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.520
 hearthstone better time 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.610
 paid leagues now and aleksich over it 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.200
 makes a joke 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.060
 although sometimes it seems to me that this 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.360
 friendly trolling greats takes 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.860
 too close to the heart ocelot 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.080
 phenomenal example of how 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.980
 professional player league of legends can 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.750
 become a brand 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.180
 not speaking at a professional level 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.370
 not a small amount of time he reached 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.170
 marks in half a million subscribers to 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.630
 your facebook page 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.030
 he doesn't need to speak on lcs to 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.580
 He was told about him and so everyone knows 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.920
 agree miss this spanish 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.490
 a guy whose every effort is trying 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.870
 to replace 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.910
 xpeke and sarana i'm a bit sosa's buhurta 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.130
 fnatic team's last losses 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.940
 blamed for what the guys are playing through 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.700
 double ap 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.890
 according to fat laneer grandee her at the scene 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.630
 play tank against tank on top 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.300
 so-so lines 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.550
 perhaps he is right we hope that 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.100
 fnatic will start soon 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.850
 to win even using a bunch of double 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.709
 ability power champions on the last 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.500
 week, I first commented 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.600
 American l set and I will not hide a secret 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.510
 I liked him a lot more than 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.769
 European match is truly attractive 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.440
 and more dynamic 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.510
