00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.550 

his<00:01:08.060> head<00:01:08.330> will<00:01:08.600> rotate<00:01:09.080> 360<00:01:09.860> degrees<00:01:10.040> his

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
his head will rotate 360 degrees his

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.780 
his head will rotate 360 degrees his
head<00:01:12.850> moves<00:01:13.850> to<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.060> side<00:01:14.270> a<00:01:14.300> little<00:01:14.390> bit<00:01:15.790> it

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
head moves to the side a little bit it

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.290 
head moves to the side a little bit it
does<00:01:17.090> not<00:01:17.630> go<00:01:17.930> down<00:01:18.280> because<00:01:19.280> it<00:01:19.640> is<00:01:19.760> right

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
does not go down because it is right

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.330 
does not go down because it is right
there<00:01:21.760> clipping<00:01:23.229> but<00:01:24.229> it<00:01:24.350> will<00:01:24.530> go<00:01:25.040> up<00:01:25.220> a

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
there clipping but it will go up a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.440 
there clipping but it will go up a
little<00:01:25.490> bit<00:01:26.050> and<00:01:27.050> that's<00:01:28.010> pretty<00:01:28.190> much<00:01:28.280> it<00:01:28.450> so

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
little bit and that's pretty much it so

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.550 
little bit and that's pretty much it so
not<00:01:29.780> great<00:01:30.290> with<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:30.800> scarf<00:01:31.100> on<00:01:31.280> of<00:01:31.760> course

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560

you<00:01:33.560> know<00:01:33.680> with<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:33.920> scarf<00:01:34.130> off<00:01:34.420> it<00:01:35.420> would<00:01:35.570> be

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
you know with the scarf off it would be

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.609 
you know with the scarf off it would be
better<00:01:35.830> but<00:01:37.210> let's<00:01:38.210> be<00:01:38.360> honest<00:01:38.600> he<00:01:39.140> will<00:01:39.380> not

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
better but let's be honest he will not

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.480 
better but let's be honest he will not
not<00:01:40.520> have<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:40.880> scarf<00:01:41.149> huh

for<00:01:47.420> torso<00:01:47.869> articulation<00:01:49.090> my<00:01:50.090> skull<00:01:50.570> does<00:01:51.079> not

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
for torso articulation my skull does not

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.340 
for torso articulation my skull does not
really<00:01:51.649> have<00:01:52.299> much<00:01:53.299> movement<00:01:53.600> in<00:01:53.899> this<00:01:54.020> area

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
really have much movement in this area

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.800 
really have much movement in this area
because<00:01:54.470> he<00:01:54.770> is<00:01:54.860> so<00:01:55.070> tight<00:01:55.450> I'm<00:01:56.450> going<00:01:56.600> to<00:01:56.659> try

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
because he is so tight I'm going to try

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.710 
because he is so tight I'm going to try
to<00:01:56.840> get<00:01:57.140> as<00:01:57.229> much<00:01:57.350> out<00:01:57.560> of<00:01:57.619> this<00:01:57.799> as<00:01:58.009> I<00:01:58.100> can<00:01:58.720> his

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.810 
to get as much out of this as I can his
waist<00:02:00.080> can<00:02:00.380> twist<00:02:01.450> that<00:02:02.450> much<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:05.810> upper

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
waist can twist that much the upper

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:14.460 
waist can twist that much the upper
torso<00:02:07.820> a<00:02:08.830> little<00:02:09.830> bit<00:02:11.560> you<00:02:12.560> can<00:02:12.800> bend<00:02:13.760> forward

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
torso a little bit you can bend forward

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:21.610 
torso a little bit you can bend forward
that<00:02:15.470> much<00:02:15.739> and<00:02:17.739> back<00:02:18.739> that<00:02:19.580> much<00:02:20.410> so<00:02:21.410> like<00:02:21.530> I

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
that much and back that much so like I

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.240 
that much and back that much so like I
said<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:22.100> figure<00:02:22.370> is<00:02:22.549> capable<00:02:23.390> of<00:02:23.600> more<00:02:24.500> but

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
said the figure is capable of more but

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.800 
said the figure is capable of more but
mine<00:02:25.430> is<00:02:25.580> so<00:02:25.760> tight<00:02:26.060> that<00:02:26.090> I<00:02:26.330> don't<00:02:26.540> want<00:02:26.720> to

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
mine is so tight that I don't want to

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.780 
mine is so tight that I don't want to
force<00:02:27.019> it

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.580 

starting<00:02:31.790> with<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:31.970> shoulder<00:02:32.270> pad<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:33.320> can<00:02:33.500> be

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
starting with the shoulder pad it can be

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.750 
starting with the shoulder pad it can be
moved<00:02:33.800> up<00:02:34.090> like<00:02:35.090> this

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
moved up like this

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.420 
moved up like this
the<00:02:37.299> arm<00:02:37.629> can<00:02:38.319> rotate<00:02:39.420> 360<00:02:40.420> degrees<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:42.280> has

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
the arm can rotate 360 degrees it has

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.250 
the arm can rotate 360 degrees it has
that<00:02:42.700> ball<00:02:42.939> on<00:02:42.970> there<00:02:43.360> so<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.900> gets<00:02:44.019> the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
that ball on there so it gets the

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.860 
that ball on there so it gets the
circular<00:02:44.860> movement<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:47.500> arm<00:02:47.879> twist<00:02:48.879> 360

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
circular movement the arm twist 360

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.030 
circular movement the arm twist 360
degrees<00:02:50.319> below<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.549> shoulder<00:02:51.849> the<00:02:52.230> elbow<00:02:53.230> is

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
degrees below the shoulder the elbow is

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.890 
degrees below the shoulder the elbow is
double-jointed<00:02:55.829> so<00:02:56.829> he<00:02:57.099> gets<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:58.450> much<00:02:58.659> of<00:02:58.810> a

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
double-jointed so he gets that much of a

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.460 
double-jointed so he gets that much of a
bend<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:01.510> hand<00:03:01.840> can<00:03:02.049> rotate<00:03:02.409> 360<00:03:03.370> degrees<00:03:03.549> and

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
bend the hand can rotate 360 degrees and

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:11.280 
bend the hand can rotate 360 degrees and
it<00:03:05.470> can<00:03:05.799> swivel

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.550 

skull<00:03:12.099> has<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.610> type<00:03:12.969> 1<00:03:13.629> style<00:03:14.019> figure<00:03:14.409> our
