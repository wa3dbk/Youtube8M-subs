00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.620
Hey guys, i'm here with cold and so is dead in the car

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.840
we will go buy 2 monitors

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.280
Steve is sending some from Canada already

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.960
but them didnt get here yet

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.040
so we will pick up 2 that are missing to start practicing

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.150
as we have match sunday against CLG

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.880
we have to set everything up in the new gaming house

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.148
so come with us!

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.235
Here we are at BestBuy

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.408
Me cold and dead

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.072
I can tell you that the ideally for FPS games are the high frequency monitors (+hertz)

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.248
120 hz, 140hz

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.040
Those monitores are coming from Canada but arent here yet

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.360
so we gonna buy 2 way more basic today

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.920
as we dont have to buy the official ones, since ours are almost getting here

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.220
Look there, I found the monitores already

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.760
We will take this basic monitors, only to fit our needs on next days

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.860
to start practicing

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.540
as sunday we have match against CLG and also WINOUT tournament next weekend

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.740
we gotta be very prepared

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.380
basically that's it, we show you later how our gaming house will looks like!

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.280
Hey guys, I will do surgery now

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.060
i'm going to open this cyberpowerPC box

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.520
as we are going to use this on our LG practice room

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.140
we are setting everything up now, as you can see only the tables are ready for now

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.440
we already got internet, it's down there

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.820
and now we gonna put all computers and monitors

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.800
to leave everything right

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.420
so come with me, let's open it!

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.200
It has some advises from CYBERPOWER in the box

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:41.540
It's really well packed, a lot of protection to dont mess up when moving it

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.280
this is the motherboard box

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.658
it looks really nice

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.320
this is way too heavy!

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.940
Lets go

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.020
Kids, be careful with knifes.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.060
Here it is

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.880
Let's take it out the box, really well packed

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.140
Looks nice hm?  The case was prepared for LG

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.200
2 different machines came to us

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.520
one to be able to only play CS and the other to cast

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.040
so take a look on this machine, i will show the case first

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.580
it comes with a inside protection too to increase protection

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.140
and the case is all personalized, some lights will turn on, lets see how it looks like later

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.960
basically the difference between one PC and the other is the Capture Card

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.620
we will use it to catch the signal from the other pc

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.920
being able to play without feeling any difference

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.560
who ever streamed once in life knows that even if the PC's is extremely good

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.120
you kinda feel a difference when playing, with that card we wont feel anything

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.920
so that's it, lets see how it looks like after turning it all on!

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.240
It's been a while hum? Some hours to set everything down

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.200
And now it's all ready!

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.660
Come with me, i'll show you our new gaming house

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.500
Are you ready to see something from "other world"?

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.500
Looks, coldzera is here

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.544
steel is also watching a match

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.880
the CYBERPOWERPC's are settled down already

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.240
Show the nootebook we took to the bootcamp

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.240
Here is boltz's PC

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.040
Steel is staying there

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.560
FER's PC

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Mine is here too

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.440
and here is coldzera's PC

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.760
So now we all have our own computers

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.600
and besides that there are some pc's in the ground

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.700
we are waiting the last monitors

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.480
to be able to turn on the stream's pcs

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.060
and it's damn cool, you can see the personalized LG's cases

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.520
Looks pretty cool, with those white led's, right nak? Confirm please as I'm colorblind.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.160
Just to make sure

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.960
NAK: Its white, right? But maybe doesnt looks like blue? LOL

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.849
I really don't know.

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.309
Finally, looks REALLY cool, PC's are way too good!

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.000
and now we are prepared to one more gaming season

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.560
at the NA scene

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.580
Lets keep rocking!

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.080
NAK: Lets go Cold, lets show a little more from the house

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.908
coldzera: Lets go

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.286
Now I'll show the mainroom

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:27.380
we will use it to watch some matches

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.920
also to watch our own matches after we play

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.960
we can talk and discuss about things in the game

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.600
coming this way we get to the kitchen

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.040
NAK: What we have on the fridge? Let's show it

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.220
Cold: water, barbecue, pepper. (Brazilian dictate)

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.720
Well, the rooms looks a little messy

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.560
Nak: ok lets jump this part, right?

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.940
Cold: Yea, I think its better

00:06:21.371 --> 00:06:23.371
Nak: So here is where we practice

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:33.540
