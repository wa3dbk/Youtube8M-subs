00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello I am me and in this video we are going to 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.919
 see the rumba beanstalk for our 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.599
 samsung galaxy s 4 minimum I will proceed 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.730
 to turn on the cell phone so they can see 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.730
 what speed turns on this rom 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:22.240
 good this room contains the android 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.240
 4.3.1 what is living 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.100
 Y 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.040
 well I was using it is already 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.720
 practically almost a week at the moment 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.369
 I installed this room I took some 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.760
 screenshots to see 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.070
 how much storage do you have and also 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.660
 You can also prove how much is 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.120
 exactly the battery life 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.120
 completely until you can download it 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.740
 good we see that the system already lifted 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.750
 the settings 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.610
 a little application of how long 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.440
 of mold turn on almost 34 seconds 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.460
 knows what is information system 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.460
 of the cell phone as we can see android 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.460
 4.3.1 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.140
 I'm fine 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.700
 and the limit 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.010
 Well let the screenshots 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.010
 I had taken 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.640
 with these are the programs with the 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.870
 applications with which it comes by 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.890
 defect are very few like those 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:39.860
 can see and this is the amount of ram 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.860
 that the time was coming to install the moon 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.720
 this is the internal free storage 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.460
 that had the cellular moment of 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.690
 install it reduce a bit more than 2 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.090
 carry can be something pretty passable 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:00.130
 something very passable and here I have some 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:04.780
 catches of what the battery itself is 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.990
 it lasted me one day with three hours on it was 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.270
 a little more almost a day and a half I used it 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.190
 from the moment I woke up 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:17.260
 from approximately six 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:19.000
 tomorrow but a full day until almost 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.120
 at noon the next day almost a 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.220
 day and a half 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.500
 As you can see, this is a good 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.989
 small catch they say but like the 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.840
 cellular looks listening to music having 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.540
 on my social networks playing a bit of 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.390
 if he gave it a normal use and the rice 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.430
 lasted the dream gave me more than a day then 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.379
 in my opinion something very positive with 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.700
 regarding this rumba since many have 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.130
 been asking the duration of the 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.350
 batteries 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.890
 in this case half taken from the time of 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.060
 do this test 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.060
 well let's see 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.459
 how much of rne do I have now 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.730
 as you can see today practically almost and 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.090
 hoops you have to be very good there is enough 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.069
 space 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.270
 to be able to have second applications 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.380
 flat 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:15.370
 well something more of this rubÃ©n how is 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.470
 coming now has the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.250
 enabled dark option what it does 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.440
 a gesture that the cell phone makes 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.930
 attenuate a little more the dark and makes 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.400
 highlight the color the light colors do not 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.610
 it's something very nice on cell phones 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.200
 on this lot in this room, sorry and 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.900

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.910
 customization of that our panels 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.260
 our adjustment panel 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.810
 notifications buttons 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.129
 all the texts the personalization that 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.129
 we can have in these cell 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:56.500
 well something else comes with 3 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.500
 38 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:09.320

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.760
 what is the launcher polo and what is 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.340
 the default launcher of 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.410
 saying that the mod 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.959
 and if I have it, it's with the launcher, 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.050
 because it's the one I like the most but 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:26.740
 as I said it has three lounge is because 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.380
 we can choose and is 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.080
 is very passable the cell phone is like 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.199
 I said it is very stable the camera works 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.849
 ok everything is ok as the cell phone with 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.490
 regarding heating I have not had 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:41.530
 problems has not warmed me very 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.569
 exaggeratedly even though I've been 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.340
 listening to music and I'm watching my 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.199

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.030

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.979
 on routes that are improving and 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.020
 greatly improving what is the 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.370
 cell heating and also the 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.529
 battery life as I said 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.539
 lasted more than a day almost a day and a half 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:04.939
 and I can say that this rom in very state 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:07.900
 stable has worked very well I have 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:09.940
 tested with games that weigh a lot 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.740
 and they need a lot of graphics 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.570
