it<00:05:14.580> on<00:05:14.700> their<00:05:14.850> behalf<00:05:15.150> but<00:05:15.740> it<00:05:16.740> appears<00:05:17.460> like

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
it on their behalf but it appears like

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.740 
it on their behalf but it appears like
they've<00:05:18.000> changed<00:05:18.030> their<00:05:18.600> role<00:05:18.930> in<00:05:19.470> the
