green star as you can see my breville

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.180 
green star as you can see my breville
Xin<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.630> background<00:00:13.110> there<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.679> some<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.099> you

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
Xin the background there and some of you

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.589 
Xin the background there and some of you
might<00:00:14.309> be<00:00:14.370> asking<00:00:14.820> why<00:00:15.000> I'm<00:00:15.150> getting<00:00:15.299> out<00:00:15.480> the

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
might be asking why I'm getting out the

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.230 
might be asking why I'm getting out the
green<00:00:15.809> star<00:00:16.520> it<00:00:17.520> just<00:00:17.789> makes<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.090> higher

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
green star it just makes a higher

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.689 
green star it just makes a higher
quality<00:00:18.449> juice<00:00:18.990> yes<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.859> Breville<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.369> way

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
quality juice yes the Breville is way

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.910 
quality juice yes the Breville is way
quicker<00:00:21.000> but<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> centrifuge<00:00:22.590> juice

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
quicker but it is a centrifuge juice

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.029 
quicker but it is a centrifuge juice
system<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.180> Breville<00:00:25.010> oxidizes<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
system and so the Breville oxidizes the

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.410 
system and so the Breville oxidizes the
juice<00:00:26.340> more<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.760> have<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.060> drink<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.359> right

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
juice more you have to drink it right

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.660 
juice more you have to drink it right
away<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.470> don't<00:00:28.650> get<00:00:28.890> nearly<00:00:29.279> as<00:00:29.460> much

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
away and you don't get nearly as much

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.170 
away and you don't get nearly as much
juice<00:00:30.029> out<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.480> pulp<00:00:30.750> out<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.529> actual

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
juice out of the pulp out of the actual

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.340 
juice out of the pulp out of the actual
produce<00:00:33.180> itself<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.809> end<00:00:33.930> up<00:00:34.020> with<00:00:34.079> some

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
produce itself so you end up with some

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.290 
produce itself so you end up with some
moist<00:00:34.620> pulp<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:36.260> it's<00:00:37.260> not<00:00:37.500> as<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:38.090> dense<00:00:39.090> with

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
moist pulp and it's not as a dense with
