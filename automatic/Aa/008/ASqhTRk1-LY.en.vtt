profile and the biggest thing when I had
this<00:01:08.110> on<00:01:08.290> that<00:01:08.830> stuck<00:01:09.250> out<00:01:09.400> to<00:01:09.430> me<00:01:09.580> is<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.909> fit

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
this on that stuck out to me is the fit

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.420 
this on that stuck out to me is the fit
the<00:01:10.689> few<00:01:11.320> new<00:01:11.500> models<00:01:11.799> of<00:01:11.860> KBC<00:01:12.189> they've

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
changed the fit powder it's still kind

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.660 
changed the fit powder it's still kind
of<00:01:13.899> that<00:01:14.049> intermediate<00:01:14.740> oval<00:01:14.859> which<00:01:15.399> is<00:01:15.520> gonna

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
of that intermediate oval which is gonna

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.639 
of that intermediate oval which is gonna
fit<00:01:15.909> in<00:01:15.999> line<00:01:16.179> with<00:01:16.329> an<00:01:16.450> arai<00:01:16.689> or<00:01:16.749> a<00:01:16.899> showy<00:01:17.200> but

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
fit in line with an arai or a showy but

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.349 
fit in line with an arai or a showy but
what<00:01:17.740> we<00:01:17.799> found<00:01:17.979> is<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.310> fits<00:01:18.640> fits<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.179> hair

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:19.359 
what we found is it fits fits a hair

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:21.209 
what we found is it fits fits a hair
small<00:01:19.689> and<00:01:19.899> in<00:01:20.200> my<00:01:20.320> opinion<00:01:20.740> I<00:01:20.890> think<00:01:20.920> it's

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
small and in my opinion I think it's

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:22.529 
small and in my opinion I think it's
gonna<00:01:21.310> fit<00:01:21.579> along<00:01:21.909> the<00:01:22.060> lines<00:01:22.210> of<00:01:22.329> something

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
gonna fit along the lines of something

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.959 
gonna fit along the lines of something
like<00:01:22.719> a<00:01:22.780> showy<00:01:23.079> x12<00:01:23.799> which<00:01:24.159> has<00:01:24.369> a<00:01:24.399> very<00:01:24.670> dense

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
like a showy x12 which has a very dense

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:26.279 
like a showy x12 which has a very dense
cheek<00:01:25.270> pad<00:01:25.479> which<00:01:25.810> is<00:01:25.929> going<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.079> feel<00:01:26.259> very

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
cheek pad which is going to feel very

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:28.260 
cheek pad which is going to feel very
encompassing<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:27.340> even<00:01:27.819> through<00:01:27.969> the<00:01:28.030> face

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
encompassing and even through the face

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.569 
encompassing and even through the face
is<00:01:28.420> gonna<00:01:28.569> be<00:01:28.689> extremely<00:01:29.079> snug<00:01:29.679> fit<00:01:30.009> does<00:01:30.490> it

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
is gonna be extremely snug fit does it

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:31.739 
is gonna be extremely snug fit does it
mean<00:01:30.700> it's<00:01:30.850> too<00:01:30.999> tight<00:01:31.210> that<00:01:31.240> it's<00:01:31.479> going<00:01:31.689> to

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:31.749 
mean it's too tight that it's going to

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:32.730 
mean it's too tight that it's going to
hurt<00:01:31.869> I<00:01:32.020> don't<00:01:32.259> think<00:01:32.439> so

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
hurt I don't think so

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.929 
hurt I don't think so
it<00:01:32.859> means<00:01:33.130> that<00:01:33.219> if<00:01:33.310> you're<00:01:33.429> maybe<00:01:33.640> on<00:01:33.850> the

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
it means that if you're maybe on the

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.190

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
cusp between the helmets you should go

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.230 
cusp between the helmets you should go
to<00:01:35.289> the<00:01:35.380> larger<00:01:35.649> size<00:01:35.859> but<00:01:36.310> really<00:01:36.670> it's<00:01:36.880> it's

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
to the larger size but really it's it's

the track sometimes like to think about

look<00:02:39.400> at<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.580> shield<00:02:39.790> it's<00:02:40.150> a<00:02:40.270> pin<00:02:40.540> lock<00:02:40.720> ready

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
look at the shield it's a pin lock ready

UV resistant shield and one of my
favorite<00:02:43.420> things<00:02:43.570> about<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:44.050> is<00:02:44.170> actually<00:02:44.650> it

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
favorite things about it is actually it

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.980 
favorite things about it is actually it
has<00:02:45.130> strong<00:02:45.460> detents<00:02:46.060> both<00:02:46.390> open<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:46.720> shut

don't<00:02:51.610> even<00:02:51.790> have<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:52.030> look<00:02:52.180> at<00:02:52.360> it<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:52.660> it

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
don't even have to look at it and it

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.460 
don't even have to look at it and it
comes<00:02:52.960> right<00:02:53.110> off

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
high density cheek pad moving past that

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.750 
high density cheek pad moving past that
I'm<00:04:26.860> going<00:04:26.980> to<00:04:27.010> start<00:04:27.220> to<00:04:27.280> work<00:04:27.430> my<00:04:27.580> way<00:04:27.730> out

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
I'm going to start to work my way out

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.630 
I'm going to start to work my way out
the<00:04:28.120> comfort<00:04:28.450> liner<00:04:28.860> it's<00:04:29.860> nice<00:04:30.100> that<00:04:30.430> it

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
the comfort liner it's nice that it

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.520 
the comfort liner it's nice that it
wraps<00:04:30.820> around<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.479> it<00:04:31.600> attaches<00:04:31.930> at<00:04:32.229> the<00:04:32.289> brow

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
wraps around and it attaches at the brow

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.740 
wraps around and it attaches at the brow
what<00:04:33.070> that<00:04:33.190> does<00:04:33.400> is<00:04:33.520> that<00:04:33.550> keeps<00:04:33.970> a<00:04:34.150> snap<00:04:34.479> or<00:04:34.720> a

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
what that does is that keeps a snap or a

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.060 
what that does is that keeps a snap or a
piece<00:04:34.960> of<00:04:35.140> velcro<00:04:35.289> all

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
piece of velcro all

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.860 
piece of velcro all
away<00:04:36.190> from<00:04:36.250> your<00:04:36.610> forehead<00:04:36.880> and<00:04:37.240> it<00:04:37.540> actually

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
away from your forehead and it actually

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.740 
away from your forehead and it actually
wraps<00:04:38.110> that<00:04:38.320> connection<00:04:39.330> to<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.420> front<00:04:40.690> of

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
wraps that connection to the front of

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.090 
wraps that connection to the front of
the<00:04:40.810> helmet<00:04:40.960> so<00:04:41.140> you<00:04:41.260> don't<00:04:41.440> get<00:04:41.560> that<00:04:41.740> seam

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
the helmet so you don't get that seam

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.070 
the helmet so you don't get that seam
and<00:04:42.280> you<00:04:42.340> don't<00:04:42.550> get<00:04:42.670> that<00:04:42.820> anything<00:04:43.690> adding<00:04:44.020> a

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
and you don't get that anything adding a

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.870 
and you don't get that anything adding a
pressure<00:04:44.380> point<00:04:44.590> to<00:04:44.740> your<00:04:44.830> forehead<00:04:45.130> and<00:04:45.310> in

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
pressure point to your forehead and in

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.760 
pressure point to your forehead and in
the<00:04:46.000> back<00:04:46.210> it<00:04:46.540> actually<00:04:46.930> connects<00:04:47.230> as<00:04:47.350> part<00:04:47.710> of

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
the back it actually connects as part of

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.610 
the back it actually connects as part of
the<00:04:47.830> neck<00:04:48.010> roll<00:04:48.930> it's<00:04:49.930> very<00:04:50.110> simple<00:04:50.470> that's

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
the neck roll it's very simple that's

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.230 
the neck roll it's very simple that's
how<00:04:50.800> that<00:04:50.950> stays<00:04:51.160> in<00:04:51.190> notice<00:04:51.670> it's<00:04:51.820> a<00:04:51.880> 3d

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
how that stays in notice it's a 3d

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.200 
how that stays in notice it's a 3d

design meant with plenty of ventilation

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.730 
design meant with plenty of ventilation
so<00:04:55.720> you<00:04:55.810> can<00:04:55.930> get<00:04:56.020> that<00:04:56.110> good<00:04:56.290> venting<00:04:56.620> to<00:04:56.650> the

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
see that everything is fully washable

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.010 
see that everything is fully washable
removable<00:05:03.150> you<00:05:04.150> know<00:05:04.240> it's<00:05:04.420> a<00:05:04.510> nice<00:05:04.720> touch

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
removable you know it's a nice touch

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.680 
removable you know it's a nice touch
it's<00:05:05.290> very<00:05:05.500> soft<00:05:05.890> but<00:05:06.880> here<00:05:07.060> are<00:05:07.150> my<00:05:07.180> channels

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
it's very soft but here are my channels

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.440 
it's very soft but here are my channels
with<00:05:08.350> my<00:05:08.470> big<00:05:08.710> 10<00:05:08.950> millimeter<00:05:09.340> holes<00:05:09.610> cut<00:05:10.270> into

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
with my big 10 millimeter holes cut into

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.510 
with my big 10 millimeter holes cut into
the<00:05:10.570> EPS<00:05:11.020> that<00:05:11.530> are<00:05:11.620> gonna<00:05:11.740> vent<00:05:11.980> directly<00:05:12.130> to

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
the EPS that are gonna vent directly to

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.820 
the EPS that are gonna vent directly to
the<00:05:12.640> head<00:05:12.840> so<00:05:13.840> I<00:05:13.870> said<00:05:14.110> I<00:05:14.290> think<00:05:14.410> this<00:05:14.650> is<00:05:14.710> a

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
the head so I said I think this is a

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.980 
the head so I said I think this is a
step<00:05:15.100> up<00:05:15.280> from<00:05:15.370> KBC<00:05:15.730> KBC<00:05:16.270> is<00:05:16.420> typically<00:05:16.780> been

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
step up from KBC KBC is typically been

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.630 
step up from KBC KBC is typically been
known<00:05:17.170> as<00:05:17.410> more<00:05:17.680> of<00:05:17.740> an<00:05:17.830> entry-level<00:05:18.100> helmet

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
known as more of an entry-level helmet

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.430 
known as more of an entry-level helmet
and<00:05:18.790> I<00:05:19.090> think<00:05:19.360> moving<00:05:19.840> into<00:05:20.020> this<00:05:20.140> range

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
and I think moving into this range

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.630 
and I think moving into this range
they're<00:05:20.650> competing<00:05:20.920> with<00:05:21.070> some<00:05:21.310> of<00:05:21.400> the<00:05:21.460> other

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
they're competing with some of the other

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.800 
they're competing with some of the other
some<00:05:22.150> made<00:05:22.390> the<00:05:22.720> mid-range<00:05:24.540> scorpion<00:05:25.540> helmets

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
some made the mid-range scorpion helmets

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
some made the mid-range scorpion helmets
you're<00:05:25.930> gonna<00:05:26.020> see<00:05:26.260> them<00:05:26.410> compete<00:05:26.710> with

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
you're gonna see them compete with

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.620 
you're gonna see them compete with
something<00:05:27.040> like<00:05:27.250> a<00:05:27.280> bell<00:05:27.610> or<00:05:27.880> something<00:05:28.180> like
