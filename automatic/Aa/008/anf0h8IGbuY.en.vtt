00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300 

so<00:00:00.269> phones<00:00:00.930> are<00:00:01.079> not<00:00:01.110> just<00:00:01.350> about<00:00:01.500> work<00:00:01.740> but

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
so phones are not just about work but

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.220 
so phones are not just about work but
they're<00:00:02.399> also<00:00:02.520> about<00:00:02.850> play<00:00:03.149> and<00:00:03.449> so<00:00:04.020> we're

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
they're also about play and so we're

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.240 
they're also about play and so we're
going<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.410> switch<00:00:04.620> into<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.859> section<00:00:05.220> here

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
going to switch into a section here

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.950 
going to switch into a section here
we're<00:00:05.549> hopefully<00:00:05.759> going<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.940> have<00:00:06.029> some<00:00:06.810> fun

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
we're hopefully going to have some fun

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.140 
we're hopefully going to have some fun
and<00:00:07.140> talk<00:00:07.319> about<00:00:07.560> how<00:00:07.710> you<00:00:07.770> can<00:00:08.069> build<00:00:08.220> great

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
and talk about how you can build great

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.440 
and talk about how you can build great
applications<00:00:09.230> that<00:00:10.230> are<00:00:10.260> fun<00:00:10.500> as<00:00:10.650> well<00:00:11.450> this

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
applications that are fun as well this

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.930 
applications that are fun as well this
first<00:00:13.099> application<00:00:14.099> we're<00:00:14.219> going<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.429> show

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
first application we're going to show

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.150 
first application we're going to show
off<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.509> kind<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.470> bit<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.710> different<00:00:17.039> one

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
off is a kind of bit of a different one

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.330 
off is a kind of bit of a different one
and<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.900> called<00:00:19.109> coding<00:00:19.470> for<00:00:19.619> fun<00:00:19.830> cannon

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
and it's called coding for fun cannon

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.340 
and it's called coding for fun cannon
and<00:00:21.080> basically<00:00:22.580> it<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.240> nap<00:00:25.050> l'occasion

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
and basically it is a nap l'occasion

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.259 
and basically it is a nap l'occasion
that<00:00:25.590> allows<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.099> remotely<00:00:26.519> control<00:00:26.849> a

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
that allows you to remotely control a

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.830 
that allows you to remotely control a
cannon<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.939> so<00:00:29.939> for<00:00:30.150> something<00:00:30.330> something<00:00:30.720> a

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
cannon and so for something something a

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.389 
cannon and so for something something a
little<00:00:30.960> different<00:00:31.199> let's<00:00:32.009> go<00:00:32.189> ahead<00:00:32.219> and

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
little different let's go ahead and

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.459 
little different let's go ahead and
wheel<00:00:32.910> out<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.239> cannon<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.840> basically<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
wheel out this cannon and basically the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.160 
wheel out this cannon and basically the
way<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.680> app<00:00:34.860> works<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.870> it's<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.930> Windows

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
way this app works is it's a Windows

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.049 
way this app works is it's a Windows
Phone<00:00:37.350> application<00:00:37.790> oh<00:00:40.579> we're<00:00:41.579> waiting<00:00:41.879> for<00:00:42.030> a

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
Phone application oh we're waiting for a

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.030 
Phone application oh we're waiting for a
network<00:00:42.290> something<00:00:43.290> about<00:00:43.379> networks<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:43.950> me

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
network something about networks and me

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:58.970 
network something about networks and me
and<00:00:44.219> phones<00:00:49.579> we're<00:00:50.579> going<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.730> try<00:00:50.879> again

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.080 

great<00:00:59.980> thing<00:01:00.160> about<00:01:00.280> having<00:01:00.370> a<00:01:00.670> canon

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
great thing about having a canon

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.760 
great thing about having a canon
application<00:01:01.660> is<00:01:01.750> when<00:01:01.930> it<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.440> network

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
application is when it the network

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:14.420 
application is when it the network
doesn't<00:01:02.980> work<00:01:11.250> give<00:01:12.250> it<00:01:12.340> a<00:01:12.400> try<00:01:12.580> here<00:01:12.910> well

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
doesn't work give it a try here well

so you can go ahead and play with this

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.810 
so you can go ahead and play with this
one<00:01:38.140> as<00:01:38.320> well<00:01:38.440> it's<00:01:38.920> kind<00:01:39.250> of<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.369> different<00:01:39.700> app

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
one as well it's kind of a different app

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.690 
one as well it's kind of a different app
kind<00:01:40.119> of<00:01:40.180> a<00:01:40.270> fun<00:01:40.450> app<00:01:40.660> and<00:01:41.590> hopefully<00:01:42.490> we'll<00:01:42.610> be

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
kind of a fun app and hopefully we'll be

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.840 
kind of a fun app and hopefully we'll be
able<00:01:42.729> to<00:01:42.880> show<00:01:43.030> it<00:01:43.060> just<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.450> little<00:01:43.479> bit<00:01:44.850> we're

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
able to show it just a little bit we're

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.170 
able to show it just a little bit we're
on<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.090> network<00:01:46.240> okay<00:01:46.690> so<00:01:47.820> let's<00:01:48.820> bring<00:01:49.060> out

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
on the network okay so let's bring out

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.350 
on the network okay so let's bring out
the<00:01:49.300> cannon<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.790> what<00:01:52.210> we<00:01:52.300> have<00:01:52.509> here<00:01:52.540> is<00:01:52.960> a

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
the cannon and so what we have here is a

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.560 
the cannon and so what we have here is a
hydraulically<00:01:55.360> powered<00:01:55.450> cannon<00:02:00.149> oops<00:02:01.149> the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
hydraulically powered cannon oops the

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.969 
hydraulically powered cannon oops the
tripped<00:02:01.870> over<00:02:01.990> its<00:02:02.200> own<00:02:02.320> cable<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:02.860> died

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
tripped over its own cable and died

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:09.539 
tripped over its own cable and died
right<00:02:03.190> away<00:02:07.799> don't<00:02:08.799> worry<00:02:08.920> we<00:02:09.040> actually<00:02:09.280> fire

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.549 
right away don't worry we actually fire

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.670 
right away don't worry we actually fire
stuff<00:02:09.910> with<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.149> cannon<00:02:10.510> don't<00:02:11.350> worry<00:02:11.500> about

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
stuff with the cannon don't worry about

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.320 
stuff with the cannon don't worry about
all<00:02:11.799> these<00:02:11.890> technical<00:02:12.250> glitches<00:02:12.519> okay<00:02:13.180> we're

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
all these technical glitches okay we're

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:23.280 
all these technical glitches okay we're
good<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.510> go<00:02:13.540> again

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.970 

and<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:24.650> what<00:02:25.519> you're<00:02:25.640> seeing<00:02:25.849> here<00:02:25.970> is<00:02:26.980> this

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
and so what you're seeing here is this

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.350 
and so what you're seeing here is this
really<00:02:28.190> kind<00:02:28.280> of<00:02:28.370> fun<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:28.819> hard<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.120> describe

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
really kind of fun and hard to describe

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.809 
really kind of fun and hard to describe
this<00:02:29.569> basically<00:02:30.170> we<00:02:30.530> have<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.819> mechanical

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
this basically we have a mechanical

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.210 
this basically we have a mechanical
cannon<00:02:32.629> being<00:02:33.110> controlled<00:02:33.530> from<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.769> windows

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
cannon being controlled from a windows

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.520 
cannon being controlled from a windows
phone<00:02:34.250> 7<00:02:34.940> device<00:02:35.420> we're<00:02:36.170> saying<00:02:36.290> network

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
phone 7 device we're saying network
