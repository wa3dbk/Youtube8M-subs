is<00:00:00.089> an<00:00:00.240> example<00:00:00.599> of<00:00:01.079> traditional<00:00:01.890> stern<00:00:02.550> boat

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
is an example of traditional stern boat

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.170 
is an example of traditional stern boat
you<00:00:03.720> can<00:00:03.899> see<00:00:04.200> that<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.740> rear<00:00:05.100> deck<00:00:05.700> of<00:00:06.029> the

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
you can see that the rear deck of the

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.870 
you can see that the rear deck of the
boat<00:00:06.359> is<00:00:07.109> not<00:00:07.410> as<00:00:07.560> big<00:00:07.890> as<00:00:08.280> in<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:10.880> semi-trailer

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
boat is not as big as in a semi-trailer

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.160 
boat is not as big as in a semi-trailer
and<00:00:12.059> cruises<00:00:12.599> down<00:00:12.630> boat<00:00:13.280> it<00:00:14.280> means<00:00:14.670> and

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
and cruises down boat it means and

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.170 
and cruises down boat it means and
really<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:17.100> person<00:00:17.550> on<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.760> helm<00:00:17.970> is

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
really that the person on the helm is

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.120 
really that the person on the helm is
that<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.420> out<00:00:18.600> here<00:00:18.840> on<00:00:18.990> their<00:00:19.140> own<00:00:19.170> with<00:00:19.920> some

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
that is out here on their own with some

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.300 
that is out here on their own with some
people<00:00:20.310> like<00:00:21.140> but<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.230> does<00:00:22.500> give<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:23.039> a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
people like but it does give you a

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.910 
people like but it does give you a
little<00:00:23.789> bit<00:00:24.060> more<00:00:24.300> having<00:00:25.140> space<00:00:25.410> actually

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
little bit more having space actually

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.250 
little bit more having space actually
inside<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.340> boat<00:00:26.820> because<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.900> bulkhead

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
inside the boat because the bulkhead

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.169 
inside the boat because the bulkhead
finishes<00:00:28.680> here<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.609> engine<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.000> down

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
finishes here and the engine is down

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.269 
finishes here and the engine is down
here<00:00:30.539> below<00:00:30.689> my<00:00:30.929> feet<00:00:31.170> which<00:00:31.349> I'll<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:31.740> show

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
here below my feet which I'll just show

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.520 
here below my feet which I'll just show
you<00:00:32.309> briefly<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.969> second<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.290> very

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
you briefly in a second this is a very

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.000 
you briefly in a second this is a very
nice<00:00:34.680> example<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.880> trad<00:00:36.210> Stern's

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
nice example of this the trad Stern's

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.250 
nice example of this the trad Stern's
come<00:00:38.010> from<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:39.030> historical<00:00:39.629> working<00:00:40.050> boats

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
come from the historical working boats

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.740 
come from the historical working boats
all<00:00:40.590> those<00:00:40.980> boats<00:00:41.309> had<00:00:41.670> very<00:00:42.149> small<00:00:42.239> Stern

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
all those boats had very small Stern

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.990 
all those boats had very small Stern
areas<00:00:43.230> because<00:00:44.010> obviously<00:00:44.340> when<00:00:44.789> they<00:00:44.940> were

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
areas because obviously when they were

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.750 
areas because obviously when they were
carrying<00:00:45.329> cargo<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.469> more<00:00:46.800> space<00:00:47.129> they<00:00:47.430> had

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
carrying cargo the more space they had

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.540 
carrying cargo the more space they had
for<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:49.230> cargo<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.860> front<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.309> greater

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
for the cargo in the front the greater

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.860 
for the cargo in the front the greater
revenue<00:00:51.090> they<00:00:51.239> could<00:00:51.420> actually<00:00:51.570> generate

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
revenue they could actually generate

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.150 
revenue they could actually generate
from<00:00:52.879> the<00:00:53.879> track<00:00:54.210> Stern<00:00:54.570> shouldn't<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.680> really

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
from the track Stern shouldn't be really

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.050 
from the track Stern shouldn't be really
confused

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.360 

more<00:01:03.960> talking<00:01:04.350> about<00:01:04.380> them<00:01:04.680> lay<00:01:04.860> out<00:01:05.040> a

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
more talking about them lay out a

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.320 
more talking about them lay out a
boatman<00:01:06.000> cabin<00:01:06.710> etc<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:08.160> this<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.790> good

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
boatman cabin etc but this is a good

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.080 
boatman cabin etc but this is a good
example<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.140> trad<00:01:10.380> Stern<00:01:10.740> if<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.700> show<00:01:12.060> you

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
example of a trad Stern if I show you

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.650 
example of a trad Stern if I show you
here<00:01:13.220> on<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.550> particular<00:01:14.910> boat

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
here on this particular boat

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.840 
here on this particular boat
you've<00:01:16.290> got<00:01:16.500> very<00:01:16.830> nice<00:01:17.070> access<00:01:18.030> through<00:01:18.930> here

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
you've got very nice access through here

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.690 
you've got very nice access through here
into<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> weed<00:01:21.150> hatch<00:01:22.250> which<00:01:23.250> makes<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.670> very

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
into the weed hatch which makes it very

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.840 
into the weed hatch which makes it very
very<00:01:24.000> easy<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.710> go<00:01:25.710> through<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.370> check<00:01:26.790> for

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
very easy to go through and check for

very easy to go through and check for
any<00:01:27.030> fouling<00:01:27.690> on<00:01:27.780> there<00:01:28.050> and<00:01:28.230> the<00:01:28.650> engine

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
any fouling on there and the engine

compartment itself then is beyond this
bulkhead<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.120> I<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.300> step<00:01:34.940> into

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
bulkhead here and if I just step into
