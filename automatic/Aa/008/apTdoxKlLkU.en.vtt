00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
infected on the first day you came out

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.540

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
so you know that was when it was hard

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.070 
so you know that was when it was hard
now<00:02:11.849> it's<00:02:12.000> really<00:02:12.209> easy

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
now it's really easy

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.650 
now it's really easy
and<00:02:13.170> we<00:02:13.440> get<00:02:13.860> my<00:02:14.010> abs<00:02:14.190> like<00:02:14.460> it's<00:02:14.670> nothing<00:02:14.820> but

and we get my abs like it's nothing but

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.570 
and we get my abs like it's nothing but
this<00:02:16.050> was<00:02:16.230> when<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.500> was<00:02:16.590> kind<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:17.070> hard<00:02:17.250> and

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
this was when it was kind of hard and

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.980 
this was when it was kind of hard and
that<00:02:17.790> there<00:02:18.000> was<00:02:18.120> no<00:02:18.210> slide<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.510> hand<00:02:18.630> or

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
that there was no slide a hand or

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.500 
that there was no slide a hand or
whatever<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:19.860> yeah<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.610> did<00:02:20.790> 19<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.300> one
