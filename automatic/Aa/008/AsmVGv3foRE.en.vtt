too strong to deal with this but we'll
see<00:02:30.900> maybe<00:02:31.050> maybe<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.770> actual<00:02:32.070> dragon<00:02:32.580> itself

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
see maybe maybe the actual dragon itself

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.949 
see maybe maybe the actual dragon itself
is<00:02:33.000> going<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.180> be<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.300> challenge<00:02:35.720> okay<00:02:36.720> slows

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
is going to be a challenge okay slows

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.380 
is going to be a challenge okay slows
attack<00:02:37.290> speed<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.890> then<00:02:38.730> we'll<00:02:38.910> get<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.150> dots

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
attack speed and then we'll get the dots

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.790 
attack speed and then we'll get the dots
on<00:02:39.780> us<00:02:40.110> right

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
on us right

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.070 
on us right
no<00:02:40.950> no<00:02:41.280> dots<00:02:41.489> yet<00:02:41.700> okay<00:02:44.480> okay<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.720> then<00:02:45.959> the

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
no no dots yet okay okay and then the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.080 
no no dots yet okay okay and then the
dot<00:02:46.260> he's<00:02:46.709> on<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.280> dragon<00:02:47.700> nice<00:02:48.060> okay<00:02:48.780> cool

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
dot he's on the dragon nice okay cool

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.070 
dot he's on the dragon nice okay cool
that's<00:02:51.090> what<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:51.239> was<00:02:51.300> thinking<00:02:51.660> for<00:02:51.690> this<00:02:51.930> guy

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
that's what I was thinking for this guy

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.350 
that's what I was thinking for this guy
anyway<00:02:52.470> for<00:02:52.830> you<00:02:53.400> be<00:02:53.550> good<00:02:53.700> for<00:02:53.910> dragons<00:02:54.239> be

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
anyway for you be good for dragons be

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.640 
anyway for you be good for dragons be
ten<00:02:55.790> okay<00:02:58.040> Ness<00:02:59.930> Ness<00:03:00.930> but<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.320> was<00:03:01.500> thinking

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
ten okay Ness Ness but I was thinking

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.070 
ten okay Ness Ness but I was thinking
he's<00:03:02.040> got<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.459> o<00:03:02.670> YZ<00:03:02.970> plus<00:03:03.420> he<00:03:03.540> can<00:03:03.690> slow

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
he's got to a o YZ plus he can slow

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.840 
he's got to a o YZ plus he can slow
which<00:03:04.410> is<00:03:04.560> good<00:03:04.739> for<00:03:04.920> dragons<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.550> it's<00:03:05.700> good

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
which is good for dragons and it's good

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:13.370 
which is good for dragons and it's good
for<00:03:06.030> towers<00:03:06.360> too<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:08.330> then<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:12.050> then<00:03:13.050> he<00:03:13.080> can

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
for towers too and then and then he can

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.850 
for towers too and then and then he can
transfer<00:03:13.980> dots

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
transfer dots

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.800 
transfer dots
which<00:03:16.490> is<00:03:16.640> nice<00:03:16.790> because<00:03:16.970> it<00:03:17.090> also<00:03:17.300> removes

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
which is nice because it also removes

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.750 
which is nice because it also removes
them<00:03:18.020> from<00:03:18.050> him<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.710> it<00:03:19.010> gives<00:03:19.310> them<00:03:19.520> to

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
them from him and it gives them to

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.940 
them from him and it gives them to
that's<00:03:19.970> what<00:03:20.210> transfer<00:03:20.660> is<00:03:20.870> that's<00:03:21.650> what

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
that's what transfer is that's what

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.860 
that's what transfer is that's what
transfer<00:03:22.430> is<00:03:22.580> so<00:03:22.820> it<00:03:22.910> removed<00:03:23.210> him<00:03:23.480> from<00:03:23.510> him

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
transfer is so it removed him from him

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.990 
transfer is so it removed him from him
and<00:03:24.110> then<00:03:24.830> he<00:03:24.950> gives<00:03:25.160> them<00:03:25.340> to<00:03:25.520> the<00:03:25.550> dragon

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
and then he gives them to the dragon

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.250 
and then he gives them to the dragon
which<00:03:26.120> is<00:03:26.150> kind<00:03:26.480> of<00:03:26.540> killing<00:03:26.840> two<00:03:26.960> birds<00:03:27.020> with

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
which is kind of killing two birds with

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.840 
which is kind of killing two birds with
one<00:03:27.500> stone<00:03:27.530> right<00:03:27.800> but<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:28.430> need<00:03:28.610> to<00:03:28.700> have

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
one stone right but you need to have

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.670 
one stone right but you need to have
those<00:03:29.090> weakening<00:03:29.780> effects<00:03:30.170> on<00:03:30.380> you<00:03:30.530> in<00:03:30.620> the

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
those weakening effects on you in the

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.950 
those weakening effects on you in the
first<00:03:30.860> place<00:03:31.130> so<00:03:32.090> let's<00:03:32.240> take<00:03:32.390> a<00:03:32.420> look<00:03:32.600> at<00:03:32.750> what

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.770 
got some got some darkies there got some
darkies<00:03:49.060> but<00:03:50.060> let's<00:03:50.330> take<00:03:50.420> a<00:03:50.480> look<00:03:50.690> at

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
darkies but let's take a look at

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.000 
darkies but let's take a look at
Poseidon<00:03:52.330> despair<00:03:53.330> very<00:03:53.810> very<00:03:54.050> nice<00:03:54.260> -<00:03:54.560> a<00:03:54.590> OES

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
Poseidon despair very very nice - a OES

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.890 
Poseidon despair very very nice - a OES
that's<00:03:55.250> what<00:03:55.400> I<00:03:55.430> would<00:03:55.550> have<00:03:55.640> done<00:03:55.790> -<00:03:55.940> we<00:03:56.750> have

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
that's what I would have done - we have

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.550 
that's what I would have done - we have
speed<00:03:57.320> yes<00:03:58.330> yes<00:03:59.330> attack<00:04:00.110> and<00:04:01.210> accuracy<00:04:02.560> so

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
speed yes yes attack and accuracy so

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.860 
speed yes yes attack and accuracy so
let's<00:04:03.740> let's<00:04:04.610> take<00:04:04.790> a<00:04:04.820> look<00:04:05.030> at<00:04:05.150> ya<00:04:05.420> okay

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
let's let's take a look at ya okay

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.470 
let's let's take a look at ya okay
accuracy<00:04:06.380> is<00:04:06.470> going<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.650> be<00:04:06.710> used<00:04:06.890> on<00:04:07.040> all<00:04:07.480> on

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
accuracy is going to be used on all on

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.860 
accuracy is going to be used on all on
all<00:04:08.540> three<00:04:09.200> so<00:04:09.890> that<00:04:10.040> is<00:04:10.130> good<00:04:10.540> that's<00:04:11.540> good

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
all three so that is good that's good

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.280 
all three so that is good that's good
and<00:04:12.110> we<00:04:12.230> have<00:04:12.440> yeah<00:04:13.570> let's<00:04:14.570> go<00:04:14.720> eighty-eight

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
and we have yeah let's go eighty-eight

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.849 
and we have yeah let's go eighty-eight
percent<00:04:15.440> accuracy<00:04:15.980> nice<00:04:17.440> so<00:04:18.440> pretty<00:04:18.470> high

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
percent accuracy nice so pretty high

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.520 
percent accuracy nice so pretty high
accuracy<00:04:19.959> good<00:04:20.959> attack<00:04:22.840> good<00:04:23.840> speed<00:04:24.080> is<00:04:24.260> extra

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
accuracy good attack good speed is extra

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:32.380 
accuracy good attack good speed is extra
pretty<00:04:24.710> good<00:04:24.890> range<00:04:25.040> for

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390
