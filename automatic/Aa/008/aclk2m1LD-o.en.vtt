00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
symbolism hmm I'm sure that's just the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.539 
symbolism hmm I'm sure that's just the
coincidence<00:01:42.060> right<00:01:42.920> but<00:01:43.920> if<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.189> think<00:01:44.220> about

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
coincidence right but if you think about

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.300 
coincidence right but if you think about
the<00:01:44.939> why<00:01:45.240> why<00:01:45.750> these<00:01:45.810> people<00:01:46.110> are<00:01:46.680> doing<00:01:47.130> this

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
the why why these people are doing this

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.789 
the why why these people are doing this
because<00:01:48.240> they<00:01:48.930> could<00:01:49.110> just<00:01:49.140> donate<00:01:49.619> that

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
because they could just donate that

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.789 
because they could just donate that
money<00:01:50.009> at<00:01:50.189> any<00:01:50.280> time<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.290> at<00:01:52.290> first<00:01:52.470> it

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
money at any time and at first it

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.530 
money at any time and at first it
started<00:01:53.189> out<00:01:53.310> where<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.939> whole<00:01:54.060> premise<00:01:54.329> of

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
started out where the whole premise of

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.569 
started out where the whole premise of
this<00:01:54.689> ice<00:01:54.899> water<00:01:55.229> challenge<00:01:55.350> was<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.460> had<00:01:56.549> a

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
this ice water challenge was you had a

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.999 
this ice water challenge was you had a
choice<00:01:56.820> if<00:01:57.180> somebody<00:01:57.509> nominated<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.860> had

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
choice if somebody nominated you you had

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.010 
choice if somebody nominated you you had
the<00:01:59.130> choice<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.640> either<00:01:59.790> donating<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.719> hundred

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
the choice of either donating a hundred

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.889 
the choice of either donating a hundred
dollars<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> chat<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.189> ALS<00:02:02.579> charity<00:02:03.060> or

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
you had to film yourself within 24 hours

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.930 
you had to film yourself within 24 hours
dumping<00:02:06.810> ice<00:02:06.899> water<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:07.320> your<00:02:07.439> head<00:02:07.610> so<00:02:08.610> it

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
dumping ice water on your head so it

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.609 
dumping ice water on your head so it
almost<00:02:09.360> started<00:02:09.780> out<00:02:09.899> as<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> joke<00:02:10.410> at<00:02:10.590> first

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
almost started out as a joke at first

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.380 
almost started out as a joke at first
and<00:02:11.099> basically<00:02:11.430> that's<00:02:11.610> sending<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.090> message

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
and basically that's sending a message

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.970 
and basically that's sending a message
of<00:02:12.629> well<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.230> guess

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
of well I guess

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.290 
of well I guess
you<00:02:14.010> know<00:02:14.129> I<00:02:14.159> don't<00:02:14.340> want<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.670> send<00:02:14.909> money<00:02:15.090> to

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
you know I don't want to send money to

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.020 
you know I don't want to send money to
charity<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:15.750> I'll<00:02:16.019> do<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.349> instead<00:02:16.879> kind<00:02:17.879> of

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
charity so I'll do this instead kind of

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.119 
charity so I'll do this instead kind of
trivializes<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.110> cheapens<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.769> little<00:02:19.890> bit

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
trivializes and cheapens it a little bit

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.250 
trivializes and cheapens it a little bit
but<00:02:21.030> if<00:02:21.239> you<00:02:21.390> think<00:02:21.720> of<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.959> from<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.580> spiritual

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
but if you think of it from a spiritual

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.330 
but if you think of it from a spiritual
aspect<00:02:26.090> what<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.540> pouring<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.290> water<00:02:29.010> over

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
aspect what is the pouring of water over

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.520 
aspect what is the pouring of water over
one's<00:02:29.730> head<00:02:29.959> symbolized<00:02:30.959> religious

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
one's head symbolized religious

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.699 
one's head symbolized religious
religiously<00:02:32.959> well<00:02:33.959> isn't<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.379> something

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
religiously well isn't that something

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.500 
religiously well isn't that something
you<00:02:35.340> get<00:02:35.640> when<00:02:35.910> you're<00:02:36.030> baptized<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:39.090> pouring

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
you get when you're baptized the pouring

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.640 
you get when you're baptized the pouring
of<00:02:39.599> water<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.110> cleansing<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.769> body<00:02:41.959> so<00:02:42.959> if

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
of water the cleansing of the body so if

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.380 
of water the cleansing of the body so if
you<00:02:43.860> think<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:44.340> it<00:02:44.430> from<00:02:44.640> an<00:02:44.819> alternate

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
you think of it from an alternate

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.360 
you think of it from an alternate
perspective<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.110> again<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.319> don't<00:02:46.980> tell

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
perspective and again I don't tell

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.400 
perspective and again I don't tell
people<00:02:47.400> how<00:02:47.849> to<00:02:47.879> think<00:02:48.209> I<00:02:48.420> am<00:02:48.900> just<00:02:49.140> talking

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
people how to think I am just talking

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.729 
people how to think I am just talking
about<00:02:49.829> other<00:02:50.239> possibilities<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:52.530> will<00:02:52.650> either

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
about other possibilities it will either

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.460 
about other possibilities it will either
resonate<00:02:53.310> with<00:02:53.459> you<00:02:53.670> or<00:02:53.910> you'll<00:02:54.750> be<00:02:55.049> repelled

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
resonate with you or you'll be repelled

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
from it I'm not in control of that but

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.500 
from it I'm not in control of that but
if<00:02:58.739> you<00:02:58.829> think<00:02:58.859> of<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.220> as<00:02:59.400> form<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.790> getting

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
if you think of it as form of getting
