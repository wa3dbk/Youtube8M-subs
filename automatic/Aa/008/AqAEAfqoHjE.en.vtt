00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
pretty well I mean our schools play

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.949 
pretty well I mean our schools play
against<00:02:22.239> each<00:02:22.299> other<00:02:22.510> which<00:02:22.630> is<00:02:22.660> kind<00:02:22.900> of

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
against each other which is kind of

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.810 
against each other which is kind of
funny<00:02:23.230> because<00:02:23.739> we're<00:02:24.010> ranked<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.340> two<00:02:24.640> best

California I think so we play against
each<00:02:28.510> other<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:29.140> know<00:02:29.260> how<00:02:29.560> pretty<00:02:29.799> well
