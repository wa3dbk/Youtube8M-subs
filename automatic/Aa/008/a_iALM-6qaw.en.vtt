00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.050
 in san martín de valdeiglesias 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.930
 celebrates Spain's first open enduro 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.570
 btt where 111 bikers compete in 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.810
 various categories all 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.350
 participants completed a total of 33 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.780
 kilometers in five different sections in 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.390
 this second test of the first open of 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.449
 Spain enduro the winner was Antonio 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.550
 I lost cost that despite achieving the triumph 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.850
 he could not snatch the leadership from the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.980
 scratch category enrique santonja yo 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.860
 I think the last section because the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.630
 accumulated fatigue was very great and the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.290
 descent was the longest of all with a 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.989
 total time of 5 minutes 5 and 15 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.700
 then there the differences were very 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.950
 important because the people who were 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.829
 already physically touched a lot was going very 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.629
 backwards I was still strong 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.730
 in advance there is a long time one of the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.829
 most important factors in san martín 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.559
 Valdeiglesias was the state of the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.990
 ground next to the heat the participants 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.820
 they had to be very concentrated to 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.310
 overcome each of the obstacles in 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.010
 the different sections and thus achieve a 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.830
 I think best time 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.550
 the key point was that the land was 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.910
 dry that there was no grip in almost any 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.830
 point of the circuits and that the 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.830
 temperature was stifling had to go 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.750
 watching continuously hydrating because 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.880
 if you did not know what could happen to the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.810
 invoice I was surprised at the low number 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.130
 4 that I pinned the second best time that 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.350
 it's like that I did not expect it because 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.060
 I had a lot of pedaling and good 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.190
 comrades the truth that they pedal 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.580
 quite my thing the truth is the 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.890
 priority the descent but good very good 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.080
 after this second test the first 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.570
 The Spanish Open Enduro moves to 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.950
 asturias where the fight and emotion 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.260
 for the leadership 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.300
 will be served thanks to the delivery of 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.230
 the runners for trying to be 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.600
 champions 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.330
