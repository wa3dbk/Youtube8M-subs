00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
well yesterday was the grand arrival of

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.780 
well yesterday was the grand arrival of
our<00:00:02.820> plumber<00:00:03.319> and<00:00:04.319> he<00:00:04.950> did<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.160> pressure<00:00:05.460> test

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
our plumber and he did a pressure test

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.870 
our plumber and he did a pressure test
on<00:00:06.150> our<00:00:06.180> in-floor<00:00:07.109> heating<00:00:07.410> system<00:00:07.980> but

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
on our in-floor heating system but

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.009 
on our in-floor heating system but
somewhere<00:00:09.240> in<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.420> neighborhood<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.870> a

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
somewhere in the neighborhood of a

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.810 
somewhere in the neighborhood of a
hundred<00:00:10.230> pounds<00:00:10.769> worth<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:11.010> pressure<00:00:11.280> against

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
hundred pounds worth of pressure against

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.390 
hundred pounds worth of pressure against
the<00:00:11.880> tubing<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.620> this<00:00:13.620> morning<00:00:14.040> it's<00:00:14.219> still

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
the tubing and this morning it's still

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.310 
the tubing and this morning it's still
holding<00:00:14.730> about<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.269> same<00:00:15.509> amount<00:00:16.230> of

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
holding about the same amount of

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.340 
holding about the same amount of
pressure<00:00:16.590> as<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:16.949> had<00:00:17.600> so<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.810> seems<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.320> be

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
pressure as it had so that seems to be

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.599 
pressure as it had so that seems to be
in<00:00:19.529> pretty<00:00:19.740> good<00:00:20.010> working<00:00:20.250> order<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:22.010> a<00:00:23.010> big

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
in pretty good working order and a big

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.529 
in pretty good working order and a big
old<00:00:23.820> semi<00:00:24.359> showed<00:00:24.779> up<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.170> other<00:00:25.320> day

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
old semi showed up the other day

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.679 
old semi showed up the other day
bringing<00:00:27.539> trusses<00:00:28.080> with<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:29.210> so<00:00:30.210> now<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.390> have

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
bringing trusses with it so now we have

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.490 
bringing trusses with it so now we have
a<00:00:30.720> whole<00:00:31.019> bunch<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.980> those<00:00:32.189> as<00:00:32.489> well<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:34.290> rest

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
a whole bunch of those as well the rest

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.920 
a whole bunch of those as well the rest
of<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.739> supplies<00:00:35.100> are<00:00:35.399> coming<00:00:35.730> sometime<00:00:36.000> soon

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
of the supplies are coming sometime soon

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.610 
of the supplies are coming sometime soon
and<00:00:37.309> then<00:00:38.309> after<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.960> construction

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
and then after that the construction

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.729 
and then after that the construction
will<00:00:40.770> actually<00:00:41.190> begin<00:00:41.989> so<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.140> should<00:00:43.350> be<00:00:43.379> very

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
will actually begin so it should be very

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.470 
will actually begin so it should be very
interesting<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.489> see<00:00:44.670> what<00:00:44.850> happens<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
interesting and see what happens in the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.310 
interesting and see what happens in the
coming<00:00:45.660> months

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
coming months

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.060 
coming months
well<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.430> concrete<00:00:47.969> guys<00:00:48.180> are<00:00:48.420> here<00:00:48.600> again<00:00:49.070> so

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
well the concrete guys are here again so

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.920 
well the concrete guys are here again so
it<00:00:50.129> looks<00:00:50.280> like<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:50.700> getting<00:00:50.850> real<00:00:51.300> close<00:00:51.870> to

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
it looks like it's getting real close to

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.490 
it looks like it's getting real close to
time<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.010> last<00:00:53.660> major<00:00:54.660> concrete-pouring

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
time for the last major concrete-pouring

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.619 
time for the last major concrete-pouring
project<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.670> then<00:00:56.789> we'll<00:00:56.940> have<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> concrete

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
project and then we'll have a concrete

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.459 
project and then we'll have a concrete
pad<00:00:57.989> ready<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.250> garage<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.850> be<00:00:59.879> built<00:01:00.469> and

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
pad ready for a garage to be built and

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.500 
pad ready for a garage to be built and
all<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.829> seems<00:01:02.190> kind<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.699> surreal<00:01:03.120> still

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
all this seems kind of surreal still

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.000 
all this seems kind of surreal still
it's<00:01:03.719> just<00:01:03.899> kind<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.140> hard<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.409> believe<00:01:04.739> that

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
it's just kind of hard to believe that

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.160 
it's just kind of hard to believe that
this<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.970> know<00:01:06.060> actually<00:01:06.630> happening

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
this is you know actually happening

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.800 
this is you know actually happening
after<00:01:07.549> many<00:01:08.549> years<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:09.030> waiting<00:01:09.210> for<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.689> and

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
after many years of waiting for it and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.859 
after many years of waiting for it and
things<00:01:10.200> like<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.150> I'm<00:01:12.150> hoping<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.630> it

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
things like that so I'm hoping that it

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:37.069 
things like that so I'm hoping that it
turns<00:01:13.110> out<00:01:13.320> real<00:01:13.680> well

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.789 

alright<00:01:38.430> 7:45<00:01:39.430> Thursday<00:01:40.420> morning<00:01:40.840> but<00:01:41.469> is<00:01:41.649> it

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
alright 7:45 Thursday morning but is it

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.820 
alright 7:45 Thursday morning but is it
September<00:01:42.340> 10th

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
September 10th

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.730 
September 10th
and<00:01:43.920> we've<00:01:44.460> got<00:01:44.670> concrete<00:01:45.120> guys<00:01:45.390> here<00:01:45.780> today

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.859 

they're<00:01:49.860> poor<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.670> floor

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
they're poor in the floor

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.170 
they're poor in the floor
our<00:01:53.290> PEX<00:01:53.590> tubing<00:01:53.710> has<00:01:54.250> had<00:01:54.430> a<00:01:54.460> hundred<00:01:54.850> pounds

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
our PEX tubing has had a hundred pounds

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.899 
our PEX tubing has had a hundred pounds
of<00:01:55.240> pressure<00:01:55.510> on<00:01:55.810> it<00:01:55.840> for<00:01:56.170> about<00:01:56.260> two<00:01:56.590> days<00:01:56.799> now

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
of pressure on it for about two days now

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.399 
of pressure on it for about two days now
if<00:01:57.909> they've<00:01:58.240> been<00:01:58.390> slowed<00:01:58.690> a<00:01:58.720> little<00:01:59.049> bit<00:01:59.170> due

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
if they've been slowed a little bit due

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.980 
if they've been slowed a little bit due
to<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.590> warm<00:01:59.860> and<00:02:00.010> cold<00:02:00.420> but<00:02:01.420> it<00:02:01.540> has<00:02:01.690> stayed

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
to the warm and cold but it has stayed

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.760 
to the warm and cold but it has stayed
locked<00:02:02.729> on<00:02:03.729> that<00:02:04.030> high<00:02:04.210> pressure<00:02:04.540> so<00:02:05.049> it's<00:02:05.619> got

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
locked on that high pressure so it's got

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.160 
locked on that high pressure so it's got
to<00:02:05.890> be<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.009> good<00:02:06.250> sign

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
to be a good sign

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.529 
to be a good sign
but<00:02:08.590> they<00:02:09.220> might<00:02:09.429> have<00:02:09.459> this<00:02:09.819> done<00:02:10.090> by<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.330> end

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
but they might have this done by the end

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.440 
but they might have this done by the end
of<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.810> day<00:02:10.959> I<00:02:10.990> don't<00:02:11.290> know<00:02:12.209> pretty<00:02:13.209> cool

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
of the day I don't know pretty cool

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.449 
of the day I don't know pretty cool
though<00:02:16.080> can't<00:02:17.080> see<00:02:17.290> too<00:02:17.530> much<00:02:17.709> from<00:02:18.010> this<00:02:18.130> side

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
though can't see too much from this side

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.900 
though can't see too much from this side
just<00:02:18.760> yet<00:02:19.470> but<00:02:20.470> I'm<00:02:20.680> sure<00:02:21.220> they'll<00:02:21.459> be<00:02:21.670> busy

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
just yet but I'm sure they'll be busy

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:50.220 
just yet but I'm sure they'll be busy
with<00:02:22.209> that<00:02:22.420> soon

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.229 

all<00:02:51.230> right<00:02:51.890> slow<00:02:52.099> after<00:02:52.459> seven<00:02:52.790> o'clock<00:02:53.000> at

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
all right slow after seven o'clock at

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.199 
all right slow after seven o'clock at
night<00:02:53.420> here<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:55.040> concrete<00:02:55.579> guys<00:02:55.790> have<00:02:56.030> been

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
night here the concrete guys have been

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.640 
night here the concrete guys have been
here<00:02:56.709> and<00:02:57.709> look<00:02:57.890> at<00:02:58.040> what<00:02:58.189> they<00:02:58.400> have<00:02:58.640> done<00:02:59.650> all

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
here and look at what they have done all

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.830 
here and look at what they have done all
that<00:03:00.890> gourd<00:03:01.250> stuff<00:03:01.700> that<00:03:01.909> they<00:03:02.060> had<00:03:02.239> set<00:03:02.540> up<00:03:02.569> as

bad there's another spot for a door and

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.039 
bad there's another spot for a door and
then<00:03:53.989> over<00:03:54.230> here<00:03:54.590> let's<00:03:55.160> see<00:03:55.400> here<00:03:55.840> all<00:03:56.840> right

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
then over here let's see here all right

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.710 
then over here let's see here all right
here's<00:03:57.260> a<00:03:57.319> spot<00:03:57.680> for<00:03:58.040> one<00:03:58.430> garage<00:03:58.639> door<00:03:59.060> this

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
here's a spot for one garage door this

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.710 
here's a spot for one garage door this
is<00:03:59.930> a<00:03:59.959> short<00:04:00.290> garage<00:04:00.620> door<00:04:01.060> and<00:04:02.060> here's<00:04:02.299> a<00:04:02.359> spot

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
is a short garage door and here's a spot

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.800 
is a short garage door and here's a spot
for<00:04:03.049> another<00:04:03.769> garage<00:04:03.980> door<00:04:04.449> another<00:04:05.449> short

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
for another garage door another short

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.509 
for another garage door another short
garage<00:04:06.079> door<00:04:06.349> and<00:04:06.500> then<00:04:06.590> this<00:04:06.709> one<00:04:06.919> down<00:04:07.129> here

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
garage door and then this one down here

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.960 
garage door and then this one down here
we<00:04:08.419> could<00:04:08.540> have<00:04:08.599> had<00:04:08.810> four<00:04:09.079> garage<00:04:09.409> doors<00:04:09.970> but

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
we could have had four garage doors but

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.990 
we could have had four garage doors but
I<00:04:11.030> like<00:04:11.209> the<00:04:11.389> idea<00:04:11.750> of<00:04:11.840> having<00:04:12.109> a<00:04:12.290> long<00:04:12.530> one<00:04:12.739> I

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
I like the idea of having a long one I

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.610 
I like the idea of having a long one I
think<00:04:14.000> this<00:04:14.180> one<00:04:14.359> is<00:04:14.449> going<00:04:14.599> to<00:04:14.690> be<00:04:14.840> 16<00:04:15.319> feet

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
think this one is going to be 16 feet

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.640 
think this one is going to be 16 feet
long<00:04:15.680> and<00:04:16.630> this<00:04:17.630> is<00:04:17.690> going<00:04:18.109> to<00:04:18.260> allow<00:04:18.470> us<00:04:18.500> to

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
long and this is going to allow us to

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.469 
long and this is going to allow us to
admit<00:04:19.099> stuff<00:04:19.400> that<00:04:19.669> you<00:04:19.760> know<00:04:19.880> is<00:04:20.030> kind<00:04:20.060> of<00:04:20.329> a

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
admit stuff that you know is kind of a

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.920 
admit stuff that you know is kind of a
an<00:04:21.079> odd<00:04:21.289> shape<00:04:21.769> or<00:04:22.130> taken<00:04:22.460> apart<00:04:22.930> something

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
an odd shape or taken apart something

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.250 
an odd shape or taken apart something
strange<00:04:24.289> you<00:04:24.650> know<00:04:25.389> but<00:04:26.389> yeah<00:04:26.539> basically<00:04:26.750> this

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
strange you know but yeah basically this

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.980 
strange you know but yeah basically this
is<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.620> story<00:04:27.919> so<00:04:28.220> far<00:04:28.599> concrete<00:04:29.599> guys<00:04:29.780> have

want to walk on it yet but to the touch

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:37.060 
want to walk on it yet but to the touch
it's<00:04:34.400> hard<00:04:34.840> and<00:04:35.840> tomorrow<00:04:36.440> they're<00:04:36.650> coming<00:04:36.979> to

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.939 
it's hard and tomorrow they're coming to
score<00:04:37.370> it<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:38.780> put<00:04:38.990> these<00:04:39.169> bolts<00:04:39.560> in<00:04:39.740> to

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
score it and put these bolts in to

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.670 
score it and put these bolts in to
attach<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.490> rest<00:04:40.639> of<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:40.880> building<00:04:41.240> to<00:04:41.680> left

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.589 
us a little bag of hardware down here
it's<00:04:44.990> probably<00:04:45.349> used<00:04:45.530> for<00:04:45.650> that<00:04:45.830> purpose<00:04:46.599> and

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
it's probably used for that purpose and

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.600 
it's probably used for that purpose and
it's<00:04:47.840> looking<00:04:48.110> pretty<00:04:48.320> sweet

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
it's looking pretty sweet

00:04:49.610 --> 00:05:00.629 
it's looking pretty sweet
so<00:04:50.569> that's<00:04:50.750> the<00:04:50.930> story<00:04:51.229> thus<00:04:51.470> far
