wouldn't fit in that box and because of

wouldn't fit in that box and because of
this

this

the page now I measure out 10 inches and

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
half let's just say this is 10 inches

which it's not if I flip it around that
is<00:04:07.370> actually<00:04:07.820> 10<00:04:08.030> inches<00:04:08.420> from<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.020> effective

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.690 
is actually 10 inches from the effective
apex<00:04:10.960> so<00:04:11.960> then<00:04:12.200> in<00:04:12.440> order<00:04:12.620> to<00:04:12.770> achieve<00:04:13.250> the

inches<00:04:33.470> and<00:04:34.360> then<00:04:35.360> go<00:04:35.570> up<00:04:35.840> a<00:04:36.110> set<00:04:36.470> distance<00:04:36.700> to

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
inches and then go up a set distance to

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.590 
inches and then go up a set distance to
each<00:04:37.820> of<00:04:37.970> these<00:04:38.060> angles<00:04:39.580> in<00:04:40.580> degrees<00:04:40.760> you<00:04:41.450> need

inches at 10 inches from the apex 12 and
1/2<00:04:48.140> degrees<00:04:48.440> you<00:04:48.800> need<00:04:48.950> roughly<00:04:49.940> two<00:04:50.120> and<00:04:50.150> a

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
apex 15 you need roughly 2.7 inches at

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.460 
apex 15 you need roughly 2.7 inches at
20<00:04:58.370> degrees<00:04:58.610> you<00:04:58.880> need<00:04:59.000> roughly<00:04:59.300> three<00:05:00.200> point

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.530 
located 10 inches from the effective
apex<00:05:07.450> so

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
apex so

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.430 
apex so
what<00:05:10.350> I<00:05:10.380> did<00:05:10.710> was<00:05:10.920> I<00:05:10.950> slid<00:05:11.340> my<00:05:11.520> wedge<00:05:12.200> in<00:05:13.200> and

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
what I did was I slid my wedge in and

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
what I did was I slid my wedge in and
out<00:05:13.560> until<00:05:13.860> this<00:05:14.370> distance<00:05:16.010> for<00:05:17.010> example

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
out until this distance for example

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.420 
out until this distance for example
three<00:05:17.940> point<00:05:18.210> six<00:05:18.450> four<00:05:18.720> inches<00:05:19.110> I<00:05:19.400> slid<00:05:20.400> my

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
three point six four inches I slid my

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.090 
three point six four inches I slid my
wedge<00:05:20.820> out<00:05:21.230> whereas<00:05:22.230> about<00:05:22.350> three<00:05:22.680> point<00:05:22.920> six

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
wedge out whereas about three point six

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.970 
wedge out whereas about three point six
four<00:05:23.340> inches<00:05:23.810> if<00:05:24.810> I<00:05:25.020> measure<00:05:25.290> right<00:05:25.530> here

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
four inches if I measure right here

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.620 
four inches if I measure right here
that's<00:05:26.220> roughly<00:05:26.610> three<00:05:26.910> point<00:05:27.180> six<00:05:27.390> four

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
that's roughly three point six four

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.350 
that's roughly three point six four
inches<00:05:28.280> then<00:05:29.280> I<00:05:29.340> put<00:05:29.550> a<00:05:29.580> little<00:05:29.730> mark<00:05:30.000> across

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
inches then I put a little mark across

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.600 
inches then I put a little mark across
the<00:05:30.540> base<00:05:31.010> so<00:05:32.010> that<00:05:32.040> I<00:05:32.190> can<00:05:32.400> see<00:05:32.640> that<00:05:32.850> distance

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
the base so that I can see that distance

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.710 
the base so that I can see that distance
did<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.760> same<00:05:36.000> thing<00:05:37.040> at<00:05:38.040> 15<00:05:38.610> degrees<00:05:38.940> twelve

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
did the same thing at 15 degrees twelve

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.840 
did the same thing at 15 degrees twelve
and<00:05:39.840> a<00:05:39.870> half<00:05:39.900> degrees<00:05:40.440> and<00:05:40.830> I<00:05:41.430> set<00:05:41.700> these

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
and a half degrees and I set these

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:48.950 
and a half degrees and I set these
uprights<00:05:42.360> to<00:05:42.450> be<00:05:42.630> ten<00:05:42.870> degrees<00:05:47.540> so<00:05:48.540> that's<00:05:48.690> the

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
uprights to be ten degrees so that's the

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.170 
uprights to be ten degrees so that's the
set<00:05:49.170> up<00:05:49.320> that's<00:05:49.620> how<00:05:49.830> it<00:05:49.980> works<00:05:50.190> but<00:05:50.700> basically

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
set up that's how it works but basically

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.180 
set up that's how it works but basically
if<00:05:51.510> I<00:05:51.720> just<00:05:51.930> use<00:05:52.170> these<00:05:52.530> marks

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
if I just use these marks

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.880 
if I just use these marks
eyeball<00:05:53.730> them<00:05:53.880> to<00:05:54.030> the<00:05:54.150> edge<00:05:54.270> of<00:05:54.390> this<00:05:54.540> block

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
eyeball them to the edge of this block

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.440 
eyeball them to the edge of this block
I'm<00:05:55.890> going<00:05:56.070> to<00:05:56.130> be<00:05:56.220> pretty<00:05:56.640> close<00:05:56.940> to<00:05:57.060> those

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
I'm going to be pretty close to those

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.390 
I'm going to be pretty close to those
angles<00:05:57.840> and<00:05:58.080> since<00:05:58.950> I'm<00:05:59.100> going<00:05:59.250> to<00:05:59.310> be

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
angles and since I'm going to be

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.670 
angles and since I'm going to be
regrinding<00:06:00.060> the<00:06:00.390> edge<00:06:00.750> bevel<00:06:01.230> of<00:06:01.350> the<00:06:01.380> knives

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
regrinding the edge bevel of the knives

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.070 
regrinding the edge bevel of the knives
when<00:06:02.100> I<00:06:02.130> do<00:06:02.250> this<00:06:02.550> it<00:06:03.510> really<00:06:03.540> doesn't<00:06:03.990> matter

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
when I do this it really doesn't matter

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.920 
when I do this it really doesn't matter
to<00:06:04.260> me<00:06:04.470> too<00:06:04.650> much<00:06:04.800> if<00:06:05.040> I'm<00:06:05.190> at<00:06:05.400> ten<00:06:06.120> degrees<00:06:06.330> or

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
to me too much if I'm at ten degrees or

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.690 
to me too much if I'm at ten degrees or
ten<00:06:07.260> and<00:06:07.410> a<00:06:07.440> half<00:06:07.590> degrees<00:06:08.010> or<00:06:08.310> nine<00:06:08.490> and<00:06:08.610> a

ten and a half degrees or nine and a

ten and a half degrees or nine and a
half<00:06:08.850> degrees<00:06:09.240> it's<00:06:09.990> going<00:06:10.050> to<00:06:10.230> be<00:06:10.320> pretty

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
half degrees it's going to be pretty

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.080 
half degrees it's going to be pretty
close<00:06:10.830> but<00:06:11.160> most<00:06:11.370> of<00:06:11.550> all<00:06:11.670> it's<00:06:11.820> going<00:06:11.910> to<00:06:11.970> be

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
close but most of all it's going to be

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.130 
close but most of all it's going to be
very<00:06:12.420> consistent<00:06:12.930> I<00:06:14.690> hope<00:06:15.690> you<00:06:15.840> find<00:06:15.990> that

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.140 
very consistent I hope you find that

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.850 
very consistent I hope you find that
useful<00:06:16.260> hope<00:06:17.160> I<00:06:17.310> didn't<00:06:17.520> leave<00:06:17.640> anything<00:06:17.880> out
