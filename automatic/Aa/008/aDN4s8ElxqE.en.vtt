all<00:00:00.659> right<00:00:00.870> so<00:00:01.020> this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.199> my<00:00:01.439> pinwheel

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
all right so this is my pinwheel

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.350 
all right so this is my pinwheel
mechanical<00:00:02.370> calculator<00:00:02.850> that<00:00:02.939> I<00:00:03.120> recently

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
mechanical calculator that I recently

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.250 
mechanical calculator that I recently
purchased<00:00:03.750> online<00:00:05.420> it's<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:07.010> last<00:00:08.010> produced<00:00:08.460> in

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
purchased online it's a last produced in

this<00:00:11.280> particular<00:00:11.790> model<00:00:12.019> in<00:00:13.019> Italy<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:15.289> it's

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
this particular model in Italy and it's

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.830 
this particular model in Italy and it's
in<00:00:16.880> fairly<00:00:17.880> good<00:00:17.910> condition<00:00:18.180> considering

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
in fairly good condition considering

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.140 
in fairly good condition considering
it's<00:00:19.350> at<00:00:20.070> least<00:00:20.340> 56<00:00:21.150> years<00:00:21.330> old<00:00:22.130> so<00:00:23.150> basically

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
it's at least 56 years old so basically

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.060 
it's at least 56 years old so basically
with<00:00:24.539> mechanical<00:00:25.050> calculators<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:26.039> a

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
with mechanical calculators you have a

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.169 
with mechanical calculators you have a
few<00:00:26.359> simple<00:00:27.359> things<00:00:27.779> for<00:00:28.760> you<00:00:29.760> know<00:00:29.849> each

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
few simple things for you know each

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.269 
few simple things for you know each
model<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.650> going<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.859> have<00:00:31.980> an<00:00:32.099> input

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
model and it's going to have an input

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.520 
model and it's going to have an input
counter<00:00:32.790> which<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.270> one<00:00:33.480> here<00:00:33.690> input

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
counter which is this one here input

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.780 
counter which is this one here input
numbers<00:00:35.070> by<00:00:35.850> turning<00:00:36.180> these<00:00:36.239> dials<00:00:37.579> and<00:00:38.579> you

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
numbers by turning these dials and you

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.459 
numbers by turning these dials and you
can<00:00:38.940> clear<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.390> with<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.110> little<00:00:40.350> lever

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
can clear that with this little lever

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.549 
can clear that with this little lever
here<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:42.620> down<00:00:43.620> here<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.129> your<00:00:44.219> output

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
here and down here you have your output

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.770 
here and down here you have your output
and<00:00:46.610> over<00:00:47.610> here<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:47.969> your<00:00:48.120> turn<00:00:48.360> counter

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
and over here you have your turn counter

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.420 
and over here you have your turn counter
now<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.680> reset<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:51.079> pull<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.260> resets<00:00:53.219> bolt

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
now to reset that pull this resets bolt

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.740 
now to reset that pull this resets bolt
and<00:00:55.789> whenever<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.910> start<00:00:57.120> using<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.510> you're

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
and whenever you start using it you're

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.459 
and whenever you start using it you're
going<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.989> want<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> move<00:00:58.640> the<00:01:00.170> you<00:01:01.170> know<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
going to want to move the you know the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.539 
going to want to move the you know the
center<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.640> bottom<00:01:02.910> display<00:01:03.439> all<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.500> way<00:01:04.769> to

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
center the bottom display all the way to

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.789 
center the bottom display all the way to
the<00:01:05.700> left<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.540> first<00:01:06.750> digit<00:01:07.170> lines

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the left so that the first digit lines

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.300 
the left so that the first digit lines
up<00:01:08.040> with<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> first<00:01:08.520> digit<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.570> input<00:01:10.409> so

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
up with the first digit of the input so

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.980 
up with the first digit of the input so
to<00:01:11.369> do<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.939> would<00:01:12.030> use<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.780> little

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
to do that you would use this little

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.660 
to do that you would use this little
rocker<00:01:13.320> back<00:01:13.799> here<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:17.869> you<00:01:18.869> can<00:01:19.020> do<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.320> or

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
rocker back here and you can do that or

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.149 
rocker back here and you can do that or
it<00:01:20.670> has<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> little<00:01:21.409> release<00:01:22.409> button<00:01:22.770> here<00:01:23.009> and

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
it has a little release button here and

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.429 
it has a little release button here and
that<00:01:23.250> lets<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.670> slide<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.060> yourself<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:25.320> in

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
that lets you slide it yourself but in

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.920 
that lets you slide it yourself but in
most<00:01:25.590> cases<00:01:25.710> you're<00:01:26.549> going<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.790> want<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.060> use

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
most cases you're going to want to use

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.580 
most cases you're going to want to use
this<00:01:29.270> unless<00:01:30.270> you're<00:01:30.450> just<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:31.110> know<00:01:31.229> opening

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
this unless you're just you know opening

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.859 
this unless you're just you know opening
it<00:01:31.710> up<00:01:34.009> now<00:01:35.009> how<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.670> works<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:36.060> pretty<00:01:36.479> simple

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
it up now how it works is pretty simple

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.300 
it up now how it works is pretty simple
you<00:01:37.369> pull<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.490> lever<00:01:38.700> out<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.390> rotate<00:01:39.780> it

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
you pull this lever out and rotate it

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.100 
you pull this lever out and rotate it
clockwise<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:42.030> do<00:01:42.450> addition<00:01:42.930> and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
clockwise to do addition and

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.929 
clockwise to do addition and
multiplication<00:01:43.189> and<00:01:46.009> counterclockwise<00:01:47.009> to

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
multiplication and counterclockwise to

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.240 
multiplication and counterclockwise to
do<00:01:48.200> subtraction<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.860> division<00:01:52.040> so<00:01:53.040> as<00:01:53.159> you

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
do subtraction and division so as you

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.569 
do subtraction and division so as you
notice<00:01:53.549> every<00:01:53.790> time<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.030> turn<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:56.189> turn

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
notice every time I turn it the turn

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.929 
notice every time I turn it the turn
counter<00:01:56.969> goes<00:01:57.390> up<00:01:57.570> by<00:01:57.719> one<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.610> I'll<00:01:59.759> keep

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
counter goes up by one so I'll keep

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.929 
counter goes up by one so I'll keep
doing<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:01.409> just<00:02:01.439> keeps<00:02:01.799> going<00:02:01.950> up<00:02:02.189> but

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
doing that it just keeps going up but

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.600 
doing that it just keeps going up but
the<00:02:03.420> input<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.840> zero<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:05.070> output<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.430> going<00:02:05.460> to

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
the input is zero the output is going to

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.120 
the input is zero the output is going to
be<00:02:05.670> zero<00:02:05.969> because<00:02:06.180> zero<00:02:06.659> plus<00:02:07.469> zero<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.799> zero

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
be zero because zero plus zero is zero

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.600 
be zero because zero plus zero is zero
so<00:02:09.670> I'm<00:02:09.730> going<00:02:09.820> to<00:02:09.910> reset<00:02:10.210> that<00:02:10.240> and<00:02:14.430> let's<00:02:15.430> do

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
so I'm going to reset that and let's do

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:25.440 
so I'm going to reset that and let's do
a<00:02:15.640> basic<00:02:16.120> addition<00:02:16.990> so<00:02:17.950> 2<00:02:20.580> 2<00:02:21.580> times<00:02:21.850> 1<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.920> 2<00:02:24.450> and

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
a basic addition so 2 2 times 1 is 2 and

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.180 
a basic addition so 2 2 times 1 is 2 and
2<00:02:25.920> times<00:02:26.920> 2<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.400> 4<00:02:28.270> so<00:02:29.110> basically<00:02:29.890> what<00:02:30.070> I<00:02:30.100> did

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
2 times 2 is 4 so basically what I did

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.210 
2 times 2 is 4 so basically what I did
was<00:02:30.310> 2<00:02:30.640> plus<00:02:30.880> 2<00:02:31.090> equals<00:02:31.300> 4<00:02:31.810> at<00:02:32.710> the<00:02:32.800> same<00:02:32.830> time

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
was 2 plus 2 equals 4 at the same time

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.560 
was 2 plus 2 equals 4 at the same time
it's<00:02:33.370> multiplication<00:02:33.730> because<00:02:34.270> I'm<00:02:34.420> using

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
it's multiplication because I'm using

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.170 
it's multiplication because I'm using
the<00:02:34.750> same<00:02:34.960> number<00:02:35.320> over<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.890> over<00:02:36.100> if<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:37.090> were

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
the same number over and over if I were

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.230 
the same number over and over if I were
to<00:02:37.270> do<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.630> know<00:02:38.010> 4<00:02:39.010> plus<00:02:40.350> 25<00:02:41.350> I<00:02:42.010> would<00:02:43.000> get<00:02:43.120> the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
to do you know 4 plus 25 I would get the

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.050 
to do you know 4 plus 25 I would get the
answer<00:02:43.590> 29<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:45.340> when<00:02:45.400> you're<00:02:45.550> doing<00:02:45.760> that<00:02:45.850> you

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
answer 29 and when you're doing that you

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.790 
answer 29 and when you're doing that you
would<00:02:46.120> just<00:02:46.300> disregard<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.200> turn<00:02:47.380> counter

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
would just disregard the turn counter

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.980 
would just disregard the turn counter
because<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.730> you<00:02:49.240> know<00:02:49.330> doesn't<00:02:49.750> matter<00:02:49.870> how

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
because it you know doesn't matter how

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.840 
because it you know doesn't matter how
many<00:02:50.110> times<00:02:50.350> you<00:02:50.500> turned<00:02:50.770> a<00:02:51.130> addition<00:02:52.000> problem

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
many times you turned a addition problem

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.700 
many times you turned a addition problem
so<00:02:54.850> I'm<00:02:54.910> going<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.120> reset<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:55.690> calculator<00:02:56.530> and

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
so I'm going to reset a calculator and

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:07.500 
so I'm going to reset a calculator and
let's<00:03:02.160> take<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.220> number<00:03:03.550> like<00:03:04.980> 25<00:03:06.150> on<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.360> to

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
let's take a number like 25 on that to

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.400 
let's take a number like 25 on that to
the<00:03:07.600> bottom<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:08.160> then<00:03:09.160> clear<00:03:09.790> that<00:03:10.030> and

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
the bottom and then clear that and

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.110 
the bottom and then clear that and
subtract<00:03:13.380> 3<00:03:14.380> so<00:03:15.250> what<00:03:15.400> with<00:03:15.520> counterclockwise

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
subtract 3 so what with counterclockwise

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.890 
subtract 3 so what with counterclockwise
and<00:03:16.690> that's<00:03:17.350> subtracted<00:03:17.920> 3<00:03:18.160> from<00:03:18.370> 25<00:03:18.850> and<00:03:19.810> we

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
and that's subtracted 3 from 25 and we

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.180 
and that's subtracted 3 from 25 and we
haven't<00:03:20.140> up<00:03:20.340> 22<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:23.530> can<00:03:23.680> do<00:03:23.770> much<00:03:23.950> bigger

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
haven't up 22 you can do much bigger

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.190 
haven't up 22 you can do much bigger
numbers<00:03:24.520> and<00:03:24.760> it<00:03:24.850> goes<00:03:24.970> just<00:03:25.000> as<00:03:25.420> fast<00:03:25.720> you

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
numbers and it goes just as fast you

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:36.300 
numbers and it goes just as fast you
know<00:03:26.290> under<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.190> random<00:03:27.640> number<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:35.250> it's<00:03:36.250> a

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
know under a random number and it's a

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.710 
know under a random number and it's a
little<00:03:36.520> louder<00:03:36.670> when<00:03:36.880> you<00:03:36.940> do<00:03:37.060> that<00:03:37.180> but<00:03:37.570> it

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
little louder when you do that but it

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.880 
little louder when you do that but it
does<00:03:38.440> add<00:03:38.800> up<00:03:38.830> just<00:03:39.340> as<00:03:39.780> fast<00:03:40.780> as<00:03:41.020> any<00:03:41.170> other

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
does add up just as fast as any other

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.640 
does add up just as fast as any other
operation<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:46.180> it's<00:03:46.300> very<00:03:46.420> fast<00:03:46.780> and<00:03:47.080> accurate

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
operation so it's very fast and accurate

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.690 
operation so it's very fast and accurate
which<00:03:48.340> is<00:03:48.610> um<00:03:49.230> something<00:03:50.230> that's<00:03:51.220> really

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
which is um something that's really

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.000 
which is um something that's really
impressive<00:03:52.180> for<00:03:52.210> a<00:03:52.690> totally<00:03:53.530> mechanical

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
impressive for a totally mechanical

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:05.449 
impressive for a totally mechanical
design<00:03:56.310> so<00:03:57.310> just<00:03:57.910> a<00:03:58.060> few<00:03:58.360> minutes<00:03:58.600> positions

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:12.750 

you<00:04:06.459> also<00:04:06.700> do<00:04:07.030> subtraction<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:12.400> is<00:04:12.489> a<00:04:12.519> little

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
you also do subtraction it is a little

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.409 
you also do subtraction it is a little
harder<00:04:13.090> to<00:04:13.329> pull<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:14.650> lever<00:04:15.209> when<00:04:16.209> you<00:04:16.299> do

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
harder to pull the lever when you do

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.569 
harder to pull the lever when you do
have<00:04:16.539> a<00:04:16.600> lot<00:04:16.750> of<00:04:16.840> numbers<00:04:20.160> but<00:04:21.160> it's<00:04:21.310> not<00:04:21.430> too

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
have a lot of numbers but it's not too

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.760 
have a lot of numbers but it's not too
difficult

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
difficult

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.900 
difficult
all<00:04:23.770> right<00:04:23.889> so<00:04:24.009> I'm<00:04:24.100> going<00:04:24.220> to<00:04:24.280> reset

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.260 

everything<00:04:27.910> there<00:04:28.860> on<00:04:29.860> another<00:04:30.039> thing<00:04:30.460> this

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
everything there on another thing this

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.980 
everything there on another thing this
switch<00:04:32.070> is<00:04:33.070> basically<00:04:33.729> a<00:04:36.570> not<00:04:37.570> sure<00:04:37.750> what<00:04:37.900> to

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
switch is basically a not sure what to

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.700 
switch is basically a not sure what to
call<00:04:38.199> it<00:04:38.910> it<00:04:39.910> prevents<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.419> output<00:04:40.870> from

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
call it it prevents the output from

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.650 
call it it prevents the output from
being<00:04:41.949> erased<00:04:42.250> when<00:04:43.150> you<00:04:43.360> know<00:04:44.110> do<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:44.919> clear

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
being erased when you know do it clear

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.430 
being erased when you know do it clear
and<00:04:47.039> you<00:04:48.039> really<00:04:48.460> only<00:04:48.490> use<00:04:49.240> that<00:04:49.509> in<00:04:49.750> division

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
and you really only use that in division

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.810 
and you really only use that in division
and<00:04:54.030> to<00:04:55.030> show<00:04:55.180> you<00:04:55.240> an<00:04:55.360> example<00:04:55.419> of<00:04:55.840> division

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
and to show you an example of division

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.999 
and to show you an example of division
I'll<00:04:57.820> do<00:04:58.060> I'm<00:04:58.810> going<00:04:58.930> to<00:04:58.990> do<00:04:59.110> a<00:04:59.139> big<00:04:59.770> number

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
I'll do I'm going to do a big number

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:06.000 
I'll do I'm going to do a big number
just<00:05:00.340> to<00:05:02.550> show<00:05:03.550> what<00:05:03.669> it<00:05:03.759> can<00:05:03.789> do<00:05:04.139> so<00:05:05.139> I<00:05:05.440> want<00:05:05.949> to

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
just to show what it can do so I want to

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:12.689 
just to show what it can do so I want to
divide<00:05:06.159> this<00:05:06.610> number<00:05:07.949> 3120<00:05:08.979> 64<00:05:11.490> so<00:05:12.490> I'm<00:05:12.580> going

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
divide this number 3120 64 so I'm going

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.969 
divide this number 3120 64 so I'm going
to<00:05:12.760> move<00:05:12.820> it<00:05:12.970> down<00:05:13.000> there<00:05:13.360> and<00:05:14.610> I<00:05:16.830> want<00:05:17.830> to

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
to move it down there and I want to

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:25.379 
to move it down there and I want to
divide<00:05:18.220> that<00:05:18.280> by<00:05:22.409> 13<00:05:23.789> so<00:05:24.789> I'm<00:05:25.060> not<00:05:25.150> gonna<00:05:25.330> do

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
divide that by 13 so I'm not gonna do

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.140 
divide that by 13 so I'm not gonna do
anything<00:05:25.570> yet<00:05:25.870> I<00:05:26.740> need<00:05:27.340> to<00:05:27.520> clear<00:05:27.820> the<00:05:27.970> turn

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
anything yet I need to clear the turn

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.510 
anything yet I need to clear the turn
counter<00:05:28.570> because<00:05:28.750> in<00:05:28.930> division<00:05:29.409> the<00:05:30.250> turn

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
counter because in division the turn

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.999 
counter because in division the turn
counter<00:05:31.000> is<00:05:31.210> your<00:05:31.720> output<00:05:32.680> or<00:05:33.280> your<00:05:33.430> answer<00:05:35.009> so

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:36.009 
counter is your output or your answer so

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:41.310 
counter is your output or your answer so
I'm<00:05:36.099> going<00:05:36.250> to<00:05:36.280> lock<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:38.620> output<00:05:39.220> and<00:05:40.320> reset

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
I'm going to lock the output and reset

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.480 
I'm going to lock the output and reset
the<00:05:41.470> turn<00:05:41.620> counter<00:05:43.349> so<00:05:44.349> the<00:05:44.830> turn<00:05:45.039> counter<00:05:45.400> is

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
the turn counter so the turn counter is

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:53.219 
the turn counter so the turn counter is
all<00:05:45.610> zeros<00:05:45.970> and<00:05:47.009> I'm<00:05:48.009> dividing<00:05:49.680> 3164<00:05:50.680> by<00:05:51.550> 13<00:05:52.229> so

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
all zeros and I'm dividing 3164 by 13 so

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:57.930 
all zeros and I'm dividing 3164 by 13 so
we<00:05:53.500> have<00:05:53.710> to<00:05:53.800> do<00:05:53.919> is<00:05:54.130> you<00:05:54.370> move<00:05:54.610> over<00:05:54.990> until<00:05:56.940> the

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
we have to do is you move over until the

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.450 
we have to do is you move over until the
first<00:05:58.270> digit<00:05:58.630> of<00:05:58.780> the<00:05:58.840> input<00:05:59.409> lines<00:06:00.009> up<00:06:00.280> with

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
first digit of the input lines up with

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.899 
first digit of the input lines up with
the<00:06:03.419> the<00:06:04.419> last<00:06:04.750> digit<00:06:05.139> of<00:06:05.289> the--<00:06:05.860> now<00:06:06.370> the

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:06.909 
the the last digit of the-- now the

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:10.740 
the the last digit of the-- now the
first<00:06:07.750> number<00:06:08.020> and<00:06:09.389> you're<00:06:10.389> just<00:06:10.570> going<00:06:10.690> to

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
first number and you're just going to

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.960 
first number and you're just going to
subtract

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
subtract

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.610 
subtract
now<00:06:13.970> see<00:06:14.240> what<00:06:14.330> I<00:06:14.389> did<00:06:14.449> there<00:06:14.600> I'll<00:06:15.080> roll<00:06:15.410> back

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
now see what I did there I'll roll back

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.570 
now see what I did there I'll roll back
so<00:06:15.830> you<00:06:15.919> can<00:06:16.009> see<00:06:16.069> it<00:06:16.220> again

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
so you can see it again

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.490 
so you can see it again
I<00:06:17.530> tried<00:06:18.530> to<00:06:18.650> subtract<00:06:19.069> 13<00:06:19.580> for<00:06:20.360> 3<00:06:20.720> so<00:06:21.380> what

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
I tried to subtract 13 for 3 so what

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.710 
I tried to subtract 13 for 3 so what
that<00:06:21.650> does<00:06:21.949> is<00:06:22.280> it<00:06:22.430> goes<00:06:22.789> to<00:06:23.060> negative<00:06:23.240> number

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
that does is it goes to negative number

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.920 
that does is it goes to negative number
and<00:06:23.930> this<00:06:24.169> can't<00:06:24.410> do<00:06:24.500> negatives<00:06:24.949> so<00:06:25.669> it<00:06:26.660> just

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
and this can't do negatives so it just

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.370 
and this can't do negatives so it just
shows<00:06:26.990> on<00:06:27.410> line<00:06:28.000> and<00:06:29.000> it<00:06:29.150> makes<00:06:29.330> a<00:06:29.509> you<00:06:30.259> know<00:06:30.349> a

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 
shows on line and it makes a you know a

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.180 
shows on line and it makes a you know a
little<00:06:30.500> bell<00:06:31.460> sound<00:06:32.590> so<00:06:33.590> when<00:06:33.710> that<00:06:33.800> happens

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
little bell sound so when that happens

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.230 
little bell sound so when that happens
you<00:06:34.430> just<00:06:35.470> shift<00:06:36.470> over<00:06:36.800> like<00:06:37.099> that<00:06:37.310> and<00:06:37.520> then

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
you just shift over like that and then

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.360 
you just shift over like that and then
try<00:06:38.449> again<00:06:41.500> keep<00:06:42.500> going<00:06:42.770> until<00:06:42.889> that<00:06:43.099> dings

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370 
try again keep going until that dings

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.749 
try again keep going until that dings
and<00:06:44.229> then<00:06:45.229> roll<00:06:45.440> back<00:06:45.470> and<00:06:46.340> have<00:06:46.490> it<00:06:46.610> ding

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 
and then roll back and have it ding

00:06:46.759 --> 00:07:02.399 
and then roll back and have it ding
again<00:06:48.759> and<00:06:49.759> move<00:06:50.120> over<00:06:51.849> and<00:06:52.849> keep<00:06:53.030> going<00:06:53.210> and

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:02.409 

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:13.210 

again<00:07:10.930> so<00:07:11.930> now<00:07:12.050> we<00:07:12.319> get<00:07:12.440> our<00:07:12.500> answer<00:07:12.740> over<00:07:13.190> here

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:13.220 
again so now we get our answer over here

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.140 
again so now we get our answer over here
now<00:07:13.729> when<00:07:13.880> you<00:07:13.970> roll<00:07:14.389> back<00:07:15.909> counter<00:07:16.909> clockwise

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.150 
now when you roll back counter clockwise

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.490 
now when you roll back counter clockwise
the<00:07:18.139> numbers<00:07:18.530> on<00:07:18.710> the<00:07:18.830> turn<00:07:19.039> counter<00:07:19.460> are<00:07:19.699> read

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:20.500 
the numbers on the turn counter are read

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.879 
the numbers on the turn counter are read
so<00:07:21.500> I'm<00:07:21.740> going<00:07:21.919> to<00:07:21.949> move<00:07:22.190> it<00:07:22.340> take<00:07:22.669> it<00:07:22.789> see<00:07:23.030> a

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:23.889 
so I'm going to move it take it see a

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:25.680 
so I'm going to move it take it see a
little<00:07:24.889> better

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:25.690 
little better

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:32.370 
little better
maybe<00:07:26.690> not<00:07:27.849> neither<00:07:29.770> 243<00:07:30.770> is<00:07:30.949> our<00:07:31.310> answer<00:07:31.699> oh

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:32.380 
maybe not neither 243 is our answer oh

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.689 
maybe not neither 243 is our answer oh
that's<00:07:33.380> not<00:07:33.650> right<00:07:33.680> because<00:07:33.949> there<00:07:34.580> is<00:07:34.669> a

00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:34.699 
that's not right because there is a

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:38.050 
that's not right because there is a
remainder<00:07:35.090> and<00:07:35.900> that<00:07:36.289> is<00:07:36.380> displayed<00:07:36.889> on<00:07:37.130> this

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:38.060 
remainder and that is displayed on this

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.430 
remainder and that is displayed on this
counter<00:07:38.900> here<00:07:39.169> so<00:07:40.009> it's<00:07:40.180> 243<00:07:41.409> with<00:07:42.409> a

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:42.440 
counter here so it's 243 with a

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.249 
counter here so it's 243 with a
remainder<00:07:42.770> of<00:07:42.889> 5<00:07:43.190> and<00:07:43.780> those<00:07:44.780> are<00:07:44.900> the<00:07:44.960> basic

00:07:45.249 --> 00:07:45.259 
remainder of 5 and those are the basic

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:47.350 
remainder of 5 and those are the basic
operations<00:07:45.349> of<00:07:45.949> the<00:07:46.070> calculator<00:07:46.550> and<00:07:46.759> that's

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 
operations of the calculator and that's

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.240 
operations of the calculator and that's
pretty<00:07:48.020> much<00:07:48.139> all<00:07:48.440> there<00:07:48.620> is<00:07:48.650> to<00:07:48.770> it<00:07:49.099> and<00:07:49.130> I

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:49.250 
pretty much all there is to it and I

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.649 
pretty much all there is to it and I
could<00:07:49.400> do<00:07:49.490> the<00:07:49.580> same<00:07:49.789> operations<00:07:50.449> you<00:07:50.539> would

00:07:50.649 --> 00:07:50.659 
could do the same operations you would

00:07:50.659 --> 00:07:55.080 
could do the same operations you would
do<00:07:50.810> on<00:07:50.840> a<00:07:51.039> you<00:07:52.039> know<00:07:52.130> that's<00:07:52.490> basic<00:07:53.030> calculator

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.090 
do on a you know that's basic calculator

00:07:55.090 --> 00:08:01.180 
do on a you know that's basic calculator
so<00:07:56.500> that's<00:07:57.500> it<00:07:57.710> and<00:07:58.060> thanks<00:07:59.060> for<00:07:59.120> watching
