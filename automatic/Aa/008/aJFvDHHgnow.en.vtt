00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.120
 hi everyone here in this track is the 

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:08.670
 speak again with you and today I am going 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.560
 to teach a vision of minecraft 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.750
 in the cycle I will show you how they are 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.219
 the most difficult mods and what else are we going 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.730
 have me that are the milan and the mold 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.730
 creatures 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.600
 and then asking for it I will leave you the 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.390
 mondragon that is a dragon that gets 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.500
 the egg and can ride it and everything but 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.680
 as not apparently it does not matter if 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.150
 you stop crying and anyone else does not have 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.150
 that necessarily be said let's go 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:47.050
 the first thing you have to do 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.050
 and the brand 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.620
 craft 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.019
 the desaforaciÃ³n 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.760
 millais inter game start loading everything 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:06.970
 and when it's over 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.720
 you will have the 12.5 I have the 1.2 port 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.300
 5 but he used the 12.4 remote because 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.150
 they are compatible 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.830
 what to use the present is used 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.290
 simply for 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.250
 so there is no risk of error 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.410
 and all the good things let's do it what 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.920
 first is to have the mods and others leave 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.390
 in the description as always 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.270
 I have them here 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.370
 and we need first to download the 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.790
 we have it here we go to the 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.790
 desk 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.140
 then for democrat it 's the hardest 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.140
 we need the module to do 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.140
 the audio mod 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.880
 the iapi 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.150
 Y 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.769
 how do you see pauner 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.520
 With all this we can install the 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:18.130
 democrat 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.130
 well let's put it more colocadito 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.390
 finish 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.770
 we go to vice here to the barre with her 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.360
 percent 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:37.070
 afp data per hundred as the folder of 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.990
 minecraft skillful brand to open with 7 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.940
 zip and if you do not have to say no os 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.880
 you worry about looking for a document that 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.340
 flame winrar i sure you have it 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.980
 you will know here you will leave a folder that 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.360
 it will be called metal then again there to 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.440
 take for ass that has not been para 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:02.350
 and now we already started this minimizes 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:05.020
 the limits of here 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.390
 control to catch everything and you pass 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.720
 A) Yes 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:14.380
 we could control 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.870
 here yes 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:23.209
 already to control 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.209
 you put them here that takes a little longer 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.830
 and yes 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:35.140
 and now you go to the most pauner point that is 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.140
 same controls here 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.299
 now my name is creatures and tools 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.040
 folders 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.569
 Well, nothing is the same, 6 and you are going 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.629
 in the folder that you have minimized 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:52.030
 previously left in minecraft is already 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.030
 Remember the app data minecraft 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:04:01.680
 then it's a thing of a folder 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.680
 new folder 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.069
 you believe it 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.940
 I was created is to be with him later 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.140
 you catch 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.650
 and 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.810
 Once you get here promise to and passes this creates 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.840
 your 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:26.040
 then sometimes it turns out that 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.040
 it turns out 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.370
 6 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.370
 and you pass it 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.340
 Now you have the mold created and now 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.340
 you go to the miller 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:44.830
 it's a little harder you're here 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.830
 here 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:53.370
 here here and this you go to the folder 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:59.070
 previous 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:05.340
 this this you take everything already here 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:06.540
 so to the back folder this one can 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.849
 close 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:13.840
 go back you gois putin much better 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:18.250
 for your skill 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:21.730
 pesetas you go back and now put put in 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:24.820
 minecraft the maker act antoja you see that 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.740
 puts a thomas kraft fifth hands 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.960
 another two the steps here where good and 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.360
 all this 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:35.510
 and it 's that easy 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:39.830
 As you can see, it's very simple 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:41.480
 it's not simple so you do not know 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.190
 and now let's see what 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.970
 it works but let's go they should work 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.970
 The perfection 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.770
 now you can close all land 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.770
 closes 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:56.680
 brand 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.900
 you carry 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:10.420
 neither have we loaded as I have put 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.980
 all modes 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:19.920
 in the cluster player 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.920
 good and you see how you look 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:26.410
 It's a two-kilometer tour 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:28.560
 looking for cities logos how do you create your 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.790
 they saw sounds here 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.530
 to see as an animal 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:37.220
 but come on it should work 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.220
 perfectly 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.410
 for example 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:47.110
 animal would not find 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:51.740
 but to see 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:53.509
 I came here local local which means that 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.779
 find a new one and a new one 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:58.810
 civilization you see here is the terrain 

00:06:56.779 --> 00:07:01.390
 of the address 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:04.570
 with your things everything 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:08.230
 there is certainly if you go wrong in the 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:11.170
 video you see he told me when they put me 

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:15.540
 weird they are going to be damaged is not because they are 

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.540
 the mod is simply because I 

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:22.819
 captured the video is very bad that no 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:22.819
 You see the deer here 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.280
 of lots that are leopards 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:37.740
 is that from beige brown 

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:41.660
 well nothing thank you very much and nothing until the 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.660
 next video thanks and best regards
