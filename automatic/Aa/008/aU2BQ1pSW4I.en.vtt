reconditioning is very profitable in

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.220 
reconditioning is very profitable in
fact<00:02:12.370> battery<00:02:13.370> reconditioning<00:02:14.300> is<00:02:14.569> one<00:02:14.930> of

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
fact battery reconditioning is one of

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.860 
fact battery reconditioning is one of
the<00:02:15.379> most<00:02:15.500> profitable<00:02:16.280> business<00:02:17.030> opportunity

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
the most profitable business opportunity

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.710 
the most profitable business opportunity
that<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.290> could<00:02:18.440> find<00:02:19.569> provided<00:02:20.569> of<00:02:20.660> course

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
that you could find provided of course

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.589 
that you could find provided of course
that<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.319> do<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.769> right<00:02:21.799> way<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.599> with

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
that you do it the right way and with

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.320 
that you do it the right way and with
the<00:02:23.750> proper<00:02:23.989> equipment<00:02:24.349> and<00:02:25.010> tools<00:02:25.370> obviously

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
the proper equipment and tools obviously

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.800 
the proper equipment and tools obviously
and<00:02:26.980> well<00:02:27.980> here's<00:02:28.640> how<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.090> can<00:02:29.239> figure<00:02:29.690> it

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
and well here's how you can figure it

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.630 
and well here's how you can figure it
out<00:02:30.110> for<00:02:30.349> yourself<00:02:30.410> I<00:02:31.720> guess<00:02:32.720> nothing<00:02:33.319> is<00:02:33.500> more

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
out for yourself I guess nothing is more

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.360 
out for yourself I guess nothing is more
convincing<00:02:34.640> than<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:35.329> concrete<00:02:36.170> example<00:02:36.370> so

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
convincing than a concrete example so

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.330 
convincing than a concrete example so
let's<00:02:37.610> just<00:02:37.940> take<00:02:38.150> this<00:02:38.209> example<00:02:39.340> suppose

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
let's just take this example suppose

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.030 
let's just take this example suppose
