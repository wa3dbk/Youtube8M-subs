00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.740
 I was delayed in everyone Hello lanterns er video by saying yes 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.550
 But 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:18.950
 The other day I was able to celebrate April 7, lanterns what skin-chan 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:22.340
 There will thus of being continue to work on youtube also to because I everyone 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.690
 It will be in the form of borrowing this place, but 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:29.430
 This channel will be zero in the future 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.780
 I hope you will be more than 20 years old by saying that you are 20 years old 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.620
 I want to go, but 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:40.170
 In the other day I had to get a six o'clock chapter 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.910
 The other really or hard school or work hard youtube until the day of another ne hair show 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.680
 It has been a difficult month 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.720
 So Kedomo it's a thing of the recent hair show 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.850
 If you have not seen yet is Kedomo the method of the previous straw Carp Tsu I mean cut I was on video 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.950
 With the wheel cup folded horizontal 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:59.050
 Got a even you, which is also used in the stroke cut actually pierced Please check 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:03.280
 It is Toka this hair show Kedomo is 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.670
 Although it is often used by the technique of the cut to show 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.650
 This time except stroke cut 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.670
 After I become another it amazing very cool cut home so Kedomo it to the die eye 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.430
 There is also street 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.900
 Effect Carp 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:20.890
 It is cool something in front of Poi Tsu great creators 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:25.600
 It is also used in effects or video editing software 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:28.930
 Also I'd think personally Nante looking final cut like a little more 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.420
 In Kedomo that the Tteyuu effect cut is do a thing I mean Ya' Nanzo 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:37.700
 I used to create this skill before TV or cm 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:42.470
 It's a cut game developed by Mr. Nozawa of the plate , though I did it 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:46.700
 It is the way of this cut, but it is also very difficult even with ordinary art 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:52.409
 It is really very few beauticians who can make this effect cut 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:55.829
 I heard that it was limited, but I think maybe I will show you from now on 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.460
 Perhaps I can not use it at all for surgery, though 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:03.329
 Cool say cormorants Mako use in Toka ne hair show today 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.770
 You can see it with such a stance because there is a way of dynamic cutting 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.849
 I am very thankful 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.430
 I would like to introduce what kind of effects cut from now on 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:19.060
 It's a way but I used to say that stroke cut before 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:21.460
 Cut indebted this I Chinepasu' path Pasun for his thought before the perspectives not pull the hair bundle 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.260
 I explained, though 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:32.920
 The effect cut is the opposite of pressing the back of the reverse hand this time 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:35.980
 When you go to this scalp with the back of this hand up, it will push this again when you pass good path run + + 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.840
 It is I feel it 's opening and closing the perspectives when 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.450
 In I do not the same as how to hold a do you Kedomo No normal stroke cut the region is 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.450
 Senic 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:49.760
 Put on a TV and feel the birthrate is declining 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:54.709
 Index finger and middle finger Guidelines two fingers later finger is feeling like this to put in 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:58.519
 It's like I'm going to go here like this, and I 'm holding it like this, yes 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.440
 This movement is very difficult unlike the slope again 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.180
 Well probably Kedomo I was using a U-shaped with a hair show 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.219
 I can not do it properly 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.849
 I think it will be a very difficult technique because it can not even be done by a hairdresser 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:13.349
 But also 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:17.480
 That I think that it is a difficult cut to get only by the coolness of the name 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.480
 I think that I want to know the shop several times 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.400
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.970
 Hmm 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:37.280
 It is so practical that it is probably looking at the way of effect cut by saying 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.750
 I think there is no, but I do something like this at a hair show in a beauty school 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.990
 In a feeling of saying 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:48.210
 Well this is the last in the hair show series, but I have one more pattern today 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:51.870

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:55.650

 I already turned twenty years old and I was a teenager l 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.710
 Or rather in I think would like to further more and more out of a high-quality video 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.980
 I want to keep trying youtube 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.280
