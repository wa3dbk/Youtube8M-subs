00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.380 
get a little smoky so if you can't open
up<00:02:15.130> your<00:02:15.250> windows<00:02:15.580> or<00:02:15.790> turn<00:02:16.030> your<00:02:16.150> fan<00:02:16.330> on<00:02:18.390> all

right you can see it's browning nicely

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.400 
right you can see it's browning nicely
just<00:02:21.580> keep<00:02:21.790> rotating<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:22.360> around<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:23.080> can<00:02:23.230> see

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
just keep rotating it around you can see

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.870 
just keep rotating it around you can see
it's<00:02:23.500> getting<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.770> little<00:02:23.920> smoky<00:02:24.340> it's<00:02:24.760> gonna

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
it's getting a little smoky it's gonna

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.380 
it's getting a little smoky it's gonna
happen<00:02:26.520> let's<00:02:27.520> say<00:02:27.580> that's<00:02:27.820> good<00:02:28.030> enough<00:02:28.090> for

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
happen let's say that's good enough for

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.020 
happen let's say that's good enough for
the<00:02:28.480> fat<00:02:28.840> cap<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.380> I<00:02:29.440> will<00:02:29.560> just<00:02:29.710> put<00:02:30.580> one<00:02:30.760> side

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
the fat cap and I will just put one side

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.720 
the fat cap and I will just put one side
in<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:32.590> let<00:02:32.710> that<00:02:32.890> go<00:02:33.070> for<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.340> minute<00:02:33.490> or<00:02:33.700> two

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
in and let that go for a minute or two

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.860 
in and let that go for a minute or two
get<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.090> nice<00:02:34.270> char<00:02:34.840> on<00:02:34.870> there<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.300> is<00:02:37.360> this

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
get a nice char on there so this is this

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.420 
get a nice char on there so this is this
is<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:38.260> hardest<00:02:38.560> part<00:02:38.800> of<00:02:38.920> this<00:02:38.980> whole<00:02:39.070> job

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
is the hardest part of this whole job

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.340 
is the hardest part of this whole job
really<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:39.970> taking<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.600> off<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.870> bones<00:02:41.110> and

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
really is taking it off the bones and

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.570 
really is taking it off the bones and
browning<00:02:41.530> it<00:02:41.770> because<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.160> rest<00:02:42.340> of<00:02:42.490> the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
browning it because the rest of the

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.940 
browning it because the rest of the
recipe<00:02:42.730> is<00:02:43.720> really<00:02:44.110> pretty<00:02:44.260> easy<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:44.770> just

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
recipe is really pretty easy you just

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.740 
recipe is really pretty easy you just
put<00:02:45.100> it<00:02:45.190> in<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.730> just<00:02:45.940> put<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:46.210> in<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.420> oven<00:02:46.540> on

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
put it in you just put it in the oven on

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.140 
put it in you just put it in the oven on
200<00:02:46.990> degrees<00:02:47.470> for<00:02:47.770> about<00:02:47.980> 4<00:02:48.220> or<00:02:48.250> 5<00:02:48.340> hours<00:02:48.490> and

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
200 degrees for about 4 or 5 hours and

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.810 
200 degrees for about 4 or 5 hours and
let<00:02:49.990> it<00:02:50.110> cook<00:02:50.260> you<00:02:51.040> can<00:02:51.190> see<00:02:51.370> it's<00:02:51.520> got<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.670> nice

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
let it cook you can see it's got a nice

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.550 
let it cook you can see it's got a nice
char<00:02:52.120> on<00:02:52.330> that<00:02:52.480> surface<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.110> we'll<00:02:53.200> do<00:02:53.440> the

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
char on that surface and we'll do the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.320 
char on that surface and we'll do the
same<00:02:53.740> thing<00:02:53.800> on<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.220> other<00:02:54.280> side<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:54.940> then

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
same thing on the other side and then

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.490 
same thing on the other side and then
I'll<00:02:55.450> tie<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.690> back<00:02:55.840> on<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.170> bones

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
I'll tie it back on the bones

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.320 
I'll tie it back on the bones
