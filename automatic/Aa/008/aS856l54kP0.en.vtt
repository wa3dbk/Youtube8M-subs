breaking<00:02:31.010> bubbles<00:02:31.480> rolling<00:02:32.480> around<00:02:32.890> should

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
breaking bubbles rolling around should

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.100 
breaking bubbles rolling around should
be<00:02:34.010> closed

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
be closed

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:44.790

we're<00:02:45.280> gonna<00:02:45.370> try<00:02:45.730> another<00:02:46.330> test<00:02:46.660> with<00:02:46.900> the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
we're gonna try another test with the

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.339 
we're gonna try another test with the
two<00:02:49.110> holes<00:02:49.349> unplugged<00:02:50.599> see<00:02:51.599> if<00:02:51.689> we<00:02:51.780> get<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.989> perk

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
two holes unplugged see if we get a perk

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.920 
two holes unplugged see if we get a perk
of<00:02:52.439> all<00:02:52.650> time<00:02:52.920> this<00:02:53.099> is<00:02:53.220> looking<00:02:53.459> like<00:02:53.930> seven

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
of all time this is looking like seven

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.660 
of all time this is looking like seven
minute<00:02:55.140> I'm<00:02:55.560> almost

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.170 

all<00:03:01.090> right<00:03:01.830> we're<00:03:02.830> at<00:03:02.970> seven<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.150> half

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
all right we're at seven and a half

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.080 
all right we're at seven and a half
minutes

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
minutes

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.309 
minutes
go<00:03:07.090> seven<00:03:08.370> call<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.520> 738<00:03:10.740> 738<00:03:11.740> rolling<00:03:12.250> boil<00:03:12.459> a

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
go seven call the 738 738 rolling boil a

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.720 
go seven call the 738 738 rolling boil a
little<00:03:14.319> bit<00:03:14.440> slower<00:03:14.740> I<00:03:14.920> think<00:03:15.250> then<00:03:15.430> with<00:03:15.580> the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
little bit slower I think then with the

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.240 
little bit slower I think then with the
extra<00:03:16.209> holes<00:03:16.360> open<00:03:16.840> but<00:03:17.110> it<00:03:17.800> looks<00:03:18.010> like<00:03:18.100> the

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
extra holes open but it looks like the

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.140 
extra holes open but it looks like the
fuel<00:03:18.520> is<00:03:18.610> gonna<00:03:18.670> last<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.180> lot<00:03:19.300> longer<00:03:19.360> and

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
fuel is gonna last a lot longer and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.730 
fuel is gonna last a lot longer and
we'll<00:03:22.150> give<00:03:22.270> it<00:03:22.300> one<00:03:22.390> more<00:03:22.630> test<00:03:22.870> with<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:23.230> two

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
we'll give it one more test with the two

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.800 
we'll give it one more test with the two
extra<00:03:23.950> holes<00:03:24.010> all<00:03:24.670> right<00:03:24.820> guys<00:03:25.030> two<00:03:25.450> cups<00:03:25.690> of

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
water added a couple of holes in the

they don't have to prime these too much
the<00:03:58.000> guy<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.180> tendency<00:03:58.720> to<00:03:58.810> do<00:03:58.930> that<00:03:59.140> but<00:03:59.500> it

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
the guy a tendency to do that but it

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.789 
the guy a tendency to do that but it
doesn't<00:03:59.860> require<00:04:00.129> much<00:04:00.430> if<00:04:01.180> she<00:04:01.329> goes<00:04:01.799> coming

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
doesn't require much if she goes coming

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.539 
doesn't require much if she goes coming
right<00:04:02.920> down<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:05.019> if<00:04:05.769> you<00:04:05.860> can<00:04:06.010> see<00:04:06.220> inside

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
right down and if you can see inside

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.210 
right down and if you can see inside
what<00:04:06.760> we<00:04:06.849> got<00:04:07.000> is<00:04:07.120> we've<00:04:08.049> got<00:04:08.079> two<00:04:08.650> rows<00:04:08.890> just

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
what we got is we've got two rows just

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.250 
what we got is we've got two rows just
to<00:04:09.370> spread<00:04:09.730> spread<00:04:10.510> that<00:04:10.629> heat<00:04:10.810> out<00:04:10.900> just<00:04:11.140> a

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
to spread spread that heat out just a

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.250 
to spread spread that heat out just a
little<00:04:11.290> more<00:04:12.040> evenly<00:04:12.569> so<00:04:13.569> we<00:04:13.690> got<00:04:13.840> one<00:04:14.049> row<00:04:14.230> on

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
little more evenly so we got one row on

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.129 
little more evenly so we got one row on
one<00:04:14.530> side<00:04:14.739> one<00:04:15.310> row<00:04:15.519> on<00:04:15.579> the<00:04:15.790> other<00:04:15.819> and<00:04:16.600> it

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
one side one row on the other and it

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.640 
one side one row on the other and it
doesn't<00:04:17.440> look<00:04:17.500> like<00:04:17.709> we've<00:04:17.829> got<00:04:17.979> much<00:04:19.650> much

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
doesn't look like we've got much much

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.909 
doesn't look like we've got much much
flame<00:04:20.979> coming<00:04:21.549> off<00:04:21.850> the<00:04:22.270> side<00:04:22.590> it's<00:04:23.590> looking

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
flame coming off the side it's looking

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.580 
flame coming off the side it's looking
pretty<00:04:24.630> pretty<00:04:25.630> decent<00:04:26.050> you<00:04:26.110> can<00:04:26.229> turn<00:04:26.410> this

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
pretty pretty decent you can turn this

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.460 
pretty pretty decent you can turn this
tube<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:27.070> adjust<00:04:27.850> your<00:04:27.970> flame<00:04:28.180> pattern<00:04:28.389> if<00:04:28.990> you

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
tube to adjust your flame pattern if you

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.279 
tube to adjust your flame pattern if you
need<00:04:30.039> to<00:04:30.340> if<00:04:31.150> she's<00:04:31.600> running<00:04:31.780> a<00:04:31.990> little<00:04:32.139> bit

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
need to if she's running a little bit

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.219 
need to if she's running a little bit
low<00:04:32.560> you<00:04:33.460> can<00:04:33.729> turn<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.419> tube<00:04:34.600> to<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.780> side<00:04:35.050> so

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
low you can turn the tube to the side so

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.390 
low you can turn the tube to the side so
that<00:04:35.260> more<00:04:35.530> of<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.680> flame<00:04:35.889> is<00:04:36.039> looking<00:04:36.310> the

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
that more of the flame is looking the

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.029 
that more of the flame is looking the
cigar<00:04:36.760> pot<00:04:37.260> when<00:04:38.260> we<00:04:38.350> got<00:04:38.500> water<00:04:38.680> drip<00:04:38.949> in

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
cigar pot when we got water drip in

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.760 
cigar pot when we got water drip in

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
there yeah

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.430 
there yeah
condensation<00:04:41.770> and<00:04:42.520> up<00:04:42.580> quickly<00:04:43.229> like<00:04:44.229> that

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
condensation and up quickly like that

condensation and up quickly like that
you're<00:04:44.800> you<00:04:44.979> can<00:04:45.130> rotate<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.669> tube<00:04:46.389> to<00:04:46.630> your

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
you're you can rotate the tube to your

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.340 
you're you can rotate the tube to your
delight<00:04:47.199> to<00:04:48.539> kind<00:04:49.539> of<00:04:49.600> kick<00:04:49.750> it<00:04:49.780> up<00:04:49.960> a<00:04:50.050> notch<00:04:50.080> or

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
delight to kind of kick it up a notch or

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.730 
delight to kind of kick it up a notch or
redirect<00:04:50.770> it<00:04:51.960> alright<00:04:52.960> guys<00:04:53.139> there's<00:04:53.620> the

redirect it alright guys there's the

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.340 
redirect it alright guys there's the
flame<00:04:54.070> pattern<00:04:54.490> really<00:04:55.449> cool<00:04:55.840> with<00:04:56.169> the

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
flame pattern really cool with the

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.750 
flame pattern really cool with the
double<00:04:57.160> set<00:04:57.310> of<00:04:57.370> rows<00:04:57.610> and<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:59.470> each<00:05:00.070> flame<00:05:00.550> is

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
double set of rows and the each flame is

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.409 
double set of rows and the each flame is
going<00:05:02.280> away<00:05:03.280> from<00:05:03.340> the<00:05:03.550> middle<00:05:03.789> so<00:05:04.030> you<00:05:04.090> can

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
going away from the middle so you can

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.210 
going away from the middle so you can
see<00:05:04.539> the<00:05:04.660> flame<00:05:04.900> actually<00:05:05.110> goes<00:05:05.650> shoots<00:05:06.010> up<00:05:06.190> to

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
see the flame actually goes shoots up to

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.580 
see the flame actually goes shoots up to
the<00:05:06.400> right<00:05:06.580> and<00:05:06.760> then<00:05:06.930> on<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:08.050> right<00:05:08.199> side<00:05:08.410> and

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
the right and then on the right side and

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.750 
the right and then on the right side and
shoots<00:05:08.800> up<00:05:08.919> and<00:05:09.160> off<00:05:09.220> to<00:05:09.340> the<00:05:09.370> left<00:05:09.610> on<00:05:09.699> the

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
shoots up and off to the left on the

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.890 
shoots up and off to the left on the
left<00:05:09.940> side<00:05:10.120> kind<00:05:11.020> of<00:05:11.139> looks<00:05:11.289> like<00:05:12.479> the<00:05:13.479> broiler

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
left side kind of looks like the broiler

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.170 
left side kind of looks like the broiler
and/or<00:05:14.500> furnace<00:05:14.979> flame<00:05:15.220> it's<00:05:15.490> pretty<00:05:15.970> neat

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
and/or furnace flame it's pretty neat

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.820 
and/or furnace flame it's pretty neat
we'll<00:05:17.020> see<00:05:17.199> how<00:05:17.289> she<00:05:17.320> does<00:05:17.590> for<00:05:17.770> time

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
we'll see how she does for time

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.450 
we'll see how she does for time
no<00:05:20.699> it's<00:05:20.849> not<00:05:20.970> I'm<00:05:21.120> gonna<00:05:21.349> do<00:05:22.349> a<00:05:22.379> little<00:05:22.590> thing

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
no it's not I'm gonna do a little thing

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.920 
no it's not I'm gonna do a little thing
there<00:05:23.610> a<00:05:23.669> little<00:05:23.910> light<00:05:24.060> boil<00:05:24.330> it's<00:05:25.199> at<00:05:25.849> 4:37

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
there a little light boil it's at 4:37

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.969 
there a little light boil it's at 4:37
looks<00:05:27.930> like<00:05:28.050> it's<00:05:28.199> gonna<00:05:28.289> be<00:05:28.440> quicker<00:05:28.710> than

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
looks like it's gonna be quicker than

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.240 
looks like it's gonna be quicker than
the<00:05:29.129> single<00:05:29.460> row<00:05:30.020> car<00:05:31.020> in<00:05:31.139> there<00:05:31.259> at<00:05:31.379> 7-7

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
the single row car in there at 7-7

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.520 
the single row car in there at 7-7
minutes<00:05:32.690> and<00:05:33.690> you<00:05:33.750> get<00:05:33.900> your<00:05:34.050> rolling<00:05:34.319> boil

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
minutes and you get your rolling boil

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.969 
minutes and you get your rolling boil
it's<00:05:34.680> about<00:05:34.800> a<00:05:34.860> half<00:05:35.099> minute<00:05:35.310> faster<00:05:36.979> perhaps

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
it's about a half minute faster perhaps

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.379 
it's about a half minute faster perhaps
even<00:05:38.340> more<00:05:38.759> but<00:05:39.659> you're<00:05:40.080> gonna<00:05:40.169> be<00:05:40.650> using

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 
even more but you're gonna be using

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:45.349 
even more but you're gonna be using
three<00:05:42.389> quarters<00:05:42.690> of<00:05:42.720> an<00:05:42.900> ounce<00:05:42.990> of<00:05:43.139> fuel
