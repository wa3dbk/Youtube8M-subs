you can see I don't quite have 4500 bc

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.439 
you can see I don't quite have 4500 bc
but<00:00:25.949> when<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.130> sell<00:00:26.430> items<00:00:26.609> out<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.000> my<00:00:27.180> packs

but when I sell items out of my packs

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.630 
but when I sell items out of my packs
I'm<00:00:27.750> going<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.960> get<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.830> difference<00:00:29.220> made<00:00:29.490> up

I'm going to get the difference made up
to<00:00:29.820> me<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.390> will<00:00:30.570> ultimately<00:00:30.960> allow<00:00:31.500> me

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
to me so that will ultimately allow me

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
to this method or you're wondering how

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.340 
to this method or you're wondering how
effective<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.420> I'm<00:00:39.420> here<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.780> tell<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:39.989> I

effective is it I'm here to tell you I

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.700 
effective is it I'm here to tell you I
like<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:42.420> reason<00:00:42.540> why<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.870> better

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
like it and the reason why is better

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.029 
like it and the reason why is better
than<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.399> going<00:00:44.670> through<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:46.050> know<00:00:46.079> 50,000

legends<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.270> with<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.110> method<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.920> go<00:00:56.250> and

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
legends and with this method you go and

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.420 
legends and with this method you go and
buy<00:00:56.899> three<00:00:57.899> gold<00:00:58.140> packs<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.800> then<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.190> wait

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
buy three gold packs and then you wait

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.880 
buy three gold packs and then you wait
roughly<00:01:00.359> 20<00:01:00.690> minutes<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.199> then<00:01:01.379> if<00:01:01.710> you

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
roughly 20 minutes and then if you

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.070 
roughly 20 minutes and then if you
choose<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.300> can<00:01:03.600> repeat<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
choose to do so you can repeat the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.530 
choose to do so you can repeat the
process<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:05.250> what<00:01:05.430> mighty<00:01:05.909> murs<00:01:06.240> need<00:01:06.450> to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
process and what mighty murs need to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.210 
process and what mighty murs need to
realize<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.229> there's<00:01:07.500> certain<00:01:07.650> periods

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
realize is that there's certain periods

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.550 
realize is that there's certain periods
of<00:01:08.310> time<00:01:08.490> during<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.909> day<00:01:09.119> where<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.960> chance

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
of time during the day where the chance

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.100 
of time during the day where the chance
of<00:01:10.710> getting<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.040> gold<00:01:11.189> legend<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:12.110> dramatically

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
of getting a gold legend is dramatically

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.840 
of getting a gold legend is dramatically
increased<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.950> there's<00:01:14.159> other<00:01:14.280> periods<00:01:14.729> of

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
increased and there's other periods of

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.910 
increased and there's other periods of
time<00:01:15.299> during<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.630> day<00:01:15.780> where<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.470> almost

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
time during a day where it's almost

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.890 
time during a day where it's almost
impossible<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.909> get<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> gold<00:01:18.299> legend<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.750> also

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
impossible to get a gold legend I also

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.460 
impossible to get a gold legend I also
believe<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:20.720> strength<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.900> those<00:01:22.049> legends

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
believe the strength of those legends

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.170 
believe the strength of those legends
let's<00:01:22.920> say<00:01:23.070> their<00:01:23.220> overall<00:01:23.580> rating<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.060> you

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
let's say their overall rating if you

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.600 
let's say their overall rating if you
will<00:01:24.560> increases<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.710> decreases<00:01:25.799> throughout

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
will increases and decreases throughout

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.760 
will increases and decreases throughout
the<00:01:26.729> day<00:01:26.850> as<00:01:27.000> well<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.540> match<00:01:28.020> their

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
the day as well to match their

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.399 
the day as well to match their
availability<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.790> you'll<00:01:30.570> go<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.079> forms

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
availability so you'll go on the forms

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.980 
availability so you'll go on the forms
and<00:01:31.530> read<00:01:31.710> very<00:01:32.400> short<00:01:32.850> period<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.210> time<00:01:33.270> three

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
and read very short period of time three

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.539 
and read very short period of time three

within<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.909> ten-minute<00:01:36.329> period<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.810> then<00:01:37.049> you

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
within a ten-minute period and then you

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.899 
within a ten-minute period and then you
go<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.890> forms<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.280> other<00:01:38.400> periods<00:01:38.820> of

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
go on to the forms of other periods of

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.569 
go on to the forms of other periods of
time<00:01:39.060> find<00:01:39.509> out<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:40.280> nobody's<00:01:41.280> gotten<00:01:41.520> a

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
time find out that nobody's gotten a

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.960 
time find out that nobody's gotten a
gold<00:01:41.729> legend<00:01:42.240> within<00:01:42.960> hour<00:01:43.610> so<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.790> makes

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
gold legend within hour so it makes

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.690 
gold legend within hour so it makes
sense<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.540> average<00:01:46.049> out<00:01:46.229> your<00:01:46.829> expenditures

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
sense to average out your expenditures

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.830 
sense to average out your expenditures
over<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.329> day<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.750> vc<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:50.189> therefore<00:01:50.689> you<00:01:51.689> may

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
over the day of vc and therefore you may

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.679 
over the day of vc and therefore you may
come<00:01:52.740> up<00:01:52.890> short<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.850> know<00:01:53.970> time<00:01:54.210> after<00:01:54.479> time

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
come up short you know time after time

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.100 
come up short you know time after time
but<00:01:55.009> over<00:01:56.009> time<00:01:56.280> your<00:01:57.060> chances<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.689> getting<00:01:57.810> a

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110
