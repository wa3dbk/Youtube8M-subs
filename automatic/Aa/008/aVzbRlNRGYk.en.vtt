00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
California is very difficult so a lot of

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.590 
California is very difficult so a lot of
times<00:01:31.430> you'll<00:01:31.579> catch<00:01:31.759> a<00:01:31.850> nice<00:01:32.000> limit<00:01:32.299> of<00:01:32.360> spots

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
times you'll catch a nice limit of spots

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.210 
times you'll catch a nice limit of spots
but<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:32.930> need<00:01:33.079> that<00:01:33.110> kick<00:01:33.409> or<00:01:33.530> largemouth<00:01:33.920> so

here that I seen on my graph and there's
some<00:02:09.410> nice<00:02:09.530> arcs<00:02:09.920> here<00:02:09.979> so<00:02:10.250> I'm<00:02:10.460> gonna<00:02:10.880> start

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
some nice arcs here so I'm gonna start

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.300 
some nice arcs here so I'm gonna start
tolling<00:02:11.660> this<00:02:11.750> jig<00:02:11.990> a<00:02:12.140> little<00:02:12.350> bit<00:02:12.470> see<00:02:13.130> if<00:02:13.190> we

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
tolling this jig a little bit see if we

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.080 
tolling this jig a little bit see if we
catch<00:02:13.580> some<00:02:13.730> active<00:02:14.090> fish<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.600> then<00:02:15.910> maybe<00:02:16.910> go

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
catch some active fish and then maybe go

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
Lake area is key in other words I might

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.680 
Lake area is key in other words I might
not<00:03:22.040> catch<00:03:22.220> them<00:03:22.370> on<00:03:22.489> a<00:03:22.519> jig<00:03:22.760> here<00:03:23.030> but<00:03:23.540> maybe

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
not catch them on a jig here but maybe

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.970 
not catch them on a jig here but maybe
two<00:03:23.930> miles<00:03:24.140> down<00:03:24.319> the<00:03:24.440> lake<00:03:24.590> they're<00:03:24.800> just

two miles down the lake they're just
killing<00:03:25.489> it<00:03:25.700> so<00:03:25.910> it<00:03:26.690> kind<00:03:26.870> of<00:03:26.900> bounced<00:03:27.110> around

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
killing it so it kind of bounced around

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.819 
killing it so it kind of bounced around
but<00:03:27.650> also<00:03:27.799> apply<00:03:28.160> some<00:03:28.190> different<00:03:28.459> techniques

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
but also apply some different techniques

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
little chartreuse in it it's really

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.850 
little chartreuse in it it's really
effective<00:03:47.030> for<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.239> spotted<00:03:47.570> bass<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:48.500> little

up<00:05:40.610> in<00:05:41.300> other<00:05:41.630> words<00:05:41.840> it<00:05:41.990> doesn't<00:05:42.169> get<00:05:42.410> wrapped

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
up in other words it doesn't get wrapped

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.680 
up in other words it doesn't get wrapped
around<00:05:42.830> and<00:05:43.430> come<00:05:43.970> back<00:05:44.120> and<00:05:44.330> you<00:05:44.390> stick<00:05:44.660> the

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
around and come back and you stick the

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.630 
around and come back and you stick the
pork<00:05:45.020> instead<00:05:45.320> of<00:05:45.410> the<00:05:45.500> fish<00:05:45.740> so<00:05:46.340> that<00:05:46.460> little

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
pork instead of the fish so that little

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.340 
pork instead of the fish so that little
tip<00:05:46.880> right<00:05:46.910> there<00:05:47.090> will<00:05:47.390> get<00:05:47.540> you<00:05:47.720> more<00:05:47.870> more

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
tip right there will get you more more

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.750 
tip right there will get you more more
fish<00:05:48.590> in<00:05:48.710> the<00:05:48.740> boats<00:05:49.040> especially<00:05:49.220> when<00:05:49.640> you're

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
fish in the boats especially when you're

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.090 
fish in the boats especially when you're
throwing<00:05:49.940> port<00:05:50.210> so<00:05:51.020> we're<00:05:51.500> gonna<00:05:51.620> move<00:05:51.800> on<00:05:51.950> to

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
throwing port so we're gonna move on to

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.680 
throwing port so we're gonna move on to
a<00:05:52.130> next<00:05:52.310> spot<00:05:52.580> and<00:05:52.970> see<00:05:53.180> if<00:05:53.240> we<00:05:53.330> can't<00:05:53.540> catch

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
a next spot and see if we can't catch

00:05:53.690 --> 00:06:04.409 
a next spot and see if we can't catch
them<00:05:53.840> more

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.810 

there's<00:06:05.419> a<00:06:05.479> fish<00:06:05.690> on<00:06:05.900> a<00:06:05.930> drop<00:06:06.260> shot<00:06:06.639> scene<00:06:07.639> one

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
there's a fish on a drop shot scene one

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.480 
there's a fish on a drop shot scene one
isolated<00:06:08.180> fish<00:06:08.630> so<00:06:08.810> far<00:06:09.070> and<00:06:10.070> I<00:06:10.130> think<00:06:10.370> it's

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
isolated fish so far and I think it's

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.180 
isolated fish so far and I think it's
probably<00:06:10.790> this<00:06:10.880> fish
