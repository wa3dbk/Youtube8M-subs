during that song I don't think they were
singing<00:00:31.019> about<00:00:31.260> puffing<00:00:32.130> cigarettes<00:00:32.579> but

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
singing about puffing cigarettes but

it's a great place for me to teach you
about<00:00:34.800> cigarette<00:00:35.579> puffing<00:00:35.940> I've<00:00:36.630> had

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
about cigarette puffing I've had

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.900 
about cigarette puffing I've had
hundreds<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.350> clients<00:00:37.559> over<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.860> years<00:00:37.950> who

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
hundreds of clients over the years who

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.430 
hundreds of clients over the years who
want<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.149> start<00:00:39.329> an<00:00:39.420> exercise<00:00:39.480> program<00:00:39.780> who

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
want to start an exercise program who

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.200 
want to start an exercise program who
aren't<00:00:40.800> ready<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.129> completely<00:00:41.489> stop<00:00:41.760> smoking

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
aren't ready to completely stop smoking

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.790 
aren't ready to completely stop smoking
and<00:00:42.239> that's<00:00:42.420> okay<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:42.960> gradually<00:00:43.440> reduce

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
and that's okay you can gradually reduce

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.990 
and that's okay you can gradually reduce
your<00:00:44.010> consumption<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.460> cigarette<00:00:44.760> smoking

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
your consumption of cigarette smoking

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.940 
your consumption of cigarette smoking
but<00:00:45.780> there's<00:00:45.930> two<00:00:46.140> important<00:00:46.530> principles<00:00:46.860> you

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
but there's two important principles you

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.470 
but there's two important principles you
want<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.160> remember<00:00:47.340> when<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.210> begin<00:00:48.360> an

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
want to remember when you begin an

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.270 
want to remember when you begin an
exercise<00:00:48.690> program<00:00:49.020> if<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:49.590> smoke<00:00:49.860> one

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
exercise program if you do smoke one

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.430 
exercise program if you do smoke one
don't<00:00:50.640> smoke<00:00:50.820> before<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.239> exercise<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.930> two

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
don't smoke before you exercise and two

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.590 
don't smoke before you exercise and two
don't<00:00:53.070> smoke<00:00:53.250> out<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.489> exercise<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.480> has

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
don't smoke out the exercise and it has

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.880 
don't smoke out the exercise and it has
to<00:00:54.629> do<00:00:54.840> with<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.050> affinity<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.500> carbon
