00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.930
 hello stratifying friends today I'm a 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.540
 unusual site I do not think we're going 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.720
 to do many more videos here I am in 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.340
 germany in a village near bremen and 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.530
 I came here because they invited us 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.140
 all in a small band of gypsy jazz 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.509
 and they have invited us to play in a small 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.950
 festival of street artists and giving 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.540
 a tour of the town turns out that 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.970
 It has some very cool spots and they are 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.490
 perfect for recording a small video 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.890
 with some sounds of nature I am 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.229
 Noise will be the wind or the ducks or 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.810
 mosquitoes and let's touch this little 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.910
 music fragment is so environmental and 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.970
 relaxed that reminds me above 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:37.590
 how am I here in the middle 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:41.700
 a little girl adventure to that music 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.799
 of the forest let's see it 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.079
 many times when we want to touch something 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.090
 and give another meaning to the usual 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.219
 have we are going to have to look a little 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.409
 the chords here I'm really playing 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:54.560
 a greater fa 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.420
 12 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.730
 a sun 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.250
 and as a the sustained 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.170
 this is the background but of course try 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.300
 look for something that sounds more special and more 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.720
 mystic and the biggest fa I'm putting 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.720
 this 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:19.280
 fret 8 for this day saves the air 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.280
 Fret well and keep the air 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.720
 this generates a very special sound for 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.770
 the ropes to the air that create great 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.770
 onstar interval 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.100
 I'm doing a fifth second 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.300
 third 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.660
 dead and then sixth and second first and 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.660
 second 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.470
 the second contribution that was deep 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.439
 I'm going to put it here too I'm going to play 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.680
 all the time with the same grace of 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:06.090
 that the first and the third one are that 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.019
 they are part of the court of two they 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.080
 they stay on the air and I put in a lot that would be 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.930
 the tonic do 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.740
 this one that is on the fret 9 good on the 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.069
 fifth I do not put anything 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.040
 the trail 9 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.840
 I put finger 3 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.049
 this would be like the seventh how to do 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.049
 A) Yes 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.450
 then rope to the air fret 8 string to the 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.170
 air at the end if I do the same arpeggio 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.170
 from before it would be 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:44.480
 he had not said a sun 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.480
 and I'm going to put the sun like this 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.470
 it's as if we take it from here 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.600
 without the tonic note from the if a 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:57.010
 investment here 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.010
 then I have 7 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:04.670
 7 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.300
 8 and for giving air at the very end arpeggio 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.300
 it sounds like this 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.680
 and to give it a different sound 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.350
 last chord is a change I would find 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.370
 as within the tonality and it's back 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.320
 to put the same position that we have 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.680
 put on the dow 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:28.080
 as seventh major finger in the sharp 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.009
 it had a sound with a little more magical and 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.009
 do the same arpeggio 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.940
 you can play it with arpeggios or 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.420
 it would be pretty cool to do it with 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.420
 rhythm in plan 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.650
 I would be going for a walk now 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.810
 through the woods these to see if I find 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.640
 something around here that by the way lost the 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.710
 tuner now takes a squirrel a 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.710
 Gnome something to see if I catch it until then
