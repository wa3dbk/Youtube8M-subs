00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
so he started labeling this product and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.290 
so he started labeling this product and
it<00:01:08.360> kind<00:01:08.540> of<00:01:08.600> stuck<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:09.080> the<00:01:09.200> finish<00:01:09.470> and<00:01:09.920> life

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
it kind of stuck to the finish and life

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.140 
it kind of stuck to the finish and life
it<00:01:12.140> does<00:01:12.320> feature<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.740> small<00:01:13.070> hole<00:01:13.310> next<00:01:13.850> to<00:01:14.000> the

this knife is doubly distal taper
tonight<00:01:24.680> I<00:01:24.860> don't<00:01:24.920> know<00:01:25.100> if<00:01:25.190> you<00:01:25.280> can<00:01:25.430> get<00:01:25.580> this

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
tonight I don't know if you can get this

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.030 
tonight I don't know if you can get this
on<00:01:25.910> film<00:01:26.090> very<00:01:26.300> well<00:01:26.390> but<00:01:26.750> if<00:01:27.200> I<00:01:27.290> double<00:01:27.350> distal

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.700 
taper
what<00:01:28.910> I<00:01:28.940> need<00:01:29.180> is<00:01:29.300> that<00:01:29.480> it<00:01:29.600> tapers<00:01:30.380> from<00:01:30.560> the

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
what I need is that it tapers from the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.460 
what I need is that it tapers from the
spine<00:01:30.980> to<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.340> edge<00:01:31.550> thinner<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:32.930> then<00:01:33.140> that

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
spine to the edge thinner and then that

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.200 
spine to the edge thinner and then that
also<00:01:34.870> hard<00:01:35.870> to<00:01:35.900> see<00:01:36.140> in<00:01:36.230> this<00:01:36.350> direction<00:01:37.210> it

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
also hard to see in this direction it

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.340 
also hard to see in this direction it
tapers<00:01:38.600> from<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.840> spine

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
tapers from the spine

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.470 
tapers from the spine
this<00:01:39.500> way<00:01:39.680> and<00:01:39.980> it<00:01:40.490> also<00:01:40.640> tapers<00:01:41.180> from<00:01:41.360> the

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
this way and it also tapers from the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.320 
this way and it also tapers from the
tang<00:01:41.690> to<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.170> tip<00:01:42.410> and<00:01:42.910> double<00:01:43.910> distal

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
tang to the tip and double distal

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.300 
tang to the tip and double distal
tapering<00:01:44.750> is<00:01:44.930> a<00:01:44.960> very<00:01:45.260> intense<00:01:45.650> process<00:01:45.860> for

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
tapering is a very intense process for

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.370 
tapering is a very intense process for
manufacturing<00:01:46.460> a<00:01:47.090> death<00:01:47.420> does<00:01:47.720> add<00:01:47.990> to<00:01:48.350> the

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
manufacturing a death does add to the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.800 
manufacturing a death does add to the
cost<00:01:48.710> of<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:48.980> product<00:01:49.430> what<00:01:50.360> it<00:01:50.450> makes<00:01:50.630> the

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
cost of the product what it makes the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.160 
cost of the product what it makes the
