00:00:13.874 --> 00:00:16.998
 When we are born, the world stands upside down, literally! 

00:00:17.462 --> 00:00:20.969
 That is how newborns see their brains until their brains learn to reverse the image, 

00:00:21.507 --> 00:00:23.338
 which reaches them from the retina of the eye. 

00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:26.658
 Sight provides us with a lot of information about the world around us, 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.849
 but can we always rely on it? 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.249
 Which of these lines is longer? 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.198
 It seems that the one on the left. 

00:00:33.537 --> 00:00:36.085
 The correct answer: they are the same length! 

00:00:36.455 --> 00:00:40.085
 But this is not the only distortion of the information that our eyes provide. 

00:00:40.426 --> 00:00:43.585
 In traditional color TVs or LCD monitors 

00:00:43.894 --> 00:00:47.236
 the limited resolving power of the human eye is used. 

00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:49.652
 Pixels that are close to each other, 

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:51.935
 viewed from a sufficiently large distance, 

00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:53.875
 they are received as one point. 

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:57.351
 Everything we look at is really an echo of the past. 

00:00:57.728 --> 00:00:59.676
 Light has a specific distance to overcome 

00:01:00.014 --> 00:01:03.479
 from the moment of rebounding, for example from my hand to reaching my eyes. 

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:05.970
 Of course, this is a very small distance, 

00:01:06.198 --> 00:01:09.022
 that's why I see my hand almost in real time. 

00:01:09.307 --> 00:01:11.301
 Differences only apply to fractional seconds. 

00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:14.053
 However, the greater the distance has light to overcome 

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:15.865
 we will see the further past. 

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:17.922
 For example, now if we had a telescope 

00:01:18.227 --> 00:01:20.146
 and they directed him towards the star Sirius, 

00:01:20.397 --> 00:01:22.533
 we would see his picture from 8 years ago! 

00:01:23.286 --> 00:01:26.482
 There is a place on the retina, which is called a blind spot, 

00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:31.058
 there is the output of the blood vessels and the optic nerve fibers converge. 

00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:35.240
 There are no photoreceptors that are responsible for receiving light waves. 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.430
 We will make a short test, thanks to which you will discover ... 

00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:40.089
 your blind spot. 

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:44.528
 Cover your left eye, look at the cross and do not take your eyes off him, 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.591
 zooms slowly to the screen and zoom out, 

00:01:48.839 --> 00:01:51.302
 at some point the circle should disappear. 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.239
 But why when looking at every day, 

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:58.493
 we do not have the impression of a missing image? 

00:01:59.046 --> 00:02:04.345
 First of all, when you look with two eyes, the blind spots of both eyes do not coincide in the field of view. 

00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:07.958
 Secondly: the eyeballs are making small movements, 

00:02:08.424 --> 00:02:11.532
 therefore, blind spots are constantly directed to another place. 

00:02:12.082 --> 00:02:17.747
 Thirdly: the missing elements are replenished by the brain from the immediate vicinity of the macula. 

00:02:18.433 --> 00:02:20.213
 What is the color vision? 

00:02:20.623 --> 00:02:22.817
 On the retina are photosensitive cells, 

00:02:23.345 --> 00:02:25.906
 containing three types of visual pigment. 

00:02:26.535 --> 00:02:29.102
 Each of them corresponds to a different range of the light wave, 

00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:31.345
 which stimulates him the most. 

00:02:31.677 --> 00:02:35.832
 Sometimes, however, our photoreceptors malfunction or simply do not have them. 

00:02:36.203 --> 00:02:38.333
 This causes various disturbances in the color vision. 

00:02:38.738 --> 00:02:42.330
 Some people with color-blind people do not realize that they have this disorder, 

00:02:42.673 --> 00:02:46.709
 because there is such an opinion that people with color blind see in shades of gray. 

00:02:47.147 --> 00:02:51.312
 However, this is only in the heaviest variety of daltonism, in monochromatism. 

00:02:52.221 --> 00:02:55.963
 The most common variation of daltonism is deuteranomalia: 

00:02:56.435 --> 00:02:58.375
 people perceive greenery as less saturated, 

00:02:58.735 --> 00:03:01.194
 and red, orange or yellow as greenish. 

00:03:01.574 --> 00:03:03.336
 Now, we'll do a short test, 

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:06.100
 through which you'll find out if you're a color-blind: 

00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:37.381
 OKAY! You can breathe a sigh of relief now, because the last two were a joke, 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.834
 but if you've had a problem reading the numbers before, 

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:44.557
 it means that you have just such a disorder in recognizing colors. 

00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:47.784
 Interestingly, dogs see just like color-blinders, 

00:03:48.285 --> 00:03:50.418
 who do not distinguish between red and green. 

00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:54.821
 In general, dogs see yellow and blue plus shades of gray. 

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:58.248
 We have no problem distinguishing these three colors, 

00:03:58.966 --> 00:04:01.386
 however, when we switch to the dog's perception 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.603
 we notice that it blends with the surroundings very much, 

00:04:05.982 --> 00:04:08.111
 while the blue one is best visible. 

00:04:08.598 --> 00:04:09.966
 Therefore, let's remember about it 

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:13.810
 choosing the next ball for retrieving for our pet :) 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.793
 If we are already in the animal world ... 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:19.649
 I must tell you that our defense mechanism of the eye 

00:04:20.015 --> 00:04:22.926
 in the form of eyelids, eyelashes and tears, they seem to be very innocent, 

00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:26.085
 compared to what this lizard has. 

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:29.139
 At times of danger, he can shoot blood from his eyes. 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.068
 The distance to which such a stream can reach is 1.2 m 

00:04:35.786 --> 00:04:37.913
 Visible light that is perceived by our eye 

00:04:38.241 --> 00:04:42.879
 it lies within a narrow range from 380 nm to 780 nm. 

00:04:43.456 --> 00:04:45.853
 We can not see in the infrared without instruments. 

00:04:46.142 --> 00:04:48.666
 in ultraviolet, in x-ray or gamma radiation. 

00:04:49.102 --> 00:04:50.949
 However, even this narrow range 

00:04:51.231 --> 00:04:53.932
 it provides us with so many amazing visual stimuli. 

00:04:54.568 --> 00:04:56.533
 That's all for today, thank you for watching 

00:04:56.834 --> 00:04:59.034
 and I invite you to the next episode.
