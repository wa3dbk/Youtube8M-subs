00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.800 
this ROM is GPS but I'm not using it
much<00:01:52.520> so<00:01:52.929> this<00:01:53.929> would<00:01:54.170> be<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:54.649> and<00:01:55.149> this<00:01:56.149> ROM<00:01:56.600> is

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
much so this would be it and this ROM is

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.249 
much so this would be it and this ROM is
really<00:01:57.170> great<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:57.860> it<00:01:58.759> is<00:01:58.819> fast<00:01:59.360> there<00:01:59.869> is<00:02:00.050> not

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.669 
really great and it is fast there is not
much<00:02:00.619> locks<00:02:01.039> you<00:02:01.340> know<00:02:01.539> it<00:02:02.539> is<00:02:02.720> better<00:02:03.289> build

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
much locks you know it is better build

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.930 
much locks you know it is better build
but<00:02:04.479> it<00:02:05.479> is<00:02:05.869> official<00:02:06.380> of<00:02:06.530> course<00:02:06.800> and<00:02:07.100> when<00:02:07.909> I
