00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:09.210
 we go with the ingredients 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.210
 here we have 4 eggs 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.240
 400 grams of flour 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.289
 300 grams of sugar 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.720
 200 grams of milk 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.480
 150 grams of sunflower oil in this 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.510
 occasion with sunflower oil if 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.220
 you prefer you can use olive oil 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.220
 but soft softer than you find 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.230
 Here we have 15 grams of yeast 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.340
 whole life 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.930
 and three tablespoons of cocoa these are 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.710
 all the ingredients that make us 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.129
 needed to make our cake 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.129
 colour 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.960
 first of all we put in the bowl the 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.960
 eggs 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:09.260
 and it was smoking 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.260
 now this we are going to more 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.810
 another followed by adding the oil 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.850
 and finally 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.850
 the milk 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.390
 here we have all the ingredients 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.390
 liquids 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:53.110
 and now we begin to take the flour 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.110
 let's update 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.610
 this us 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.260
 here we have the yeast 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.990
 and the rest of the flour that we're going to 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:14.680
 add the rest of the flour to yeast 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:19.320
 we're going to improve it and we're going to atomize it and 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.320
 I am so cultured we reserve cocoa 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.030
 we already have everything well mixed 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.030
 and now we pass 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.900
 We spent half 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.800
 at the border 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.080
 here we have the mold we are going to use this 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.220
 we can take approximately then the 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.220
 half or a little more 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.970
 and we are going to extend it 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.240
 now with the rest we will incorporate the 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.240
 traca 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.870
 to one to the other half we add the 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.540
 banana 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.750
 and less well 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.770
 to get the effect of the color that 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.020
 we want 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.110
 to our bicolor cake 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.110
 Y 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.440
 we already have it well mixed and now 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.470
 let's take 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.790
 on the other half of the mass that 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.790
 we already have in the mold 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.330
 let's think carefully we share it 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.510
 the next furnace you will already hear 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.510
 getting warmer 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.810
 because when we finish we will put to 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.600
 talk not when you warm up to 180 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.420
 degrees 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.850
 because this mold is as fat as 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.620
 that is thick 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:58.510
 will come out of a big cake 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.670
 after 30 to 40 minutes we will control 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.000
 Now let's do 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.800
 the drawing 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.250
 that this already depends on the ability of 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.250
 each 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:24.509
 there we have it and now we wait for 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.509
 the oven is hot to put it 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.660
 we do not know so here we have here 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.330
 we have our cake 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.700
 we have taken a little bit of acceptance with 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.950
 above as you see to decorate and we have 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.920
 had 50 minutes on the clock and more everything 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.980
 exactly 50 minutes 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.130
 and now let's cut to see the 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.130
 effect 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.060
 if you notice 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.060
 the color 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:05.380
 of entry 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.380
 You see he's in the center 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:10.520
 around white 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.710
 you have seen depending on the movement 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.300
 that is seen with the 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.969
 with the palette with the spoon with what 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.709
 is used as a drawing other 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:21.510
 and beige and here we have our 

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:24.470
 bicolor cake 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.470
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:27.259
 And until next time 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.740
 goodbye
