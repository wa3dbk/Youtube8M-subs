 other tips I'll be giving here 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.590
 For you it has a direct relationship with your 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.960
 training 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.490
 of course there are many questions is 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.009
 that we could be commenting 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.020
 on overload training in 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.030
 their particularities but I'm going to give 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.470
 some that are essential that you can 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.570
 apply in your day to day 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.740
 the first would be in relation to the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.360
 of movement 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.180
 as long as you have no type 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.850
 of pathology or any muscular injury 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.340
 always seek maximum amplitude in 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.750
 his movements always making of form 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.670
 controlled 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.490
 trying to use a weight that 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.380
 enable you to do the correct 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.899
 that its objective should never be 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.000
 fill the weight machine to fill the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.399
 eyes of those who watch you train 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.119
 you should train for yourself and not for 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.189
 the others 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.590
 this way you will be reaching 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.049
 your target muscles without running any 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.759
 type of risk of injury 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.829
 still with regard to training to 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.509
 you seeking to gain muscle is 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.820
 important that you do not hold the 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.489
 number of repetitions the body does not 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.959
 account it is very common to see that the 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.790
 people are attached to certain 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.990
 I'll give an example a token 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.140
 for example listed there 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.750
 10 12 8 repetitions people end up 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.180
 holding this number and generally not 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.730
 lead the musician to total failure then the 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.620
 tip for you is trainee to failure 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.120
 total of your musician until he does not 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.560
 more this response if the repetitions 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.870
 from 12 were three were 13 14 97 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.360
 regardless of the number always light up the 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.770
 total failure and you will feel on the 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.390
 muscle response 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.700
 what we call daddy in the 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.550
 training and your muscles with certainty 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.740
 will respond growing and the last tip is 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.140
 not least is women for 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.150
 please train your upper limbs 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.100
 it is very common but listen inside the 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.840
 bodybuilding women 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.060
 complaining saying I will not train the 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.610
 arms because they get very strong 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.950
 this is a myth you women produce 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.040
 a very low testosterone 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.480
 which practically does not allow that 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.060
 then this increase in mass 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.070
 then it is necessary that you 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.290
 of this stimulus, but your muscles 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.970
 you have the visual stimulus to realize 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.040
 if the upper limbs are growing 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.720
 too much to do this control and also 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.000
 It's interesting that you give this stimulus 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.130
 even for you to stimulate the loss of 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.900
 fat in this region then you will only have 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.020
 benefits is not even speculation 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.090
 started 15 years ago but the 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.820
 even positive results 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.310
 I saw six years or so that was the 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.000
 from there I began to take seriously the 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.680
 diet and workout is the good rest with 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.530
 my goal is to increase muscle mass 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.020
 because of the category is my coach him 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.970
 notes which phase of the year I twisted is pre 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.680
 championship after championship and so 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.440
 increases the intensity of training or 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.120
 decreases but always varies in all 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.230
 days of the week including Saturday or 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.520
 Sunday 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.600
 along with this I have to stay 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.940
 watching my food a lot 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.710
 because it has to be well regulated and has 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.960
 be exactly every three hours 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.330
 because otherwise I lose lean mass 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.060
 for this I make one before or in the 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.490
 same day in the morning every day I do 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.050
 my food the whole day I 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.080
 I schedule it every three hours 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.150
 put a thermal in a bag and I take 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.530
 wherever I go because I need to reconcile 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.780
 my baby girl, she's two years old 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.310
 now I need to reconcile my husband 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.290
 work and college then 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.180
 if you have no error is the cable did not go to 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.250
 diet because it is a program she could 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.780
 whole and along with that advice 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.450
 also the rest because it is fundamental 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.530
 for those who want great mass what is a 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.150
 good result is in bodybuilding there is sleep 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.010
 I hope this testimony will serve as a 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.570
 encouragement to you that is always 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.090
 seeking transformation but do not quit 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.830
 showing how you're going to do this 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.960
 transformation goes after their 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.850
 goals you can achieve 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.980
