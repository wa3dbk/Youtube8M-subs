00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
that on the HTC One m8 because that for

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.740 
that on the HTC One m8 because that for
some<00:01:58.340> reason<00:01:58.370> that<00:01:58.760> phone<00:01:59.000> is<00:01:59.180> just<00:01:59.299> selling

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
some reason that phone is just selling

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.350 
some reason that phone is just selling
probably<00:02:00.590> well<00:02:00.950> better<00:02:01.220> than<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.549> first<00:02:01.700> HTC

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
probably well better than the first HTC

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.700 
probably well better than the first HTC
when<00:02:02.510> I<00:02:02.540> think<00:02:02.750> people<00:02:02.870> are<00:02:03.049> going<00:02:03.200> it's<00:02:03.650> a

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
when I think people are going it's a

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.380 
when I think people are going it's a
little<00:02:03.860> sexier<00:02:04.460> it's<00:02:04.580> a<00:02:04.640> little<00:02:04.850> slicker<00:02:05.150> and

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
little sexier it's a little slicker and

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.990 
little sexier it's a little slicker and
it's<00:02:05.900> because<00:02:06.260> of<00:02:06.290> gary<00:02:06.680> oldman<00:02:06.950> gary<00:02:07.729> oldman

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
it's because of gary oldman gary oldman

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.490 
it's because of gary oldman gary oldman
i<00:02:08.270> think<00:02:08.450> that's<00:02:08.630> part<00:02:08.840> of<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:08.959> reason<00:02:09.110> i<00:02:09.380> mean

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
i think that's part of the reason i mean

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.280 
i think that's part of the reason i mean
it's<00:02:09.679> sad<00:02:09.920> that<00:02:09.979> Robert<00:02:10.910> Downey<00:02:11.060> jr.<00:02:11.510> when

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290
