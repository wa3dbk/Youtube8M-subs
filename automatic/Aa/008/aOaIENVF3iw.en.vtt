00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
differently and so depending on the

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.360 
differently and so depending on the
singer<00:06:43.690> you<00:06:44.080> want<00:06:44.259> to<00:06:44.350> have<00:06:44.500> some<00:06:45.039> different

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
singer you want to have some different

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:49.389 
everybody's voice sounds a little bit

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:52.409 
everybody's voice sounds a little bit
different<00:06:49.840> depending<00:06:49.930> on<00:06:50.229> on<00:06:51.030> the<00:06:52.030> microphone

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:52.419 
different depending on on the microphone

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:54.659 
different depending on on the microphone
and<00:06:52.870> and<00:06:53.110> each<00:06:53.620> Mike<00:06:53.919> performs<00:06:54.400> a<00:06:54.490> little

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:54.669
