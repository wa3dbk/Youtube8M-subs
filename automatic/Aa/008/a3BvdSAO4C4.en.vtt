00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello friends and youtube subscribers in 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.440
 this video tutorial we will learn to 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.900
 elaborate an origami fish well let's 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.570
 see how it is done first 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.460
 we will need a paper square of 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.150
 color and the size you want 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.830
 well we will fold in half carrying the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.710
 bottom to top 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.820
 and we will take the right side to 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.340
 left 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:32.160
 in this way we rotate our figure 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.730
 in this way taking this tip and 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.730
 bending the 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.140
 in this way unfold emos 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.809
 and what we will do is take the corner 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:47.809
 outward 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.390
 and press in such a way that we stay 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.760
 a triangle well we flipped our 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.900
 figure and we will do the same taking this 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.900
 side by the center 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:11.040
 we press and unfold taking this 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.040
 corner to this corner 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.820
 all right up to get this triangle to 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.120
 then we will take this point towards 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.120
 above 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.980
 and we will double this point taking a little 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.010
 the tip from that fold 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.850
 thus 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.850
 we push 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.820
 and we'll take this tip in half 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.370
 and again we take the tip bending 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.920
 the 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.720
 in this way 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:07.210
 well then we will take this side 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.210
 bending and taking measure of that bend 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.890
 bending out 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.840
 in this way we unfold and put 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.840
 our doubles inside 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:27.170
 ok and we'll take the top tip 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.750
 taking it out 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.750
 until this fold that we have put 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.290
 well we will have this figure bolt e 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.290
 we will make our figure 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.450
 and we will carry out the same steps taking 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.270
 this corner 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.690
 to the top 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.440
 we will turn this corner to this one that 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.440
 we have bent 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.850
 and we go to this side through the center 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.959
 we doubled this point towards 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.959
 behind 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:17.200
 and we will take measure from this side 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.200
 for this fold 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.720
 we bend and lift and put the 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.720
 fold in 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.400
 and finally we take this tip 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.470
 taking it out 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.880
 up to our doubles 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.870
 thus 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.409
 all right 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.860
 finally we will take our figure 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.860
 leading aside 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:52.630
 in this way we turn and take 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:56.170
 this side 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.880
 to finish our good fish friends 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.190
 I hope you liked it, do not forget
