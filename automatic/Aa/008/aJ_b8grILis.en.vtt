00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.580
 Speak, my personal beauty, beauty, but for 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.929
 the games that talk to you and rafa off 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.119
 the video since colleagues and to show 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.740
 some changes in the map of the Andes hit 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.119
 so if you're sure to enjoy 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.859
 leave your taste as it goes 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.510
 help a lot of people then 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.279
 let's go guys the next o many 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.630
 changes are happening in the game is 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.960
 both in terms of items and 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.329
 game map graphics updates 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.250
 visual magic changes are many 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.120
 open discussion on the support of 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.489
 the aris 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.290
 but anyway this is not the focus of the video 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.360
 special here today and I know it's more 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.620
 to show the map changes are 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.440
 forward when you have more 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.640
 more detailed information even 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.469
 people are going to bring it to you, do not 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.570
 worry while our goal is to 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.940
 They bring information to you but not 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.620
 Today's case is more about the same map 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.469
 Taiwan before you ask yourself 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.699
 that part is open for you guys 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.260
 argue with each other 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.570
 one of the changes that I found very 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.880
 cool is the insertion of a new monster 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.770
 the new jungle monster advances and gives you 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.020
 support it rises along with the other 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.810
 neutral boys, except for the bucks 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.900
 than not in 1 55 the other boys 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.909
 205 are born but also together is well 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.960
 stronger than I thought he was. 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.939
 but when you end up swallowing a 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.100
 a little there you end up killing more 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.290
 quickly but well at first I found 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.090
 very strong maybe they go out change 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.490
 guys here in tb it's then the changes 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.020
 from here may change may still suffer 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.950
 some change before going to the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.390
 official server 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.909
 so this is the first change we 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.430
 we already have the second change is about the 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.290
 kill the wizards or the blushes like you 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.090
 call him no matter what matters 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.490
 they changed're walking so tava 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.680
 visual and the change in functional form 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.360
 how is the following before the bush 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.750
 of the saints see that it seemed claudia ohana 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.240
 but now they are smaller 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.490
 They are smaller but the bushes were 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.590
 theses occupied practically the entire border 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.299
 of the land now is no longer personal 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.619
 in the woods were much smaller 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.960
 At least I thought it was said that 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.119
 none as well as animations of 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.099
 When you walk in that bush, it's 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.569
 How did I tell you before the return? 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.590
 through various updates 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.569
 graphics 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.620
 clearly this is one of them. 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.599
 mass much 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.459
 beautiful when you walk in it makes 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.799
 plus a sound and also moves 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.739
 different and in addition in the top line 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.870
 we had there there is a division of the bushes 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.690
 before we had two weeds two 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.989
 brushes separate dispensations in the middle tÃ¡ 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.390
 is equal in the boat and that the new map 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.489
 witches from the top are divided into three 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.799
 they are smaller they are separated two 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.569
 times and I'm clear about whether this 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.060
 will directly influence the 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.920
 hangu singing and goal strategies 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.870
 game I can not even see it with a 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.430
 very radical change, but it is clear that 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.209
 Chinese will you please try to 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.650
 people right 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.930
 something else that has to tell you 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.190
 visually speaking to the hpl bar 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.079
 doll also changed 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.209
 the source of the block also changed the 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.739
 pink glow you your name as only 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.690
 small changes that end up making the 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.180
 game gets heavier and you have to 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.280
 buy the new video card novel 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.540
 to make changes make the 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.190
 lol grow 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.690
 visually speaking to be able to 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.370
 compare with other games that are 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.170
 market because they are competitors of 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.930
 in front of him even I think 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.060
 some parts of the map so different in 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.709
 Your gmp of me setting is different 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.180
 from my server br 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.160
 only I thought the map stayed because 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.739
 the textured in a more beautiful way 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.450
 I do not know if it's my impression or if 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.769
 really a goal but anyway I was 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.120
 I wanted to show you in the video of 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.099
 I hope you liked it today, I will. 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.629
 Try to bring more life to you. 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.239
 information is not necessarily 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:38.069
 discussions but rather the word bring 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.959
 you information that sometimes you 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.489
 know then I think this way that 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.690
 you end up having a range of 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.280
 greater knowledge 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.260
 even if you do not enjoy reading and 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.030
 behind research you end up there if 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.709
 interacting little more with the changes that 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.120
 are happening and that they can also 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.889
 to happen then that's it 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.780
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:57.000
 video about the change but what if 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.919
 I liked your favorite comments and share the 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.919
 Next video I hugged you.
