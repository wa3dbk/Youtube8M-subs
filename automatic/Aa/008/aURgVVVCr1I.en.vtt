00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.670
 good in this tutorial we will see 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.610
 how to play the song that I 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.130
 titled canon 1 this is a 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.900
 significantly simplified arrangement and 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.810
 I even changed the tone that's to 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.220
 to say that before there were two dies in 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.739
 the piece here there is more so 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.779
 how to play it right hand then hand 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.939
 left and then both hands at the same 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.070
 time so for the right hand you have 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.550
 seen that there are indications of fingering at 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.280
 above notes so 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:42.359
 so we start on the acute dmi it's 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.129
 this one can normal me of the acute almi 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:46.410
 this is the one that is written 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.059
 first on the score is hard to 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.850
 this time are white was not bad 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.980
 of white and so we start with the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.899
 finger number 5 on it so when we play 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.940
 to a piece like that as long as there is 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.159
 no other indication of fingering one has to 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.550
 refer to the last indication in 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.640
 dated 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.960
 for example we play the next note 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:09.010
 we see that it's a dream 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.409
 so that's the date before so our 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.570
 little finger will stay above the mit 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.400
 and so that's the fourth finger that goes 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.460
 play when and continue to go down 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.810
 at 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.820
 so as long as there is no indication 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.090
 of fingering I unroll the fingers in 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.280
 the order with the note on which they 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.409
 match and I see that then I 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.570
 the number 2 on the ground alone his note 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.900
 before so I just went through 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.450
 on to make a pivot 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.130
 that's it once I'm done 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.350
 my thumb in front I put my hand 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.780
 still my hand to move so that's my 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.480
 finger that made my hand move and so 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:51.290
 I see that I'm going back 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:53.090
 here I put a 5 on the back while 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.900
 of course we go there it's just 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.850
 to confirm 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.320
 otherwise it's really to confirm that 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.850
 it's good of death must be well 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.080
 arrived on the bench fingers if you 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.800
 do not get over it unless you're 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.800
 overpaid only by 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.080
 or 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.440
 it's going to be the same thing we go through 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.860
 above 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.860
 or 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.860
 or 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.090
 and after 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.750
 my 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.780
 1 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.780
 no 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.040
 we make a pivot that is also what is 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.870
 pivot that will return immediately to his 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.170
 initial position it so 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.180
 1 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.180
 we immediately come back to the back 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.180
 or 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.599
 that's it then we only have one is so 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.670
 our push on the back and that there is 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.870
 no written vote after that is the floor 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.200
 so it's the little finger that gets 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.200
 charge 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.550
 and after you I make a small gap 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.550
 as in the exercise of the informer 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.510
 my 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.410
 etc etc follow well I give you no 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.180
 the whole piece I leave you 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.040
 fiddling for the end all the fingering 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.050
 are written there is no need to 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.750
 move your hand only when there is a 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.520
 to vote fits and tail there are 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.830
 a small indication possibly of 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.200
 moving tomorrow or confirmation of 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.860
 fingering if you do not arrive if you 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.720
 are not above 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.220
 at this point on the right should you 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.290
 may be deceived somewhere so 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.420
 this one allows you to have a good 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.950
 fluency right hand 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:32.580
 this avoids accumulating bad 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.910
 habits for the left hand so 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.970
 then the disagreements they argue the 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:43.650
 discover the accord of doha the first that 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.590
 so it is a C major after one 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.730
 had a 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:51.910
 a linen floor agreement is therefore major 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.709
 only major to play it we will 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.290
 play down the threshold not to 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.519
 go up to the only essen show you 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.090
 notice that we can fool ourselves 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.890
 here you will be here 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.680
 if we go down it all 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.680
 simply time each one or 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.540
 why of time everyone simply 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:13.840
 because the note on which they are 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.209
 facts 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.690
 from a to a 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.519
 2 etc etc so I did not put I did not 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.840
 not said for the right hand but that's it 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.370
 there are white and black the 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:32.040
 white hard time blacks lasts a 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:36.090
 time do it with the metronome 1 2 1 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.320
 2 1 two times 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.120
 2 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.300
 2 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.300
 2 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:51.400
 two camps etc etc 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.400
 and when you get black that makes 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.250
 on all weather 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.280
 no 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.990
 or 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.279
 all 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.550
 et cetera you noticed that all 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.870
 the two years makes it a care all the 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.580
 two blacks on all the white ones 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:18.650
 there is an agreement a new agreement of 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:22.250
 screaming and so the rope safe so many 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.350
 time they finally last it's 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.640
 written that is to say, as long as there is no 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.650
 other written agreements we always play 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.940
 the same 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:32.840
 here every two times it changes so 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:37.690
 so gaming resumes so back of time 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.690
 soil of time we had a minor 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.060
 then it's a minor when that 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.350
 I'm doing it's a 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.350
 minor finally 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.590
 soon 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.200
 a lighthouse 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.849
 and insolent so with both hands in 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.100
 same time this gives this 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:00.400
 2 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.400
 2 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.860
 2 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:04.310
 years 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.310
 2 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.310
 2 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.639
 2 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.639
 1 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.300
 I'm going to the part where there are 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.300
 black 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.930
 see that I play two notes during 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.310
 each grants evil gives it right 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.400
 plays notes while scrambling 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:27.750
 play an agreement so it does not 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.750
 2 it does not change 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.120
 at 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.139
 all 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.820
 in 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:37.030
 1 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.030
 2 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:48.170
 etc etc I wanted to finish the piece by 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.660
 you are here for this first 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:53.930
 piece so the cannon finally this problem 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.340
 this cannon a forgiveness on which I you 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.530
 really advises to respect hold the 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.960
 fingering and then to train you 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.370
 first right hand then my left a 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.510
 Once you're ready for the hand 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.139
 left for you train you do 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.139
 with the metronome 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.820
 what 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.790
 no 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:29.780
 all the chords have been here except the 

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:32.639
 back who is a people and hop the others 

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.900
 the minor I renounce so it's better here 

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:38.940
 because we do not see very well mid 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:42.460
 way so those at the mit and the ski 

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:44.650
 I hope you will arrive 

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.430
 to leave it otherwise do not hesitate to me 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.430
 contact
