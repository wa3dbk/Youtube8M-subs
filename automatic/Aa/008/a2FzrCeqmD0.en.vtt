00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
the season that was really good I

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.920 
the season that was really good I
thought<00:05:13.789> that<00:05:13.970> program<00:05:14.390> was<00:05:14.539> really<00:05:14.840> unique

thought that program was really unique

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.210 
thought that program was really unique
because<00:05:15.140> you<00:05:15.260> don't<00:05:15.470> get<00:05:15.560> to<00:05:15.710> really<00:05:15.830> go<00:05:16.070> to<00:05:16.130> a

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
because you don't get to really go to a

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.560 
because you don't get to really go to a
game<00:05:16.460> if<00:05:16.669> you<00:05:16.789> have<00:05:16.910> hard<00:05:17.120> times<00:05:17.330> financially

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
game if you have hard times financially

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.390 
game if you have hard times financially
right<00:05:18.320> you<00:05:18.470> don't<00:05:18.620> have<00:05:18.740> so<00:05:18.919> many<00:05:19.100> people

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400
