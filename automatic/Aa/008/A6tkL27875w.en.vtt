00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hello people, welcome, one more 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.730
 Video World of electrical channel that 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.919
 video I'll show you and when 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.510
 make the load controller connection 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.230
 to the solar system 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.230
 come on guys 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.439
 the staff will now be demonstrating 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.460
 for you how the connection of the 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.160
 charge controller 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.560
 so I have a charge controller. 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.869
 use instead of a solar panel I go 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.420
 using a direct current source is 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.000
 To simulate the panel here and I'm going 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.910
 use a two- rocket battery at 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.430
 amp t time to be able to do the part of the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.550
 battery the battery connection I already have 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.629
 here the connectors that here is the entrance 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.629
 of the load 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.399
 this from the entrance of the panels in the case 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.309
 vote using the source and this output to the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.710
 battery would still have gone from here to 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.020
 load I could call there in 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.480
 direct current in this personal source 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.390
 configuration I'm going to use it could 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.400
 be directly connected 12 volts but the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.380
 recommended is that an attention be paid to 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.220
 little more than 12 goals so I go 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.689
 use least 12 with three going okay 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.909
 giving and approximately 14 14.3 others 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.950
 More or less he has a fall yes 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.520
 so he gets around 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.210
 14 colts I called my source 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.119
 to robocup the cable that minus 12 and more 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.460
 three 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:39.210
 I have everything ok I 'll connect here on 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.759
 my entry would be from the panel 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.640
 Talk to you, they 'll see that he's going to get 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.140
 red middle oled because it does not have 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.390
 battery on then it is indicating 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.299
 that it has no battery and it will stay 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.290
 flashing here enters the panel and the load is 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.119
 and then when I connect the battery 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.560
 solve what they mean made a car 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.009
 here with the alligator has always been connected to 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.009
 my battery 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.530
 the positive and negative red and then I 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:12.350
 I'll connect to the public. 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.350
 you can see that my battery 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.000
 battery went red because he was 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.070
 giving the charge signal 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.250
 now both the two green signs 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.990
 to say that I'm getting a pension from the 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.720
 the controller and controller is 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.810
 sending it to my battery then the 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.000
 You can measure with the team I have 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.650
 I will leave here, you will see that I am 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.280
 having an attention of 3.91 holds 1 14 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.890
 between -12 plus 3.3 has a fall in 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.440
 Due to the controller're giving me 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:51.030
 a little of that attention, so stay there 14 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.890
 on my battery has more 12.9 13 of 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.250
 Charging my battery 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.070
 This is the average output of my load is 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.080
 scoring 10 because my load did not 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.420
 It's released when I shoot the source. 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.330
 now he is closing from the battery to 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:12.000
 Come back there at my freight exit. 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:17.760
 12.7 approximately the same attention 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.070
 to hit my battery in the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.890
 load controller is relatively 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.950
 simply taking the daughter then has the 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.780
 marriage there between the source is right and 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.790
 batteries carrying my battery there 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.650
 making voltage control that the battery 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.450
 needs to be loaded 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.640
 This one will like this personal video. 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.230
 I appreciate you share, have you stayed? 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.510
 any questions let us down here 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.160
 comments we want to answer this is the 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.360
 first time on our channel 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.700
 let's sign up 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.200
 reviewing our updates was worth 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.200
 and until the next video
