you got this piece done lads yeah the

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.770 
you got this piece done lads yeah the
vapour<00:00:36.640> barrier<00:00:36.790> is<00:00:37.059> very<00:00:37.239> important<00:00:37.600> to<00:00:37.690> the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
vapour barrier is very important to the

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.920 
vapour barrier is very important to the
Passivhaus<00:00:38.170> reason<00:00:38.770> being<00:00:38.950> it<00:00:39.670> seeds<00:00:39.970> off<00:00:40.239> the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
Passivhaus reason being it seeds off the

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.549 
Passivhaus reason being it seeds off the
house<00:00:41.110> and<00:00:41.440> makes<00:00:41.710> it<00:00:41.829> almost<00:00:41.950> airtight<00:00:43.559> and

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
house and makes it almost airtight and

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.600 
house and makes it almost airtight and
secondly<00:00:45.129> what<00:00:45.970> with<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.449> warm<00:00:46.720> moisture

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
secondly what with the warm moisture

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.369 
secondly what with the warm moisture
inside<00:00:48.610> the<00:00:48.670> house<00:00:48.970> cold<00:00:49.870> air<00:00:50.050> that<00:00:50.080> is

inside the house cold air that is

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.560 
inside the house cold air that is
outside<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:50.860> house<00:00:51.040> if<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:52.150> warm<00:00:52.330> moisture

outside the house if the warm moisture

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.070 
outside the house if the warm moisture
meets<00:00:53.019> the<00:00:53.530> end<00:00:53.769> cold<00:00:54.370> air<00:00:54.550> on<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.269> outside<00:00:55.300> we

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
meets the end cold air on the outside we

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.720 
meets the end cold air on the outside we
get<00:00:56.260> Jew<00:00:56.530> which<00:00:57.070> will<00:00:57.220> lead<00:00:57.339> to<00:00:57.370> condensation

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
get Jew which will lead to condensation

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.450 
get Jew which will lead to condensation
in<00:00:58.300> the<00:00:58.480> insulation<00:00:59.050> and<00:00:59.559> we<00:01:00.040> don't<00:01:00.220> want<00:01:00.370> that

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
in the insulation and we don't want that

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.700 
in the insulation and we don't want that

time the timber would blacken he's will
and<00:02:12.140> you<00:02:12.260> really<00:02:12.530> need<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.739> put<00:02:12.890> something<00:02:13.160> on

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
and you really need to put something on

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.470 
and you really need to put something on
it<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:13.519> will<00:02:13.640> give<00:02:13.700> give<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.299> long-term

it that will give give it long-term
protection<00:02:14.810> so<00:02:15.799> voltage<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.220> anything<00:02:16.459> you

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
protection so voltage is anything you

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.280 
protection so voltage is anything you
can<00:02:16.700> value<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:16.970> new<00:02:17.239> as<00:02:17.390> a<00:02:17.570> kind<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:17.900> pigment

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
can value the new as a kind of a pigment

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.500 
can value the new as a kind of a pigment
as<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.680> wood<00:02:18.980> stain<00:02:19.280> that<00:02:19.640> would<00:02:19.880> breathe<00:02:20.239> that

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
as a wood stain that would breathe that

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.900 
as a wood stain that would breathe that
needs<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.840> breathe<00:02:21.049> to<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.440> outside<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.430> and
