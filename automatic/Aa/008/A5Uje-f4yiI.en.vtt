being improved since previous videos

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.220

hopefully<00:01:42.520> by<00:01:43.060> June<00:01:43.420> they<00:01:43.690> might<00:01:43.810> have<00:01:43.900> polish

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230

it<00:01:46.660> doesn't<00:01:46.930> matter<00:01:47.110> because<00:01:47.320> I<00:01:47.710> think

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
it doesn't matter because I think

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.930 
it doesn't matter because I think
they're<00:01:48.460> looking<00:01:48.700> pretty<00:01:48.820> good<00:01:49.030> right<00:01:49.090> now

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
I think I'll be quite cool to see and

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.790 
I think I'll be quite cool to see and
the<00:03:32.450> final<00:03:32.780> thing<00:03:32.810> which<00:03:33.110> are<00:03:33.290> most<00:03:33.470> happy<00:03:33.770> to

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
the final thing which are most happy to

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.670 
the final thing which are most happy to
see<00:03:34.070> is<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:35.330> AI<00:03:35.480> survivors<00:03:36.170> are<00:03:36.320> fighting

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
see is the AI survivors are fighting

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.300 
see is the AI survivors are fighting
with<00:03:36.830> you<00:03:37.010> not<00:03:37.550> like<00:03:38.560> dead<00:03:39.560> rising<00:03:40.040> where<00:03:40.190> they

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
with you not like dead rising where they

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.700 
with you not like dead rising where they
solve<00:03:40.660> they'll<00:03:41.660> defend<00:03:41.960> themselves<00:03:42.380> like<00:03:42.680> a

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
solve they'll defend themselves like a

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.800 
solve they'll defend themselves like a
bit<00:03:42.950> but<00:03:43.190> not<00:03:43.370> much<00:03:43.400> these<00:03:44.120> guys<00:03:44.390> they're<00:03:44.780> like

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
bit but not much these guys they're like

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.690 
bit but not much these guys they're like
probably<00:03:45.200> sticking<00:03:45.980> it<00:03:46.160> to<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.280> zombies

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
probably sticking it to the zombies

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.420 
probably sticking it to the zombies
which<00:03:47.650> it's<00:03:48.650> going<00:03:48.830> to<00:03:48.890> make<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.070> game<00:03:49.250> a<00:03:49.280> lot

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
which it's going to make the game a lot

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.270 
which it's going to make the game a lot
of<00:03:49.580> fun<00:03:49.700> I<00:03:49.760> think<00:03:49.910> because<00:03:50.210> it's<00:03:50.450> not<00:03:50.600> just<00:03:50.870> you

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
of fun I think because it's not just you

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.680 
of fun I think because it's not just you
sort<00:03:52.280> of<00:03:52.370> babysitting<00:03:52.880> a<00:03:53.030> survivor<00:03:53.330> to<00:03:53.600> the

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
sort of babysitting a survivor to the

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.000 
sort of babysitting a survivor to the
safe<00:03:53.900> zone<00:03:54.140> he's<00:03:54.320> actually<00:03:54.500> going<00:03:54.710> to<00:03:54.800> be<00:03:54.890> like

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
safe zone he's actually going to be like

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.860 
safe zone he's actually going to be like
sort<00:03:55.250> of<00:03:55.280> kicking<00:03:55.820> some<00:03:55.970> ass<00:03:56.090> himself<00:03:56.570> so

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
sort of kicking some ass himself so

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.240 
sort of kicking some ass himself so
quite<00:03:57.770> looking<00:03:57.980> forward<00:03:58.070> to<00:03:58.400> that<00:04:00.070> but<00:04:01.070> yeah

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
quite looking forward to that but yeah

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.500 
quite looking forward to that but yeah
I'm<00:04:01.460> not<00:04:01.580> really<00:04:01.700> sure<00:04:01.790> what<00:04:02.000> else<00:04:02.210> to<00:04:02.270> say

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
I'm not really sure what else to say

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.720

getting what about two or three months
before<00:04:08.780> release<00:04:09.200> now<00:04:09.440> so<00:04:09.740> all<00:04:10.700> we<00:04:10.880> can<00:04:11.030> do<00:04:11.150> is

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
before release now so all we can do is

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.690 
before release now so all we can do is
sit<00:04:11.570> back<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:11.780> wait<00:04:11.990> and<00:04:12.350> hope<00:04:13.340> they<00:04:13.520> didn't

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
sit back and wait and hope they didn't
