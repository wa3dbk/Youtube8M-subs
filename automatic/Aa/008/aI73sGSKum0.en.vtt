this<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:11.450> true<00:00:12.450> swarm<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.170> bees<00:00:13.410> we<00:00:13.769> are

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
this is a true swarm of bees we are

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.340 
this is a true swarm of bees we are
absolutely<00:00:15.710> covered<00:00:17.570> they're<00:00:18.570> all<00:00:18.810> around<00:00:19.080> us

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
absolutely covered they're all around us

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.170 
absolutely covered they're all around us
and<00:00:19.650> they<00:00:19.800> keep<00:00:20.010> on<00:00:20.189> going<00:00:20.490> back<00:00:20.699> up<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.029> this

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
and they keep on going back up to this

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.500 
and they keep on going back up to this
tree<00:00:21.539> we're<00:00:22.260> trying<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.710> get<00:00:22.830> them<00:00:23.180> into<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> box

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
tree we're trying to get them into a box

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.400 
tree we're trying to get them into a box
down<00:00:24.779> below

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
down below

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.349 
down below
I<00:00:26.480> suspect<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.630> Queen<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.080> somewhere<00:00:28.970> in<00:00:29.970> this

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
I suspect the Queen is somewhere in this

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.430 
I suspect the Queen is somewhere in this
but<00:00:31.050> they're<00:00:31.289> all<00:00:31.560> around<00:00:32.099> us<00:00:33.079> there<00:00:34.079> are<00:00:34.350> a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
but they're all around us there are a

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:50.959 
but they're all around us there are a
lot<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.649> bees<00:00:34.980> here<00:00:49.039> box<00:00:50.039> when<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.670> capture<00:00:50.940> a

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
lot of bees here box when you capture a

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:51.680 
lot of bees here box when you capture a
swarm

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
swarm

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.319 
swarm
and<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.289> Queen's<00:00:52.559> not<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.100> there<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:54.120> they're

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
and the Queen's not in there and they're

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.560 
and the Queen's not in there and they're
literally<00:00:54.690> pouring<00:00:55.199> out<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.890> box

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
literally pouring out of this box

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.900 
literally pouring out of this box
looking<00:00:57.570> for<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.870> Queen<00:00:58.070> so<00:00:59.070> we're<00:00:59.550> gonna<00:00:59.640> ask

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
looking for the Queen so we're gonna ask

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.030 
looking for the Queen so we're gonna ask
you<00:01:00.949> try<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.070> once<00:01:02.969> again

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
you try this once again

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.920 
you try this once again
but<00:01:06.040> maybe<00:01:06.220> give<00:01:06.460> them<00:01:06.670> a<00:01:06.760> minute<00:01:06.909> to<00:01:07.270> get<00:01:08.260> out

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.200 

box<00:01:12.560> is<00:01:12.770> actually<00:01:12.920> moving<00:01:15.850> because<00:01:16.850> of<00:01:17.000> the

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
box is actually moving because of the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.820 
box is actually moving because of the
weight<00:01:17.390> of<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.750> bees<00:01:17.900> shifting<00:01:18.440> inside

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.440 

so<00:01:22.640> I<00:01:22.700> guess<00:01:22.850> this<00:01:22.970> is<00:01:23.090> what<00:01:23.240> it<00:01:23.330> would<00:01:23.390> look

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
so I guess this is what it would look

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.680 
so I guess this is what it would look
like<00:01:23.570> at<00:01:23.870> your<00:01:23.960> hive<00:01:24.140> if<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.680> bees<00:01:25.690> were

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
like at your hive if the bees were

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.380 
like at your hive if the bees were
swarming<00:01:27.520> literally<00:01:28.520> pouring<00:01:28.850> out<00:01:29.180> of<00:01:29.300> the

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
swarming literally pouring out of the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:52.250 
swarming literally pouring out of the
box<00:01:31.030> constantly

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.940 

and<00:01:53.260> this<00:01:53.910> is<00:01:54.910> the<00:01:55.060> opposite<00:01:55.480> effect<00:01:55.780> this<00:01:56.710> is

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
and this is the opposite effect this is

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.790 
and this is the opposite effect this is
what<00:01:57.100> happens<00:01:57.460> when<00:01:58.210> you<00:01:59.020> get<00:01:59.230> the<00:01:59.410> Queen<00:01:59.620> in

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
what happens when you get the Queen in

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.160 
what happens when you get the Queen in
the<00:01:59.890> box<00:02:00.150> so<00:02:01.150> you<00:02:01.210> can<00:02:01.450> see<00:02:01.570> all<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.780> bees<00:02:01.930> are

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
the box so you can see all the bees are

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.190 
the box so you can see all the bees are
now<00:02:02.290> flustered<00:02:02.860> around<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.190> outside<00:02:03.700> and

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
now flustered around the outside and

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.480 
now flustered around the outside and
banding<00:02:05.200> her<00:02:05.320> pheromones<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:08.770> think<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.369> we

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
banding her pheromones we think that we

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.850 
banding her pheromones we think that we
might<00:02:09.670> have

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.660 

as<00:02:12.850> I'm<00:02:13.060> filming<00:02:13.510> this
