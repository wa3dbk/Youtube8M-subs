00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.249 
like that I can't pronounce his name but
the<00:01:44.610> main<00:01:44.759> character's<00:01:45.210> name<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.479> Kira<00:01:45.750> toe<00:01:45.960> we

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
the main character's name is Kira toe we

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.109 
the main character's name is Kira toe we
learned<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.740> later<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.340> he's

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
learned that on later on and he's

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.350 
learned that on later on and he's
basically<00:01:49.100> he<00:01:50.100> was<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.280> beta<00:01:50.610> tester<00:01:51.090> for<00:01:51.210> this

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
basically he was a beta tester for this

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.780 
basically he was a beta tester for this
game<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.810> he's<00:01:52.649> got<00:01:52.860> some<00:01:53.009> experience<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.670> he

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
game and he's got some experience so he

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.399 
game and he's got some experience so he
knows<00:01:53.939> what<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.299> do<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.899> other<00:01:55.110> dude

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
knows what to do and this other dude

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.230 
knows what to do and this other dude
doesn't<00:01:56.100> know<00:01:56.189> what<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.369> do<00:01:56.549> at<00:01:56.579> all<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.090> he

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
doesn't know what to do at all so he

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.810 
doesn't know what to do at all so he
just<00:01:57.420> teaches<00:01:57.719> him<00:01:58.020> how<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.259> fight<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.100> it

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
just teaches him how to fight and it

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.310 
just teaches him how to fight and it
seems<00:02:00.030> like<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.270> combat<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.750> mainly<00:02:01.079> based

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
seems like the combat is mainly based

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.990 
seems like the combat is mainly based
around<00:02:01.560> sorts<00:02:02.070> because<00:02:02.189> they<00:02:02.460> mentioned<00:02:02.909> that

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
around sorts because they mentioned that

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.600 
around sorts because they mentioned that
there's<00:02:03.240> no<00:02:03.420> magic<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.079> in<00:02:04.560> RPGs<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.130> mmos

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
there's no magic and in RPGs and mmos

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.340 
there's no magic and in RPGs and mmos
magic<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.299> obviously<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.689> big<00:02:06.840> part<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.259> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
magic is obviously a big part of the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.080 
magic is obviously a big part of the
game<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:07.890> was<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:08.129> her<00:02:08.369> well<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.879> seemed

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
game so I was like her well it seemed

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.570 
game so I was like her well it seemed
interesting<00:02:09.629> because<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.890> other<00:02:11.039> dude<00:02:11.280> he

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
interesting because the other dude he

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.100 
interesting because the other dude he
was<00:02:11.610> trying<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.090> use<00:02:12.810> his

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
was trying to use his

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.780 
was trying to use his
sword<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.710> was<00:02:13.890> cool<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.250> way<00:02:14.370> they<00:02:14.550> talk

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
sword and it was cool the way they talk

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.390 
sword and it was cool the way they talk
animed<00:02:15.240> so<00:02:15.540> loads<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:17.040> attacks<00:02:17.310> are

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
animed so loads of it the attacks are

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.980 
animed so loads of it the attacks are
going<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.640> be<00:02:17.700> string<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.150> sword<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.720> not

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
going to be string to the sword and not

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.810 
going to be string to the sword and not
happen<00:02:19.320> but<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:20.010> still<00:02:20.220> think<00:02:20.430> it's<00:02:20.550> weird<00:02:20.700> that

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
happen but I still think it's weird that

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.820 
happen but I still think it's weird that
they<00:02:21.000> don't<00:02:21.150> have<00:02:21.210> magic<00:02:21.660> but<00:02:21.840> whatever<00:02:22.260> um

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
they don't have magic but whatever um

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.040 
they don't have magic but whatever um
they're<00:02:23.130> going<00:02:23.340> about<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.910> he<00:02:24.210> kills<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.750> wild

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
they're going about and he kills a wild

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.990 
they're going about and he kills a wild
boar<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.500> they're<00:02:25.650> like<00:02:25.830> yay<00:02:26.070> kira<00:02:26.520> kira

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
boar and they're like yay kira kira

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.210 
boar and they're like yay kira kira
token<00:02:27.510> kill<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.810> with<00:02:27.930> ease<00:02:28.140> but<00:02:28.170> he<00:02:28.620> struggles

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
token kill it with ease but he struggles

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.470 
token kill it with ease but he struggles
a<00:02:29.280> little<00:02:29.340> bit<00:02:29.610> he<00:02:29.820> gets<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.150> hang<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.450> it

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
a little bit he gets the hang of it

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.480 
a little bit he gets the hang of it
after<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.900> while<00:02:30.960> and<00:02:31.320> then<00:02:31.680> he's<00:02:31.800> like<00:02:32.010> you

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
bait or dogs wally was thinking about so

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.960 
bait or dogs wally was thinking about so

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
maybe he's not a very social guy and he

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.760 
maybe he's not a very social guy and he
didn't<00:02:51.150> want<00:02:51.300> any<00:02:51.480> other<00:02:51.570> people<00:02:52.020> aren't<00:02:52.470> no

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
didn't want any other people aren't no

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.550 
didn't want any other people aren't no
but<00:02:53.270> what<00:02:54.270> happens<00:02:54.600> is<00:02:54.750> they<00:02:54.930> try<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.200> log<00:02:55.410> out

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
but what happens is they try to log out

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.960 
but what happens is they try to log out
and<00:02:55.620> they<00:02:55.770> can't<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.280> then<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.489> like<00:02:56.700> what's

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
and they can't and then I like what's

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.220 
and they can't and then I like what's
going<00:02:57.180> on<00:02:57.330> you<00:02:57.450> should<00:02:57.480> be<00:02:57.690> able<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.959> log<00:02:58.110> out

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
going on you should be able to log out

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.140 
going on you should be able to log out
because<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.100> only<00:02:59.160> way<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.459> can<00:02:59.610> log<00:02:59.820> out<00:02:59.970> is

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
because the only way you can log out is

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.229 
because the only way you can log out is
through<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.600> main<00:03:00.840> like<00:03:01.140> menu<00:03:01.620> thing<00:03:02.070> so<00:03:02.610> all
