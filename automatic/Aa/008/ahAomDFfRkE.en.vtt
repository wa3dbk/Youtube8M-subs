so<00:00:02.110> -<00:00:02.290> a<00:00:02.320> demo<00:00:02.590> of<00:00:04.110> converting<00:00:05.110> an<00:00:05.980> existing

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:06.610 
so - a demo of converting an existing

so - a demo of converting an existing
NTFS<00:00:07.480> specifically<00:00:08.469> fat32<00:00:10.019> filesystem

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:11.560 
NTFS specifically fat32 filesystem

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.910 
NTFS specifically fat32 filesystem
to<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:13.059> Linux<00:00:13.480> file<00:00:13.780> system<00:00:13.809> is<00:00:14.470> specifically

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
to the Linux file system is specifically

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.519 
to the Linux file system is specifically
the<00:00:15.099> port<00:00:15.370> extended<00:00:15.970> file<00:00:16.150> system<00:00:16.570> and<00:00:16.779> then

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:17.529 
the port extended file system and then

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:19.800 
the port extended file system and then
we're<00:00:17.769> going<00:00:17.949> to<00:00:18.159> again<00:00:18.880> show<00:00:19.269> you<00:00:19.329> how<00:00:19.749> to

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
we're going to again show you how to

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.220 
we're going to again show you how to
convert<00:00:20.439> it<00:00:20.769> back<00:00:20.800> to<00:00:21.009> the<00:00:21.960> lead<00:00:22.960> fab

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
convert it back to the lead fab

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.809 
convert it back to the lead fab
otherwise<00:00:23.739> known<00:00:23.980> as<00:00:24.009> the<00:00:24.220> fat32<00:00:24.689> filesystem

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:26.819 
otherwise known as the fat32 filesystem

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:31.739 
otherwise known as the fat32 filesystem
so<00:00:27.819> let's<00:00:28.060> get<00:00:28.359> started<00:00:29.849> I'm<00:00:30.849> going<00:00:31.210> to<00:00:31.329> use<00:00:31.509> a

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:31.749 
so let's get started I'm going to use a

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:35.250 
so let's get started I'm going to use a
USB<00:00:32.250> thumb<00:00:33.250> drive<00:00:33.550> to<00:00:34.149> make<00:00:34.449> it<00:00:34.629> much<00:00:34.870> simpler

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
USB thumb drive to make it much simpler

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.470

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.480 
to know that it's in Linux file system
so<00:05:14.550> right<00:05:14.729> now<00:05:14.880> we're<00:05:15.270> going<00:05:15.720> to<00:05:15.990> try<00:05:16.740> to

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
so right now we're going to try to

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.270 
so right now we're going to try to
convert<00:05:18.389> this<00:05:18.690> fort<00:05:19.169> extended<00:05:19.650> file<00:05:19.860> system

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
convert this fort extended file system

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.330 
convert this fort extended file system
back<00:05:20.520> to<00:05:20.550> fat32<00:05:21.210> so<00:05:21.900> that<00:05:22.050> we<00:05:22.229> can<00:05:22.440> make<00:05:22.710> we<00:05:23.159> can

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
back to fat32 so that we can make we can

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.550 
back to fat32 so that we can make we can
use<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.759> USB<00:05:24.060> we<00:05:24.810> can<00:05:24.960> make<00:05:25.110> me<00:05:25.229> used<00:05:25.409> to<00:05:25.500> be

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
use the USB we can make me used to be

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.620 
use the USB we can make me used to be
usable<00:05:25.949> when<00:05:26.550> you<00:05:26.699> go<00:05:26.849> back<00:05:27.060> to<00:05:27.090> our<00:05:27.330> post

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
usable when you go back to our post

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.129 
usable when you go back to our post
machine<00:05:27.990> which<00:05:28.680> is<00:05:28.830> Windows<00:05:29.190> 7<00:05:29.750> so<00:05:30.750> again

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
machine which is Windows 7 so again

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.020 
machine which is Windows 7 so again
we're<00:05:31.409> on<00:05:31.650> the

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.130 

oh<00:05:35.890> I<00:05:36.890> forgot<00:05:37.340> the<00:05:37.850> F<00:05:38.000> this<00:05:38.240> command<00:05:38.630> so<00:05:38.900> we<00:05:38.930> got

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
oh I forgot the F this command so we got

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.140 
oh I forgot the F this command so we got
sudo<00:05:39.620> and<00:05:40.040> then<00:05:40.460> F<00:05:40.730> disk<00:05:42.340> so<00:05:43.340> I<00:05:43.400> can<00:05:43.580> type<00:05:43.850> them

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
sudo and then F disk so I can type them

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.220 
sudo and then F disk so I can type them
then<00:05:44.870> SVC<00:05:45.880> but<00:05:46.880> he<00:05:47.180> as<00:05:47.360> you<00:05:47.390> can<00:05:47.660> see<00:05:47.870> it's<00:05:48.050> the

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
then SVC but he as you can see it's the

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.580 
then SVC but he as you can see it's the
littles<00:05:48.620> file<00:05:48.890> system<00:05:49.370> or<00:05:49.930> the<00:05:50.930> extended<00:05:51.290> one

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
littles file system or the extended one

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.330 
littles file system or the extended one
so<00:05:52.430> we're<00:05:52.520> going<00:05:52.640> to<00:05:52.760> delete<00:05:53.090> this<00:05:53.330> partition

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
so we're going to delete this partition

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.710 
so we're going to delete this partition
automatically<00:05:55.340> selected<00:05:55.880> the<00:05:55.970> one<00:05:56.420> is<00:05:56.540> only

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
automatically selected the one is only

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.580 
automatically selected the one is only
partition<00:05:57.320> click<00:05:57.740> W<00:05:58.610> it's<00:05:58.850> like<00:05:59.000> W<00:05:59.450> to<00:06:00.170> write

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
partition click W it's like W to write

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.040 
partition click W it's like W to write
the<00:06:00.830> actual<00:06:00.980> changes<00:06:01.700> and<00:06:02.690> then<00:06:02.810> what<00:06:02.930> we're

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
the actual changes and then what we're

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.070 
the actual changes and then what we're
going<00:06:03.170> to<00:06:03.200> do<00:06:03.350> is<00:06:03.470> we're<00:06:03.620> going<00:06:03.650> to<00:06:03.980> just

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
going to do is we're going to just

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.690 
going to do is we're going to just
verify<00:06:06.080> that<00:06:06.440> the<00:06:06.650> partition<00:06:06.770> is<00:06:07.220> no<00:06:07.490> longer

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 
verify that the partition is no longer

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.600 
verify that the partition is no longer
there<00:06:09.100> by<00:06:10.100> hitting<00:06:10.400> P<00:06:10.880> and<00:06:12.310> then<00:06:13.310> we're<00:06:13.460> going

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
there by hitting P and then we're going

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.220 
there by hitting P and then we're going
to<00:06:13.730> create<00:06:14.000> a<00:06:14.770> new<00:06:15.770> partition<00:06:16.930> so<00:06:17.930> it's<00:06:18.080> like

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.230 
to create a new partition so it's like

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.330 
to create a new partition so it's like
feet<00:06:18.530> or<00:06:19.100> primary<00:06:19.669> partition<00:06:20.300> number<00:06:20.390> one

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
feet or primary partition number one

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.130 
feet or primary partition number one
press<00:06:22.340> 1<00:06:22.669> on<00:06:22.700> the<00:06:22.880> first<00:06:22.940> cylinder<00:06:23.600> and<00:06:23.870> we're

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
press 1 on the first cylinder and we're

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.930 
press 1 on the first cylinder and we're
going<00:06:24.290> to<00:06:24.410> use<00:06:24.530> the<00:06:24.680> entire<00:06:24.800> 16-gigabyte<00:06:25.610> that

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
going to use the entire 16-gigabyte that

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.210 
going to use the entire 16-gigabyte that
person<00:06:26.300> in<00:06:26.480> the<00:06:26.570> turn<00:06:26.750> but<00:06:27.710> this<00:06:27.800> time<00:06:28.040> we're

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
person in the turn but this time we're

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.270 
person in the turn but this time we're
going<00:06:28.370> to<00:06:28.520> hit<00:06:28.870> T<00:06:29.870> to<00:06:30.380> change<00:06:30.650> the<00:06:30.770> practition

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
going to hit T to change the practition

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.210 
going to hit T to change the practition
system<00:06:31.640> ID<00:06:33.010> and<00:06:35.440> then<00:06:36.440> we're<00:06:36.620> going<00:06:36.770> to<00:06:36.860> hit<00:06:36.980> L

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 
system ID and then we're going to hit L

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.700 
system ID and then we're going to hit L
to<00:06:37.760> show<00:06:38.090> all<00:06:38.480> the<00:06:38.750> file<00:06:38.990> systems<00:06:39.470> that<00:06:39.530> are

to show all the file systems that are

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.590 
to show all the file systems that are
available<00:06:39.979> so<00:06:40.610> that<00:06:40.760> we<00:06:40.970> know<00:06:41.180> which<00:06:41.330> one<00:06:41.570> is

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 
available so that we know which one is

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.710 
available so that we know which one is
the<00:06:41.720> fat32<00:06:42.290> so<00:06:42.860> you<00:06:42.950> can<00:06:43.130> see<00:06:43.340> right<00:06:44.180> here<00:06:44.510> it's

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
the fat32 so you can see right here it's

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.520 
the fat32 so you can see right here it's
the<00:06:45.050> letter<00:06:45.290> B<00:06:45.800> w<00:06:46.669> 95<00:06:47.030> 532<00:06:48.020> from<00:06:48.229> going<00:06:48.470> to

same thing we're going to unmount this

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:04.030 
same thing we're going to unmount this
device<00:07:01.120> before<00:07:02.120> we<00:07:02.570> can<00:07:02.750> make<00:07:02.930> a<00:07:03.500> filesystem

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:04.040 
device before we can make a filesystem

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:09.640 
device before we can make a filesystem
out<00:07:04.820> of<00:07:05.000> it<00:07:05.320> to<00:07:06.320> fat32<00:07:08.169> so<00:07:09.169> we're<00:07:09.320> gonna<00:07:09.410> say

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.650 
out of it to fat32 so we're gonna say

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:15.610 
out of it to fat32 so we're gonna say
the<00:07:10.190> mount<00:07:11.200> then<00:07:12.200> SBC<00:07:13.070> 1<00:07:13.370> and<00:07:14.260> then<00:07:15.260> we're

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:15.620 
the mount then SBC 1 and then we're

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.760 
the mount then SBC 1 and then we're
going<00:07:15.830> to<00:07:16.340> say<00:07:17.530> make<00:07:18.530> filesystem<00:07:19.370> the<00:07:20.270> fat

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:20.770 
going to say make filesystem the fat

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.180 
going to say make filesystem the fat

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:25.190 
which is the the alias for fat32 and

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.440 
which is the the alias for fat32 and
then<00:07:25.520> hit<00:07:25.729> enter<00:07:27.669> it's<00:07:28.669> gonna<00:07:28.910> take<00:07:29.180> some<00:07:29.419> time

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:29.450 
then hit enter it's gonna take some time

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.440 
then hit enter it's gonna take some time

folder<00:07:42.350> called<00:07:42.620> lost<00:07:42.919> in<00:07:43.190> town<00:07:44.980> sometimes<00:07:45.980> we

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.130 
folder called lost in town sometimes we

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.000 
folder called lost in town sometimes we
need<00:07:46.280> to<00:07:46.460> leave<00:07:46.610> a<00:07:46.639> disconnect<00:07:47.270> and<00:07:47.360> reconnect

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.010 
need to leave a disconnect and reconnect

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.490 
need to leave a disconnect and reconnect
just<00:07:49.010> for<00:07:49.220> the<00:07:49.310> virtual<00:07:49.639> machine<00:07:50.000> to<00:07:50.500> detect

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:51.500 
just for the virtual machine to detect

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.120 
just for the virtual machine to detect
that<00:07:51.680> yes<00:07:52.100> and<00:07:52.669> now<00:07:53.150> we<00:07:53.210> have<00:07:54.010> converting<00:07:55.010> it

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:55.130 
that yes and now we have converting it

00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:01.030 
that yes and now we have converting it
back<00:07:55.370> to<00:07:55.690> 532<00:07:56.690> I<00:07:57.310> hope<00:07:58.310> you<00:07:58.490> enjoyed<00:07:58.760> the<00:07:58.850> demo
