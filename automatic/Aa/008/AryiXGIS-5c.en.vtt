00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.020
 very good dear subscribers this is 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.059
 my new tutorial on how to configure 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:17.480
 in a basic way the hard disk in the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:20.860
 playstation 2 playstation 2 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.289
 as you can see with your network adapter 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.610
 in this case I have live but I know that 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.509
 there are new versions with the 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:32.829
 adaptation binds them and we will need a 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:35.719
 hard drive and go 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.449
 that is compatible that is the same 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:41.839
 size that works the others 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:46.219
 inputs of the crisis model in two 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:50.570
 to be able to configure it this hard drive 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:53.269
 it has to be in ntfs format I do not know if 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.360
 work for 32 but I just in case 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.100
 always set them in ntfs this 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.960
 theory is going to be very short because like my 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.510
 hard drive is 10 gigs is going to be 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.180
 pretty fast we want to put it 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.090
 the hard drive directly in the modem 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:14.240
 in the adapter we place it in the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.240
 playstation 2 screws these 2 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.500
 screws 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.340
 but we must turn on the good now 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.340
 let's go sad and feel 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.500
 very well we turn on the playstation 2 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.020
 and here we have to try to be the 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.979
 free macbook or we have to have the hd 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.470
 loader on disk as you prefer 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:57.010
 I in this case I will use the hd 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:01.140
 loader installed on my memory card with 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.140
 the acvot frame and we started it 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.220
 I was not talking new capturing that 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.950
 buy for the channel to make new 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.720
 tutorials and better facts I hope that 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.120
 like the quality that I'm going to 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.620
 provide from now on 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.930
 We wait for you to load recognizes the disk 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.959
 hard here tells us that you see format 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.060
 the hard drive that was connected here is 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.610
 part makes the loader's own h 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.360
 make the hard drive and put it in 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.310
 format of play station2 directly 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.900
 they gave me the typical warning that yes 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.600
 erased all data because it's going to 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.230
 erase everything I give x accept and it 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.230
 start formatting 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.940
 and as you can see we already have the disk 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.459
 complete hard to use in the 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.830
 play station2 and good that my hard drive 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.390
 is 10 gigabytes are stored a bit to 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.730
 the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.880
 for the archives' own system 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.819
 that recognizes prison 2 so here I 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.709
 I can install the games they want if 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.350
 I install games from the play reader 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.630
 station2 unfortunately only leaves me 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.570
 and install games that are original 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.270
 but then we have other methods like 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.990
 are to install it by hard drive or 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.850
 connected to the pc or good network cable 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.620
 that's all for now I hope that you 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.060

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.730
