00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
first your heels look I would wrap my

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.959 
first your heels look I would wrap my
hand<00:00:54.210> around<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.250> dolly<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
hand around like that like I dolly and

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.970 
hand around like that like I dolly and
go<00:00:57.120> like<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.809> then<00:00:58.260> let<00:00:58.440> go<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.949> just

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
go like that and then let go and just

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.529 
go like that and then let go and just
have<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> board<00:00:59.670> through<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.940> tiny<00:01:00.210> flip

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
have the board through that tiny flip

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.810 
have the board through that tiny flip
right<00:01:00.719> there<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.140> my<00:01:01.379> answer<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:03.019> and

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
right there and my answer like that and

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.560 
right there and my answer like that and
what<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.850> should<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.420> should

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
what you should do is you should

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.060 
what you should do is you should
practice<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.290> first<00:01:07.560> because<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.799> really

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
practice that first because that really

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.250 
practice that first because that really
helps<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.760> get<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.000> feeling<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.570> sort<00:01:10.200> of

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
helps you get the feeling of it sort of

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.140 
helps you get the feeling of it sort of
want<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.470> do<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.740> sort<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.070> want<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.310> pop

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
want to do is you sort of want to pop

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.390 
want to do is you sort of want to pop
when<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.479> pop<00:01:12.689> pop<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.380> board<00:01:13.740> you're<00:01:14.250> going

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
when you pop pop the board you're going

when you pop pop the board you're going
to<00:01:14.490> sort<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:14.970> move<00:01:15.270> your<00:01:15.479> hand<00:01:15.659> out<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:15.990> that

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
to sort of move your hand out like that

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.710 
to sort of move your hand out like that
I<00:01:16.439> know<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.460> lot<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.670> people<00:01:17.759> say<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.210> pop<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
I know a lot of people say to pop the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.130 
I know a lot of people say to pop the
board<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.200> goes<00:01:19.439> like<00:01:20.509> terms<00:01:21.509> towards<00:01:22.020> you

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
board so it goes like terms towards you

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.679 
board so it goes like terms towards you
so<00:01:22.350> then<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.590> can<00:01:22.740> pop<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.130> back<00:01:23.159> out<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.820> like

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
so then you can pop it back out I like

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.840 
so then you can pop it back out I like
pop<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:25.500> out<00:01:25.740> just<00:01:26.189> like<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.369> okay

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
pop it just out just like that okay

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.999 
pop it just out just like that okay
because<00:01:27.630> what<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.840> do<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.200> pop<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.619> out<00:01:28.740> and

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
because what I do is I pop it out and

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.039 
because what I do is I pop it out and
the<00:01:29.400> board<00:01:29.610> usually<00:01:29.759> comes<00:01:30.180> out<00:01:30.360> here<00:01:30.630> now

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
the board usually comes out here now

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.359 
the board usually comes out here now
people<00:01:31.350> say<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:31.710> there<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:31.979> right<00:01:32.189> here<00:01:32.340> and

they're<00:01:32.549> going<00:01:32.700> up<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:32.970> your<00:01:33.090> heel<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.420> you're

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
they're going up in your heel so you're

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.670 
they're going up in your heel so you're
not<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.990> be<00:01:34.049> one<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.229> these<00:01:34.470> put<00:01:34.650> them

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
not going to be one of these put them

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.490 
not going to be one of these put them
out<00:01:34.860> there<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.400> land<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.150> now<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:36.960> was<00:01:37.290> easy

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
out there to land on it now it was easy

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.840 
out there to land on it now it was easy
for<00:01:37.619> me<00:01:37.970> it's<00:01:38.970> sort<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:40.729> flip<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
for me it's sort of just I flip the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.630 
for me it's sort of just I flip the
board<00:01:42.030> out<00:01:42.240> but<00:01:42.950> bring<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.070> back<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.490> catch

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
board out but bring it back in and catch
