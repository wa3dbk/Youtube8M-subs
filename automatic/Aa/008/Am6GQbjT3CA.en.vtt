00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.700
 jet li bazoer put his signature Tuesday afternoon under a contract that him 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.910
 for three years connecting to ajax the 16 year old defender comes over from psv 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:14.650
 look how happy i am drawing you with you often 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.150
 stay that kind of class 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.470
 and proud 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.550
 but I have too 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.550
 fantastic god at psv 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.419
 it rains far away 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.539
 because I am ready for a new step I have chosen it myself 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.210
 for development 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.290
 After a bit of Nascom also thank PSV for the time that framework has been 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.340
 that choice from multiple clubs all kamikazes ethias are right 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.830
 the gp of the internet 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.480
 and especially actively opted for ajax that sporting way is better 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.500
 because such steps showed that two youth players get the chance 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.130
 it's natural to mine mine 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.310
 mohawke ridiculously stepped this 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.120
 the conversation I learn with from the farmer he was there so I learn that he is with us 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.810
 who did he have that against 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.530
 such that return 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.570
 that can actually choose 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.030
 ask questions 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.030
 already had to bow 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.570
 the trainings are now good on the psv but something and 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.460
 all in all professional footballers as trainers 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.430
 that it's good 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.439
 we are completely true 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.370
 players from ajax 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.350
 and that and in particular 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.010
 and look forward to working with you 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.180
 wind angle 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.510
 want to train your ease 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.640
 so because I am not entitled to play 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.900
 could yesterday 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.540
 this time scoring start training that rich 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.760
 of nature in that corner and may or play a match 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.400
 well out 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.460
 of course we will be in for an hour 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.690
 also have with psv and 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.600
 contact they have received a letter from us 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.179
 and we have 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.899
 PSV also informed that we were interested in these players 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.730
 the ajax will not do anything that is not possible 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.730
 emiel not now and yes 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.250
 So 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.340
 9 Of course we want to see that he can compete as much as possible 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.439
 play want 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:17.159
 we have not known so well for years that saw what kind of football player 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.089
 media 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:20.779
 I'm on for the last half hour 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:22.949
 shoot through those shoes 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:26.329
 the film three bid inbred the midfield 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.489
 why does ajax still want an agenda 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.400
 well we heard that with those with other clubs and washing up 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.230
 he is a top talent in the netherlands and x a lot 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:43.710
 years 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.419
 also in sion no the growth spurt by the woman 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:49.039
 ajax is of course always interested in 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:50.610
 in the best players 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.250
 a night bus 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.760
 would drive like this 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.259
 got into conversation and 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:59.609
 Of course it is also nice that a top talent stays in the Netherlands and not 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.799
 as so often very light in england 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:03.909
 disappears 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.689
 well I am the media often talk of a kind of exams and cream and 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.689
 tactical clubs where you can explain how that works 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:16.109
 well we naturally asked smoke here he said ing internally to this 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.459
 their demolition work ioc 14 years and it was not known 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.719
 and with the other members of the management either, I don't have to go to Disney's again 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:25.669
 platform requested from kpn 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:28.499
 but all directors were present and also basel 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:29.449
 and 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.579
 but massively also said he was unaware 

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:38.409
 so that's probably why it's just not known 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:39.899
 and 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:43.009
 if there are rules to come and then the kvb would be there 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:45.709
 to take a position there 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.999
 with marcel again a massive month for the cards looking at Kerkrade psv 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.029
 yes it is also in send a platform to kpn 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.939
 obeidi but goes 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:57.919
 stays that way 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:58.529
 that is
