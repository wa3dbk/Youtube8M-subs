know<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:19.140> pith<00:00:19.410> agoria<00:00:19.770> theory<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.250> simply

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
know the pith agoria theory is simply

the algebraic saying a2 plus p2 equals

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.720 
the algebraic saying a2 plus p2 equals
c2<00:00:24.140> what<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.320> means<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> white

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
c2 what this means is that in a white

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.269 
c2 what this means is that in a white
kangal<00:00:27.330> both<00:00:27.630> right<00:00:27.930> side<00:00:28.230> squared<00:00:28.710> then<00:00:29.039> I

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
kangal both right side squared then I

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.420 
kangal both right side squared then I
will<00:00:29.609> equal<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.060> hypotenuse<00:00:30.689> squared<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.980> is

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
will equal the hypotenuse squared and is

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.510 
will equal the hypotenuse squared and is
getting<00:00:32.640> closer<00:00:32.969> my<00:00:33.360> triangle<00:00:33.870> alright<00:00:34.520> Dino
