to bring the size down we the size is

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.330 
to bring the size down we the size is
what<00:05:52.960> like<00:05:53.229> you<00:05:53.410> did<00:05:53.590> on<00:05:53.770> the<00:05:53.830> first<00:05:54.070> one<00:05:54.160> to

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
what like you did on the first one to

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.730 
what like you did on the first one to
bring<00:05:55.000> the<00:05:55.180> size<00:05:55.390> down<00:05:55.419> just<00:05:56.260> to<00:05:56.410> where<00:05:56.590> it

bring the size down just to where it

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.779 
bring the size down just to where it
just<00:05:57.900> do<00:05:58.900> it<00:05:59.050> really<00:05:59.680> touches<00:06:00.070> it<00:06:00.400> okay<00:06:00.729> so
