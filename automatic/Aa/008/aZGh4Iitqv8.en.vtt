00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210 

so<00:00:00.930> I'm<00:00:01.050> actually<00:00:01.170> on<00:00:01.350> the<00:00:01.410> cell<00:00:01.680> network<00:00:01.890> just

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
so I'm actually on the cell network just

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.610 
so I'm actually on the cell network just
before<00:00:02.550> extra<00:00:02.820> effect<00:00:03.179> that's<00:00:03.899> not<00:00:04.200> my<00:00:04.350> chairs

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
before extra effect that's not my chairs

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.490 
before extra effect that's not my chairs
so<00:00:05.549> what<00:00:05.819> you<00:00:05.879> can<00:00:06.000> see<00:00:06.060> here<00:00:06.210> is<00:00:06.750> that<00:00:07.049> if<00:00:07.319> I

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
so what you can see here is that if I

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.980 
so what you can see here is that if I
pinch<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.370> zoom<00:00:08.429> you'll<00:00:09.240> see<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.450> very<00:00:09.599> small

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
pinch and zoom you'll see a very small

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.080 
pinch and zoom you'll see a very small
scaling<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.830> map<00:00:11.040> at<00:00:11.429> very<00:00:11.790> smooth

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
scaling of the map at very smooth

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.240 
scaling of the map at very smooth
scaling<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.780> labels<00:00:13.200> yeah<00:00:13.830> because<00:00:13.980> we're

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
scaling of the labels yeah because we're

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.980 
scaling of the labels yeah because we're
dynamically<00:00:14.700> rendering<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.269> tiles<00:00:15.690> on<00:00:15.960> the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
dynamically rendering the tiles on the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.260 
dynamically rendering the tiles on the
phone<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.430> gives<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.699> much<00:00:17.820> smoother

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
phone and it gives you a much smoother

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.300 
phone and it gives you a much smoother
experience<00:00:18.359> before<00:00:18.840> fluid<00:00:19.410> feels<00:00:19.680> much<00:00:19.859> nicer

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
experience before fluid feels much nicer

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.670 
experience before fluid feels much nicer
and<00:00:20.939> one<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.720> really<00:00:21.900> cool<00:00:22.020> features<00:00:22.500> on

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
and one of the really cool features on

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.320 
and one of the really cool features on
this<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.430> if<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.609> use<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> multi-touch

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
this is that if I use a multi-touch

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.509 
this is that if I use a multi-touch
gesture<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.140> basically<00:00:25.500> drag<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.099> map<00:00:26.250> like

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
gesture to basically drag the map like

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.320 
gesture to basically drag the map like
this<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:27.029> then<00:00:27.660> get<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.960> 3d<00:00:28.710> perspective<00:00:29.269> and<00:00:30.269> I

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
this I then get a 3d perspective and I

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.510 
this I then get a 3d perspective and I
can<00:00:30.510> make<00:00:30.630> another<00:00:30.869> gesture<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.309> to

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
can make another gesture like this to

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.729 
can make another gesture like this to
twist<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.210> map<00:00:33.420> around<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.200> basically

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
twist the map around and basically

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.979 
twist the map around and basically
oriented<00:00:35.640> into<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.329> perspective<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.840> I

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
oriented into the perspective that I

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.560 
oriented into the perspective that I
want<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.230> see<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.879> what<00:00:39.180> we're<00:00:39.329> doing<00:00:39.360> is

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
want to see and so what we're doing is

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.790 
want to see and so what we're doing is
we're<00:00:39.750> doing<00:00:39.809> something<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.320> we<00:00:40.469> refer<00:00:40.770> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
we're doing something that we refer to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.920 
we're doing something that we refer to
as<00:00:40.980> vector<00:00:41.610> maps<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.210> instead<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.570> downloading

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
as vector maps so instead of downloading

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.979 
as vector maps so instead of downloading
tiles<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.860> are<00:00:44.010> part<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:45.030> map<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.690> you're

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
tiles that are part of a map that you're

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.630 
tiles that are part of a map that you're
seeing<00:00:46.230> we're<00:00:46.410> actually<00:00:46.559> downloading<00:00:47.280> vector

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
seeing we're actually downloading vector

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.549 
seeing we're actually downloading vector
based<00:00:47.789> information<00:00:48.230> means<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.320> can<00:00:49.440> actually

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
based information means we can actually

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.700 
based information means we can actually
smoothly<00:00:50.070> pan<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.969> zoom<00:00:51.320> without<00:00:52.320> having

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
smoothly pan and zoom without having

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.350 
smoothly pan and zoom without having
loading<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.250> they<00:00:53.670> probably<00:00:53.969> have<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
loading so they probably have the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.540 
loading so they probably have the
experience<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:55.020> sitting<00:00:55.350> there<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.829> maps<00:00:56.430> for

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
experience of sitting there on maps for

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.250 
experience of sitting there on maps for
mobile<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.149> there's<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.329> gray<00:00:57.570> spot<00:00:57.930> on<00:00:58.199> your

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
mobile and there's a gray spot on your

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.689 
mobile and there's a gray spot on your
screening<00:00:58.829> your<00:00:59.070> radio<00:00:59.340> virtual<00:00:59.579> mode

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
screening your radio virtual mode

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.430 
screening your radio virtual mode
because<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.059> piece<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.449> need<00:01:00.719> hasn't

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
because the piece that you need hasn't

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.200 
because the piece that you need hasn't
come<00:01:01.559> down<00:01:01.770> we're<00:01:02.399> doing<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.730> actually

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
come down we're doing that actually

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.870 
come down we're doing that actually
allows<00:01:03.390> us<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.780> load<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.260> up<00:01:04.559> front<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.760> let's

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
allows us to load this up front so let's

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.399 
allows us to load this up front so let's
go<00:01:06.000> ahead<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.210> look<00:01:06.540> at<00:01:06.659> specific<00:01:07.080> building

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
go ahead and look at specific building

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.010 
go ahead and look at specific building
let's<00:01:07.590> try<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> imperative<00:01:08.540> ok<00:01:09.540> I'm<00:01:09.720> feeling

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
let's try the imperative ok I'm feeling

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.630 
let's try the imperative ok I'm feeling
brave<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.830> I'm<00:01:11.010> going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.220> try<00:01:11.340> speech

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
brave so I'm going to try speech

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.530 
brave so I'm going to try speech
recognition<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.330> see<00:01:12.450> how<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.630> works<00:01:12.810> I

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
recognition and see how this works I

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.230 
recognition and see how this works I
Empire<00:01:15.540> State<00:01:15.840> Building<00:01:16.939> so<00:01:17.939> now<00:01:18.060> what's

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
Empire State Building so now what's

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.429 
Empire State Building so now what's
happening<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.570> were<00:01:18.689> streamed<00:01:19.020> Leonean<00:01:19.350> to

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
happening is were streamed Leonean to

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.170 
happening is were streamed Leonean to
our<00:01:19.530> servers<00:01:19.950> for<00:01:20.130> data<00:01:20.369> centers<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.060> does

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
our servers for data centers it does

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.880 
our servers for data centers it does
speech<00:01:21.360> recognition<00:01:21.659> analysis<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.650> trans

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
speech recognition analysis the trans

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.520 
speech recognition analysis the trans
results<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.400> lot<00:01:23.520> faster<00:01:23.640> than<00:01:23.909> typing<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:25.200> when

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
results a lot faster than typing so when

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.920 
results a lot faster than typing so when
my<00:01:26.009> favorite<00:01:26.520> feature<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.479> version<00:01:27.840> of

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
my favorite feature of this version of

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.630 
my favorite feature of this version of
maps<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.590> fact<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.130> about<00:01:29.280> 3d

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
maps is the fact that is about 3d

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.640 
maps is the fact that is about 3d
building<00:01:29.970> support<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.960> we<00:01:31.079> actually<00:01:31.439> have

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
building support so we actually have

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.530 
building support so we actually have
dueling<00:01:32.100> information<00:01:32.759> geometric<00:01:33.270> billing

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
dueling information geometric billing

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.270 
dueling information geometric billing
information<00:01:33.780> for<00:01:34.350> over<00:01:34.680> 100<00:01:35.130> cities

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
information for over 100 cities

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.050 
information for over 100 cities
worldwide<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:36.810> i<00:01:37.229> zoom<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.729> Empire

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
worldwide so as i zoom in on the Empire

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.210 
worldwide so as i zoom in on the Empire
State<00:01:39.270> Building<00:01:39.720> what<00:01:40.200> will<00:01:40.350> happen<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
State Building what will happen is the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.590 
State Building what will happen is the
building's<00:01:41.729> not<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.270> Empire<00:01:42.450> State

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
building's not just the Empire State

i'll actually comes airplane mode so

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.640 
i'll actually comes airplane mode so
that<00:03:58.609> we<00:03:59.150> see<00:03:59.359> as<00:03:59.449> i<00:03:59.569> have<00:03:59.689> no<00:03:59.810> connection<00:04:00.290> yeah

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
that we see as i have no connection yeah

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
and i have an airplane symbol here at

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.460 
and i have an airplane symbol here at
the<00:04:03.680> top<00:04:03.889> and<00:04:04.759> so<00:04:05.060> at<00:04:05.599> what<00:04:05.870> you'll<00:04:06.019> notice<00:04:06.139> is

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
the top and so at what you'll notice is

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.770 
the top and so at what you'll notice is
that<00:04:06.829> everything<00:04:07.189> is<00:04:07.699> still<00:04:08.000> working<00:04:08.299> exactly

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
that everything is still working exactly

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.229 
that everything is still working exactly
as<00:04:09.019> before<00:04:09.799> it<00:04:10.099> and<00:04:10.759> what's<00:04:11.030> actually

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
as before it and what's actually

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.439 
as before it and what's actually
happened<00:04:11.780> here<00:04:11.989> is<00:04:12.379> that<00:04:12.439> we<00:04:12.680> intelligently

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:13.449 
happened here is that we intelligently

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:16.479 
happened here is that we intelligently
prefetch<00:04:14.449> the<00:04:14.959> map<00:04:15.169> information<00:04:15.530> and<00:04:16.159> my

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
prefetch the map information and my

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.860 
prefetch the map information and my
intelligence<00:04:17.030> either<00:04:17.180> stating<00:04:17.599> that<00:04:17.690> we've

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
intelligence either stating that we've

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.479 
intelligence either stating that we've
looked<00:04:18.049> at<00:04:18.229> the<00:04:18.349> positions<00:04:18.739> that<00:04:18.829> infrequent

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
looked at the positions that infrequent

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.189 
looked at the positions that infrequent
most<00:04:19.669> for<00:04:20.000> those<00:04:20.090> people<00:04:20.299> have<00:04:20.389> like<00:04:20.570> work<00:04:20.780> and

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
most for those people have like work and

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.070 
most for those people have like work and
home<00:04:21.380> and<00:04:22.370> we<00:04:22.520> pull<00:04:23.120> that<00:04:23.270> data<00:04:23.419> down<00:04:23.750> on<00:04:23.990> the

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
home and we pull that data down on the

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.839 
home and we pull that data down on the
client<00:04:24.470> side<00:04:24.530> and<00:04:24.949> so<00:04:25.310> it<00:04:25.430> means<00:04:25.550> that<00:04:25.639> when

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
client side and so it means that when

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.610 
client side and so it means that when
you<00:04:25.909> start<00:04:26.180> up<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:26.419> app<00:04:26.539> is<00:04:26.780> instantaneous

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
you start up the app is instantaneous

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.740 
you start up the app is instantaneous
and<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.460> tiles<00:04:28.789> are<00:04:28.849> just<00:04:29.030> immediately<00:04:29.479> there

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
and the tiles are just immediately there

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.899 
and the tiles are just immediately there
but<00:04:30.139> also<00:04:30.320> if<00:04:30.620> you<00:04:30.710> have<00:04:30.919> no<00:04:31.130> network<00:04:31.490> or<00:04:31.669> flaky

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:31.909 
but also if you have no network or flaky

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:33.830 
but also if you have no network or flaky
network<00:04:32.330> they<00:04:33.259> also

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
network they also

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.140 
network they also
here<00:04:33.990> for<00:04:34.230> you<00:04:34.430> so<00:04:35.430> like<00:04:35.610> for<00:04:35.699> example<00:04:35.760> in<00:04:36.000> your

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
here for you so like for example in your

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.090 
here for you so like for example in your
case<00:04:36.330> that<00:04:36.540> you<00:04:36.780> spend<00:04:37.020> time<00:04:37.050> in<00:04:37.320> seattle<00:04:37.500> in

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
case that you spend time in seattle in

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.670 
case that you spend time in seattle in
san<00:04:38.490> francisco<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.240> now<00:04:39.389> you're<00:04:39.540> in<00:04:39.660> Paris<00:04:40.110> so

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
san francisco and now you're in Paris so

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.290 
san francisco and now you're in Paris so
we<00:04:40.770> would<00:04:40.889> have<00:04:41.100> a<00:04:41.370> city<00:04:41.610> maps<00:04:41.850> for<00:04:42.150> those

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
we would have a city maps for those

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.750 
we would have a city maps for those
cities<00:04:42.690> already<00:04:43.340> downloaded<00:04:44.340> on<00:04:44.400> your<00:04:44.430> phone

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
cities already downloaded on your phone

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.250 
cities already downloaded on your phone
especially<00:04:45.210> in<00:04:45.300> locations<00:04:45.810> in<00:04:45.930> those<00:04:46.050> cities

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
especially in locations in those cities

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.990 
especially in locations in those cities
that<00:04:46.530> you<00:04:46.650> tend<00:04:46.830> to<00:04:46.889> be<00:04:47.040> in<00:04:47.190> so<00:04:47.699> i<00:04:47.760> think<00:04:47.850> is

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
that you tend to be in so i think is

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.250 
that you tend to be in so i think is
pretty<00:04:48.150> interesting<00:04:48.720> when<00:04:48.930> you<00:04:49.020> think<00:04:49.199> about

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
pretty interesting when you think about

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.080 
pretty interesting when you think about
now<00:04:49.830> we<00:04:49.889> actually<00:04:50.100> allows<00:04:50.520> what<00:04:50.699> a<00:04:50.760> lot<00:04:50.880> of<00:04:50.970> our

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
now we actually allows what a lot of our

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.310 
now we actually allows what a lot of our
time<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.479> you<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:51.660> infrastructure<00:04:52.139> and

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
time to you the infrastructure and

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.850 
time to you the infrastructure and
getting<00:04:52.530> ready<00:04:52.680> for<00:04:52.919> bigger<00:04:53.160> and<00:04:53.250> bigger<00:04:53.580> data
