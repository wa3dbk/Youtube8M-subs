hi<00:00:11.880> everyone<00:00:12.090> so<00:00:12.650> the<00:00:13.650> galaxy<00:00:14.250> s5<00:00:14.730> appears<00:00:15.179> to

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
hi everyone so the galaxy s5 appears to

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.960 
hi everyone so the galaxy s5 appears to
have<00:00:15.509> leaked<00:00:15.960> out<00:00:16.440> early<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.369> announcement

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
have leaked out early the announcement

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.640 
have leaked out early the announcement
is<00:00:18.029> actually<00:00:18.300> entered<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:18.840> evening<00:00:19.380> but

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
is actually entered this evening but

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.740 
is actually entered this evening but
someone<00:00:20.070> has<00:00:20.189> managed<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.520> get<00:00:20.640> some<00:00:21.510> pretty

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
someone has managed to get some pretty

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.900 
someone has managed to get some pretty
high<00:00:22.109> resolution<00:00:22.619> pictures<00:00:22.949> really<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.430> what

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
high resolution pictures really of what

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.029 
high resolution pictures really of what
the<00:00:24.240> galaxy<00:00:24.570> s5<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:25.140> going<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.500> look<00:00:25.650> like<00:00:25.680> as

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
the galaxy s5 is going to look like as

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.160 
the galaxy s5 is going to look like as
well<00:00:26.430> as<00:00:26.580> some<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.599> software<00:00:27.960> and

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
well as some of the software and

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.290 
well as some of the software and
features<00:00:28.529> we<00:00:28.710> may<00:00:29.340> very<00:00:29.640> well<00:00:29.789> expect<00:00:30.119> now

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
features we may very well expect now

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.519 
features we may very well expect now
obviously<00:00:30.900> none<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.289> stuff<00:00:31.410> is

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
obviously none of this stuff is

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.830 
obviously none of this stuff is
confirmed<00:00:32.040> these<00:00:32.219> could<00:00:32.550> be<00:00:32.730> incredibly<00:00:33.450> good

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
confirmed these could be incredibly good

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.660 
confirmed these could be incredibly good
fakes<00:00:34.140> but<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.920> seems<00:00:35.100> unlikely<00:00:35.430> at<00:00:35.640> this

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
fakes but it seems unlikely at this

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.280 
fakes but it seems unlikely at this
point<00:00:35.820> with<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> handset<00:00:36.840> going<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.170> be

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
point with the handset going to be

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.190 
point with the handset going to be
announced<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:38.160> just<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.610> few<00:00:38.850> hours<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.840> what<00:00:40.140> am

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
announced in just a few hours so what am

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.860 
announced in just a few hours so what am
I<00:00:40.290> reactions<00:00:40.890> well<00:00:41.210> largely<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.570> doesn't

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
I reactions well largely it doesn't

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.740 
I reactions well largely it doesn't
appear<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.800> galaxy<00:00:44.610> s5<00:00:44.879> has<00:00:44.910> changed

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
appear that the galaxy s5 has changed

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.690 
appear that the galaxy s5 has changed
that<00:00:46.050> much<00:00:46.079> from<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> galaxy<00:00:46.800> s4<00:00:47.309> certainly

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
that much from the galaxy s4 certainly

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.150 
that much from the galaxy s4 certainly
on<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.910> front<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.390> appears<00:00:49.020> very<00:00:49.110> similar<00:00:49.710> now

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
on the front it appears very similar now

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.069 
on the front it appears very similar now
various<00:00:50.969> rumours<00:00:51.270> are<00:00:51.360> suggesting<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
various rumours are suggesting that the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.069 
various rumours are suggesting that the
fingerprint<00:00:52.710> scanner<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.610> built<00:00:54.390> into<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
fingerprint scanner is built into the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.930 
fingerprint scanner is built into the
home<00:00:55.320> button<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.770> simply<00:00:56.100> swiping<00:00:56.520> down<00:00:56.579> with

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
home button and simply swiping down with

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.420 
home button and simply swiping down with
your<00:00:57.109> chosen<00:00:58.109> digit<00:00:58.620> will<00:00:58.980> allow<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.280> to

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
your chosen digit will allow you to

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.220 
your chosen digit will allow you to
unlock<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> device<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.090> also<00:01:00.510> make<00:01:00.719> payments

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
unlock the device and also make payments

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.070 
unlock the device and also make payments
via<00:01:01.680> paypal<00:01:01.940> now<00:01:02.940> there<00:01:03.359> are<00:01:03.449> also<00:01:03.539> appears<00:01:04.019> to

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
via paypal now there are also appears to

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.719 
via paypal now there are also appears to
be<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:05.540> waterproofing<00:01:06.540> added<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.380> device

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
be a waterproofing added to this device

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.760 
be a waterproofing added to this device
certainly<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.909> USB<00:01:09.420> port<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> bottom<00:01:10.350> now

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
certainly the USB port on the bottom now

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.030 
certainly the USB port on the bottom now
has<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> giant<00:01:11.490> plug<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:13.110> whether<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.710> just

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
has a giant plug so whether this is just

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.670 
has a giant plug so whether this is just
the<00:01:14.130> active<00:01:14.580> version<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.450> galaxy<00:01:15.630> s5<00:01:16.200> that

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
the active version of the galaxy s5 that

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.899 
the active version of the galaxy s5 that
we're<00:01:16.799> looking<00:01:17.070> at<00:01:17.189> or<00:01:17.340> whether<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:17.850> is

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
we're looking at or whether this is

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.700 
we're looking at or whether this is
actually<00:01:18.360> going<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.570> be<00:01:18.659> standard<00:01:19.110> across<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
actually going to be standard across the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.460 
actually going to be standard across the
s5<00:01:20.189> range<00:01:20.520> not<00:01:21.000> too<00:01:21.180> sure<00:01:21.450> be<00:01:21.930> interesting<00:01:22.380> to

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
s5 range not too sure be interesting to

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.420 
s5 range not too sure be interesting to
find<00:01:22.500> out<00:01:22.950> now<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.880> back<00:01:24.270> cover<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:25.430> probably

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
find out now the back cover is probably

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.399 
find out now the back cover is probably
the<00:01:26.580> thing<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.909> makes<00:01:27.060> me<00:01:27.180> go<00:01:27.420> urgh<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.170> most

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
the thing that makes me go urgh the most

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.670 
the thing that makes me go urgh the most
it<00:01:28.680> doesn't<00:01:28.979> look<00:01:29.250> particularly<00:01:29.759> attractive

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
it doesn't look particularly attractive

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
it doesn't look particularly attractive
certainly<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.829> various<00:01:32.130> colors<00:01:32.490> that

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
certainly in the various colors that

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.300 
certainly in the various colors that
have<00:01:33.090> leaked<00:01:33.299> out<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:33.659> far<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.170> does<00:01:34.799> look<00:01:34.920> from

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
have leaked out so far it does look from

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.770 
have leaked out so far it does look from
a<00:01:35.369> distance<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:36.000> be<00:01:36.119> rather<00:01:36.600> fugly<00:01:37.310> but<00:01:38.310> as

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
a distance to be rather fugly but as

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.940 
a distance to be rather fugly but as
with<00:01:39.780> anything<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.290> depends<00:01:40.829> what<00:01:40.920> it

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
with anything it just depends what it

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.289 
with anything it just depends what it
actually<00:01:41.189> looks<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.700> when<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:41.970> get<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.210> in

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
actually looks like when you get it in

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.330 
actually looks like when you get it in
your<00:01:42.479> hand<00:01:42.720> images<00:01:43.409> especially<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:43.920> they<00:01:44.040> use

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
your hand images especially if they use

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.069 
your hand images especially if they use
flash<00:01:44.640> where<00:01:44.939> they've<00:01:45.060> got<00:01:45.240> light<00:01:45.810> hitting

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
flash where they've got light hitting

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.139 
flash where they've got light hitting
the<00:01:46.350> device<00:01:46.920> at<00:01:47.100> particular<00:01:47.340> angle<00:01:47.759> can<00:01:47.970> make

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
the device at particular angle can make

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.710 
the device at particular angle can make
these<00:01:48.299> back<00:01:48.509> covers<00:01:48.840> look<00:01:49.100> particularly<00:01:50.100> grim

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
these back covers look particularly grim

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.719 
these back covers look particularly grim
but<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.990> doesn't<00:01:52.470> look<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:52.770> Samsung<00:01:53.579> have

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
but it doesn't look like Samsung have

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.730 
but it doesn't look like Samsung have
made<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.090> major<00:01:54.390> change<00:01:54.869> here<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.470> all

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
made a major change here in the all

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.969 
made a major change here in the all
polycarbonate<00:01:56.700> body<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.689> galaxy<00:01:58.439> s5

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
polycarbonate body of the galaxy s5

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.440 
polycarbonate body of the galaxy s5
certainly<00:01:59.700> all<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.850> rumors<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.240> they<00:02:00.360> were

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
certainly all the rumors that they were

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.539

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
data limits so not something I think

data limits so not something I think
that's<00:03:14.310> going<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.489> become<00:03:14.609> particularly

I personally think it's going to be a

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.390 
I personally think it's going to be a
1080p<00:03:32.519> display<00:03:33.030> if<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.659> is<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:34.199> quad<00:03:34.859> HD<00:03:35.370> display

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400

1080p display if it is a quad HD display
I<00:03:35.819> will<00:03:36.150> be<00:03:36.269> very<00:03:36.540> very<00:03:36.629> surprised<00:03:37.340> mostly

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
I will be very very surprised mostly

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.619 
I will be very very surprised mostly
because<00:03:38.459> they<00:03:38.609> just<00:03:38.729> doesn't<00:03:39.060> feel<00:03:39.209> like

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
because they just doesn't feel like

because they just doesn't feel like
there's<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.959> need<00:03:40.079> for<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.560> there's<00:03:40.709> no<00:03:40.799> content

there's a need for it there's no content

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.119 
there's a need for it there's no content
for<00:03:41.430> starters<00:03:41.790> there<00:03:42.120> is<00:03:42.359> no<00:03:43.019> real<00:03:43.409> desire<00:03:43.680> out

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
for starters there is no real desire out

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.369 
for starters there is no real desire out
there<00:03:44.370> right<00:03:44.579> now<00:03:44.659> not<00:03:45.659> at<00:03:45.810> this<00:03:45.959> stage<00:03:46.139> of

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
there right now not at this stage of

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.819 
there right now not at this stage of
2014<00:03:47.129> for<00:03:48.000> 2k<00:03:48.419> displays<00:03:48.810> I<00:03:49.049> think<00:03:49.349> towards<00:03:49.739> the

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
2014 for 2k displays I think towards the

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.860 
2014 for 2k displays I think towards the
end<00:03:49.949> of<00:03:50.099> the<00:03:50.159> year<00:03:50.540> certainly<00:03:51.540> I<00:03:51.599> think<00:03:51.629> the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
end of the year certainly I think the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.890 
end of the year certainly I think the
note<00:03:52.229> 4<00:03:52.560> will<00:03:52.919> pack<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.609> 2k<00:03:54.000> display<00:03:54.150> but<00:03:54.840> I

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
note 4 will pack a 2k display but I

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.860 
note 4 will pack a 2k display but I
can't<00:03:55.259> see<00:03:55.470> it<00:03:55.560> on<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.799> galaxy<00:03:56.430> s5<00:03:56.870> personally

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
can't see it on the galaxy s5 personally

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.689 
can't see it on the galaxy s5 personally
otherwise<00:03:58.319> we<00:03:58.650> would<00:03:58.799> more<00:03:59.129> than<00:03:59.159> likely<00:03:59.430> have

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
otherwise we would more than likely have

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.339 
otherwise we would more than likely have
heard<00:03:59.879> a<00:04:00.060> number<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.509> other<00:04:00.659> manufacturers

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
heard a number of other manufacturers

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.080 
heard a number of other manufacturers
like<00:04:01.500> Sony<00:04:01.949> for<00:04:02.129> instance<00:04:02.489> who<00:04:02.609> obviously<00:04:02.879> is

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
like Sony for instance who obviously is

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.849 
like Sony for instance who obviously is
very<00:04:03.239> big<00:04:03.629> in<00:04:03.659> displays<00:04:04.109> would<00:04:04.650> have<00:04:04.739> also

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
very big in displays would have also

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.800 
very big in displays would have also
gone<00:04:05.129> to<00:04:05.280> 2k<00:04:05.609> at<00:04:05.729> this<00:04:05.849> point<00:04:06.090> in<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.299> cycle<00:04:06.479> I

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
gone to 2k at this point in the cycle I

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.229 
gone to 2k at this point in the cycle I
just<00:04:07.590> don't<00:04:07.769> think<00:04:07.949> it's<00:04:08.069> likely<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:08.879> I<00:04:09.090> mean

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
just don't think it's likely so I mean

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.719 
just don't think it's likely so I mean
that<00:04:09.359> is<00:04:09.479> what<00:04:09.509> we<00:04:09.780> know<00:04:09.930> of<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.229> galaxy<00:04:10.680> s5<00:04:11.310> so

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:11.729 
that is what we know of the galaxy s5 so

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:14.599 
that is what we know of the galaxy s5 so
far<00:04:12.120> I<00:04:12.900> will<00:04:13.349> be<00:04:13.470> back<00:04:13.620> later<00:04:14.250> today<00:04:14.489> or

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
far I will be back later today or

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.759 
far I will be back later today or
probably<00:04:15.090> tomorrow<00:04:15.209> morning<00:04:15.659> with<00:04:15.840> more

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
probably tomorrow morning with more

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.099 
probably tomorrow morning with more
thoughts<00:04:17.130> depending<00:04:17.729> on<00:04:17.849> if<00:04:18.419> we<00:04:18.750> actually<00:04:18.900> get

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
thoughts depending on if we actually get

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.629 
thoughts depending on if we actually get
to<00:04:19.139> see<00:04:19.349> the<00:04:19.470> device<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:19.769> if<00:04:20.130> it<00:04:20.220> turns<00:04:20.430> out<00:04:20.579> to

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639
