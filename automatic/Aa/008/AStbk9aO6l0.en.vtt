home for blush I got and it's a gorgeous

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.589 
home for blush I got and it's a gorgeous
pinky<00:00:28.859> shade<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.250> did<00:00:29.490> use<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.150> one<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.420> my

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
pinky shade I did use it in one of my

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.690 
pinky shade I did use it in one of my
recent<00:00:30.869> tutorials<00:00:31.710> it's<00:00:32.369> kind<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.550> like<00:00:32.640> a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
recent tutorials it's kind of like a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.910 
recent tutorials it's kind of like a
pinky<00:00:33.239> peach<00:00:33.480> shade<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.320> has<00:00:34.440> got<00:00:34.649> shimmer

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
pinky peach shade and it has got shimmer

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.430 
pinky peach shade and it has got shimmer
it<00:00:35.100> now<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.250> think<00:00:35.399> most<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.059> Tom<00:00:36.840> folds<00:00:37.230> and

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
it now I think most of Tom folds and

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.680 
it now I think most of Tom folds and
blushes<00:00:38.070> do<00:00:38.250> have<00:00:38.579> some<00:00:38.910> shimmer<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.480> but

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
blushes do have some shimmer in it but

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.440 
blushes do have some shimmer in it but
it's<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:40.170> gorgeous<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:41.070> it's<00:00:41.940> weird<00:00:42.239> because

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
it's just gorgeous it it's weird because

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.810 
it's just gorgeous it it's weird because
I<00:00:42.809> never<00:00:43.050> really<00:00:43.440> considered<00:00:43.950> myself<00:00:44.250> much<00:00:44.670> of

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
I never really considered myself much of

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.299 
I never really considered myself much of
like<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> blush<00:00:45.329> lover<00:00:45.809> but<00:00:46.289> these<00:00:47.070> are

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
like a blush lover but these are

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.889 
like a blush lover but these are
completely<00:00:47.910> stolen<00:00:48.270> my<00:00:48.390> heart<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.719> think

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
completely stolen my heart I think

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.510 
completely stolen my heart I think
they're<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.410> pigmented<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.100> they're<00:00:50.280> so

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
they're so pigmented and they're so

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.639 
they're so pigmented and they're so
creamy<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:51.719> actually<00:00:51.899> been<00:00:52.199> reaching

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
creamy and I have actually been reaching

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.920 
creamy and I have actually been reaching
for<00:00:52.829> these<00:00:53.120> more<00:00:54.120> than<00:00:54.329> I've<00:00:54.420> been<00:00:54.449> reaching

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
for these more than I've been reaching

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.750 
for these more than I've been reaching
for<00:00:55.050> my<00:00:55.140> NARS<00:00:55.379> blushes<00:00:55.829> recently<00:00:56.309> which<00:00:56.550> I

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
for my NARS blushes recently which I

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.939 
for my NARS blushes recently which I
think<00:00:57.180> there's<00:00:57.420> quite<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> lot<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.559> so

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
think there's quite a lot it's just so

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.740 
think there's quite a lot it's just so
gorgeous<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.579> gives<00:00:59.730> such<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> nice<00:01:00.210> glow<00:01:00.690> to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
gorgeous it gives such a nice glow to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.439 
gorgeous it gives such a nice glow to
the<00:01:01.109> face<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.710> I'm<00:01:02.309> it's<00:01:02.730> quite<00:01:02.969> similar<00:01:03.300> to

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the face and I'm it's quite similar to

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.969 
the face and I'm it's quite similar to
nas<00:01:03.809> deep<00:01:04.080> throat<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.650> got<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.830> little

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
nas deep throat but it's got a little

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.890 
nas deep throat but it's got a little
bit<00:01:05.189> more<00:01:05.309> peach<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:06.750> got<00:01:06.869> a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
bit more peach to it and it's just got a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.080 
bit more peach to it and it's just got a
bit<00:01:07.140> more<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.470> kick<00:01:07.770> generally<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.430> think<00:01:08.549> so

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
bit more of a kick generally I think so

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.240 
bit more of a kick generally I think so
that's<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.990> gorgeous<00:01:10.409> shade<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.950> think<00:01:11.159> it

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
that's a gorgeous shade and I think it

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.890 
that's a gorgeous shade and I think it
would<00:01:11.340> look<00:01:11.430> fantastic<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> lot<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.479> people

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
would look fantastic on a lot of people

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.750 
would look fantastic on a lot of people
although<00:01:13.049> maybe<00:01:13.799> if<00:01:13.950> you're<00:01:14.130> you've<00:01:14.549> got<00:01:14.729> a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
although maybe if you're you've got a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.490 
although maybe if you're you've got a
much<00:01:15.000> darker<00:01:15.240> skin<00:01:15.600> tone<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> mean<00:01:16.140> maybe<00:01:16.350> it

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
much darker skin tone the mean maybe it

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.320 
much darker skin tone the mean maybe it
wouldn't<00:01:16.680> show<00:01:16.830> up<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.159> much<00:01:17.340> ok<00:01:17.970> then

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
wouldn't show up that much ok then

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.600 
wouldn't show up that much ok then

shades because I don't know sometimes I

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.819

think<00:01:53.640> purple<00:01:54.090> can<00:01:54.720> maybe<00:01:54.990> make<00:01:55.380> me<00:01:55.530> think<00:01:55.680> of

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
think purple can maybe make me think of

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.819 
think purple can maybe make me think of
more<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.130> dated<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:57.170> shadow<00:01:58.170> looks<00:01:58.380> but<00:01:58.799> I

more like dated I shadow looks but I

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.160

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
think when you do it in like a soft way

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.200 
think when you do it in like a soft way
it<00:02:01.439> can<00:02:01.649> really<00:02:02.159> really<00:02:02.490> pretty<00:02:02.700> and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
it can really really pretty and

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.819

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
obviously these kind of shades are

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.190 
obviously these kind of shades are

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:44.969 
depth to the crease because it's a

it's kind of like a straight-up pink
shades<00:03:28.650> maybe<00:03:28.979> got<00:03:29.159> a<00:03:29.340> little<00:03:29.459> bit<00:03:30.239> of<00:03:30.269> like

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
shades maybe got a little bit of like

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.199 
shades maybe got a little bit of like
blue<00:03:31.470> undertones<00:03:32.159> it's<00:03:32.400> not<00:03:32.549> yellow<00:03:32.819> at<00:03:32.940> all

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
blue undertones it's not yellow at all

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.020 
blue undertones it's not yellow at all
but<00:03:33.510> it's<00:03:33.659> so<00:03:33.989> gorgeous<00:03:34.889> and<00:03:35.250> it's<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:35.669> glossy

but it's so gorgeous and it's so glossy

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.259 
but it's so gorgeous and it's so glossy
it's<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:37.109> easy<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.409> apply<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:38.159> I<00:03:38.669> think<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:39.209> a

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
it's so easy to apply and I think it's a

must-have for a lot of people unless

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.649 
must-have for a lot of people unless
you're<00:03:41.400> one<00:03:41.790> of<00:03:41.909> those<00:03:41.970> people<00:03:42.299> who<00:03:42.389> only

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
you're one of those people who only

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.420 
you're one of those people who only
likes<00:03:42.900> lipsticks<00:03:43.500> if<00:03:43.680> they're<00:03:44.099> really

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.030 
likes lipsticks if they're really
full-on<00:03:44.819> creamy<00:03:45.449> pigmented<00:03:45.840> colors<00:03:46.650> but<00:03:46.889> if

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
full-on creamy pigmented colors but if

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.129 
full-on creamy pigmented colors but if
you<00:03:47.190> do<00:03:47.400> like<00:03:47.609> things<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.239> bit<00:03:48.359> Shearer<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:48.959> a

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
you do like things a bit Shearer and a

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:50.719 
you do like things a bit Shearer and a
bit<00:03:49.290> more<00:03:49.440> comfortable<00:03:50.010> than<00:03:50.190> this<00:03:50.430> is

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:50.729 
bit more comfortable than this is

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:52.879 
bit more comfortable than this is
fantastic<00:03:51.329> I<00:03:51.780> also<00:03:52.049> think<00:03:52.290> these<00:03:52.470> lipsticks

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
fantastic I also think these lipsticks

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.550 
fantastic I also think these lipsticks
are<00:03:53.129> great<00:03:53.400> for<00:03:53.579> people<00:03:53.760> who<00:03:54.419> maybe<00:03:54.840> aren't<00:03:55.349> so

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
are great for people who maybe aren't so

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.110 
are great for people who maybe aren't so
comfortable<00:03:56.129> wearing<00:03:56.370> brighter<00:03:56.639> colors

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
comfortable wearing brighter colors

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.089 
comfortable wearing brighter colors
because<00:03:57.510> I<00:03:57.689> used<00:03:58.169> to<00:03:58.290> be<00:03:58.379> one<00:03:58.409> of<00:03:58.530> those<00:03:58.680> people

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
because I used to be one of those people

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.399 
because I used to be one of those people
but<00:03:59.340> this<00:03:59.609> formulation<00:04:00.150> really<00:04:00.629> eases<00:04:01.109> um

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
but this formulation really eases um

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.589 
but this formulation really eases um
because<00:04:01.769> it<00:04:02.370> doesn't<00:04:02.760> feel<00:04:02.909> really<00:04:03.150> heavy<00:04:03.419> or

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
because it doesn't feel really heavy or

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.059 
because it doesn't feel really heavy or
crewing<00:04:03.959> on<00:04:04.169> the<00:04:04.319> lips<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.739> kind<00:04:04.919> of<00:04:04.949> forget

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
crewing on the lips you kind of forget

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.699 
crewing on the lips you kind of forget
they're<00:04:05.400> there<00:04:05.430> so<00:04:06.060> it's<00:04:06.720> easier<00:04:07.379> to<00:04:07.500> go<00:04:07.590> out

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
they're there so it's easier to go out

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.860 
they're there so it's easier to go out
in<00:04:07.859> public<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.280> be<00:04:08.609> natural<00:04:09.239> because<00:04:09.540> you

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
in public and be natural because you

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.240 
in public and be natural because you
don't<00:04:10.079> really<00:04:10.199> remember<00:04:10.409> they're<00:04:10.769> there<00:04:10.949> and

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.249 
don't really remember they're there and
I<00:04:11.310> never<00:04:11.609> really<00:04:11.909> find<00:04:12.090> that<00:04:12.389> they<00:04:12.569> bleed<00:04:12.959> out

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:13.259 
I never really find that they bleed out

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:16.129 
I never really find that they bleed out
of<00:04:13.590> my<00:04:13.739> lip<00:04:13.919> line<00:04:14.159> or<00:04:14.459> smudge<00:04:15.180> badly<00:04:15.780> they<00:04:15.959> have

really<00:04:16.380> great<00:04:16.650> lasting<00:04:17.549> power<00:04:17.729> so<00:04:18.000> they're

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
really great lasting power so they're

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.060

looks<00:04:56.949> kind<00:04:57.159> of<00:04:57.219> frizzy<00:04:57.699> I<00:04:57.729> feel<00:04:58.029> like<00:04:58.120> it

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
looks kind of frizzy I feel like it

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.760 
looks kind of frizzy I feel like it
needs<00:04:58.389> something<00:04:58.689> just<00:04:58.990> to<00:04:59.110> tame<00:04:59.349> it<00:04:59.500> a<00:04:59.560> bit

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
needs something just to tame it a bit

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.459 
needs something just to tame it a bit
and<00:05:00.009> this<00:05:00.340> is<00:05:00.520> a<00:05:00.550> really<00:05:01.090> really<00:05:01.120> light<00:05:01.840> serum

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:02.469 
and this is a really really light serum

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.890 
and this is a really really light serum
that<00:05:02.650> adds<00:05:02.860> shine<00:05:03.250> and<00:05:03.759> kind<00:05:04.210> of<00:05:04.330> smoothes<00:05:04.689> out

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
that adds shine and kind of smoothes out

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.170 
that adds shine and kind of smoothes out
the<00:05:04.960> frizz<00:05:05.379> but<00:05:05.620> it's<00:05:05.800> not<00:05:05.949> really<00:05:06.279> heavy<00:05:06.789> I

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
the frizz but it's not really heavy I

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.369 
the frizz but it's not really heavy I
don't<00:05:07.509> have<00:05:07.629> the<00:05:07.689> thickest<00:05:07.930> hair<00:05:08.169> in<00:05:08.259> the

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:08.379 
don't have the thickest hair in the

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.409 
don't have the thickest hair in the
world<00:05:08.560> so<00:05:08.740> if<00:05:08.800> something<00:05:09.129> was<00:05:09.340> thick<00:05:09.819> and<00:05:10.000> kind

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
world so if something was thick and kind

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.779 
world so if something was thick and kind
of<00:05:10.509> heavy<00:05:11.139> then<00:05:11.620> you<00:05:12.009> really<00:05:12.279> would<00:05:12.400> notice<00:05:12.729> it

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
of heavy then you really would notice it

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.429 
of heavy then you really would notice it
on<00:05:12.849> my<00:05:13.000> hair<00:05:13.210> but<00:05:13.360> this<00:05:13.539> keeps<00:05:13.840> my<00:05:13.960> hair<00:05:14.139> light

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:14.439 
on my hair but this keeps my hair light

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.290 
on my hair but this keeps my hair light
and<00:05:14.680> fluffy<00:05:14.889> but<00:05:15.189> it<00:05:15.279> just<00:05:15.430> tames<00:05:15.729> the<00:05:15.729> frizzen

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
and fluffy but it just tames the frizzen

add shine and my fragrance of the month
is<00:05:18.969> quite<00:05:19.270> a<00:05:19.300> different<00:05:19.719> one<00:05:19.839> for<00:05:19.990> me<00:05:20.139> because

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:20.529 
is quite a different one for me because

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:22.379 
is quite a different one for me because
I've<00:05:20.919> had<00:05:21.339> this<00:05:21.490> my<00:05:21.669> collection<00:05:22.029> for<00:05:22.060> a<00:05:22.210> long

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
I've had this my collection for a long

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:23.730 
I've had this my collection for a long
time<00:05:22.599> but<00:05:22.629> I<00:05:22.839> don't<00:05:23.020> really<00:05:23.229> talk<00:05:23.439> about<00:05:23.469> it

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
time but I don't really talk about it

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.869 
time but I don't really talk about it
that<00:05:23.770> much<00:05:23.889> partly<00:05:24.430> because<00:05:24.520> I<00:05:24.639> kind<00:05:24.789> of

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:24.879 
that much partly because I kind of

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:26.879 
that much partly because I kind of
forgot<00:05:25.120> about<00:05:25.180> it<00:05:25.419> and<00:05:25.749> then<00:05:25.900> I<00:05:26.139> was<00:05:26.620> polishing

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
forgot about it and then I was polishing

description of it because I think that's

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:39.480

freezer so it's kind of like your

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:06.420 
freezer so it's kind of like your
typical<00:06:03.930> fruity<00:06:04.930> floral<00:06:05.169> sin<00:06:05.649> and<00:06:05.919> it's<00:06:06.219> just

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
typical fruity floral sin and it's just

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.480

really<00:06:06.879> fresh<00:06:07.449> so<00:06:07.899> so<00:06:08.229> fresh<00:06:08.560> it's<00:06:09.189> really

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
really fresh so so fresh it's really

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
really light and it's kind of non

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.559 
really light and it's kind of non
offensive<00:06:11.289> I<00:06:11.830> think<00:06:12.069> some<00:06:13.000> people<00:06:13.240> might<00:06:13.300> find

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:13.569 
offensive I think some people might find

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:16.230 
offensive I think some people might find
it<00:06:13.810> quite<00:06:14.110> nondescript<00:06:14.830> but<00:06:15.129> for<00:06:15.430> months<00:06:16.060> or

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
it quite nondescript but for months or

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.610 
it quite nondescript but for months or
days<00:06:16.330> when<00:06:17.020> you<00:06:17.139> don't<00:06:17.259> want<00:06:17.469> something

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
days when you don't want something

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.469 
days when you don't want something
that's<00:06:17.830> heavy<00:06:18.129> and<00:06:18.520> especially<00:06:19.089> when<00:06:19.330> I<00:06:19.360> teach

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 
that's heavy and especially when I teach

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.329 
that's heavy and especially when I teach
sometimes<00:06:20.409> I<00:06:20.649> don't<00:06:20.800> really<00:06:20.919> want<00:06:21.129> to<00:06:21.189> wear

00:06:21.329 --> 00:06:21.339 
sometimes I don't really want to wear

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.309 
sometimes I don't really want to wear
something<00:06:21.370> too<00:06:21.789> heavy<00:06:22.029> because<00:06:22.240> the<00:06:23.080> kids

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:23.319 
something too heavy because the kids

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:25.469 
something too heavy because the kids
might<00:06:23.560> have<00:06:23.889> asthma<00:06:24.159> or<00:06:24.399> might<00:06:25.120> they<00:06:25.330> might

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 
might have asthma or might they might

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:27.089 
might have asthma or might they might
not<00:06:25.629> like<00:06:25.839> the<00:06:26.050> smell<00:06:26.259> I<00:06:26.319> did<00:06:26.620> I<00:06:26.680> think<00:06:26.949> it's

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:27.099 
not like the smell I did I think it's

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:28.709 
not like the smell I did I think it's
safer<00:06:27.669> to<00:06:27.699> offer<00:06:27.939> something<00:06:28.149> that's<00:06:28.419> lighter

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.719 
safer to offer something that's lighter

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:31.559 
safer to offer something that's lighter
and<00:06:29.050> fresher<00:06:29.319> so<00:06:29.770> I<00:06:30.009> often<00:06:30.580> wear<00:06:30.879> this<00:06:31.060> on<00:06:31.300> days

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:31.569 
and fresher so I often wear this on days

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:33.420 
and fresher so I often wear this on days
like<00:06:31.599> that<00:06:31.839> what<00:06:32.139> I<00:06:32.169> don't<00:06:32.529> want<00:06:32.740> something<00:06:32.949> to
