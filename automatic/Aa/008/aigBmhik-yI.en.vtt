this<00:01:28.350> first<00:01:28.560> turn<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.979> actually<00:01:29.130> thought<00:01:29.340> he

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
this first turn I actually thought he

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.219 
this first turn I actually thought he
was<00:01:29.460> gonna<00:01:29.580> fly<00:01:29.940> off<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.240> track<00:01:30.509> Latvia

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
was gonna fly off the track Latvia

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.080 
was gonna fly off the track Latvia
meeting<00:01:31.830> a<00:01:31.890> huge<00:01:32.159> angle<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.580> slow<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> car

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
meeting a huge angle to slow the car

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.609 
meeting a huge angle to slow the car
down<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.420> manages<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.899> keep<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.259> track<00:01:34.470> and

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
down and manages to keep it on track and

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.430 
down and manages to keep it on track and
I<00:01:34.679> don't<00:01:34.740> think<00:01:34.860> Tiger<00:01:35.130> was<00:01:35.399> expecting<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.440> a

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
I don't think Tiger was expecting that a

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.190 
I don't think Tiger was expecting that a
little<00:01:38.429> bit<00:01:38.520> unorthodox<00:01:38.819> line<00:01:39.450> from<00:01:39.840> Justin

the<00:04:10.060> judges<00:04:10.270> decide

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
the judges decide

we're<00:04:12.170> gonna<00:04:12.260> see<00:04:12.440> this<00:04:12.560> replay<00:04:13.010> again<00:04:13.450> you

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
we're gonna see this replay again you

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.440 
we're gonna see this replay again you
really<00:04:14.690> want<00:04:14.840> to<00:04:14.900> look<00:04:14.989> at<00:04:15.080> this<00:04:15.430> closely

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
really want to look at this closely

really want to look at this closely
judges<00:04:17.450> are<00:04:17.600> kind<00:04:17.720> of<00:04:17.840> deciding<00:04:18.230> how<00:04:18.320> to<00:04:18.380> do

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
judges are kind of deciding how to do

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.240 
judges are kind of deciding how to do
this<00:04:18.680> again

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
this again

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.789 
this again
that<00:04:19.820> entry<00:04:20.180> speed<00:04:20.450> was<00:04:20.660> about<00:04:21.109> three<00:04:21.500> miles

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
that entry speed was about three miles

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.440 
that entry speed was about three miles
an<00:04:21.950> hour<00:04:22.070> slower<00:04:22.340> than<00:04:22.520> when<00:04:22.730> Justin<00:04:23.120> ran<00:04:23.240> last

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
an hour slower than when Justin ran last

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.060 
an hour slower than when Justin ran last
time<00:04:23.600> in<00:04:23.900> about<00:04:24.080> eight<00:04:24.320> miles<00:04:24.590> an<00:04:24.710> hour<00:04:24.830> slower

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
time in about eight miles an hour slower

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:42.360 
time in about eight miles an hour slower
than<00:04:25.280> what<00:04:25.580> he's<00:04:25.790> run<00:04:26.000> before

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.879 

this<00:04:42.940> is<00:04:43.120> one<00:04:43.270> of<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.419> tricks<00:04:43.660> of<00:04:43.810> Formula<00:04:44.770> D

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
this is one of the tricks of Formula D

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.430 
this is one of the tricks of Formula D
you<00:04:45.040> know<00:04:45.190> as<00:04:46.180> the<00:04:46.480> chase<00:04:46.690> driver<00:04:46.900> you<00:04:47.350> must

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
you know as the chase driver you must

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.140 
you know as the chase driver you must
address<00:04:47.919> to<00:04:48.160> that<00:04:48.280> moving<00:04:48.580> clipping<00:04:48.850> point<00:04:49.060> I

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
address to that moving clipping point I

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.170 
address to that moving clipping point I
think<00:04:49.530> Justin<00:04:50.530> Pollock<00:04:50.889> kind<00:04:51.100> of<00:04:51.220> again<00:04:51.639> in

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
think Justin Pollock kind of again in

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.390 
think Justin Pollock kind of again in
that<00:04:52.419> first<00:04:52.720> run<00:04:53.050> ran<00:04:53.710> a<00:04:53.740> little<00:04:54.310> bit

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
that first run ran a little bit

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.760 
that first run ran a little bit
unconventional
