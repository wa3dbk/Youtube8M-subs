00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.580
 this division your internet to each 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:09.360
 I extract a new video in which he teaches 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.530
 how to hack in speed underground 2 for 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.990
 that we have to have the game 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.940
 obviously and the program called chip in 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.710
 gel if we do not have it you can download it 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.480
 from the link that I leave in the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.820
 description of the video 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.880
 well first we have to open 7 in 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.740
 zinc, we invite you and we have to 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.590
 have the game open if they did not 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.750
 open the good once we open 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.600
 in the program have without these we are going to 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.150
 close this this on the computer and 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.600
 is up here and they select the need 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.640
 for speed android those that is extra k 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.230
 read in open or open if you have it 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.960
 in Spanish 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.970
 and now let's go to the good fire in 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.980
 this case we need to center after 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.660
 fire yes very good in this case a 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.160
 Once we are in the game what 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.070
 we have to do is look at how much 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.650
 silver we have 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.380
 in career mode obviously in this 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.450
 case I have 750 pesos and to look 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.519
 the silver we have to look at down there 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.520
 to the left that you have to 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.720
 appear yes or yes and if for some reason 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.729
 it does not appear to them when they are doing 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.450
 when they are running in free mode in 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.160
 career mode as you can see above to the 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.590
 right they will look like a bank there 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.510
 up 750 pesos then what are we 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.850
 what to do now is to pause 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.619
 and you need 100 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.540
 and once we are in they exist without 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.970
 we are going to put about 750 in this 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.830
 case I put 750 because the amount of 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.790
 silver that I have if you have 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.170
 1200 pesos you have to put 1200 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.630
 one is that once they put the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.149
 amount of silver they give to first scan 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.700
 and all these codes will appear 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:55.570
 rare that you do not burn in reason with the 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.250
 value of 350 then to know which is 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.619
 the silver or what of all these 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.229
 codes is the money game we have 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.909
 to spend or earn money or this is 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.100
 we have to modify the silver in the 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.679
 game then to do that we have 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.130
 that go to the game and being in the game 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.459
 we have to win or lose money in this 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.069
 case I go to your unit the car I'm going 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.650
 to change the several I will buy a 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.830
 unit to modify the letters we can 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.900
 buy us an artifact of 25 pesos or 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.119
 one of 500 cost 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.119
 [Music] 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.680
 you will come back 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.250
 and good thing is that we are here we can 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.050
 buy what we want not 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.750
 let's change the tires we're going to 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.069
 to be no no no 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.709
 [Music] 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:59.879
 well let's put as an example come out 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:03.180
 400 pesos 17 750 I bought a plant 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.110
 400 pesos will be 350 pesos here 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.990
 down 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.840
 then now we about the ying 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.870
 we put the new modified value of the 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.050
 silver in this case before they have 750 and 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.470
 now I have 350 then we 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.220
 we go to the fit itself and about the 7 in zinc 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:27.560
 we get into 750 now we have 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.560
 350 and we give in next 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.180
 and we will look like the value of silver 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:39.080
 one appeared to them as they clicked 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:42.740
 over him and they hit him on the red arrow and 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.569
 here about value on this part yet 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.469
 I'm designing with the mouse 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:50.989
 give them double click and it appears that 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:53.439
 is to change the value if in such a case 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:58.069
 do not show them they give you right click 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:04:02.060
 change record and give it value that it is 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:06.340
 the value and there they change it in this case 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.340
 I only want to put 150 thousand pesos 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.560
 and I give in 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.020
 to this the value has already been changed to 150 thousand 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.290
 weights now to verify this we go to 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.180
 game 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.200
 here I am in the game and how can you see 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:25.290
 there is 150 thousand pesos said obviously in 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:29.880
 elche tension commas are not used like this 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:32.010
 do not put 150,000 but put the 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.020
 amount of silver 5 more without points without 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:38.509
 the numbers directly if they want 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:42.599
 put 300,000 put 300 000 6 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:44.789
 I am from behind and well I already complete what 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:47.999
 that we must keep remember 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:50.540
 save the game because if they do not go there 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:51.890
 to do this all the time 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.750
 and you can close the program 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.670
 read that no good I hope that I have 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.530
 liked video do not forget suffer too 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.450
 channel and like it obviously if you 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.130
 it served so well this has been all 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:13.239
 for today and see you next chao 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:13.239
