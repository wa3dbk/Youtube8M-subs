them<00:02:33.250> although<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.150> don't<00:02:34.240> really<00:02:34.420> recommend

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
them although I don't really recommend

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.900

investing<00:02:35.620> in<00:02:35.770> crafting<00:02:36.190> at<00:02:36.280> this<00:02:36.430> point<00:02:36.700> just

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
investing in crafting at this point just

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.699 
investing in crafting at this point just
because<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:37.510> such<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.720> cache<00:02:38.080> sink<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.680> the

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
because it is such a cache sink and the

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.310 
because it is such a cache sink and the
money<00:02:39.130> is<00:02:39.220> better<00:02:39.430> spent<00:02:39.580> on<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.209> aah<00:02:40.570> they

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
money is better spent on the aah they

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.410 
money is better spent on the aah they
will<00:02:41.530> eventually<00:02:41.709> come<00:02:42.190> into<00:02:42.550> play<00:02:42.790> when

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
will eventually come into play when

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.170 
will eventually come into play when
you're<00:02:43.510> crafting<00:02:43.959> at<00:02:44.110> later<00:02:44.380> levels<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:49.060> my

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
you're crafting at later levels so my

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.270 
you're crafting at later levels so my
last<00:02:49.360> tip<00:02:49.690> would<00:02:49.870> just<00:02:50.110> be<00:02:50.650> ready<00:02:50.830> for<00:02:51.070> combat

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
last tip would just be ready for combat

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.699 
last tip would just be ready for combat
