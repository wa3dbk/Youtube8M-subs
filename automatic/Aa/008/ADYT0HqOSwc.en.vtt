00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
on moving my guys away so the idea of

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.830 
on moving my guys away so the idea of
this<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.640> opening<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.270> I've<00:02:00.420> done<00:02:00.570> so

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
this this this opening that I've done so

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.109 
this this this opening that I've done so
far<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.350> all<00:02:01.649> about<00:02:02.070> making<00:02:02.399> sure<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.909> right

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
far is all about making sure that right

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.969 
far is all about making sure that right
now<00:02:03.299> at<00:02:03.570> ten<00:02:03.810> minutes<00:02:04.140> when<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.320> pause<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.860> and

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
now at ten minutes when I pause it and

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.709 
now at ten minutes when I pause it and
look<00:02:05.130> at<00:02:05.250> how<00:02:05.340> many<00:02:05.399> workers<00:02:05.640> he<00:02:05.939> has<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.420> want

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
look at how many workers he has I want

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.499 
look at how many workers he has I want
to<00:02:06.869> see<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> number<00:02:07.590> close<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.250> 39

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
to see a number close to that 39

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.199 
to see a number close to that 39
and<00:02:09.950> this<00:02:10.950> guy's<00:02:11.189> in<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.489> masters<00:02:11.849> league<00:02:12.000> if

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
and this guy's in the masters league if

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.119 
and this guy's in the masters league if
I<00:02:12.420> had<00:02:12.629> put<00:02:12.870> on<00:02:12.989> zero<00:02:13.319> early<00:02:13.650> pressure<00:02:13.860> he

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
I had put on zero early pressure he

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.860 
I had put on zero early pressure he
would<00:02:14.280> have<00:02:14.459> 50<00:02:14.909> workers<00:02:15.090> by<00:02:15.420> now<00:02:15.569> you<00:02:15.629> would

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
would have 50 workers by now you would

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.160 
would have 50 workers by now you would
have<00:02:15.900> 48<00:02:16.439> 53<00:02:17.150> some<00:02:18.150> number<00:02:18.450> up<00:02:18.569> in<00:02:18.720> there<00:02:18.900> so

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
have 48 53 some number up in there so

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.410 
have 48 53 some number up in there so
even<00:02:20.040> though<00:02:20.069> I<00:02:20.549> didn't<00:02:20.849> do<00:02:20.939> a<00:02:20.970> lot<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.209> damage

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
even though I didn't do a lot of damage

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.819 
even though I didn't do a lot of damage
with<00:02:21.629> my<00:02:21.810> Marines<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:23.459> damage<00:02:23.879> I<00:02:24.030> did<00:02:24.060> was

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
with my Marines the damage I did was

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.699 
with my Marines the damage I did was
economic<00:02:26.060> because<00:02:27.060> every<00:02:27.690> Ling<00:02:27.930> he<00:02:28.140> builds<00:02:28.560> is

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
economic because every Ling he builds is

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.289 
economic because every Ling he builds is
a<00:02:28.739> drone<00:02:29.040> he<00:02:29.129> didn't<00:02:29.340> build<00:02:29.459> so<00:02:29.879> anyway<00:02:30.120> here

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
a drone he didn't build so anyway here

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.250 
a drone he didn't build so anyway here
he's<00:02:30.390> coming<00:02:30.720> with<00:02:30.750> his<00:02:30.900> twelve<00:02:31.230> minute

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
he's coming with his twelve minute

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.470 
he's coming with his twelve minute
meters<00:02:31.709> 12<00:02:31.920> minutes<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.280> almost<00:02:32.549> exalt<00:02:33.120> it's

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.880 
meters 12 minutes is almost exalt it's
almost<00:02:33.780> always<00:02:34.170> when<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.409> meters<00:02:34.650> are<00:02:34.739> going

almost always when the meters are going
to<00:02:34.950> come<00:02:35.099> but<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.340> got<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.549> be<00:02:35.670> prepared<00:02:35.700> just

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
to come but you got to be prepared just

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.059 
to come but you got to be prepared just
in<00:02:36.329> case<00:02:36.359> they<00:02:36.629> come<00:02:36.659> at<00:02:36.900> nine<00:02:37.019> minutes<00:02:37.319> he's

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
in case they come at nine minutes he's

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.530 
in case they come at nine minutes he's
got<00:02:38.370> two<00:02:39.120> four<00:02:39.420> six<00:02:39.720> seven<00:02:40.049> seven<00:02:40.709> meters<00:02:41.540> and

got two four six seven seven meters and

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.750 
got two four six seven seven meters and
that's<00:02:42.690> fourteen<00:02:43.260> hundred<00:02:43.620> dollars<00:02:44.280> he<00:02:44.489> spent

that's fourteen hundred dollars he spent

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.819 
that's fourteen hundred dollars he spent
on<00:02:44.909> mute<00:02:45.090> is<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.359> that's<00:02:45.480> pretty<00:02:45.659> typical<00:02:45.900> for

point of the mute is is to make me have

he's<00:03:25.049> not<00:03:25.109> using<00:03:25.470> them<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:25.739> way<00:03:26.040> but<00:03:26.730> that's

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
he's not using them that way but that's

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.030 
he's not using them that way but that's
because<00:03:27.150> he<00:03:27.510> sees<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:28.290> my<00:03:28.470> army<00:03:28.739> is<00:03:28.769> coming

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
after the early economic limitations

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.509 
after the early economic limitations
that<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:06.989> put<00:04:07.199> on<00:04:07.290> him<00:04:07.440> if<00:04:07.620> he<00:04:07.739> did<00:04:07.889> if<00:04:08.040> I'd<00:04:08.250> done

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
that I put on him if he did if I'd done

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.189 
that I put on him if he did if I'd done
no<00:04:08.790> her<00:04:09.000> ass<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.449> just<00:04:09.599> come<00:04:09.840> out<00:04:09.989> with<00:04:10.109> this

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
no her ass and just come out with this

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.199 
no her ass and just come out with this
exact<00:04:10.530> same<00:04:10.709> army<00:04:11.069> against<00:04:11.609> what<00:04:12.000> would

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
exact same army against what would

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.850 
exact same army against what would
therefore<00:04:12.540> from<00:04:13.019> him<00:04:13.290> have

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
therefore from him have

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.150 
therefore from him have
like<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:14.070> 200<00:04:14.520> units<00:04:15.000> pays<00:04:15.180> army<00:04:15.480> yeah<00:04:16.200> anyway
