working on gameday pitching the majority
of<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.209> time<00:04:02.450> we<00:04:02.599> work<00:04:02.810> with<00:04:03.049> pitchers<00:04:03.560> we

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
of the time we work with pitchers we

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.330 
of the time we work with pitchers we
want<00:04:04.340> to<00:04:04.459> be<00:04:04.609> it<00:04:04.700> do<00:04:05.299> it<00:04:05.420> from<00:04:05.629> about<00:04:06.340> 3/4

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
want to be it do it from about 3/4

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.940 
want to be it do it from about 3/4
distance<00:04:08.290> 35<00:04:09.290> feet<00:04:09.590> instead<00:04:09.829> of<00:04:09.980> 46<00:04:10.700> 48<00:04:11.950> the

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
distance 35 feet instead of 46 48 the

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.649 
distance 35 feet instead of 46 48 the
reason<00:04:13.310> for<00:04:13.459> that<00:04:13.519> is<00:04:13.819> we<00:04:13.970> don't<00:04:14.120> want<00:04:14.269> them

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
reason for that is we don't want them

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:16.449 
reason for that is we don't want them
feeling<00:04:15.349> like<00:04:15.560> they<00:04:15.859> have<00:04:15.950> to<00:04:16.039> put<00:04:16.340> their

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459

actions<00:04:30.099> their<00:04:31.099> mechanics<00:04:31.849> this<00:04:32.120> is<00:04:32.180> training

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
actions their mechanics this is training

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.350 
actions their mechanics this is training
body<00:04:33.110> movements<00:04:33.800> it's<00:04:33.950> not<00:04:34.130> throwing<00:04:35.120> a<00:04:35.180> ball
