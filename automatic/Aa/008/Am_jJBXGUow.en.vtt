00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.430
 this wonderful hipster set 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.200
 the last city is called hipster 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.030
 I think how are they to another 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.549
 time it will be called differently 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.040
 it used to call me pretty 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.890
 you become immediately automatically 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.530
 I will call fashionable samples I do not know that right now 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.509

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.720

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.549
 Fashionable dude and chick but a set of chick 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.759
 Dubai honestly do not know what's 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.430
 now fashionable and go to the street is 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.850
 morning cool all the hallways in the university 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.090
 or else where you do not look and see 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.649
 several twins for that neher how many 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:13.110
 do you understand that once again 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:16.500
 I will not just play on your desire as 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.370
 stand out and also once was there and 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.010
 There with iPhones with other devices with 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:28.230
 cars too 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:30.240
 in fact it is through clothes through that 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.420
 what can you buy for money and stand out 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.910
 difficult enough to do 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.520
 understated car you can buy it 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.730
 some pontovyh discs underestimate and again 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.530
 same sacrifice your comfort and running 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.730
 qualities of the car or on the order 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:51.989
 you looked back in the stream but this again 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.390
 same one-sided way too 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.910
 peel off all some kind of exclusive 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.590
 car or just buy non-standard 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.720
 some cars and maybe he 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:06.780
 you really like it but already 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:09.800
 expensive and rarely peel off any such 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.670
 know buckets for an inexpensive price 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.200
 some really high quality 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.140
 film so really that it was 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.760
 cool I saw well, a little plastered 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.230
 really cool cars mostly 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.640
 it was some kind of charged cars 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.470
 which are several lyamas themselves 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:29.160
 worth it if you buy just so cool 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.660
 dear new car she besides you from 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.700
 crowds don't look because believe me 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.200
 many people earn me too 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.239
 decent money drive on such 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.220
 vehicles for them then just 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.630
 transport 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.830
 Well, mostly those who buy cars for 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:46.019
 several million are no longer trying 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:49.560
 stand out although maybe I am mistaken that 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.799
 you can still do well, probably outwardly 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.970
 no longer stand out 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:59.730
 make photos post them in instagram 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.070
 that is, something like that too 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.930
 unique use set 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.989
 filters that are in instagram so 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.110
 try to be unique not like 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.989
 all you can throw lenses in the eyes to leave 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.660
 Well, in principle, you can cut off your hand then 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:19.890
 You will definitely join the army of people 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:23.550
 which is much smaller than all those in 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.950
 complete I assure you that then 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.169
 if you're still a deer sweater top 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:34.080
 wear will not hand you get 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:37.110
 not bad too just like me somewhere 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.970
 brought in Barshevsky in fact what 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.970
 your fucking set off 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.530
 individuality it is expressed more often 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.349
 all clothes niche 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.680
 it expresses itself through what you do 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:51.510
 all try mostly well not all 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.979
 many people try to mow under 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:58.110
 someone have chosen their idol and to 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:04.349
 Unfortunately I have for someone with such was 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:05.789
 these 7 bike channels fortunately 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:07.650
 or unfortunately there is no such 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.570
 individual riding style which 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.979
 could copy i don't know to 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.190
 happiness or unhappiness 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.510
 not guys there from bmx cult many 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.450
 others who are now active 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.960
 propagate free casters parts 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:24.000
 colors oil slick and other stuff they 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.030
 make themselves an army of fans but it is already 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.039
 commerce and trust me individually 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.810
 you will only become when some 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.060
 your own style will develop you 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.610
 when he will work it out for you 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.400
 you already will not give a shit about what you have 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.909
 there who thinks and all your attempts 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:45.930
 stand out and become like everyone else 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:48.810
 your creativity will disappear 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.729
 it is your actions they are inspired 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.090
 marketing and inspired by your 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:56.729
 idols of models on which you masturbate 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:06:02.099
 or are there some movie stars 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:03.810
 actors all this is not yours 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:05.479
 individuality develops only 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.099
 thanks to when you choose 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:11.789
 do something for yourself or find yourself 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:13.770
 and you start doing things no longer for that 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:16.530
 to look with in spite of you anyway 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.240
 on the reaction and that's when you already have it 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.520
 see you not really you 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.039
 to become like others become 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.000
 individuality so basically in 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:27.120
 nature is all terrifying 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.200
 injustice 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.200
 because 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.840
 this and little you want to be 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:39.180
 cool thump smoke drive there cool 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.310
 cars you do not have this in principle 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.620
 this age it is impossible to achieve this 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.420
 well, except for some short-term 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.520
 term someone killing squeezing machine 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.370
 ride on is not to win but not rolling 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:53.340
 I understand again some gloomy comparison 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:55.200
 and at the most tender age when you 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.780
 I want to be like everyone else stand 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.700
 most likely in yourself there is probably little of 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.230
 this will turn out the same avocado 

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.170
 individuality will gain something 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:06.450
 do it and really start you 

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:08.850
 notice then you basically to this 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.680
 to treat bush is already cool calm but 

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.330
 in fact it will not be superfluous to this 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.630
 rejoice because really 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.530
 nice it says that you're on 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.000
 the right way 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.980
 although it cannot be said that if 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.710
 right and wrong way not 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:26.580
 there is some perfect pattern 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:28.260
 are there any books that are written as 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.590
 live right and wrong 

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:33.840
 it's all the same from the evil one therefore 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:40.530
 the only thing I could wish for 

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:45.680
 it stop trying to become wrong 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:50.220
 how it all and just start already damn it 

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:52.140
 look for yourself look for what you like 

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.650
 do you like the fact that they 

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:59.000
 you are here have sold their business Anton 

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.000
 Stepan all bye
