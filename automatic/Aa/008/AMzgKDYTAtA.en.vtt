while I was in fabrication mode I

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.570 
while I was in fabrication mode I
thought<00:02:36.170> why<00:02:36.319> not<00:02:36.349> have<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.709> go<00:02:36.920> at<00:02:37.040> making<00:02:37.250> my

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
thought why not have a go at making my

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.809 
thought why not have a go at making my
own<00:02:37.610> restoration<00:02:38.360> spit<00:02:39.110> I<00:02:39.640> started<00:02:40.640> gathering

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
own restoration spit I started gathering

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.570 
own restoration spit I started gathering
bits<00:02:41.269> and<00:02:41.450> bobs<00:02:41.629> together<00:02:42.019> and<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:43.310> even

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
bits and bobs together and I even

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.759 
bits and bobs together and I even
recycled<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.239> front<00:02:44.510> end<00:02:44.750> of<00:02:44.959> another<00:02:45.410> mini

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
recycled the front end of another mini

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.830 
recycled the front end of another mini
