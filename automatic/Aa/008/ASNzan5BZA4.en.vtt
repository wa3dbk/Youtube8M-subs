this<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.840> success<00:00:40.379> was<00:00:40.590> successful<00:00:41.280> for

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
this this success was successful for

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.280 
this this success was successful for
Boeing<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:41.879> far<00:00:42.120> they've<00:00:42.300> only<00:00:42.480> got<00:00:43.020> three

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
Boeing so far they've only got three

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.869 
Boeing so far they've only got three
carriers<00:00:43.649> who<00:00:43.890> have<00:00:43.980> ordered<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.340> for<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.550> total

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
carriers who have ordered it for a total

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.470 
carriers who have ordered it for a total
of<00:00:44.910> 36<00:00:45.860> but<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.890> reckon<00:00:47.340> when<00:00:47.670> they<00:00:47.850> get<00:00:48.300> them

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
of 36 but I reckon when they get them

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.630 
of 36 but I reckon when they get them
out<00:00:48.600> there<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:48.899> they<00:00:49.530> start<00:00:49.920> using<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.489> more

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
out there and they start using it more

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.310 
out there and they start using it more
and<00:00:50.910> more<00:00:51.000> people<00:00:51.300> will<00:00:51.570> probably<00:00:51.930> order<00:00:52.199> them

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
and more people will probably order them

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.560 
and more people will probably order them
because<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.829> my<00:00:52.980> opinion<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.460> several<00:00:53.850> 7-8

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
because in my opinion the several 7-8

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.110 
because in my opinion the several 7-8
I'd<00:00:55.199> rather<00:00:55.469> go<00:00:55.739> on<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:56.070> over<00:00:56.340> an<00:00:56.430> a380<00:00:56.910> any

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
I'd rather go on that over an a380 any

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.260 
I'd rather go on that over an a380 any
day<00:00:57.329> because<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.960> don't<00:00:58.890> unless<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.120> my

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
due to the swept wings but one thing I

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.100 
due to the swept wings but one thing I
couldn't<00:02:02.850> believe<00:02:03.060> about<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
couldn't believe about this is the

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.310 
couldn't believe about this is the
actual<00:02:04.530> size<00:02:04.799> difference<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.729> seven<00:02:05.939> four

actual size difference of the seven four

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.359

-<00:02:06.710> hope<00:02:06.980> compared<00:02:07.430> to<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.840> 747-400<00:02:09.220> this<00:02:10.220> is

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
- hope compared to the 747-400 this is

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.130 
- hope compared to the 747-400 this is
the<00:02:10.550> when<00:02:11.000> this<00:02:11.150> doesn't<00:02:11.420> service<00:02:11.930> it<00:02:12.050> will

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
the when this doesn't service it will

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.990 
the when this doesn't service it will
officially<00:02:12.410> be<00:02:12.740> the<00:02:12.770> longest<00:02:13.250> passenger<00:02:13.790> jet

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
officially be the longest passenger jet

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.540 
officially be the longest passenger jet
in<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.150> world<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:15.020> it's<00:02:15.800> just<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:16.070> fantastic

and<00:04:20.570> I<00:04:20.930> said<00:04:21.200> and<00:04:21.380> I<00:04:21.440> just<00:04:21.680> knew<00:04:21.860> that<00:04:21.890> when<00:04:22.220> I

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
and I said and I just knew that when I

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.730 
and I said and I just knew that when I
realized<00:04:22.910> seen<00:04:23.360> that<00:04:23.600> Phoenix<00:04:24.230> was<00:04:24.410> making

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
realized seen that Phoenix was making

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.470 
realized seen that Phoenix was making
this<00:04:24.800> I<00:04:24.950> just<00:04:25.160> had<00:04:25.280> to<00:04:25.430> get<00:04:25.550> it<00:04:25.700> and<00:04:25.850> I<00:04:26.060> also<00:04:26.240> got

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
this I just had to get it and I also got

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.180 
this I just had to get it and I also got
it<00:04:26.600> in<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.810> ground<00:04:26.960> configuration<00:04:27.860> because<00:04:28.040> I

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
it in the ground configuration because I

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.800 
it in the ground configuration because I
think<00:04:28.340> for<00:04:28.640> displaying<00:04:29.060> like<00:04:29.300> these<00:04:29.540> on<00:04:29.720> the

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
think for displaying like these on the

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.840 
think for displaying like these on the
runway<00:04:30.140> it<00:04:30.740> just<00:04:31.040> looks<00:04:31.250> better<00:04:31.430> in<00:04:31.700> my

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
runway it just looks better in my

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.290 
runway it just looks better in my
opinion<00:04:32.860> so<00:04:33.860> yeah<00:04:34.010> once<00:04:34.400> again<00:04:34.670> guys<00:04:34.820> this<00:04:35.150> is

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
opinion so yeah once again guys this is

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.060 
opinion so yeah once again guys this is
just<00:04:35.510> a<00:04:35.600> fantastic<00:04:36.050> model<00:04:36.470> if<00:04:36.680> you<00:04:36.710> have<00:04:36.950> the

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
just a fantastic model if you have the

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.860 
just a fantastic model if you have the
chance<00:04:37.310> to<00:04:37.520> get<00:04:37.670> this<00:04:37.910> I<00:04:38.060> recommend<00:04:38.330> you<00:04:38.720> do

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
chance to get this I recommend you do

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.010 
chance to get this I recommend you do
because<00:04:39.230> it's<00:04:39.470> just<00:04:39.710> so<00:04:39.920> deep<00:04:40.190> like<00:04:40.720> words<00:04:41.720> and

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
because it's just so deep like words and

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.780 
because it's just so deep like words and
this<00:04:42.110> video<00:04:42.440> can't<00:04:42.770> describe<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:43.400> level<00:04:43.670> of

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
this video can't describe the level of

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.610 
this video can't describe the level of
detail<00:04:44.210> on<00:04:44.240> this<00:04:44.450> thing<00:04:44.660> like<00:04:44.690> you<00:04:45.230> have<00:04:45.440> to

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
detail on this thing like you have to

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.140 
detail on this thing like you have to
see<00:04:45.800> it<00:04:45.860> for<00:04:46.010> yourself<00:04:46.400> but<00:04:46.610> one<00:04:46.820> thing<00:04:47.030> I

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
see it for yourself but one thing I

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.120 
see it for yourself but one thing I
couldn't<00:04:47.420> believe<00:04:47.630> is<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:48.050> sheer<00:04:48.350> size<00:04:48.680> of<00:04:48.980> it

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
couldn't believe is the sheer size of it

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.690 
couldn't believe is the sheer size of it
compared<00:04:49.520> to<00:04:49.580> a<00:04:49.670> 747<00:04:50.570> 400<00:04:51.190> it's<00:04:52.190> obviously<00:04:52.580> if

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
compared to a 747 400 it's obviously if

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.980 
compared to a 747 400 it's obviously if
we<00:04:52.820> go<00:04:53.000> model<00:04:53.420> sizes<00:04:53.900> here<00:04:54.550> it<00:04:55.550> is<00:04:55.760> much<00:04:56.390> much

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
we go model sizes here it is much much

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.770 
we go model sizes here it is much much
bigger<00:04:57.260> what<00:04:57.970> may<00:04:58.970> be<00:04:59.030> difficult<00:04:59.450> to<00:04:59.510> see<00:04:59.690> in

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
bigger what may be difficult to see in

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.600 
bigger what may be difficult to see in
the<00:04:59.870> video<00:04:59.990> but<00:05:00.380> it<00:05:00.470> is<00:05:00.500> a<00:05:00.620> lot<00:05:00.920> longer<00:05:01.100> and<00:05:01.490> the

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
the video but it is a lot longer and the

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.610 
the video but it is a lot longer and the
wingspan<00:05:02.000> is<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:02.690> wings<00:05:02.900> and<00:05:03.200> the<00:05:03.320> wingspan

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
wingspan is the wings and the wingspan

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.240 
wingspan is the wings and the wingspan
itself<00:05:04.160> are<00:05:04.340> much<00:05:04.610> bigger<00:05:05.830> so<00:05:06.830> it's<00:05:06.980> a<00:05:07.070> bit

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
itself are much bigger so it's a bit

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.950 
itself are much bigger so it's a bit
difficult<00:05:07.490> to<00:05:07.790> see<00:05:07.880> in<00:05:08.120> this<00:05:08.270> video<00:05:08.480> I'll<00:05:08.810> try

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
difficult to see in this video I'll try

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.030 
difficult to see in this video I'll try
and<00:05:09.200> line<00:05:09.440> them<00:05:09.560> up<00:05:09.680> as<00:05:09.890> best<00:05:10.070> I<00:05:10.280> can

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
and line them up as best I can

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.590 
and line them up as best I can
that's<00:05:13.040> about<00:05:13.310> lined<00:05:13.640> up<00:05:13.850> you<00:05:14.000> can<00:05:14.150> see<00:05:14.420> that

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
that's about lined up you can see that

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.620 
that's about lined up you can see that
the<00:05:14.720> 747<00:05:15.590> -<00:05:16.340> 8<00:05:16.610> is<00:05:16.730> much<00:05:16.940> longer<00:05:17.150> than<00:05:17.480> my

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
the 747 - 8 is much longer than my

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.460 
the 747 - 8 is much longer than my
Qantas<00:05:18.200> 747<00:05:19.010> 400<00:05:19.250> by<00:05:19.700> Gemini<00:05:20.150> and<00:05:20.390> also<00:05:21.320> the

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
Qantas 747 400 by Gemini and also the

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.090 
Qantas 747 400 by Gemini and also the
wings<00:05:21.740> are<00:05:21.980> a<00:05:22.010> lot<00:05:22.280> long<00:05:23.030> wide<00:05:23.450> er<00:05:23.770> and<00:05:24.770> also

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
wings are a lot long wide er and also

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.800 
wings are a lot long wide er and also
thicker<00:05:25.400> here<00:05:25.700> and<00:05:25.850> they<00:05:25.940> don't<00:05:26.120> feature<00:05:26.450> the

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
thicker here and they don't feature the

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.710 
thicker here and they don't feature the
winglets<00:05:27.280> but<00:05:28.280> instead<00:05:28.640> raked<00:05:29.000> wingtips<00:05:29.240> like

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
winglets but instead raked wingtips like

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.220 
winglets but instead raked wingtips like
the<00:05:29.840> triple<00:05:30.050> 7<00:05:30.440> series<00:05:30.800> and<00:05:30.980> the<00:05:31.040> new<00:05:31.070> 707<00:05:32.230> so

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
the triple 7 series and the new 707 so

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.610 
the triple 7 series and the new 707 so
yeah

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
once the end guys is wrapping up the

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.540 
once the end guys is wrapping up the

video it's seriously if you have a

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.160 
video it's seriously if you have a
chance<00:05:37.820> to<00:05:37.910> get<00:05:38.120> this<00:05:38.240> model<00:05:38.450> just<00:05:38.840> get<00:05:39.050> it

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170
