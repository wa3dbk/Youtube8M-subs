do these little brush strokes so I can

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.249 
do these little brush strokes so I can
pre<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.090> lighter<00:01:21.420> effect<00:01:21.869> around<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
pre like a lighter effect around the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.010 
pre like a lighter effect around the
middle<00:01:22.619> here<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.490> shows<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.850> letters<00:01:24.330> like

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
middle here it shows the letters like

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.830 
middle here it shows the letters like
kind<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.500> round<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:26.270> gives<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> letters<00:01:27.659> more

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
kind of round it gives the letters more

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.370 
kind of round it gives the letters more
dimension<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.500> way<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:30.600> let's<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:31.020> go<00:01:31.170> down

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
dimension that way so let's just go down

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.170 
dimension that way so let's just go down
with<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.619> red

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.600 

then<00:01:34.600> you<00:01:34.720> go<00:01:34.900> from<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.230> bottom<00:01:35.560> up<00:01:37.590> mmm<00:01:38.650> she's

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
then you go from the bottom up mmm she's

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.040 
then you go from the bottom up mmm she's
gonna<00:01:39.730> color<00:01:40.030> these<00:01:40.180> two<00:01:40.390> letters<00:01:40.720> in<00:01:40.750> right

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
gonna color these two letters in right

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:50.750 
gonna color these two letters in right
here

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.039

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.380 

trying<00:01:54.710> to<00:01:54.770> make<00:01:54.860> this<00:01:55.220> quick<00:01:55.490> on<00:01:55.759> people

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
trying to make this quick on people

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:05.910 
trying to make this quick on people
might<00:01:56.570> watch<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:56.930> long<00:01:57.140> videos

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.719 

accidental<00:02:06.920> that<00:02:07.070> mm-hmm<00:02:09.250> now<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.310> take<00:02:10.520> like

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
accidental that mm-hmm now you take like

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.760 
accidental that mm-hmm now you take like
a<00:02:10.759> darker<00:02:11.240> green<00:02:12.970> choose<00:02:13.970> this<00:02:14.180> one<00:02:14.360> right

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
a darker green choose this one right

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.750 
a darker green choose this one right
then<00:02:15.770> you<00:02:15.860> go<00:02:16.010> around<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.340> edges

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.640 

kind<00:02:22.690> of<00:02:22.780> creates<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.590> know<00:02:23.740> like

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
kind of creates you know like

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.820 
kind of creates you know like
two-dimensional<00:02:26.650> st.<00:02:26.890> shades<00:02:27.220> so<00:02:27.970> shows<00:02:28.270> the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
two-dimensional st. shades so shows the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:49.970 
two-dimensional st. shades so shows the
roundness<00:02:29.830> of<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.190> letter

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.119 

and<00:02:50.489> then<00:02:50.640> like<00:02:50.819> where<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.120> got<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.540> queue<00:02:52.470> on

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
and then like where you got the queue on

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.600 
and then like where you got the queue on
top<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.819> right<00:02:54.060> here<00:02:55.519> you're<00:02:56.519> gonna

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
top of the you right here you're gonna

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.920 
top of the you right here you're gonna
take<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:59.670> darker<00:03:00.060> green<00:03:00.300> and<00:03:00.360> just<00:03:00.660> go<00:03:00.810> around

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
take the darker green and just go around

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.530 
take the darker green and just go around
the<00:03:01.110> edge<00:03:01.349> and<00:03:02.040> follow<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.580> queue<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:06.209> shows

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
the edge and follow the queue it shows

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.509 
the edge and follow the queue it shows
that<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.050> queues<00:03:07.319> on<00:03:07.500> top<00:03:07.769> of<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.069> you<00:03:10.400> so<00:03:11.400> it

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
that the queues on top of the you so it

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:18.140 
that the queues on top of the you so it
gives<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.790> more<00:03:12.030> of<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:14.090> live<00:03:15.090> effect<00:03:15.709> so<00:03:17.150> then

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
gives it more of a live effect so then

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.500 
gives it more of a live effect so then
you<00:03:18.269> go<00:03:18.450> around<00:03:19.400> rest<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.519> you

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:39.690 

so<00:03:24.870> basically<00:03:25.230> that's<00:03:25.500> how<00:03:25.650> I<00:03:25.680> do<00:03:25.830> it

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.640 

hopefully<00:03:40.450> this<00:03:40.569> should<00:03:40.750> help<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:41.050> guys<00:03:41.260> a

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
little bit I'm saying see every day that

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.559 
little bit I'm saying see every day that
gives<00:03:47.290> it<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.910> two-tone<00:03:49.319> kind<00:03:50.319> of<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.530> 3d<00:03:51.510> now<00:03:52.510> I'm

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
gives it a two-tone kind of a 3d now I'm

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.960 
gives it a two-tone kind of a 3d now I'm
saying<00:03:52.810> three-dimensional<00:03:53.800> this<00:03:54.010> shades<00:03:54.670> of

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
saying three-dimensional this shades of

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.900 
saying three-dimensional this shades of
green<00:03:55.540> mm-hmm<00:03:56.760> you<00:03:57.760> can<00:03:57.910> take<00:03:58.030> a<00:03:58.060> darker<00:03:58.540> green

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
green mm-hmm you can take a darker green

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.020 
green mm-hmm you can take a darker green
like<00:04:00.910> real<00:04:01.150> light<00:04:01.420> just<00:04:02.200> a<00:04:02.290> little<00:04:02.590> bit<00:04:02.910> on<00:04:03.910> the

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
like real light just a little bit on the

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.180 
like real light just a little bit on the
edges<00:04:04.420> or<00:04:04.690> some<00:04:05.140> areas<00:04:05.560> they<00:04:05.739> think<00:04:06.010> may<00:04:06.160> be

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
edges or some areas they think may be

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:18.479 
edges or some areas they think may be
darker

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:30.600

pretty much it for that then you can add
whatever<00:04:38.229> on<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.770> edges<00:04:40.050> you<00:04:41.050> know<00:04:41.080> saying

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
whatever on the edges you know saying

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.920 
whatever on the edges you know saying
when<00:04:41.680> I<00:04:41.710> had<00:04:41.860> an<00:04:42.009> outside<00:04:42.490> color<00:04:42.789> pink<00:04:43.659> or

whatever it goes for the same thing like
on<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.360> edges<00:04:49.719> here<00:04:51.300> so<00:04:52.300> you<00:04:52.360> got<00:04:52.569> a<00:04:52.599> pink

00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:53.439 
on the edges here so you got a pink

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:57.749 
on the edges here so you got a pink
right<00:04:53.680> here<00:04:54.629> and<00:04:55.800> then<00:04:56.800> you<00:04:56.919> choose<00:04:57.189> a<00:04:57.219> darker

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:09.819
