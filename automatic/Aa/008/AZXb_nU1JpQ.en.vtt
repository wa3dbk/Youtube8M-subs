the<00:01:44.840> car<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.080> lot<00:01:45.229> of<00:01:45.350> people<00:01:45.560> seem<00:01:45.770> to<00:01:45.890> agree<00:01:46.100> as

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
the car a lot of people seem to agree as

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.260 
the car a lot of people seem to agree as
you<00:01:48.229> can<00:01:48.380> see<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:49.490> rear<00:01:49.640> quarter<00:01:49.970> panels

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
you can see the the rear quarter panels

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.910 
you can see the the rear quarter panels
got<00:01:50.360> a<00:01:50.420> stripe<00:01:50.720> all<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.289> way<00:01:51.409> over<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.740> bird

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
got a stripe all the way over the bird

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.740 
got a stripe all the way over the bird
which<00:01:52.159> is<00:01:52.720> pretty<00:01:53.720> much<00:01:53.869> an<00:01:54.619> American<00:01:55.750> option

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
which is pretty much an American option

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.649 
which is pretty much an American option
I'd<00:01:56.869> say<00:01:57.050> on<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.319> dodge<00:01:57.500> darts<00:01:58.390> it's<00:01:59.390> a<00:01:59.479> wide

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
I'd say on the dodge darts it's a wide

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.359 
I'd say on the dodge darts it's a wide
car<00:01:59.990> big<00:02:00.289> car<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.649> I<00:02:00.710> think<00:02:00.770> that<00:02:01.009> suits<00:02:01.190> that

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
car big car and I think that suits that

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.279 
car big car and I think that suits that
