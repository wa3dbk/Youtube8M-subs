00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
I noticed as soon as I opened my eyes

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.229 
I noticed as soon as I opened my eyes
was<00:03:06.510> how<00:03:06.690> supple<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.580> moisturized<00:03:08.580> my<00:03:08.910> skin

was how supple and moisturized my skin

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.120 
was how supple and moisturized my skin
felt<00:03:09.480> really<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.930> am<00:03:10.260> not<00:03:10.500> even<00:03:10.800> kidding<00:03:10.950> that

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
felt really I am not even kidding that

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.250 
felt really I am not even kidding that
was<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.519> first<00:03:11.940> thing<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.300> noticed<00:03:12.630> as<00:03:12.870> soon<00:03:12.900> as

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
was the first thing I noticed as soon as

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.090

I<00:03:13.350> open<00:03:13.680> my<00:03:13.769> eyes<00:03:13.800> I<00:03:14.160> believe<00:03:15.060> this<00:03:15.480> was

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
I open my eyes I believe this was

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.920 
I open my eyes I believe this was
20-something<00:03:17.100> so<00:03:17.550> it<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.239> little<00:03:18.630> bit<00:03:18.780> more

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
20-something so it is a little bit more

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.240 
20-something so it is a little bit more
expensive<00:03:19.230> than<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.709> rest<00:03:19.890> of<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.100> other
