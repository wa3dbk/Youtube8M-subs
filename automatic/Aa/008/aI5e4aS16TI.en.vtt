 Meanwhile, already a dozen phone calls wouldn't do it though not all 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.939

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.210

 under the motto stop walking tour you must not disagree that's natural 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.140

 among them are an asset 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.810
 I'll take all of that 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.510
 I need all SIM onlys here 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.580
 just huge 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.120
