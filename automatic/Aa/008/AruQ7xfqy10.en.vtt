with<00:00:33.489> um<00:00:34.489> obviously<00:00:35.329> didn't<00:00:35.719> play<00:00:35.899> with<00:00:36.020> cam

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
with um obviously didn't play with cam

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.139 
with um obviously didn't play with cam
so<00:00:36.800> it's<00:00:37.039> hard<00:00:37.219> to<00:00:37.280> say<00:00:37.640> but<00:00:37.699> just<00:00:38.059> from

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
so it's hard to say but just from

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.569 
so it's hard to say but just from
watching<00:00:38.379> it<00:00:39.379> seemed<00:00:39.620> that<00:00:39.649> cam<00:00:40.010> was<00:00:40.220> more<00:00:40.489> of

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
watching it seemed that cam was more of

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.450 
watching it seemed that cam was more of
like<00:00:40.670> a<00:00:40.790> run<00:00:41.570> you<00:00:41.720> over<00:00:41.750> type<00:00:42.200> guy<00:00:42.440> who<00:00:43.310> is<00:00:43.399> a

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
like a run you over type guy who is a

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.910 
like a run you over type guy who is a
powerful<00:00:43.790> runner<00:00:44.120> I<00:00:44.360> know<00:00:44.690> obviously<00:00:45.230> nick<00:00:45.800> is

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
powerful runner I know obviously nick is

powerful runner I know obviously nick is
a<00:00:45.980> little<00:00:46.190> bit<00:00:46.280> smaller<00:00:46.550> person<00:00:46.820> antennas<00:00:47.480> but

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
a little bit smaller person antennas but

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.190 
a little bit smaller person antennas but
like<00:00:48.890> Trey<00:00:49.579> said<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:50.120> he's<00:00:50.270> he's<00:00:50.840> a<00:00:50.870> very

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
like Trey said and he's he's a very

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.040

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.960 
only every game but every practice and
that's<00:03:44.170> what<00:03:44.350> we<00:03:44.410> try<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.650> do<00:03:44.890> this<00:03:45.040> year<00:03:45.280> so<00:03:45.910> I

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
that's what we try to do this year so I

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.550 
that's what we try to do this year so I
really<00:03:46.239> think<00:03:46.390> that<00:03:46.510> on<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:47.019> winds<00:03:47.290> will<00:03:47.380> be

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
really think that on the winds will be

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.500 
really think that on the winds will be
though<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.340> crazy<00:03:48.640> ones<00:03:48.790> we've<00:03:49.150> had<00:03:49.330> that

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
though the crazy ones we've had that

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.660 
though the crazy ones we've had that
people<00:03:49.750> say<00:03:49.959> oh<00:03:49.989> look<00:03:50.290> which<00:03:50.800> may<00:03:50.980> be<00:03:51.010> what<00:03:51.430> was

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
people say oh look which may be what was

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.430 
people say oh look which may be what was
still<00:03:51.880> I<00:03:52.090> thought<00:03:52.360> we<00:03:52.540> deserved<00:03:52.690> as<00:03:53.050> winds<00:03:53.290> and

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
still I thought we deserved as winds and

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.830 
still I thought we deserved as winds and
work<00:03:53.620> deserve<00:03:53.950> those<00:03:54.100> winds<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.670> I<00:03:55.269> think

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
work deserve those winds and I think

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.509 
work deserve those winds and I think
that's<00:03:56.110> part<00:03:56.650> of<00:03:56.680> life<00:03:56.800> you<00:03:56.980> know<00:03:57.160> you<00:03:57.370> get

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
that's part of life you know you get

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.130 
that's part of life you know you get
what<00:03:57.640> you<00:03:57.670> work<00:03:57.910> for<00:03:57.940> no<00:03:58.600> matter<00:03:58.780> how<00:03:58.989> it<00:03:59.110> comes

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
what you work for no matter how it comes

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.030 
what you work for no matter how it comes
so<00:03:59.769> that's<00:04:00.280> obviously

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
so that's obviously

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.400 
so that's obviously
cool
