motorcycle and we've designed it from
the<00:01:00.590> ground<00:01:00.740> up<00:01:00.980> because<00:01:01.250> we<00:01:01.370> realized<00:01:01.760> the

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
the ground up because we realized the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.450 
the ground up because we realized the

thing<00:01:18.080> about<00:01:18.170> our<00:01:18.320> technology<00:01:18.710> is<00:01:19.190> that<00:01:19.340> it's

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
thing about our technology is that it's

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.300 
thing about our technology is that it's
completely<00:01:19.940> modular<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.869> actual<00:01:21.530> term<00:01:21.979> for

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
completely modular the actual term for

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.240 
completely modular the actual term for
it<00:01:22.400> is<00:01:22.490> mission<00:01:22.940> EVT<00:01:23.510> ok<00:01:24.229> electric<00:01:24.860> vehicle

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
it is mission EVT ok electric vehicle

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.800 
it is mission EVT ok electric vehicle
technology<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:26.240> here's<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.570> interesting

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
technology so here's the interesting

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.219 
technology so here's the interesting
thing

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
thing

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.230 
thing
we<00:01:27.860> developed<00:01:28.220> this<00:01:28.310> technology<00:01:28.670> for<00:01:29.150> this

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
we developed this technology for this

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.870 
we developed this technology for this
motorcycle<00:01:29.600> right<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:30.290> in<00:01:30.830> doing<00:01:31.070> so<00:01:31.220> we

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
motorcycle right and in doing so we

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.010 
motorcycle right and in doing so we
solved<00:01:32.150> a<00:01:32.240> lot<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:32.450> engineering<00:01:32.990> challenges

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
solved a lot of engineering challenges

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.550 
solved a lot of engineering challenges
so<00:01:33.800> good<00:01:33.979> acting<00:01:34.550> in<00:01:34.729> power<00:01:34.910> and<00:01:35.410> we<00:01:36.410> found

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
so good acting in power and we found

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.410 
so good acting in power and we found
that<00:01:36.740> OMS<00:01:37.190> were<00:01:37.340> very<00:01:37.520> very<00:01:37.729> interested<00:01:38.270> in

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
that OMS were very very interested in

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.030 
that OMS were very very interested in
the<00:01:38.540> solutions<00:01:38.930> that<00:01:39.080> we<00:01:39.200> created<00:01:39.530> we

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
the solutions that we created we

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.580 
the solutions that we created we
actually<00:01:40.460> do<00:01:40.640> have<00:01:40.940> two<00:01:41.450> OEM<00:01:41.840> customers<00:01:42.080> right

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
actually do have two OEM customers right

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.649 
actually do have two OEM customers right
now<00:01:42.619> very<00:01:43.190> cool<00:01:43.520> are<00:01:44.509> you<00:01:44.690> allowed<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:44.990> tell<00:01:45.350> me

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:54.380

okay no but seriously one so here we are
in<00:01:54.570> front<00:01:54.690> of<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.869> local<00:01:55.229> motors<00:01:55.560> booth<00:01:55.740> we've

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
in front of the local motors booth we've

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.080 
in front of the local motors booth we've
already<00:01:56.070> talked<00:01:56.340> about<00:01:56.430> local<00:01:56.670> motors<00:01:57.060> a

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
already talked about local motors a

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.550 
already talked about local motors a
little<00:01:57.360> bit<00:01:57.450> but<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> truth<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.140> these<00:01:58.409> guys

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
little bit but the truth is these guys

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.680 
little bit but the truth is these guys
are<00:01:58.950> fantastic<00:01:59.220> and<00:01:59.820> their<00:01:59.909> efficiencies<00:02:00.479> in

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
are fantastic and their efficiencies in

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.719 
are fantastic and their efficiencies in
fact<00:02:01.170> their<00:02:01.290> business<00:02:01.680> model<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.190> an<00:02:02.369> open

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
fact their business model is an open

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.520 
fact their business model is an open
source<00:02:02.970> production<00:02:03.600> model<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.290> allows<00:02:04.500> a

well<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.680> work<00:02:28.920> we've<00:02:29.100> done<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.670> we've<00:02:29.850> taken

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
well this work we've done is we've taken

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.420 
well this work we've done is we've taken
the<00:02:30.600> idea<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.260> normal<00:02:31.560> shock<00:02:31.860> from<00:02:32.340> a

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
the idea of a normal shock from a

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.280 
the idea of a normal shock from a
vehicle<00:02:32.610> let's<00:02:33.450> take<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:33.840> up-and-down

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
vehicle let's take that up-and-down

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.990 
vehicle let's take that up-and-down
motion<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:35.010> actually<00:02:35.370> create<00:02:35.640> something

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
motion and actually create something

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.490 
motion and actually create something
with<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.330> that<00:02:36.450> we<00:02:36.540> can<00:02:36.720> give<00:02:36.900> back<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.470> our

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
with it that we can give back to our

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.759 
with it that we can give back to our
charging<00:02:38.489> system<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.630> our<00:02:39.810> engine<00:02:40.530> management

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
charging system to our engine management

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.770 
charging system to our engine management
system<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.970> things<00:02:42.209> that<00:02:42.360> really<00:02:42.569> make<00:02:42.750> a

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
system the things that really make a

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.559 
system the things that really make a
vehicle<00:02:43.560> run<00:02:43.739> we<00:02:44.280> have<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.430> solid<00:02:44.790> piston<00:02:45.209> okay

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
vehicle run we have a solid piston okay

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.960 
vehicle run we have a solid piston okay
which<00:02:45.690> pushes<00:02:45.959> fluid<00:02:46.530> in<00:02:46.680> one<00:02:47.190> direction<00:02:47.340> this

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
which pushes fluid in one direction this

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.790 
which pushes fluid in one direction this
motor<00:02:48.420> is<00:02:48.630> continually<00:02:49.350> turning<00:02:49.590> and

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
motor is continually turning and

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.650 
motor is continually turning and
creating<00:02:50.130> electricity<00:02:50.489> all<00:02:51.180> right<00:02:51.299> so<00:02:51.480> the

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
creating electricity all right so the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.750 
creating electricity all right so the
purpose<00:02:51.959> of<00:02:52.079> this<00:02:52.230> is<00:02:52.829> kind<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.640> like

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
purpose of this is kind of like

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.920 
purpose of this is kind of like
regenerative<00:02:54.150> braking<00:02:54.510> right<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.780> takes

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
regenerative braking right it takes

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.350 
regenerative braking right it takes
energy<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.410> would<00:02:55.530> have<00:02:55.620> been<00:02:55.739> lost<00:02:55.920> and

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
energy that would have been lost and

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.390 
energy that would have been lost and
absolutely<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.840> have<00:02:58.220> 20,000<00:02:59.220> trucks

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
absolutely you have 20,000 trucks

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.759 
absolutely you have 20,000 trucks
running<00:02:59.610> around<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.180> these<00:03:01.140> shocks<00:03:01.410> enable

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
running around and these shocks enable

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.190 
running around and these shocks enable
you<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:01.920> put<00:03:02.220> 50<00:03:03.000> cents<00:03:03.299> in<00:03:03.329> your<00:03:03.420> pocket<00:03:03.510> every

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
you to put 50 cents in your pocket every

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.620 
you to put 50 cents in your pocket every
five<00:03:04.769> miles<00:03:05.040> yeah<00:03:05.400> that's<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.850> given<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.450> math

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
five miles yeah that's a given the math

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.260 
five miles yeah that's a given the math
and<00:03:06.810> its<00:03:06.930> really<00:03:07.170> gonna<00:03:07.410> make<00:03:07.590> sense<00:03:07.950> yeah

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.450 

so<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.870> automotive<00:03:13.200> x<00:03:13.560> prize<00:03:13.650> was<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.100> ten

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
so the automotive x prize was a ten

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.190 
so the automotive x prize was a ten
million<00:03:14.670> dollar<00:03:14.790> design<00:03:15.360> competition<00:03:16.080> that

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
million dollar design competition that

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.840 
million dollar design competition that
was<00:03:16.260> created<00:03:16.800> in<00:03:16.920> order<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.280> encourage

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
was created in order to encourage

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.270 
was created in order to encourage
designers<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:19.170> create<00:03:19.290> vehicles<00:03:19.680> that<00:03:20.160> could

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
designers to create vehicles that could

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.540 
designers to create vehicles that could
hit<00:03:20.460> the<00:03:20.580> 100<00:03:21.090> mpg<00:03:21.720> mark<00:03:21.990> or<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.500> 100<00:03:22.890> mpge

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
hit the 100 mpg mark or the 100 mpge

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.820 
hit the 100 mpg mark or the 100 mpge
the<00:03:23.940> electric<00:03:24.270> equivalent<00:03:24.720> so<00:03:25.170> today<00:03:25.440> we're

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
the electric equivalent so today we're

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.850 
the electric equivalent so today we're
checking<00:03:26.040> out<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.430> cars<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.270> winners

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
checking out the cars and the winners

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.900 
checking out the cars and the winners
they<00:03:28.860> see<00:03:28.920> it's<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.160> electric<00:03:29.520> version<00:03:29.820> of

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
they see it's the electric version of

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.910 
they see it's the electric version of
the<00:03:30.000> monotracer<00:03:30.710> essentially<00:03:31.710> an<00:03:31.770> enclosed

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
the monotracer essentially an enclosed

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.250 
the monotracer essentially an enclosed
motorcycle<00:03:32.820> so<00:03:33.510> tell<00:03:33.660> me<00:03:33.720> some<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:33.990> specs

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
motorcycle so tell me some of the specs

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.810 
motorcycle so tell me some of the specs
of<00:03:34.350> this<00:03:34.500> how<00:03:34.650> fast<00:03:34.830> is<00:03:35.070> this<00:03:35.190> go<00:03:35.370> zero<00:03:35.700> to

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
of this how fast is this go zero to

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.760 
of this how fast is this go zero to
sixty<00:03:36.150> what<00:03:36.270> are<00:03:36.330> we<00:03:36.390> looking<00:03:36.630> at<00:03:36.720> 0-60<00:03:37.710> is

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
sixty what are we looking at 0-60 is

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.740 
sixty what are we looking at 0-60 is
five<00:03:38.040> seconds<00:03:38.550> or<00:03:38.760> less<00:03:39.150> they're<00:03:39.510> still

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
five seconds or less they're still

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.540 
five seconds or less they're still
developing<00:03:40.110> its<00:03:40.980> everything<00:03:41.190> still<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.460> little

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
developing its everything still a little

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.860 
developing its everything still a little
bit<00:03:41.700> in<00:03:41.730> development<00:03:42.180> but<00:03:42.330> it's<00:03:42.600> gonna<00:03:42.750> be

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
bit in development but it's gonna be

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.060 
bit in development but it's gonna be
definitely<00:03:43.020> less<00:03:43.230> than<00:03:43.440> five<00:03:43.560> seconds<00:03:43.890> maybe

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
definitely less than five seconds maybe

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.580 
definitely less than five seconds maybe

all<00:04:01.450> right<00:04:01.570> so<00:04:01.690> tell<00:04:01.840> me<00:04:01.900> a<00:04:01.990> little<00:04:02.110> bit<00:04:02.230> about

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
all right so tell me a little bit about

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.530 
all right so tell me a little bit about
the<00:04:02.590> very<00:04:02.890> light<00:04:03.160> car<00:04:03.460> when<00:04:04.120> we<00:04:04.210> were<00:04:04.270> going

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
the very light car when we were going

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.390 
the very light car when we were going
after<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:05.050> hundred<00:04:05.320> miles<00:04:05.470> per<00:04:05.650> gallon<00:04:05.980> we

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
after the hundred miles per gallon we

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.700 
after the hundred miles per gallon we
decided<00:04:06.850> to<00:04:06.970> pursue<00:04:07.480> it<00:04:07.690> their<00:04:08.140> platform

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
decided to pursue it their platform

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.950 
decided to pursue it their platform
efficiency<00:04:09.280> okay<00:04:09.490> that<00:04:09.820> means<00:04:10.000> just<00:04:10.360> creating

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
efficiency okay that means just creating

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.740 
efficiency okay that means just creating
a<00:04:10.990> car<00:04:11.440> that<00:04:12.040> takes<00:04:12.310> less<00:04:12.550> energy<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:13.210> move<00:04:13.420> no

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
a car that takes less energy to move no

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
where the energy comes from when we were

engine ok and from there we had a

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.040 
engine ok and from there we had a
turbocharger<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.220> it<00:04:30.460> we<00:04:30.670> use<00:04:31.240> exhaust<00:04:31.510> turbos

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
turbocharger to it we use exhaust turbos

choosing<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:35.470> IC<00:04:35.830> II<00:04:35.860> did<00:04:36.370> that<00:04:36.400> make<00:04:36.610> it

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
choosing the IC II did that make it

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.670 
choosing the IC II did that make it
harder<00:04:36.940> for<00:04:36.970> you<00:04:37.150> in<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.300> competition<00:04:37.780> it<00:04:38.440> did

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
harder for you in the competition it did

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.800 
harder for you in the competition it did
we<00:04:38.860> saw<00:04:39.250> it<00:04:39.340> as<00:04:39.460> more<00:04:39.610> of<00:04:39.730> the<00:04:40.000> high<00:04:40.150> road<00:04:40.450> the

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
we saw it as more of the high road the

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.020 
we saw it as more of the high road the

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
MAL per gallon equivalency it's a great

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.180 
MAL per gallon equivalency it's a great
way<00:04:43.120> to<00:04:43.150> compare<00:04:43.390> electric<00:04:44.320> cars<00:04:44.530> to<00:04:44.680> internal

combustion<00:04:45.670> engines<00:04:46.030> but<00:04:46.390> the<00:04:46.690> one<00:04:46.840> thing<00:04:47.050> it

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
combustion engines but the one thing it

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.500 
combustion engines but the one thing it
does<00:04:47.560> give<00:04:47.890> the<00:04:48.070> electric<00:04:48.730> cars<00:04:48.940> a<00:04:49.000> little<00:04:49.390> bit

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
does give the electric cars a little bit

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.090 
does give the electric cars a little bit
of<00:04:49.600> advantage<00:04:49.930> because<00:04:50.440> it<00:04:50.590> doesn't<00:04:50.920> take

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
of advantage because it doesn't take

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.950 
of advantage because it doesn't take
into<00:04:51.130> account<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:51.790> thermal<00:04:52.120> conversion<00:04:52.419> that

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
into account the thermal conversion that

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.850 
into account the thermal conversion that
happens<00:04:53.320> upstream<00:04:55.080> we<00:04:56.080> wanted<00:04:56.350> a<00:04:56.530> car<00:04:56.830> that

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
happens upstream we wanted a car that

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.400 
happens upstream we wanted a car that
used<00:04:57.520> the<00:04:57.669> existing<00:04:57.970> infrastructure<00:04:58.750> the

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
used the existing infrastructure the

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.930 
used the existing infrastructure the
tough<00:04:59.590> thing<00:04:59.800> is<00:04:59.830> is<00:05:00.130> that<00:05:00.250> we<00:05:00.370> also<00:05:00.550> had<00:05:00.850> to

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
tough thing is is that we also had to

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.730 
tough thing is is that we also had to
meet<00:05:01.090> emission<00:05:01.510> requirements<00:05:01.720> it<00:05:02.290> also<00:05:02.440> had

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
meet emission requirements it also had

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.710 
meet emission requirements it also had
to<00:05:02.770> be<00:05:02.890> a<00:05:03.040> clean<00:05:03.430> engine<00:05:03.730> we<00:05:04.300> put<00:05:04.480> in<00:05:04.570> some

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
to be a clean engine we put in some

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.480 
to be a clean engine we put in some
milder<00:05:05.020> cams<00:05:05.260> to<00:05:05.530> try<00:05:05.740> to<00:05:05.800> bring<00:05:06.220> the<00:05:06.310> revs

milder cams to try to bring the revs
down<00:05:06.760> and<00:05:07.090> did<00:05:07.900> a<00:05:07.930> lot<00:05:08.080> of<00:05:08.140> tuning<00:05:12.540> it's<00:05:13.540> all
