is<00:01:50.179> its<00:01:50.630> back<00:01:50.990> so<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.130> first<00:01:52.399> one<00:01:52.640> had<00:01:53.000> a

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
is its back so the first one had a

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.359 
is its back so the first one had a
completely<00:01:55.840> complete<00:01:56.840> back<00:01:57.229> cover<00:01:57.619> made<00:01:58.160> out

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
out of plastic so it has the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.889 
out of plastic so it has the
disadvantage<00:02:06.200> it<00:02:06.770> doesn't<00:02:07.100> look<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:07.700> good<00:02:08.539> and

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
disadvantage it doesn't look so good and

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.690 
disadvantage it doesn't look so good and

so yea high quality built but

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.210 
so yea high quality built but
the<00:02:13.209> advantage<00:02:13.780> of<00:02:13.930> this<00:02:13.989> is<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.770> don't<00:02:14.980> see

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
the advantage of this is you don't see
