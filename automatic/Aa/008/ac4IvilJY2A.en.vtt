00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
the mating to is not with Queen takes a

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:27.170 
the mating to is not with Queen takes a
fix<00:05:21.780> but<00:05:22.410> actually<00:05:22.830> with<00:05:22.950> Queen<00:05:23.280> h6<00:05:24.030> check<00:05:26.180> so

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
fix but actually with Queen h6 check so

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.450 
fix but actually with Queen h6 check so
that<00:05:27.390> would<00:05:27.630> force<00:05:29.090> King<00:05:30.090> f7<00:05:30.840> and<00:05:31.130> now<00:05:32.130> it's

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
that would force King f7 and now it's

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.590 
that would force King f7 and now it's
Queen<00:05:32.730> g7<00:05:33.240> mate<00:05:34.910> so<00:05:35.910> that<00:05:36.090> was<00:05:36.180> a<00:05:36.240> very<00:05:36.300> nice

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
Queen g7 mate so that was a very nice

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.410 
Queen g7 mate so that was a very nice
tactic<00:05:37.170> with<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:37.590> idea<00:05:37.890> of<00:05:37.980> Queen<00:05:38.310> h6<00:05:39.090> check

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
tactic with the idea of Queen h6 check

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.680 
tactic with the idea of Queen h6 check
not<00:05:40.140> Queen<00:05:40.410> takes<00:05:40.620> f6<00:05:41.460> check<00:05:41.760> so<00:05:42.360> the<00:05:42.480> King

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
not Queen takes f6 check so the King

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.920 
not Queen takes f6 check so the King
goes<00:05:42.960> to<00:05:44.930> f7<00:05:45.930> and<00:05:46.260> then<00:05:46.470> Queen<00:05:46.890> g7<00:05:47.400> mate<00:05:47.930> so

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
goes to f7 and then Queen g7 mate so

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.120 
goes to f7 and then Queen g7 mate so
