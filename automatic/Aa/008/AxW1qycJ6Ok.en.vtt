that good strong forward action but I

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:44.510 
that good strong forward action but I
first<00:04:36.000> worked<00:04:36.210> great<00:04:36.480> if<00:04:36.630> it<00:04:36.750> was<00:04:43.400> really<00:04:44.400> good

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.850 
know you have to bend and straighten
your<00:04:51.510> legs<00:04:51.720> and<00:04:51.840> I<00:04:51.960> quite<00:04:52.230> liked<00:04:52.500> your<00:04:52.680> leg

your legs and I quite liked your leg
action<00:04:53.040> at<00:04:53.280> times<00:04:53.700> okay<00:04:54.630> but<00:04:54.810> you<00:04:54.870> do<00:04:55.020> look<00:04:55.410> a

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
action at times okay but you do look a

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.440 
action at times okay but you do look a
bit<00:04:55.710> lost<00:04:55.890> with<00:04:56.100> your<00:04:56.250> arms<00:04:56.610> and<00:04:56.790> your<00:04:56.850> head
