00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.210 
sure there's no air bubbles if you
happen<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.600> get<00:01:24.780> an<00:01:24.900> air<00:01:25.080> bubble<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.920> can

too<00:01:29.610> many<00:01:29.729> times<00:01:29.850> because<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.509> lose<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
too many times because you lose the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.950 
too many times because you lose the
stickiness<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.590> your<00:01:31.740> grip<00:01:32.150> so<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.750> keep

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
the board your next step is going to be

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.780 
the board your next step is going to be
to<00:01:46.590> take<00:01:47.399> your<00:01:47.460> screwdriver

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
and go around the edges now what this is

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.160 
and go around the edges now what this is
going<00:01:54.620> to<00:01:54.830> do<00:01:55.450> this<00:01:56.450> is<00:01:56.600> going<00:01:56.780> to<00:01:56.840> make<00:01:57.020> an
