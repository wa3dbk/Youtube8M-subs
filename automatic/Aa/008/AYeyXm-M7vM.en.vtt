think<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.370> brings<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.730> bit<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.260> sanity<00:01:04.260> back<00:01:05.220> to

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
think it brings a bit of sanity back to

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.510 
think it brings a bit of sanity back to
the<00:01:05.610> game<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.689> what<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.470> exactly<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.159> about

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.910 
the game and what is exactly this about
it's<00:01:08.909> not<00:01:09.119> about<00:01:09.270> shots<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.110> success<00:01:10.650> it's

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
it's not about shots and success it's

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.609 
it's not about shots and success it's
not<00:01:11.189> about<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:12.479> know<00:01:12.630> or<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:12.930> sustaining

afternoon to speak to sky sports news on

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.620 
afternoon to speak to sky sports news on
this<00:01:25.530> huge<00:01:25.920> story<00:01:26.430> let's<00:01:27.150> hear<00:01:27.330> from<00:01:27.540> a

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
this huge story let's hear from a

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.260 
this huge story let's hear from a
Chelsea<00:01:28.110> interim<00:01:28.320> manager<00:01:29.009> Rafa<00:01:29.640> Benitez<00:01:29.790> on

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
Chelsea interim manager Rafa Benitez on

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.890 
Chelsea interim manager Rafa Benitez on
the<00:01:30.630> Moyes<00:01:30.780> appointment<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:32.659> think<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:33.750> not

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
the Moyes appointment I think it's not

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.719 
the Moyes appointment I think it's not
the<00:01:34.079> easy<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.340> find<00:01:35.720> someone<00:01:36.720> like<00:01:37.610> focus<00:01:38.610> on

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
the easy to find someone like focus on

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.060 
the easy to find someone like focus on
but<00:01:39.000> still<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.170> manager<00:01:40.500> with<00:01:40.650> experience

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
but still it's a manager with experience

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.710 
but still it's a manager with experience
in<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.250> Premier<00:01:41.939> League<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.329> think<00:01:42.420> he

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
in the Premier League so I think he

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.380 
in the Premier League so I think he
knows<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.049> players<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.560> know<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.880> club<00:01:45.119> what

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
knows the players you know the club what

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.020 
knows the players you know the club what
means<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:46.070> discovered<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.729> Premier<00:01:48.000> League

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
means a discovered in the Premier League

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.730 
means a discovered in the Premier League
so<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.299> think<00:01:48.390> there<00:01:48.750> could<00:01:49.439> be<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.590> good

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
so I think there could be a good

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.200 
so I think there could be a good
appointment<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:50.310> just<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.240> time<00:01:51.450> will<00:01:51.630> say

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
appointment but just the time will say

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.819 
appointment but just the time will say
so<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.390> afternoon<00:01:54.540> we've<00:01:55.079> been<00:01:55.380> getting<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
so this afternoon we've been getting the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.550 
so this afternoon we've been getting the
reaction<00:01:56.430> from<00:01:56.640> people<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.930> game<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.409> this

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
reaction from people in the game to this

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.950
