00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
custom firmware it's an add-on which

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.160 
custom firmware it's an add-on which
your<00:01:20.549> city<00:01:20.759> has<00:01:20.909> an<00:01:21.060> atom<00:01:22.040> so<00:01:23.040> when<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.610> close<00:01:23.939> it

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
your city has an atom so when I close it

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.679

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
goes back to my custom from so it's kind

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.590 
goes back to my custom from so it's kind
of<00:01:30.750> pointless<00:01:31.460> pimping<00:01:32.460> out<00:01:32.610> your<00:01:32.640> status

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
of pointless pimping out your status

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.560 
of pointless pimping out your status
part<00:01:33.950> only<00:01:34.950> because<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.520> won't<00:01:35.729> work<00:01:36.030> when<00:01:36.479> you

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
part only because it won't work when you

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.280 
part only because it won't work when you
look<00:01:36.720> cydia<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.579> only<00:01:38.729> see<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.290> and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
look cydia and you only see it and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.460 
look cydia and you only see it and
you're<00:01:40.409> navigating<00:01:40.560> through<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> phone<00:01:42.470> so

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
you're navigating through the phone so

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.010 
you're navigating through the phone so
if<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.770> guys<00:01:43.890> don't<00:01:44.100> know<00:01:44.600> custom<00:01:45.600> firmwares

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
if you guys don't know custom firmwares

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.670 
if you guys don't know custom firmwares
on<00:01:46.200> your<00:01:46.380> status<00:01:46.619> bar<00:01:46.950> does<00:01:47.189> not<00:01:47.399> work<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:48.680> the

on your status bar does not work on the
iphone<00:01:50.070> 4<00:01:50.369> because<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.119> jailbreak<00:01:51.570> is

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
iphone 4 because the jailbreak is

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.160 
iphone 4 because the jailbreak is
different<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.320> it's<00:01:52.950> not<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.930> counter<00:01:54.930> for<00:01:55.110> it

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
different and it's not a counter for it

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.830 
different and it's not a counter for it
OS<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.950> how<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.280> used<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.579> be<00:01:56.790> please<00:01:57.479> always

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
be custom was no longer custom anymore

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:14.460

so<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:01.380> an<00:02:01.500> FYI

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.209
