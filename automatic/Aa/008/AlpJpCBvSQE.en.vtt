00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.469
 Hello 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:14.410
 about windows 8 and today's video theme 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:17.820
 lesson what services can 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.930
 8 and so what kind of service am I now 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.240
 I will not consider explaining us 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.670
 interested in the question of what can be disabled 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.890
 what can not be said along the way 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.900
 shutting down the service is usually done 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.670
 in order to increase the volume 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.629
 internal RAM that is 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.309
 let's say affect the speed of your 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:40.960
 computer speed it up 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:43.320
 but immediately want to say that even if you 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.930
 disable a large number of services 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.940
 windows 8 is very fast 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.770
 will not affect that is to say but 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.480
 in fact, well tangible such straight 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.370
 big gain if you expect it 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.629
 big gain it won't be 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.280
 so I’m warning you right away that 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.759
 you did not suffer a certain 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.800
 disappointment and the second is that 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.940
 certain services affect 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.850
 health and knee applications 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.610
 or own operating system and 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.270
 so 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.420
 important before you start turning off 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.890
 certain services it is important to do 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.870
 checkpoint make recovery 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.060
 create system reference point for 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.729
 so that later if suddenly you 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.020
 make some changes unwanted 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.040
 so that you can then just 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.020
 recover one chef said now 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.700
 itself to changes in question recruit 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.520
 on computer windows key combination 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.910
 the service is started to execute in it we write 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.050
 service command from . and the meme array is ok and y 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.820
 we open the service window 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.530
 this window is here the very window where 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:02.220
 all running on the system are displayed 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:05.250
 services and here I recommend pushing 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.960
 these columns so that you can 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.020
 was comfortable 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.120
 you read the description of their services and for no 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.280
 what is not needed that is to read it to you 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.290
 I will have to because all services are now 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.180
 list which can be disabled or 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.150
 which can not be answered will not because 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.299
 First of all, this is an exclusive question. 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.790
 individual and depends on what 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.739
 services you need which are not because 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.049
 for example, you can disable the service 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.370
 bluetooth case if you don’t have a module 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.930
 bluetooth or are you a bluetooth module 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.269
 for example, do not use 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.130
 but if you use it then 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.709
 respectively, and disable service minato 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.410
 and so on, that is, as if here 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.650
 what service you can turn off which ones 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.330
 I can not repeat it depends on what you 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.440
 what you need or what you do not have 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.060
 for example, there is a service related to 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.070
 hyper-v general service service 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.450
 virtualization remote work words 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.280
 coupon that is if you 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.440
 use the virtual machine you up to 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.060
 Service is needed if you do not use it 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.920
 you say don't even know what it is 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.489
 then accordingly we don’t need can 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.819
 boldly 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.560
 service disabled any service that you 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.349
 need to turn off here also have 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.310
 nuance that you should know how she is 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:21.730
 turns off 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:23.650
 Well, for example, if you do not have a printer, then 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.930
 baths, respectively, do not need service 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.410
 print manager and you can safely turn on 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:33.519
 for this we click twice on the name 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.150
 this service and here we do not just click 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.360
 stop 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.290
 and in the type of launch we select 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.690
 is disabled 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:46.930
 click stop click apply okay and 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.660
 so this service gets into 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.640
 status is disabled here is the launch type 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.549
 is disabled 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.569
 well and so we turn everything off 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:00.069
 systems why did i say that 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.989
 necessarily start type is disabled because 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.700
 what if you're just and and it becomes when 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.810
 the next time you start the computer again 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.510
 will be 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.130
 is running and now it is already disabled and 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.010
 Respectively while you are manually in vein 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.709
 the keys it will not run even 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.959
 after reboot and so on then 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.190
 there is an important point here that I want 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.859
 say as i said i won't 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.240
 list all services that you can or 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.770
 it is impossible because it is a very question 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.480
 individual but I recommend you 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.980
 carefully read the description before the service then 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.870
 have chosen remote worker services 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.400
 tables allowed by the user 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.240
 online remote connection 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.400
 computer 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.400
 green desktop and server viz 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.800
 accordingly if you are not 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.330
 do and do not do this talent 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.400
 the service is not necessary you can disable 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.010
 smart card is the same if you this 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.960
 service is not needed then you can 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.320
 we disable it see in our case 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:57.240
 on by default you are already enabled 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.240
 you can turn it off and so on 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.340
 Fax 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.290
 again if you are not using fax 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.290
 then you can accordingly 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.740
 shut off and she won't bother you 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.840
 In principle, these are the main ones. 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.760
 moments I wanted to say on what 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.800
 services can be disabled 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:26.460
 read the description carefully and proceed 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.400
 According to this description principle on 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.170
 this is a channel about windows 80 while its 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.280
 remember that any problem can be solved 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.280
 the main thing is to know how
