00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.540
 Here we have the Mario between use for Nikon cameras 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.780
 Special feature of this between ring, it put that he autofocus 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.279
 transmits 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:16.970
 around and to another 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.970
 that the individual between longer 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.059
 both with impetus on Anette stuck for camera 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.149
 performs the objective are equipped 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.369
 can be mounted directly between the camera and lens without that 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.580
 more are possible at an event 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.680
 we have no role 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.260
 thick between ring becomes 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.190
 36 millimeters 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.590
 the middle ones with 34 millimeters 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.060
 not just a twelve millimeter 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.940
 All three can also be combined with each other 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.420
 that you can do more 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.240
 to the objects 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.700
 can approach 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.240
 By way of example, one can now here opposite the camera with the 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.550
 in normal 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.520
 small 50 mm 1 8 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.790
 that's a not very sparkling plug in so did 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.260
 then 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
 as always right after the war practiced 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.300
 Bremen go 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.700
 with the mark 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.080
 a camera 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.800
 the objective 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.540
 at the tints 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.650
 Mate is a failed 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.370
 and how they can already see it 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.650
 the focus is transmitted 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.150
 and 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.010
 the place is demonstrated as easy times when a man now with these 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.799
 lens 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.799
 inclusive between bring 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.170
 No, the objects can come up 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.700
 it's pretty close 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.670
 if at third between Lingen 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.670
 with Schneider in between, that's even more 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.990
 and a final possibility 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.100
 which already demand objective use in the vicinity
