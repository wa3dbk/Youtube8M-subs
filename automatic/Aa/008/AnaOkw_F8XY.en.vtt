00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.650
 I 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.290
 passion hightech and michael 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:40.050
 Schumacher under these influences 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.050
 the ferrari 599 gtb fiorano is born 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.160
 Once again , the design of the 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.260
 current grand turismo from maranello 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.660
 the fine brush stroke of the master 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.610
 cultural pininfarina 's silhouette 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:01:01.360
 state already in the state power and 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:01:03.460
 speed from rear diffuser and 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.190
 integrated wing profiles in the 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.500
 c-pillars are clear signs for the 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.990
 sophisticated formula 1 aerodynamics of the 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.990
 ferrari spoiler are superfluous here 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.950
 in order to experience that in motion 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.890
 we have an appointment with raffaele de simone 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.470
 the 29 year old has been a test driver since 2001 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.470
 at ferrari and co-developer of the 599th 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.760
 We have one year and eight months 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.630
 used to our idea of ​​a car 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.690
 implement 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.280
 on the one hand a racing car is with the 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:53.490
 our customers but also on the other hand 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:57.280
 can drive every day as discreet as in the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:02.140
 466 long 599 gtb were twelve cylinders 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.030
 and 620 ps probably rarely disguised the 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.130
 six-liter front mid-engine is scarce 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.250
 behind the front axle the gear 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.850
 is behind result 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.380
 highest possible driving dynamics 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.750
 Positioning the motto is ours 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.190
 as well as the 575 we succeeded 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.860
 have a weight distribution of about 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.570
 53 percent in the back and 47 in the front around 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.280
 test driver to work for ferrari 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.230
 Reaches driving skills alone can not 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.000
 from raffaele must have his impressions 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.770
 constantly pass on to the engineers 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.810
 And of course, that's very important 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.130
 Judgment of Michael Schumacher Michael 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.470
 Of course, this is not a classic one 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.820
 test driver but towards the end of 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.769
 Development work helps us 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.489
 unique judgment enormous 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.050
 It's incredible 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.620
 combination of skill and 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.620
 fervor 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.739
 that makes his unbiased judgment 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.459
 about a new car like the 599 gtb for 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.459
 us valuable 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.170
 The finest leather envelops the perfect 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.790
 sitting retarus adjustable on the 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.930
 Popometer very different built 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.939
 ferraristi the analog digital 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.129
 instruments mix betrays worth knowing 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.900
 up to the selected driving program that 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.940
 selects the driver on the five-stage spot 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.560
 wheel out the so-called manettino 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.000
 we have five settings selected with 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.040
 the kick changes the whole 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.299
 Driving dynamics so the car is always 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.079
 Perfect on the respective conditions 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.079
 to adjust 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.260
 the formula1 training ground of 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.480
 scuderia 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.019
 Hardly is the incredible sound orgy 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.019
 dies 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.960
 we must the 599 gtb on the same 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.960
 experience asphalt up close 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.640
 the race tracks all have these too 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.830
 here in fiorano their very own 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.120
 characteristics 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.470
 It is a stretch that is different from many 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.730
 different routes all over 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.730
 world has been inspired 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.330
 so we could do a very diverse 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.330
 create test round 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.130
 now the artist of transformation plays 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.260
 his strengths from a production car with 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.060
 everyday comfort achieves lap times the 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.430
 previously ultralight bolides 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.590
 were reserved 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.419
 the predecessor 575 maranello was a 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.900
 classic gt a long haul 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.040
 athletes of the 599 is only 13 in fiorano 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.210
 seconds slower than that 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.490
 supercars ferrari enzo the 599 gtb 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.030
 has almost the sporting potential of 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.650
 enzo you can race him over the race track 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.390
 beat and in the next moment 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.960
 For hours relaxed by the area 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:06.000
 go for a ride because he is one 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.500
 fully equipped standard car with 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.500
 all the comfort you can expect 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.650
 no matter if you're on the highway 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.430
 make or with the new ferrari one 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.430
 woman from the prince 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.800
 the driver chooses the landing gear 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.900
 characteristic that he needs right now 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.060
 the rest fully automatically handles 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.100
 damper system depending on driving condition 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.230
 it completes in ten seconds 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:35.480
 change from the comfort of a litter to 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.480
 ultra-hard racing trim and back again 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.190
 is that full of formula 1 technology 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.760
 packed gtb the best ferrari of all 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.010
 times 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.630
 If so, then not for long 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.070
 Test drivers in Fiorano have their eyes 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.070
 again focused on new goals 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:06:01.169
 I have no favorites the newest 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.169
 Ferrari is always the best
