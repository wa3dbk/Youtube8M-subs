00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.819 
keeps disconnecting itself and it's just
not<00:01:36.390> working<00:01:36.630> very<00:01:36.810> well<00:01:37.049> but<00:01:37.380> I've<00:01:37.560> had<00:01:37.710> it

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
not working very well but I've had it

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.640 
not working very well but I've had it
since<00:01:37.979> December<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.509> I'm<00:01:39.990> getting<00:01:40.320> good<00:01:40.439> use

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
out of that I can probably still use it

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.580 
out of that I can probably still use it
a<00:01:42.150> little<00:01:42.240> bit<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.810> might<00:01:43.020> be<00:01:43.140> switching<00:01:43.500> to
