done something well when we do so do
something<00:05:02.160> like<00:05:02.400> it<00:05:02.550> let<00:05:03.060> me<00:05:03.090> end<00:05:03.270> up<00:05:03.300> with<00:05:03.419> an

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
something like it let me end up with an

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.110 
something like it let me end up with an
incredibly<00:05:04.560> imperfect<00:05:05.250> situation<00:05:05.760> you<00:05:05.940> don't

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
incredibly imperfect situation you don't

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.909 
incredibly imperfect situation you don't
know<00:05:06.270> whether<00:05:06.930> it<00:05:07.410> would<00:05:07.620> have<00:05:07.680> been<00:05:07.800> better

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
know whether it would have been better

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.680 
know whether it would have been better
to<00:05:08.070> do<00:05:08.280> nothing<00:05:08.460> so<00:05:08.850> it's<00:05:08.970> I<00:05:09.120> think<00:05:09.240> it's<00:05:09.630> a

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
to do nothing so it's I think it's a

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.409 
to do nothing so it's I think it's a
it's<00:05:10.110> an<00:05:10.560> intervened<00:05:11.100> in<00:05:11.280> Kosovo<00:05:11.850> and<00:05:12.150> that

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
worked out pretty well they did I went

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.400 
worked out pretty well they did I went
there<00:05:14.850> and<00:05:15.060> I<00:05:15.180> saw<00:05:15.210> what<00:05:15.780> happened<00:05:15.990> when<00:05:16.350> you

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410

it's terrible site paddy Ashton was
there<00:05:20.730> with<00:05:20.910> me<00:05:21.060> we<00:05:21.900> propose<00:05:22.680> that<00:05:22.890> there

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
there with me we propose that there

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.200 
there with me we propose that there
ought<00:05:23.250> to<00:05:23.280> be<00:05:23.490> a<00:05:23.610> government<00:05:23.970> intervention

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
ought to be a government intervention

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.580 
ought to be a government intervention
and<00:05:24.750> actually<00:05:25.050> that<00:05:25.200> government

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
and actually that government

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.440 
and actually that government
intervention<00:05:25.680> I<00:05:26.190> think<00:05:26.669> went<00:05:26.910> a<00:05:27.000> very<00:05:27.030> long

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
intervention I think went a very long

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.900 
intervention I think went a very long
way<00:05:27.630> to<00:05:27.690> save<00:05:28.050> they<00:05:28.860> did<00:05:29.310> indeed<00:05:29.460> they<00:05:29.820> did

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
way to save they did indeed they did

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.150 
way to save they did indeed they did
indeed<00:05:30.090> had<00:05:30.450> it<00:05:30.570> happened<00:05:30.870> it<00:05:31.590> did<00:05:31.740> it<00:05:31.919> had<00:05:32.070> it

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
indeed had it happened it did it had it

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.990 
indeed had it happened it did it had it
happened<00:05:32.370> earlier<00:05:32.640> it<00:05:32.700> would<00:05:32.820> have<00:05:32.910> been

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
happened earlier it would have been

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.430
