 Hi, Today I am making a 3-element non-frosting ice cream machine. 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.980
 First, pour كوب cup and 2 tablespoons of condensed condensed milk into a bowl 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.410
 Check in 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder. 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.820
 And even stirred together. 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.530
 And the remaining remaining 4 tablespoons of cocoa powder 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.530
 And whisk until the mixture is homogeneous. 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.740
 It is very thick. 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.740
 Then whisk 1 cup of heavy cream until stiffened. 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.030
 Whiskkle transfer from the milk cream to the cocoa mixture 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.240
 Stir until mixed well. 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.950
 To do this, the mixture must be weak out. 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.950
 Then pour cocoa milk mixture into cream each time 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.030
 And even fold combined. 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.030
 Be careful not to break the cream. 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.660
 This is a way to mix the thick dough into the batter lighter. 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.740
 Now transfer the mixture into a bowl 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.680
 Cover with plastic wrap. 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.680
 Then freeze for at least 6 hours or overnight. 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.980
 Voila, 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.980
 Simple and easy chocolate ice cream with only three ingredients! 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.980
 This babe is thick chocolate ice cream in a snap. 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.580
 Of course, chocolate sauce and minced nuts make the ice cream better. 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.680
 Bon appetite. 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.280
 I love this homemade chocolate ice cream. 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.780
 Everyone knows chocolate ice cream is the best. 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.910
 Also do not forget to watch my summer run. 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.700
 The links are below in the Description box. 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.700
 thanks for watching. Bye for now.
