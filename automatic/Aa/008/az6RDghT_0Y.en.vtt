00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 spring bulbous plants appear on 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.350
 light they are so beautiful they are no se pierde 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.059
 she pour in the look they excite the soul and 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.219
 give rise to different desires 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.420
 so our next story will be 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.070
 ordinary shortened takes special 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.289
 position in garden design 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.720
 many people can't wait to melt 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.150
 snow and we can see beautiful 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.090
 fragrant hyacinths 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.210
 delicate tulips gorgeous strict 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.160
 daffodils unfortunately the winter was long and 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.170
 here we come to your aid and for 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.020
 reception which you call race 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.670
 now we try not to do it 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.670
 distillation is best suited 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.590
 tulips and hyacinths onion need to take 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.829
 only large so-called first 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.840
 parsing their diameter should be of the order 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.570
 three or four centimeters and weight not more than 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.100
 22 grams if you take an onion more 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.820
 they are small you can not simply 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.640
 bloom 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.070
 if you own a bulb then 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.960
 do not need to be afraid that they are infected with something 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.809
 if you purchase onion in 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.119
 store you then better put them on 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.140
 some time to the solution of potassium permanganate 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.140
 what we will do now 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.470
 you can hold at least an hour, and this 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:26.180
 will be enough to onion 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:30.860
 pickle the onion and start 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.020
 prepare containers for planting we can 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.090
 use any container any container 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.240
 in order for the substrate we do not 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.610
 spill out take the usual napkin it 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.790
 one of the most common tricks 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.130
 now container ready landing i 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.410
 fill it with soil any that you have 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:54.800
 There is a whole lot of course to take 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:57.530
 universal primer now we place 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.420
 onion it should not be a passage 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.020
 very deep and approximately so 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.320
 whole club to spout the bulbs 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.330
 was visible above the surface in order 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.490
 so that the bulb awakened we will have 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.120
 to deceive them for this we can fill them 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:17.020
 meltwater or even snow overlay they 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.100
 feel that spring has come and 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.980
 faster give flower stalks 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.990
 you just will not be very fast only 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.110
 in six to eight weeks you will get 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.120
 here is the same wonderful result 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.060
 Naturally onion would throw later 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.030
 it will be a pity and we will try to plant it 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.430
 in the ground but I want to warn you immediately 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.590
 the next time the bulb blooms only 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.820
 in two years because so many 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.820
 Forces are spent on forcing
