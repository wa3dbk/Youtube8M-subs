00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
thought this was overpriced but it's

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.500 
thought this was overpriced but it's
like<00:02:12.350> a<00:02:12.380> little<00:02:12.590> desktop<00:02:13.130> trash<00:02:13.460> can<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.000> it

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
like a little desktop trash can and it

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.690 
like a little desktop trash can and it
was<00:02:14.600> only<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.870> dollar<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.470> was<00:02:15.590> ninety<00:02:16.550> percent

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
was only a dollar it was ninety percent

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.970 
was only a dollar it was ninety percent
off<00:02:17.030> i<00:02:17.330> mean<00:02:17.750> i<00:02:17.870> paid<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:18.170> dollar<00:02:18.350> for<00:02:18.710> it<00:02:18.770> I

off i mean i paid a dollar for it I

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.160 
off i mean i paid a dollar for it I
figure<00:02:19.580> it'll<00:02:19.760> be<00:02:19.910> good<00:02:20.090> maybe<00:02:20.390> for<00:02:20.630> chapstick

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
figure it'll be good maybe for chapstick

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.690 
figure it'll be good maybe for chapstick
or<00:02:21.410> something<00:02:21.830> or<00:02:21.980> maybe<00:02:22.010> if<00:02:22.340> I'm<00:02:22.520> just

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
or something or maybe if I'm just

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.450 
or something or maybe if I'm just
cutting<00:02:22.910> coupons<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.720> uh<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:24.140> could<00:02:24.800> just<00:02:24.950> stow

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
cutting coupons and uh I could just stow

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.240 
cutting coupons and uh I could just stow
it<00:02:25.490> in<00:02:25.790> there<00:02:26.590> Christian<00:02:27.590> but<00:02:27.710> I'm<00:02:27.860> thinking

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
it in there Christian but I'm thinking

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.300 
it in there Christian but I'm thinking
maybe<00:02:28.400> like<00:02:28.580> chapstick<00:02:29.650> or<00:02:30.650> something

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310
