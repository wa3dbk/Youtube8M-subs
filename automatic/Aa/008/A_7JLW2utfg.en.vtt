00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:07.770
 how can you organize it you know that 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.059
 always easy and very fast to do and what 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.639
 more important that you do not have to spend 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.349
 so much money in this interest to know with 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.969
 according to these ideas and watching the video 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.250
 We are going to need a piece of snow 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.590
 dry this is 90 x 40 centimeters 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.240
 friends paints a brush or ribbon more 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.160
 people once they have erased your burden 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.869
 of classroom level bits are passed to 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.310
 stick strips with masquin tape 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.710
 The following way you can do 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.750
 triangles pictures lines what you 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.369
 want and this is how it would now 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.170
 let's paint and once it's about 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.820
 of the painting you are going to remove the tape with 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.950
 be very careful do not worry if this does not 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.660
 you are perfect here what is important is 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.280
 what did you see and then now they followed 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.899
 can last in your room or where else 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.399
 you like it for that base you need 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.289
 a book that you no longer use or that you no longer 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.640
 It serves and all those things that you get 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.260
 can lose because you want 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.640
 basically organize what we're going to 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.670
 to do is let's talk all the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.329
 leaves as follows 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.329
 [Music] 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.989
 i 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.170
 so we're going to occupy a point 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.190
 widths of wood or cork and what you 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.750
 you want to accommodate 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.490
 I'm going to accommodate my caps and with 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.530
 hot cold glue you are going to paste the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.159
 corks 95 me up the car I put him 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.200
 a clip because the cap slipped 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.939
 and ready for that position to organize your 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.939
 caps or anything you want 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.360
 but if you did not get corks what 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.810
 you can do with the hooks like 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.149
 we have the video 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.890
 and that's how it is ready for us to go 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.110
 to occupy a wooden or snow shovel 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.090
 dry scissors stamen and the covers of your 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.560
 cellular eight candles with clips we're going to 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.329
 nail two tacks in the part of 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.039
 up trying to leave a space for 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.549
 then place the mole of the 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.549
 Following way 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.560
 you are going to cut a piece of yarn and 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.190
 trying that this is very well 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.590
 stretched 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.180
 and it's going to be the same in the back 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.180
 and you can now accommodate all those things 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.909
 loans with the cardboard next to a 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.619

 we fill it remains to stick on the wall 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.130
