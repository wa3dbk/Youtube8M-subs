code my code is called a deep plan so

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.110 
code my code is called a deep plan so
apparently<00:05:04.960> people<00:05:05.319> work<00:05:05.949> for<00:05:06.220> a<00:05:06.280> dealership

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
apparently people work for a dealership

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.649 
apparently people work for a dealership
or<00:05:07.360> nisa<00:05:07.659> employee<00:05:08.289> has<00:05:08.740> a<00:05:08.770> a<00:05:09.130> plan<00:05:09.669> B<00:05:10.000> Plan<00:05:10.030> C

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:10.659 
or nisa employee has a a plan B Plan C

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:13.200 
or nisa employee has a a plan B Plan C
plan<00:05:10.690> and<00:05:11.199> for<00:05:11.590> others<00:05:11.979> they<00:05:12.370> have<00:05:12.550> a<00:05:12.580> D<00:05:12.849> plan

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
plan and for others they have a D plan

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.360
