00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.290
 but yesterday it has been transformed into 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.450
 recent times in a large center 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.420
 technological presentations in this case 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.010
 it's the galaxy s 4 non-cellular of the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.230
 South Korean company has been revolutionized 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.539
 the city with this presentation and here 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.189
 goes into creating an emblematic place the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.080
 user can not only see the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.279
 presentation enemies but you can also 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.279
 take contact with the product 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.550
 after so much waiting we are here in 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.500
 the heart of the radio city hall for 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.840
 Meet the new samsung phone the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.269
 samsung galaxy s 4 we have it in your hand 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.670
 we are going to try it is finer and in a 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.350
 5 inch screen full hd amoled 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.600
 but now let's know all the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.309
 functions to detail a function 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.010
 interesting is the time to be me I'm 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.140
 passing behind the photograph 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.079
 theory ruining that photograph but 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.360
 attention because with this function we can 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.030
 erase the people we do not want in the 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.590
 image for example my image that 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.490
 It appeared from behind and the photo is 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.490
 perfect 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.670
 then more and more are transformed into 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.020
 video game consoles consoles 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.909
 portable video games look at this 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.270
 accessory that allows us to have a 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.000
 joystick connected to our pc 4 and of 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.330
 this way play as if it were a 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.220
 front console to see many 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.450
 cell phones do not respond when they do not have 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.330
 the gloves on when he 's in the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.770
 street I buy maybe 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.040
 this has the answer so that 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.020
 us with the gloves stories 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.130
 we could go moving in the 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.130
 different cell phone screens 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.070
 to the concept of health linked to 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.140
 cell phones we have to add this balance 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.530
 this intelligent balance that allows us 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.110
 among other things for example to weigh us and 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.000
 the weight is directly 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.400
 synchronized with our cell phone this 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.560
 way we will go trying taking the 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.900
 data of our different weights at 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.190
 over the weeks and know if the diet 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.190
 it has served or not 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.540
 one supports it on this pad and of 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.590
 this way the good being is already 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.540
 loading 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.450
 look at the detail is not touching anything 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.950
 more than relying on this model that 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.950
 allows to charge the cell phone
