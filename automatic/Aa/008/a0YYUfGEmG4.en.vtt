00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.879
 in the Middle stat virtus would say the Latins 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.220
 already because if a four-wheel drive 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.410
 permanent can be scary for consumption 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.179
 and a two-wheel drive, albeit a rubber one 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.219
 of winter tires does not climb 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.309
 where would you like to weigh the solution 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:19.150
 indeed the solutions are called hiver four 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.150
 and grip control 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.540
 we are in val d'isere in france 2,100 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.500
 meters high to try the two 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.500
 systems on the snow 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.559
 our test starts from the most 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:35.570
 small 2008 with grip control place 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.210
 that our 2008 is equipped with 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.879
 winter tires the place of the mps 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.710
 with which exits factory solutions 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.170
 we always recommend if you have to 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.929
 address snow - covered feedback 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.929
 they are positive after selecting 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:53.089
 from the central knob the snow function 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:55.280
 all that remains is to dose the pressure of the 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.859
 right foot to pull yourself out of 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.300
 otherwise complicated situations for one 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.129
 classic front 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.949
 thanks to the grip control we remember 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.620
 works hand in hand with the brakes 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.540
 wheels with less grip the peugeot 2008 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.970
 manages to climb uphill 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.760
 avoiding wild skating a 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.620
 system as simple as it is effective 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.240
 which, however, is best expressed on the snow 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.370
 fresh more than on the beat e 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.740
 compact where at the end of the fair 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.440
 the congenital limits of the come out 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.320
 front-wheel drive in practice later 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.510
 have tried the 2008 with and without the grip 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.820
 control with the same tires obviously i 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.920
 results change there is little to do and 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.640
 when it comes to starting on funds 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.260
 slippery 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.660
 the difference is felt 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.380
 but if on one side the grip control is enough e 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.010
 advances to those who know how to be the highest aspiration 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.830
 off-road the one to arrive 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.780
 in the most renowned ski resorts is 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.990
 also true that if you want to raise 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.910
 the pull is the traction hybrid forum e 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.220
 on the peugeot 3008 we try in the 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.540
 hybrid for system unlike the 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.070
 grip control system 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.110
 here is the possibility to have a 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.520
 four-wheel drive arrangement 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.100
 thanks to the rear electric motor 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.710
 that takes care of giving strength to those 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.200
 behind we explain ourselves better on the 3008 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.000
 the hybrid four is not about traction 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.370
 integral as a whole 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.410
 the mechanical organs of one are missing 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.570
 common 4x4 transmission 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.580
 however the final result is 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.020
 satisfactory especially if we think 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.280
 that we are talking about a car 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.380
 hybrid in snow starts for 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.280
 example also without sparing us 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.050
 accelerator 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.030
 the socket is good and the electric motor 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.520
 discharge power to the ground 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.840
 immediate but effective slope of a 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.330
 certain level I 'm not a big one 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.550
 problem is the 3008 climbs with 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.110
 all tranquility by breaking down a little 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.600
 provided that you have the good sense of 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.820
 replace the tires n more s series with 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.980
 winter covers as mentioned so 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.470
 doing the grip is good but you need to 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.570
 always remember that the 3008 hybrid four 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.360
 it was not born to face obstacles 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.260
 too insidious since the changes 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.840
 I'm from the motorway 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.939
 in 4x4 mode the one we used 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.370
 on the snow the electronics deals with 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:07.049
 all that remains for us is to concentrate 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.790
 on driving 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.519
 the most attentive will notice a slight 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.689
 delay in the response of the rear 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.450
 especially in the phases of entry into 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:17.610
 curve but are really details on 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.190
 hybrid system still manages to manage 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.260
 the behavior of the 3008 on several 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.269
 road surfaces without having to 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.329
 necessarily possess knowledge 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.040
 techniques make particular choices and it is 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.040
 this is the strength of the system of 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.700
 Peugeot simplicity and hybrid drive 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.700
 maximum yield
