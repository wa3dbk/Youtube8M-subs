00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
the detail and I do think children if

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.370 
the detail and I do think children if
this<00:03:10.850> has<00:03:11.000> never<00:03:11.180> been<00:03:11.300> a<00:03:11.450> girl<00:03:11.660> list<00:03:12.140> from<00:03:12.260> the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
this has never been a girl list from the

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.820 
this has never been a girl list from the
very<00:03:12.590> golden<00:03:13.040> age<00:03:13.160> for<00:03:13.190> picture<00:03:13.880> books<00:03:13.910> but<00:03:14.360> I

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
very golden age for picture books but I

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.350 
very golden age for picture books but I
think<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:15.980> one<00:03:16.130> snack<00:03:16.610> to<00:03:16.820> know<00:03:16.970> is<00:03:17.330> that

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
think the one snack to know is that

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.090 
think the one snack to know is that
there<00:03:17.690> are<00:03:17.780> so<00:03:17.990> many<00:03:18.230> diversions<00:03:18.710> for

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
there are so many diversions for

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.000 
there are so many diversions for
children<00:03:19.520> and<00:03:19.670> they<00:03:20.360> do<00:03:20.420> get<00:03:20.870> easily<00:03:21.200> diverted

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
children and they do get easily diverted

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.820 
children and they do get easily diverted
and<00:03:22.250> I<00:03:23.180> think<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:24.020> important<00:03:24.530> thing<00:03:24.560> is<00:03:24.800> that

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
and I think the important thing is that

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.740 
and I think the important thing is that
they<00:03:25.130> should<00:03:25.820> with<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.060> book<00:03:26.300> like<00:03:26.330> this
