teach you guys how to create some pretty
decent<00:00:04.830> looking<00:00:05.190> water<00:00:05.339> so<00:00:05.640> let's<00:00:05.790> get

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
decent looking water so let's get

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:06.410 
decent looking water so let's get
started

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
started

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.540 
started
when<00:00:06.930> I<00:00:06.990> first<00:00:07.170> create<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.410> plane<00:00:07.919> scale<00:00:08.280> it<00:00:08.429> up

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
when I first create a plane scale it up

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.430 
when I first create a plane scale it up
in<00:00:08.820> R<00:00:09.059> for<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.660> scale<00:00:09.690> tool<00:00:10.050> W<00:00:10.349> from

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
in R for the scale tool W from

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.310 
in R for the scale tool W from
manipulator<00:00:10.950> or<00:00:11.269> translation<00:00:12.269> tool<00:00:12.420> okay<00:00:13.259> so

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
manipulator or translation tool okay so

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.770 
manipulator or translation tool okay so
um<00:00:13.710> now<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.670> have<00:00:14.880> my<00:00:14.969> plane<00:00:15.150> all<00:00:15.299> set<00:00:15.480> up<00:00:15.570> and

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
um now I have my plane all set up and

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.630 
um now I have my plane all set up and
going<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.410> go<00:00:16.500> up<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.650> window<00:00:16.800> render<00:00:17.250> knitters

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
going to go up to window render knitters

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.090 
going to go up to window render knitters
hypershade<00:00:18.199> and<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.289> got<00:00:19.410> my<00:00:19.470> hypershade<00:00:19.859> open

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
hypershade and I got my hypershade open

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.730 
hypershade and I got my hypershade open
I'm<00:00:20.189> gonna<00:00:20.279> do<00:00:20.400> some<00:00:20.550> shader<00:00:20.850> work<00:00:21.150> in<00:00:21.300> here<00:00:21.740> so

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
I'm gonna do some shader work in here so

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.290 
I'm gonna do some shader work in here so
I'm<00:00:23.400> going<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.779> first<00:00:25.279> drag<00:00:26.279> out<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.430> blend<00:00:26.789> and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
I'm going to first drag out a blend and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.620 
I'm going to first drag out a blend and
then<00:00:27.420> I'm<00:00:27.539> going<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.840> drag<00:00:28.650> out<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.859> file<00:00:29.250> node

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
then I'm going to drag out a file node

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.460 
then I'm going to drag out a file node
doing<00:00:30.630> all<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:30.869> with<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.080> middle<00:00:31.349> mouse

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
doing all this with the middle mouse

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.380 
doing all this with the middle mouse
button<00:00:31.500> on<00:00:32.510> the<00:00:33.510> fractal<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.550> see<00:00:35.550> I'm

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
button on the fractal to see I'm

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.209 
button on the fractal to see I'm
probably<00:00:36.809> going<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> need<00:00:37.320> under<00:00:37.590> general

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
probably going to need under general

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.100 
probably going to need under general
utilities<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:40.460> sit<00:00:41.460> here<00:00:41.670> plus<00:00:42.660> an<00:00:42.809> average

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
utilities the sit here plus an average

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.639 
utilities the sit here plus an average
tool<00:00:44.570> okay<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.690> what<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.260> going<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.410> do

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
tool okay and what this is going to do

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.900 
tool okay and what this is going to do
is<00:00:48.170> if<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.440> were<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.680> take<00:00:50.100> well<00:00:50.579> first<00:00:50.760> what's

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
is if I were to take well first what's

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.990 
is if I were to take well first what's
loads<00:00:51.120> up<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.420> our<00:00:51.660> file<00:00:51.899> one<00:00:52.199> node<00:00:52.850> with<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> lot

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
loads up in our file one node with a lot

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.229 
loads up in our file one node with a lot
of<00:00:54.090> an<00:00:54.270> image<00:00:54.600> here<00:00:54.980> into<00:00:55.980> there<00:00:56.239> let's

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
of an image here into there let's

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.560 
of an image here into there let's
actually<00:00:57.390> adjust<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.989> fractal<00:00:58.440> one

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.520 

-<00:01:02.079> about<00:01:03.119> there<00:01:04.119> and<00:01:04.960> then<00:01:05.199> I'm<00:01:05.350> going<00:01:05.379> to

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
- about there and then I'm going to

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.200 
- about there and then I'm going to
change<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:05.830> color<00:01:06.040> grain<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:09.210> bluish

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
change the color grain to the bluish

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.279 
change the color grain to the bluish
type<00:01:10.390> color<00:01:10.630> really<00:01:11.049> light

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.990 

really<00:01:15.039> light<00:01:15.280> blue<00:01:16.079> about<00:01:17.079> right<00:01:17.350> there<00:01:18.000> well

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
really light blue about right there well

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.200 
really light blue about right there well
maybe<00:01:19.360> a<00:01:19.539> little<00:01:19.869> a<00:01:22.380> little<00:01:23.380> more<00:01:23.880> about<00:01:24.880> right

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
maybe a little a little more about right

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.999 
maybe a little a little more about right
about<00:01:25.420> there

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
about there

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.490 
about there
all<00:01:27.009> right<00:01:27.159> so<00:01:27.969> now<00:01:28.299> that<00:01:28.360> I<00:01:28.479> got<00:01:28.600> my<00:01:28.869> um

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
all right so now that I got my um

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.679 
all right so now that I got my um
Tooting<00:01:29.979> node<00:01:30.310> set<00:01:30.610> up<00:01:30.819> here<00:01:31.060> so<00:01:31.240> I'm<00:01:31.329> going<00:01:31.539> to

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
Tooting node set up here so I'm going to

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.539 
Tooting node set up here so I'm going to
go<00:01:32.020> file<00:01:32.229> one<00:01:32.560> little<00:01:32.890> mouse<00:01:33.009> drag<00:01:33.159> on<00:01:33.399> to<00:01:33.460> the

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
go file one little mouse drag on to the

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.929 
go file one little mouse drag on to the
plus/minus<00:01:33.759> node<00:01:34.299> and<00:01:34.569> input<00:01:35.560> 3<00:01:35.740> DN<00:01:36.009> 0<00:01:36.549> and

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
plus/minus node and input 3 DN 0 and

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.910 
plus/minus node and input 3 DN 0 and
fractal<00:01:37.719> middle<00:01:37.990> must<00:01:38.110> drop<00:01:38.560> it<00:01:38.710> on<00:01:38.799> there

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
fractal middle must drop it on there

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.559 
fractal middle must drop it on there
again<00:01:39.130> and<00:01:39.340> put<00:01:39.490> 3<00:01:39.670> DN<00:01:39.939> 1<00:01:41.520> okay<00:01:42.520> and<00:01:42.729> now<00:01:43.360> I'm

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
again and put 3 DN 1 okay and now I'm

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:46.350 
again and put 3 DN 1 okay and now I'm
going<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:43.960> select<00:01:44.170> my<00:01:44.319> blend<00:01:44.710> 1<00:01:45.039> and<00:01:45.369> I'm<00:01:46.149> going

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
going to select my blend 1 and I'm going

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.359 
going to select my blend 1 and I'm going
to<00:01:46.420> select<00:01:46.780> this<00:01:46.990> box<00:01:47.530> over<00:01:47.799> here<00:01:47.920> all<00:01:48.189> the<00:01:48.280> way

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
to select this box over here all the way

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.240 
to select this box over here all the way
to<00:01:48.399> the<00:01:48.580> right<00:01:48.700> color<00:01:49.030> and<00:01:49.840> go<00:01:50.409> environment

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
to the right color and go environment

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.020 
to the right color and go environment
Bowl<00:01:51.929> and<00:01:52.929> then<00:01:53.140> I'm<00:01:53.200> going<00:01:53.380> to<00:01:53.590> drag<00:01:53.950> my

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
Bowl and then I'm going to drag my

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.120 
Bowl and then I'm going to drag my
plus/minus<00:01:55.030> average<00:01:55.360> 1<00:01:56.310> node<00:01:57.310> into<00:01:58.149> the<00:01:58.179> image

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
plus/minus average 1 node into the image

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.380 
plus/minus average 1 node into the image
option<00:02:00.130> right<00:02:00.280> there<00:02:00.489> and<00:02:01.049> now<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:03.610> want<00:02:04.360> to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
option right there and now I want to

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.559 
option right there and now I want to
create<00:02:04.599> some<00:02:04.750> displacement<00:02:05.470> on<00:02:05.709> my<00:02:06.250> plane<00:02:06.569> I

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
create some displacement on my plane I

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.169 
create some displacement on my plane I
could<00:02:07.929> use<00:02:08.049> a<00:02:08.079> bump<00:02:08.319> map<00:02:08.880> but<00:02:09.880> make<00:02:10.060> it<00:02:10.090> a

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
could use a bump map but make it a

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.600 
could use a bump map but make it a
little<00:02:10.269> more<00:02:10.390> realistic<00:02:10.980> I'm<00:02:11.980> going<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.459> use<00:02:12.579> a

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
little more realistic I'm going to use a

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.309 
little more realistic I'm going to use a
displacement<00:02:13.120> map<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.720> let's<00:02:13.840> taste<00:02:14.049> it<00:02:14.230> it

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
displacement map and let's taste it it

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.839 
displacement map and let's taste it it
takes<00:02:14.470> extra<00:02:14.620> time<00:02:14.799> to<00:02:15.069> render<00:02:15.340> than<00:02:15.579> a<00:02:15.670> bump

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
takes extra time to render than a bump

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.160 
takes extra time to render than a bump
map<00:02:16.110> but<00:02:17.110> let's<00:02:17.260> get<00:02:17.380> this<00:02:17.470> set<00:02:17.650> up<00:02:17.739> here<00:02:17.769> um

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
map but let's get this set up here um

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.080 
map but let's get this set up here um
let's<00:02:20.170> see<00:02:20.350> um<00:02:20.560> I'm<00:02:21.549> just<00:02:21.639> going<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.880> about<00:02:22.030> a

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
let's see um I'm just going to about a

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.990 
let's see um I'm just going to about a
new<00:02:22.209> fractal<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:23.400> hope<00:02:24.400> out<00:02:24.549> a<00:02:24.579> new<00:02:24.670> factor

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
new fractal and hope out a new factor

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000 
new fractal and hope out a new factor
like<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:25.989> I'm<00:02:26.290> going<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.530> turn<00:02:26.739> down<00:02:26.769> my

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
like that and I'm going to turn down my

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.530 
like that and I'm going to turn down my
attitude<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:28.630> about

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
attitude to about

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.330 
attitude to about
they're<00:02:30.719> a<00:02:31.760> little<00:02:32.760> more<00:02:33.530> or<00:02:34.530> about<00:02:34.709> there<00:02:34.890> and

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
they're a little more or about there and

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.330 
they're a little more or about there and
then<00:02:35.489> I'm<00:02:35.609> going<00:02:35.879> to<00:02:36.019> drop<00:02:37.019> it<00:02:37.230> on<00:02:37.319> to<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.620> Blin

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
then I'm going to drop it on to the Blin

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.069 
then I'm going to drop it on to the Blin
one<00:02:38.549> use<00:02:38.909> the<00:02:39.030> middle<00:02:39.180> mouse<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:39.659> select<00:02:39.780> with

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
one use the middle mouse and select with

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.130 
one use the middle mouse and select with
displacement<00:02:40.799> map<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.250> now<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.510> need<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.079> add

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
displacement map and now I need to add

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.830 
displacement map and now I need to add
some<00:02:43.379> extra<00:02:43.549> geometry<00:02:44.549> or<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.150> need<00:02:45.659> to<00:02:45.780> add

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
some extra geometry or I need to add

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.490 
some extra geometry or I need to add
some<00:02:45.989> subdivisions<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.859> my<00:02:46.950> plane<00:02:47.250> so<00:02:47.939> I<00:02:47.970> can

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
some subdivisions to my plane so I can

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.099 
some subdivisions to my plane so I can
cancel<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:50.489> can<00:02:50.700> actually<00:02:50.849> see<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:51.750> detail

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
cancel so I can actually see the detail

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.990 
cancel so I can actually see the detail
displacement<00:02:53.069> map<00:02:53.220> because<00:02:53.879> the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
displacement map because the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.069 
displacement map because the
displacement<00:02:54.569> map<00:02:54.629> works<00:02:54.959> with<00:02:55.109> geometry<00:02:55.609> and

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
displacement map works with geometry and

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.830 
displacement map works with geometry and
let's<00:02:58.079> go<00:02:58.230> under<00:02:58.409> poly<00:02:58.620> plane<00:02:58.859> 1<00:02:59.189> and

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
let's go under poly plane 1 and

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.789 
let's go under poly plane 1 and
subdivisions<00:03:00.840> width<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.379> height

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
subdivisions width and height

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.740 
subdivisions width and height
let's<00:03:02.010> select<00:03:02.250> them<00:03:02.459> both<00:03:02.609> and<00:03:02.849> go<00:03:03.120> 45

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
let's select them both and go 45

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:11.210 
let's select them both and go 45
actually<00:03:04.439> to<00:03:04.769> 55<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:09.439> drag<00:03:10.439> your<00:03:10.620> blend<00:03:10.859> on<00:03:11.010> to

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
actually to 55 and drag your blend on to

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.909 
actually to 55 and drag your blend on to
3d<00:03:11.730> viewport<00:03:12.090> onto<00:03:12.930> your<00:03:13.049> plane<00:03:13.290> using<00:03:13.829> the

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
3d viewport onto your plane using the

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.879 
3d viewport onto your plane using the
middle<00:03:14.040> mouse<00:03:14.129> button<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.669> now<00:03:15.540> if<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:16.530> render

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
middle mouse button and now if I render

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.879 
middle mouse button and now if I render
a<00:03:16.919> frame<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.930> my<00:03:18.930> output<00:03:19.169> window<00:03:19.530> doesn't<00:03:19.799> get

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
a frame and my output window doesn't get

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.809 
a frame and my output window doesn't get
in<00:03:19.980> my<00:03:20.010> way

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.949 

you<00:03:23.819> can<00:03:24.000> see<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.419> it's<00:03:24.689> looking<00:03:24.870> pretty

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
you can see that it's looking pretty

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.699 
you can see that it's looking pretty
decent<00:03:25.169> on<00:03:25.590> some<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.579> little<00:03:26.760> closer<00:03:26.939> here

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.059 

all<00:03:30.250> right<00:03:30.459> let's<00:03:30.700> see<00:03:30.819> this<00:03:30.969> on

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
all right let's see this on

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.630 
all right let's see this on
all<00:03:33.969> right<00:03:34.120> now<00:03:34.269> it's<00:03:35.019> looking<00:03:35.140> pretty<00:03:35.409> decent

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
all right now it's looking pretty decent

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.690 
all right now it's looking pretty decent
so<00:03:37.049> you<00:03:38.049> definitely<00:03:38.739> work<00:03:39.069> with<00:03:39.099> that<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.579> can

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
so you definitely work with that you can

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.580 
so you definitely work with that you can
adjust<00:03:39.819> all<00:03:40.239> your<00:03:40.450> nose<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.140> stuff<00:03:41.290> like<00:03:41.379> that

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
adjust all your nose and stuff like that

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.369 
adjust all your nose and stuff like that
make<00:03:41.829> it<00:03:41.859> make<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:42.819> look<00:03:42.879> a<00:03:42.969> little<00:03:43.090> better

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
make it make it look a little better

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.940 
make it make it look a little better
maybe<00:03:44.379> even<00:03:44.620> add<00:03:44.739> a<00:03:44.769> bump<00:03:45.299> map<00:03:46.299> to<00:03:46.599> it<00:03:46.950> a

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
maybe even add a bump map to it a

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.890 
maybe even add a bump map to it a
fractal<00:03:48.790> and<00:03:49.000> just<00:03:49.239> kind<00:03:49.450> of<00:03:49.480> tweak<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:49.810> with

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
fractal and just kind of tweak it with

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.199 
fractal and just kind of tweak it with
those<00:03:50.019> sentence<00:03:50.349> and<00:03:50.530> stuff<00:03:50.709> but<00:03:51.069> um<00:03:51.220> that's

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
those sentence and stuff but um that's

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.369 
those sentence and stuff but um that's
pretty<00:03:52.420> good<00:03:52.629> you<00:03:52.720> can<00:03:52.750> even<00:03:52.930> key<00:03:53.170> in<00:03:53.290> your

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
pretty good you can even key in your

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.369 
pretty good you can even key in your
displacement<00:03:54.340> if<00:03:54.400> you<00:03:54.459> want<00:03:54.609> to<00:03:54.670> animate<00:03:55.120> it

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
displacement if you want to animate it

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.509 
displacement if you want to animate it
or<00:03:56.379> not<00:03:56.560> your<00:03:56.709> displacement<00:03:56.980> but<00:03:57.370> your

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
or not your displacement but your

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.640 
or not your displacement but your
fractal<00:03:58.239> that<00:03:58.420> controls<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.989> displacement

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
fractal that controls the displacement

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.410 
fractal that controls the displacement
so<00:04:00.569> let's<00:04:02.250> let's<00:04:03.250> add<00:04:03.459> a<00:04:03.489> little<00:04:03.730> something<00:04:04.389> to

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
so let's let's add a little something to

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.679 
so let's let's add a little something to
this<00:04:04.659> so<00:04:04.840> let's<00:04:04.870> add<00:04:05.109> a<00:04:05.170> cube<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:06.569> put<00:04:07.569> the

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:07.689 
this so let's add a cube and put the

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:09.899 
this so let's add a cube and put the
cube<00:04:07.870> right<00:04:08.079> about<00:04:08.290> there<00:04:08.590> and<00:04:09.069> I'm<00:04:09.579> going<00:04:09.879> to

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909 
cube right about there and I'm going to

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.729 
cube right about there and I'm going to
select<00:04:10.299> all<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.629> edges<00:04:10.750> on<00:04:11.079> the<00:04:11.169> cube<00:04:11.439> and

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
select all the edges on the cube and

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.819 
select all the edges on the cube and
we're<00:04:12.159> going<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.340> go<00:04:12.400> into<00:04:12.549> edit<00:04:12.639> mesh<00:04:12.970> bevel

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
we're going to go into edit mesh bevel

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.379 
we're going to go into edit mesh bevel
let's<00:04:14.829> change<00:04:15.129> our<00:04:15.250> offset<00:04:15.669> make<00:04:15.879> it<00:04:16.000> really

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
let's change our offset make it really

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.900 
let's change our offset make it really
kind<00:04:16.599> of<00:04:16.660> light<00:04:17.019> segments<00:04:17.979> a<00:04:18.070> lot<00:04:18.250> of<00:04:18.370> segments

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
kind of light segments a lot of segments

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.719 
kind of light segments a lot of segments

about<00:04:21.849> what<00:04:22.810> let's<00:04:23.470> change<00:04:23.710> that's<00:04:23.949> going<00:04:24.280> to

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
about what let's change that's going to

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.170 
about what let's change that's going to
our<00:04:24.490> history<00:04:24.759> here<00:04:25.000> on<00:04:25.270> poly<00:04:25.919> bevel<00:04:26.919> one

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
our history here on poly bevel one

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:34.390 
our history here on poly bevel one
changes<00:04:28.180> our<00:04:28.240> offset<00:04:29.020> to<00:04:29.470> like<00:04:31.050> 0.05

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.210 

alright<00:04:34.850> that<00:04:35.180> looks<00:04:35.210> pretty<00:04:35.479> decent<00:04:36.560> alright

to an orange like color like that throw
it<00:04:51.229> on<00:04:51.320> the<00:04:51.470> cube<00:04:51.770> rotate<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:52.639> cube<00:04:52.760> slightly

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
it on the cube rotate the cube slightly

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.180 
it on the cube rotate the cube slightly
and<00:04:54.820> I'm<00:04:55.820> going<00:04:56.000> to<00:04:56.030> go<00:04:56.180> down<00:04:56.360> to<00:04:56.949> where<00:04:57.949> is<00:04:58.070> it

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
and I'm going to go down to where is it

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
let's see ray tracing options want to

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.930 
let's see ray tracing options want to
drop<00:05:02.750> down<00:05:02.960> that<00:05:03.080> tab<00:05:03.580> refractions<00:05:04.580> turn<00:05:04.790> that

it's going to Maya software and let's go

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.340 
it's going to Maya software and let's go
down<00:05:13.039> to<00:05:13.190> ray<00:05:13.520> tracing<00:05:13.789> quality<00:05:14.449> and<00:05:14.690> check

down to ray tracing quality and check

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.260 
down to ray tracing quality and check
the<00:05:15.500> ray<00:05:15.620> tracing<00:05:15.860> box<00:05:16.250> a<00:05:16.610> close<00:05:17.590> render<00:05:18.590> frame

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.590 
the ray tracing box a close render frame
let's<00:05:20.270> see<00:05:20.389> what<00:05:20.510> we<00:05:20.600> got<00:05:20.750> here

let's see what we got here
takes<00:05:23.170> a<00:05:23.410> minute<00:05:23.980> to<00:05:24.130> render<00:05:24.460> though<00:05:24.610> but<00:05:24.880> um

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
takes a minute to render though but um

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.270 
takes a minute to render though but um
as<00:05:25.660> you<00:05:26.110> can<00:05:26.260> see<00:05:26.440> you<00:05:26.740> know<00:05:26.830> it's<00:05:27.040> looking

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
as you can see you know it's looking

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.370 
as you can see you know it's looking
pretty<00:05:27.640> decent<00:05:27.910> you<00:05:28.720> can<00:05:28.840> throw<00:05:28.990> in<00:05:29.080> a<00:05:29.170> light

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
pretty decent you can throw in a light

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.010 
pretty decent you can throw in a light
in<00:05:29.500> your<00:05:29.590> scene<00:05:29.830> when<00:05:30.610> we<00:05:30.640> do<00:05:30.820> that<00:05:30.940> when<00:05:31.210> we<00:05:31.360> go

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
in your scene when we do that when we go

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.370 
in your scene when we do that when we go
to<00:05:32.080> render<00:05:32.320> end<00:05:32.590> point<00:05:32.980> light<00:05:34.020> just<00:05:35.020> like<00:05:35.230> that

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
to render end point light just like that

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.500 
to render end point light just like that
little<00:05:35.500> light<00:05:35.800> plot<00:05:36.700> selecting<00:05:37.180> the<00:05:37.360> other

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
little light plot selecting the other

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:43.130 
little light plot selecting the other
nodes<00:05:37.870> ooh<00:05:40.650> let's<00:05:41.650> try<00:05:41.800> to<00:05:41.860> grab<00:05:42.100> this

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
nodes ooh let's try to grab this

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.230 
nodes ooh let's try to grab this
all<00:05:44.140> right<00:05:44.260> there<00:05:44.620> I<00:05:44.800> got<00:05:45.070> it<00:05:45.250> let's<00:05:45.880> bring<00:05:46.120> it

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
all right there I got it let's bring it

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.030 
all right there I got it let's bring it
up<00:05:46.330> here<00:05:46.570> turn<00:05:47.560> on<00:05:47.680> seven<00:05:48.190> from<00:05:48.550> lit<00:05:49.110> mode<00:05:50.110> and

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040 
up here turn on seven from lit mode and

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.570 
up here turn on seven from lit mode and
kind<00:05:51.670> of<00:05:51.730> adjust<00:05:52.120> this<00:05:52.390> a<00:05:52.720> little

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.460 

and<00:05:56.060> see<00:05:56.240> how<00:05:56.330> that<00:05:56.389> would<00:05:56.630> work<00:05:56.840> look<00:05:57.229> if<00:05:57.380> I

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
and see how that would work look if I

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:04.159 
and see how that would work look if I
rendered<00:05:57.830> it

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.089 

and<00:06:04.289> you<00:06:05.280> know<00:06:05.430> that<00:06:06.060> doesn't<00:06:06.509> look<00:06:06.629> that<00:06:06.659> bad

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099 
and you know that doesn't look that bad

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:10.640 
and you know that doesn't look that bad
you<00:06:08.099> definitely<00:06:08.610> you<00:06:09.150> know<00:06:10.110> just<00:06:10.379> some<00:06:10.530> of<00:06:10.590> the

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
you definitely you know just some of the

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.309 
you definitely you know just some of the
options<00:06:10.770> make<00:06:11.189> a<00:06:11.219> little<00:06:11.370> better<00:06:11.759> under<00:06:12.389> run

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 
options make a little better under run

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:15.499 
options make a little better under run
your<00:06:13.560> blend<00:06:13.860> and<00:06:14.009> stuff<00:06:14.159> like<00:06:14.279> that<00:06:14.460> but<00:06:14.669> um<00:06:14.789> it

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
your blend and stuff like that but um it

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:16.850 
your blend and stuff like that but um it
looks<00:06:15.719> pretty<00:06:15.930> decent<00:06:16.050> right<00:06:16.319> now<00:06:16.439> so<00:06:16.680> that's

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
looks pretty decent right now so that's

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.469
