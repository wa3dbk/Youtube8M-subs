00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.200
 hello how about youtube friends like 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.970
 I hope you are very well 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.770
 and today I am going to show you in 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.360
 this video the package of mods that 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.640
 too many people were asking me in 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.580
 the last days and obviously have to 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.170
 see with the karman land series this 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.670
 series that are performing several 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.070
 youtubers that I guess already all the 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.310
 the world knows her since they are practically 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.440
 all the known youtubers of Spain 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.629
 so this series have asked me many 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.040
 users that I make available for 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.100
 download both in the format of the 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.719
 classic as in project launcher so 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.670
 I had to make my own version of 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.920
 this package of mods as you know 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.659
 or good I do not know if they know but I'm not 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.789
 the creator of that motorcycle package that 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:49.100
 is used in the series therefore I 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.890
 I have made a compilation of my own 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.179
 that includes that package and also it 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.089
 have to go asking these 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:57.710
 youtubers what content is there or what things 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.699
 are using so that you can 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.649
 have a package of mods be identical 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.760
 In addition to that also the package of mods 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.500
 will be available in version 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.090
 server so if you want 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.729
 play with your friends can also 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.110
 do what is true is that there 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.830
 some things 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.840
 they are not you can say universal or that 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.390
 they are not included in a package of mods 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.030
 or in a mod as such but they are things 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.440
 that were designed by hand practically 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.050
 so that this could be done 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.670
 series between all those youtubers so 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.850
 there are some things like for example the 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.740
 map and the buildings that are not 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.890
 included because obviously that's something 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.500
 personal or private users that 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.360
 they are using it so the mods 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.979
 they were going to be included and obviously 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.470
 you can download them without any 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.690
 problem the content is identical and 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.610
 there are even some improvements that also 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.040
 I have designed so that you can 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.020
 use them without problems so let's 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.340
 to start with the installation in the 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.990
 description of this video I'm going to 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.850
 leave the necessary links so that 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.160
 you download both the version of the 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.320
 client that is the launcher as well 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.020
 the compressed format in zip point that 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.540
 is the server so you download 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.770
 the files that you are going to use now 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.380
 let's execute our application 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.210
 by double-clicking it to start 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.580
 and once you have finished loading 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.100
 all these files needed for the 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.220
 installation will then appear in the 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.230
 main installation window in this 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.180
 installation window we can 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.190
 select at the bottom the 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.950
 location where we want that 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.750
 this package of mods is installed we have 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.820
 three different options the first of 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.680
 them is to install directly in 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.440
 roaming creating us the point folder 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.990
 minecraft the second is to be installed 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.690
 creating a new instance in multi 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.880
 minecraft or the third one is download 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.290
 directly the minecraft point folder 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.120
 in zip dot format 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.130
 there are some users that have 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.780
 problems when installing it or that 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.790
 they simply wish to have the folder 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.890
 minecraft point then they can do it 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.470
 with this option they simply select 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.750
 download the folder and then they will be 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.400
 taken to the download page in 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.010
 where can you get that file 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.290
 compressed that file that you are going to 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.990
 download is not an application nor 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.090
 no other type of installation but 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.580
 which is simply the point folder 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.540
 minecraft already compressed directly 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.879
 so that you 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.430
 and copy it in the location where 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.469
 you want to install either add it 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.590
 directly to multi minecraft or also 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:29.730
 put it in roaming so you can 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.099
 execute or can you start the 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.079
 game so you select the 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.430
 option that corresponds in this case I 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.319
 I will install it directly in 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.720
 roaming so press the button 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.650
 install and now let's wait for it 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.650
 finish the entire installation 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.799
 although there is a time when it's over 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.780
 then the message will appear that 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.790
 installed correctly so now 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.560
 we press accept and we can 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.340
 we start the game directly 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.140
 from this application or we can even 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.480
 edit the content that is included in 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.370
 this series as I mentioned all the 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.620
 Series mods you are 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.060
 they are using and that you 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.219
 can see in the videos are also 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.170
 included in this package of mods as well 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:17.329
 that if they want to see some content see 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.979
 some way or they want to take it away they can 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.840
 do from tab number 2 that 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.280
 call to edit mods and there it will appear 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.740
 the entire list of modes that 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.150
 they are currently installed so 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.410
 practically this is all the 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.300
 installation that you must 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.460
 perform to have all the mods already 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.720
 installed remember that if you have any 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.849
 problem can you tell me in the 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.220
 comments on facebook pages or 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:38.990
 in my twitter account so I hope 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.099
 that you liked this video and we 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.099
