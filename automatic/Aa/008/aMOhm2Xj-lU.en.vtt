00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.170
 Hello everyone and wishes of Taponier 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 today I'm going to make a video 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.370
 of unboxing so two unpacking a 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.410
 phone yes still runs a phone 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.120
 or ico again they really 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.590
 a phone output output really 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.490
 very very very very very impressive 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.949
 which is not to displease me 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.279
 by the way and today I'm going so 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.920
 you unpack the last 5 inches of the 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.590
 catalog called wiko galloway 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.630
 so here it is so we'll do a tour 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.680
 of the box as usual then 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.990
 what we have on this 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.399
 phone boils a classic box like 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.510
 usually we will rather linger on 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.430
 the specificities we see behind 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.320
 so we are of course 1.5 inches 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.399
 so we leave on hd no full hd 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.320
 of hd so 720p a hd seedling with a 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.059
 good surprise of a apn of 13 million 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.280
 pixels so big fat big 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.809
 resolution in the back and for the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.280
 selphy 5 million pixels advance it 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.250
 is also very well so we are on 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.690
 a quad core with 3 giguÃ¨re I imagine 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.020
 that it's from the media library we'll see the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.239
 model more precisely in rom so in 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.320
 memory to do we have 16 gigabytes and that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.100
 it is rather a good thing 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.080
 with a 1 gigabit RAM and 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.700
 we are here on corning gorilla to 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.650
 their good good news again since 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.229
 we are also on a series of 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.060
 phones that come out of the box with the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.250
 last android kit kat so from 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.659
 the android 4.4 so installed original 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.430
 on the phone to this one it's a 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.830
 good news and so the 3g + more 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.600
 so the ax more for a good flow 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.840
 at the level of the internet network that's it and 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.790
 so the usual double sim at wifo and 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.890
 without further ado we will unpack this 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.619
 phone a little power to what he 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.540
 looks like that's it we're all from 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.850
 then remove this little film that 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.280
 clock provide immediately what 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.130
 looks like the phone without this little 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.840
 utensil something very classy to 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.340
 first sight with a very dark screen a 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.750
 so says if you see there he is even 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.520
 blacker than the edges of the phone 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.350
 so that's pretty cool that's it 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.350
 sends a rather classy image then 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.750
 look 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.100
 then one of the particularities here is this 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.659
 phone is like wanting to 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.240
 the back I do not know if you have 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.890
 a story of imitation imitation 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.170
 seagulls cure at the back which is 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.670
 rather well on false bottoms has 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.410
 obviously in oil leather we 're going to be 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.030
 clear is plastic but that is 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.440
 very very good especially for taking 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.540
 in hand something non-slip 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.250
 even here when we pose but we feel that 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.620
 it takes a little bit more so it's 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.120
 rather well with a visual effect 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.319
 I'm pretty nice too 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.580
 do what is black is what 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.560
 it's dark blue kind rather 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.480
 tend to say dark blue but that's it 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.430
 otherwise you see a little worry 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.630
 fined delala that as you have 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.040
 could also see him here up and scored at 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.410
 the humiliating in something we 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.810
 they find here that gives 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.880
 something borrowed at the level of 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.030
 style including phones that we 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.010
 can we find at htc 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.150
 here are the ones because this little side 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.140
 like that makes it obviously there is no 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.390
 one part in front but it makes me a 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.910
 little think of something very fan 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.220
 very simple very flat design that makes 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.150
 also think in any case it's for 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.280
 take my first and first 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.100
 approaches like that some phones 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.710
 also from chez alcatel including 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.330
 the x i find it looks like who the 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.880
 one touch and x that looks like a little 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.410
 little but in any case it's not bad for 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.700
 a first aspect so here I was leaving 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.960
 the phone aside we'll watch the 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.620
 bundle what's inside somehow 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.730
 very classic thing of course 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.710
 what is the USB cord 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.860
 of course without which we could not 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.640
 do nothing of course the charger that goes 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.200
 with 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.820
 very classic of a shoot where the good 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.980
 domingo I think they have not changed 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.390
 since a year or two years ago but 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.980
 it's not frankly because 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.290
 they're doing that it works 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.520
 present i have never m in full so of 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.840
 earphones something very 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.970
 classic also found at all 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.260
 the bundles again good ben the 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.060
 testin not expected something 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.770
 extraordinary but less it works and 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.720
 it has the merit of being there and some 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.670
 nice thing also from 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.850
 wilko as it's double sign and that 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.170
 everyone does not necessarily have the 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.280
 sin format reminds you that until 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.280
 present there are three formats that are 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.840
 used the mini the micro and the nano and 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.460
 if necessary you have the students 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.470
 stater here that they will be able to you 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.330
 allow to put your different 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.550
 card type cards to be able to them 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.470
 insert in the phone it's nice 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.550
 also from wilko which I 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.560
 let's go on a little tour of 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.639
 I remind you phone priori it 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.039
 on the media library 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:20.870
 4.3 gigahertz 1 gigabit of ram 16 giga 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:24.080
 ROME something rather nice one 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.490
 sees two slots here a first here there is 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.530
 a second there so I know that it 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.000
 some small peculiarities too and 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.949
 that's pretty well thought on the part of 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.639
 wilko but we'll see that during the test 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.800
 full 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.110
 So here I remember it was a video 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.090
 of a boxing of the yes galloway that is 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.130
 released a few days ago and that I 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.330
 I'm going to test myself right now 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.930
 I'll see you soon for a test 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.930
 complete hi
