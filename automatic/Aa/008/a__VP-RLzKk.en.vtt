00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.080
 hello my dear friends and warmly 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.090
 Welcome to a new minecraft 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.050
 playstation and three tutorials in the 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.550
 Today's video is about again 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.770
 a new lift a very 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.430
 simple lift and although the ears 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.840
 elevator 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.000
 I have with my other times 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.309
 lift tutorial in the comments 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.989
 looked around and noticed that very many 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.670
 write that he no longer 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.199
 works or almost not anymore 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.600
 he will hang on 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.280
 and yes that's the whole update 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.560
 You must also send me the upload date 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.700
 command video were uploaded as he has 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.230
 still works perfectly though 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.420
 meanwhile because of all the updates 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.030
 He has subsided a bit 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.190
 and today is also a new one 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.020
 Lift at the start a very simple 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.380
 example, the flawlessly works 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.700
 namely the Loren partie said and me 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.560
 I would show you the whole time before I see you 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.200
 show what we need and we built 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.280
 becomes 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.660
 The whole thing looks like I can see 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.009
 these loren hover around 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.200
 we just press l2 all the time 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.970
 sometime above and here still l2 and 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.080
 were once as we can top rum 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.409
 That's very, very important 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.060
 just kept simple here and now 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.799
 many loren stacked on top of each other 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.260
 you have to get the whole two third one 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.750
 as fast as you want and then 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.400
 you are at the top 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.470
 yes as I said inserts easier and 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.390
 Practical game of chance the only thing 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.369
 we need it again 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.420
 Any building block is a few loren 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.710
 Of course it is up to you how high he is 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.040
 power could make you as tall as you 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.780
 want 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.970
 the function does not work in any case 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.939
 and then we need one too 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.009
 rail i believe in a few seemed 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.140
 ok i do not know how many a few 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.090
 trap doors the torch does not burn and 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.979
 Of course, I already told you 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.420
 just catch the basic concept 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.479
 to the elevator and not so 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.070
 Three in front of here do so and build 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.850
 We then as high as the elevator 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.900
 shall be 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.360
 Of course, I 'll do it again now 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.970
 a bit smaller because it's the note tutorial 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.850
 is that I so go all out then 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.010
 we're here two tall a 28 year old one 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.470
 blog and then so the men again 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.700
 the whole thing looks and goes away 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.860
 Then we pull just as high as the 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.530
 other blocks come up here and up here 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.150
 we already build our platform where we 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.590
 then walk around later etc 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.810
 It does not matter, of course I do 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.870
 always big 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.970
 if all this out and here at the 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.500
 lowest point 1 2 here on the 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.239
 third block placed animals and animals 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.340
 Fold the immediately takes on the whole 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.739
 looks like that then we have to go up again 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.569
 in the 2d mode , I would with a lighter 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.220
 first make the place in the gate under 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.110
 to go 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.849
 and yes, then we go to our blog 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.080
 place here again here 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.430
 so that we are on top of it 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.680
 and the lore can be placed in 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.480
 our blog barely off the lore is 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.390
 then fall down right in 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.060
 the gap in and moment must fly 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.670
 so and above that lore a blog place 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.200
 someone next part animals moment like that 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.670
 that's what the tall ones say 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.220
 important that they are always high 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.510
 folding roof the trap doors and then comes 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.489
 even the next lore and that 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.260
 then repeated it so many times as high 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.519
 some blame is mine is now as 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.500
 said very small and kept simple 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.390
 then at some point will be so high 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.560
 be that they only have a lore out 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.120
 coal or detail animals 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.670
 I was definitely going to do it that way 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.380
 something above looks like that and the block came 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.540
 me then away here is also one 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.650
 get a logo on it 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.180
 Here we can do it a bit more 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.720
 edge lamp not pushed away 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.130
 becomes 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.650
 and now you can do it all the time 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.730
 try all the time just l2 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.859
 if you push it at the top 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.150
 are still looking for l2 if you again l2 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.650
 Vapors can run around freely 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.209
 and yes it was already with the 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.739
 tutorial as I said a very simple 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.450
 and practical case studies should 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.220
 actually everyone managed and the 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.310
 The function of the lift will be on everyone 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.510
 never let up and with this 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.819
 You can do the same vehicle as well 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:59.819
 back down is appel 22 22 l 22nd 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.139
 then listen to me at the bottom so so 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.200
 In this case you can go up and down 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:06.000
 shut down and in my opinion one 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.239
 very practical lift a simple 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.680
 driving lessons and the materials are you 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.329
 yes that 's it with a few shoes 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.680
 of course, I hope, as always, by the 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.970
 liked the video you write the 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.130
 Comments on what you think of these industries 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.510
 stop and yes we'll see you later 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.510
 next video again people chips 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.530
 HÃ¤nni 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.530
 is bright
