00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.390
 m 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.160
 hello and welcome to the five designs 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.930
 the week i am here again for you and 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.270
 has five designs with the luggage 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.460
 You see, they are really cool this time 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.900
 off and this one also really cool and 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.090
 we'll just go to the first one 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.250
 design over and I think you see 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.460
 Immediately what that should be exactly and indeed 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.650
 is it a duck and yes that's right 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.240
 become cool 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.669
 otherwise there just not net as much to 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.290
 say I 'm going a bit 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.730
 around it as you see how the built 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.610
 that we now have her yellow block 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.100
 forest blog and here is another yellow 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.829
 block and again this is here 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.370
 carpeting as well as the wings 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.020
 and the tail back there too 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.140
 you can build quite simply 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.090
 We rebuild everything without problems 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.460
 the second design and that is when 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.050
 the reddot user to apollo and that is 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.590
 really really cool one with water so 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.350
 chair 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.540
 You see what it looks like and the cool one 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.129
 You can even use it 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.370
 and now sees itself in it 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:13.110
 I'll go and see the person 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.979
 yes I do not remember one now 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.290
 Comment by villa 52 of a third person 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.150
 wrote 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.480
 and that looks like the one sitting 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.740
 bit in the chair in there 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.810
 But nothing makes year that is minecraft 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.700
 and I'll just go out and 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.680
 that's a bit bread that one 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.900
 bit problematic that build 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.650
 I 'll just do that and that 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:41.570
 you need a rail 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:46.190
 a no came a redstone torch and 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:49.820
 a runway a trap door and a runway 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:54.510
 nevertheless, it takes exactly one harp 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.100
 step best of wood and 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:02.299
 k 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:05.310
 Maybe I am still healthy 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.700
 okay well it starts and indeed sits 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.870
 just go here and on the rail 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.580
 can you already put your card and the 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.200
 moment that was the wrong step now 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.500
 and now goes here first in the park 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.290
 look up now you can see your rail 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.739
 set and best already your k on it 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.340
 and exactly and here comes yours now 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.590
 run in and now you have to be like that 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.840
 pull a small kaff pen here and 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.819
 Here you guys let me think 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.790
 this is exactly where the here 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.250
 stamp this way and now you just have to 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.730
 still go and the raider broken 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.080
 do 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:49.470
 that was such a highlight in front of 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.940
 and said to built and then it can 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.530
 actually already go and that 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:59.040
 we still have to list this one 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.670
 operation take zack like that and then that's it 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.390
 squad 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.280
 I've already thought okay good the 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.560
 the most difficult it managed missing now 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.910
 still the tractor and the door and the 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.570
 are also quite simple in two sentences 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:16.950
 now in the block behind it and because we are so 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:19.620
 once and twice and now we bet 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.450
 now still run tenth carry once 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:27.960
 twice and we'll find it now 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.390
 twice 6 times heard so 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.800
 they can fold up now and then 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.840
 have we ever take our arm 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.160
 and that of the drops already 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.250
 sucked now only the door is missing 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.770
 and we are so in it and now 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.060
 Do you have your chair as I said that one 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:47.820
 bit complicated the sun is going 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:49.020
 but under mist it is really a whole 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.610
 cool chair if you are too 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.250
 can use such a similar 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.930
 chair gibson villa 5 there we go too 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:00.210
 another one of the designs follows ok 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.340
 Let's move on to design number three 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.760
 and that looks very unspectacular 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.860
 but it's really just about this 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.080
 pillars and although a building now 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.110
 builds what is partially in the water 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.490
 then of course you need to pill and 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.480
 In any case, it's really just about it 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.610
 that here now that you wet and 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.980
 rotten wood could pose with 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.510
 dark wood that means you take 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.120
 just her dark wood and light wood 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.560
 and that's how it works here among each other 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.660
 means the dark wood comes to the water 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.300
 pure and the bright on top and then 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.280
 from the very cool effect is about 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.370
 demonstrate 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.440
 good that his number four is one 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.910
 Fountains and wells are very big 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.450
 because I never would have found now 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.830
 designs are built and you know them 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.320
 perhaps specifically he stands 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.380
 right at the entrance of demenz ev aquapark 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.030
 which we have built recently 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.980
 that is if now have this poland 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.310
 you do not want to build it then 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.980
 but just go to uk city ​​2014 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:06.450
 behind the mcv aquapark and there finds 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:08.629
 her this well and looks very cool 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.759
 like I think 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:13.589
 Okay, let's move on to the last one 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:15.749
 that also looks very unspectacular 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:17.460
 but it is really cool and that is 

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:20.819
 I know it then I realize go 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.169
 just out of the shape and then 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:26.389
 you can see that a bit better and 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:28.979
 Although the son is you want to button and 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:31.259
 that was such a highlight that the 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:34.439
 to build clean and that are quite 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:36.689
 many items in a frame in it 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:39.539
 so to speak so I see that is a glass 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:43.279
 block in there in a frame so 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:46.680
 puts it in and then you just bet 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:49.039
 44 carpet floors in there and the button 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.059
 and how do you do that 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:53.669
 Of course that's always the one 

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:55.379
 most interesting question and indeed needs 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.110
 you first in frame and the 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:59.699
 sentences to the wall then have to now 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.809
 decide what you put in there 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:04.020
 We wanted to trust in that now 

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:06.659
 our class block and also ours 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.580
 carpet and best the red 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:10.589
 paint that a wall paint ago therefore 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.860
 Let's take that and then put it first 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:16.709
 once the glass blog in and you see 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.719
 who looks a little bit out there and I 

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:19.979
 Do not do that now because of that 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:22.349
 takes a bit long but I can 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:24.059
 explained and you have to get out of the 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:26.479
 because you have to first of all still in 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:28.680
 take frame 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:31.349
 I have somehow gone now 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.019
 and you need one more 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:35.849
 frame targets the block behind it and 

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:37.409
 set that and then you see it now 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:39.659
 Although nice but in the resin at the animation 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:40.259
 seen the salt still set a frame 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:41.370
 has been 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:43.199
 Now you just have to play the game 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.979
 leave that means we go out goes 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:47.519
 Clear again 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:51.689
 with a little luck you can then there 

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:53.699
 a new insert a new item yes 

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:55.110
 then it looks like it is 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:56.849
 everything in a frame in it 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.649
 You have to do this procedure a few times 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:00.149
 repeat and put the final 

00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:03.330
 button in and then you have yours 

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:05.920
 emergency button here that was the 1 0 23 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.840
 or I know are available 

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.690
 that was really cool time to go 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.730
 even if you liked that then 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:15.010
 is best a like or read one 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.420
 comment there and I thank you for 

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.980
 maybe we'll see each other now 

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.460
 in one or the other video again 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.460
 It's good
