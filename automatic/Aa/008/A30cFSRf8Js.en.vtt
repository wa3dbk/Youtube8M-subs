00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.710 
because we haven't brought anyone in
it's<00:02:59.670> adequate<00:02:59.970> enough<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.359> play<00:03:00.540> on<00:03:00.599> that

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
it's adequate enough to play on that

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.240 
it's adequate enough to play on that
left-hand<00:03:00.989> side<00:03:01.319> he's<00:03:01.709> not<00:03:01.829> gonna<00:03:01.980> be<00:03:02.069> able<00:03:02.129> to

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
play his best football he's not gonna be

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.319 
play his best football he's not gonna be
as<00:03:03.810> creative<00:03:04.079> and<00:03:04.730> frankly<00:03:05.730> he<00:03:06.120> said<00:03:06.269> this

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
as creative and frankly he said this

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:07.580 
as creative and frankly he said this
phrase<00:03:06.569> he's<00:03:06.780> having<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.019> play<00:03:07.170> down<00:03:07.379> when<00:03:07.500> he

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
phrase he's having to play down when he

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.020 
phrase he's having to play down when he
probably<00:03:07.859> is<00:03:08.069> one<00:03:08.609> of<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.730> most<00:03:08.790> creative

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
probably is one of the most creative

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.759 
probably is one of the most creative
players<00:03:09.450> in<00:03:09.629> that<00:03:09.659> scored<00:03:10.019> when<00:03:10.290> he<00:03:10.379> plays<00:03:10.590> in

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
players in that scored when he plays in

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.470 
players in that scored when he plays in
the<00:03:10.799> right<00:03:11.010> position<00:03:11.400> so<00:03:11.790> overall<00:03:12.090> I'm<00:03:12.299> not

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
the right position so overall I'm not

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.119 
the right position so overall I'm not
happy<00:03:12.659> about<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:13.170> I<00:03:13.379> don't<00:03:13.769> think<00:03:13.829> it<00:03:13.980> will

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
happy about that I don't think it will

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.390 
happy about that I don't think it will
be<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.280> game<00:03:14.489> bag<00:03:14.790> for<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.060> girls<00:03:15.269> I<00:03:15.480> think<00:03:15.900> um

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
be a game bag for the girls I think um

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.530 
be a game bag for the girls I think um
there<00:03:17.400> may<00:03:17.489> be<00:03:17.519> one<00:03:17.730> or<00:03:17.790> two<00:03:17.879> girls<00:03:18.120> in<00:03:18.299> it<00:03:18.449> I

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
there may be one or two girls in it I

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.420 
there may be one or two girls in it I
think<00:03:19.049> ice<00:03:19.139> we're<00:03:19.319> going<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.500> win<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.709> 2-1<00:03:19.980> I

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
think ice we're going to win it 2-1 I

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.189 
think ice we're going to win it 2-1 I
reckon<00:03:20.790> Giroux<00:03:21.090> could<00:03:21.329> gap<00:03:21.540> grabbed<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:21.930> brace

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
reckon Giroux could gap grabbed a brace

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.050 
reckon Giroux could gap grabbed a brace
and<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.500> pixel<00:03:22.829> data<00:03:23.010> or<00:03:23.250> school<00:03:23.459> score<00:03:23.910> for
