00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.410 

for<00:01:03.589> cranial<00:01:04.009> designers<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.820> be<00:01:04.970> here<00:01:05.210> I<00:01:05.239> think

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
for cranial designers to be here I think

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.340 
for cranial designers to be here I think
it's<00:01:05.900> kind<00:01:06.439> of<00:01:06.619> a<00:01:06.770> unique<00:01:07.450> occasion<00:01:08.450> and

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
it's kind of a unique occasion and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.100 
it's kind of a unique occasion and
because<00:01:10.009> London<00:01:10.460> is<00:01:10.700> like<00:01:11.030> right<00:01:11.689> now<00:01:11.840> is<00:01:11.990> the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
because London is like right now is the

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.940 
because London is like right now is the
capital<00:01:12.320> of<00:01:12.759> you<00:01:13.759> know<00:01:13.880> for<00:01:14.630> scouting<00:01:15.560> of

capital of you know for scouting of
young<00:01:16.670> designers<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:17.420> I<00:01:17.450> think<00:01:17.539> it's<00:01:17.899> really

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
young designers so I think it's really

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.440 
young designers so I think it's really
special<00:01:18.680> for<00:01:18.860> them<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.250> be<00:01:19.340> here<00:01:19.610> what<00:01:20.420> I

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
special for them to be here what I

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.570 
special for them to be here what I
always<00:01:20.720> say<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:21.049> designers<00:01:21.680> I<00:01:21.799> think<00:01:22.280> the

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
always say to designers I think the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.520 
always say to designers I think the
essential<00:01:23.119> part<00:01:23.360> that<00:01:23.570> seems<00:01:23.840> really<00:01:24.170> simple

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
essential part that seems really simple

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.249 
essential part that seems really simple
but<00:01:25.009> they<00:01:25.310> have<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:25.520> always<00:01:25.820> keep<00:01:26.210> in<00:01:26.420> mind<00:01:26.630> to

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
but they have to always keep in mind to

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.109 
but they have to always keep in mind to
keep<00:01:27.289> their<00:01:27.680> ideas<00:01:28.250> from<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:28.700> beginning<00:01:29.090> to

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
keep their ideas from the beginning to

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.410 
keep their ideas from the beginning to
the<00:01:29.240> end<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:29.780> follow<00:01:30.700> their<00:01:31.700> instinct<00:01:32.270> and

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
the end and follow their instinct and

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.169 
the end and follow their instinct and
their<00:01:33.170> ideas<00:01:33.619> and<00:01:33.649> fulfill<00:01:34.429> them<00:01:34.670> until<00:01:35.030> the

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
their ideas and fulfill them until the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:42.610 
their ideas and fulfill them until the
end<00:01:35.300> I<00:01:35.479> think<00:01:35.509> that's<00:01:35.899> very<00:01:35.990> important

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.200 

the<00:01:43.310> level<00:01:43.730> I<00:01:43.880> was<00:01:44.210> quite<00:01:44.630> impressed<00:01:45.910> in<00:01:46.910> a

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
the level I was quite impressed in a

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.710 
the level I was quite impressed in a
good<00:01:47.510> way<00:01:47.570> I<00:01:48.140> thought<00:01:48.860> there<00:01:49.070> would<00:01:49.220> be<00:01:49.250> more

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
good way I thought there would be more

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.840 
good way I thought there would be more
beginner<00:01:50.720> than<00:01:51.080> that<00:01:51.290> I<00:01:51.650> think<00:01:52.490> they<00:01:52.820> have

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
beginner than that I think they have

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.430 
beginner than that I think they have

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.770 

I<00:03:21.520> think<00:03:22.520> one<00:03:22.640> of<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.820> great<00:03:23.000> things<00:03:23.030> now<00:03:23.540> with

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
I think one of the great things now with

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.230 
I think one of the great things now with
fashion<00:03:24.200> scout<00:03:24.500> is<00:03:24.770> it's<00:03:25.370> got<00:03:25.580> an<00:03:25.700> established

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
fashion scout is it's got an established

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.370 
fashion scout is it's got an established
home<00:03:26.540> here<00:03:27.020> and<00:03:27.550> being<00:03:28.550> part<00:03:28.940> of<00:03:29.240> that<00:03:29.300> and<00:03:29.780> the

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
home here and being part of that and the

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.650 
home here and being part of that and the
international<00:03:31.190> quality<00:03:31.430> that<00:03:31.940> fashion<00:03:32.390> Scout

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
international quality that fashion Scout

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.390 
international quality that fashion Scout
has<00:03:32.930> I<00:03:33.140> think<00:03:33.500> it's<00:03:33.620> a<00:03:33.680> really<00:03:33.860> good<00:03:33.980> match

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
has I think it's a really good match

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.910 
has I think it's a really good match
because<00:03:35.090> obviously<00:03:35.690> with<00:03:36.290> fashion<00:03:36.650> scout

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
because obviously with fashion scout

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.160 
because obviously with fashion scout
you've<00:03:37.130> got<00:03:37.340> designers<00:03:38.060> from<00:03:38.180> all<00:03:38.480> over<00:03:38.930> the

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
you've got designers from all over the

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.770 
you've got designers from all over the
world<00:03:39.310> London<00:03:40.310> is<00:03:40.490> quite<00:03:40.790> international<00:03:41.600> but

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
world London is quite international but

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.170 
world London is quite international but
there's<00:03:41.930> quite<00:03:42.140> a<00:03:42.170> focus<00:03:42.830> as<00:03:43.100> well<00:03:43.160> on<00:03:43.790> the

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
there's quite a focus as well on the

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.540 
there's quite a focus as well on the
British<00:03:44.390> brands<00:03:44.990> burberry<00:03:45.530> mulberry<00:03:45.950> etc

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
British brands burberry mulberry etc

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.250 
British brands burberry mulberry etc
whereas<00:03:47.090> this<00:03:47.240> has<00:03:47.480> much<00:03:47.750> more<00:03:47.780> of<00:03:48.140> an

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
whereas this has much more of an

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.530 
whereas this has much more of an
international<00:03:48.620> focus<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.580> I<00:03:50.210> think<00:03:50.330> that's

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
international focus and I think that's

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.180 
international focus and I think that's
why<00:03:50.870> it's<00:03:51.020> such<00:03:51.200> a<00:03:51.260> perfect<00:03:51.560> match<00:03:51.950> for

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
why it's such a perfect match for

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.230 
why it's such a perfect match for
mercedes-benz<00:03:52.780> gear<00:03:53.780> fashion<00:03:54.200> days
