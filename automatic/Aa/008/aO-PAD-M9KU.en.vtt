with your charcoal bricks so you put
about<00:00:18.510> eight<00:00:19.609> what<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.640> think<00:00:20.880> I've<00:00:21.029> put<00:00:21.210> ten<00:00:21.510> in

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
about eight what I think I've put ten in

about eight what I think I've put ten in
ten<00:00:23.160> briquettes<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:23.880> there<00:00:24.800> so<00:00:25.800> it's<00:00:26.039> just

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
ten briquettes in there so it's just

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.009 
ten briquettes in there so it's just
quite<00:00:26.369> economical<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:27.240> because<00:00:27.599> if<00:00:27.930> you

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
quite economical this because if you

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.300 
quite economical this because if you

wondering it is safe to put these and

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.890 
wondering it is safe to put these and
cob<00:02:23.560> barbecues<00:02:24.130> on<00:02:24.400> top<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.820> tables<00:02:25.300> like<00:02:25.540> this

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
cob barbecues on top of tables like this

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.290 
cob barbecues on top of tables like this
obviously<00:02:26.830> in<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.340> garden<00:02:27.670> don't<00:02:27.880> take<00:02:28.150> them

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
obviously in the garden don't take them

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.600 
obviously in the garden don't take them
inside<00:02:28.690> because<00:02:28.720> that's<00:02:29.650> dangerous<00:02:29.920> with<00:02:30.430> the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
inside because that's dangerous with the

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.840 
inside because that's dangerous with the
fumes<00:02:31.150> but<00:02:32.110> yeah<00:02:32.650> it<00:02:32.800> isn't<00:02:32.980> perfectly<00:02:33.580> safe

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
fumes but yeah it isn't perfectly safe

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.630 
fumes but yeah it isn't perfectly safe
to<00:02:34.090> put<00:02:34.420> them<00:02:34.570> on<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.900> table<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:36.460> heat

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
to put them on the table and the heat

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.990 
to put them on the table and the heat
won't<00:02:36.850> transfer<00:02:37.390> through<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:37.960> table<00:02:38.410> so

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
won't transfer through to the table so

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.610 
won't transfer through to the table so
so<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.060> can<00:02:40.270> do<00:02:40.450> that<00:02:40.690> no<00:02:41.020> problem

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
so you can do that no problem

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.010 
so you can do that no problem
so<00:02:42.250> that's<00:02:42.430> cooking<00:02:42.670> away<00:02:42.880> nicely<00:02:43.210> now<00:02:43.600> and
