00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.830 
figured that out but yeah I did that
because<00:02:11.660> it's<00:02:12.920> kind<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.040> boring<00:02:14.310> seeing<00:02:15.030> well

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
because it's kind of boring seeing well

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.600 
because it's kind of boring seeing well
in<00:02:15.959> my<00:02:15.989> opinion<00:02:16.140> it's<00:02:16.650> kind<00:02:16.860> of<00:02:16.920> boring<00:02:17.099> seeing

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
in my opinion it's kind of boring seeing

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.610 
in my opinion it's kind of boring seeing
the<00:02:17.760> same<00:02:17.940> guns<00:02:18.270> that<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.599> can<00:02:18.810> see<00:02:19.170> all<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
the same guns that you can see all the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.400 
the same guns that you can see all the
time<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:21.180> think<00:02:21.989> it's<00:02:22.140> kind<00:02:22.349> of

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
time and I think it's kind of

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.770 
time and I think it's kind of
interesting<00:02:22.620> seeing<00:02:23.160> all<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:24.000> whole<00:02:24.480> bunch<00:02:24.660> of

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
interesting seeing all a whole bunch of

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.490 
interesting seeing all a whole bunch of
different<00:02:24.840> types<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.590> camos<00:02:26.129> and<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.840> just

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
different types of camos and so I just

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.430 
different types of camos and so I just
made<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.950> green<00:02:29.370> one<00:02:29.550> over<00:02:29.879> the<00:02:30.000> red<00:02:30.150> tiger<00:02:30.629> with

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
made a green one over the red tiger with

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.890 
made a green one over the red tiger with
a<00:02:31.470> cluttered<00:02:31.890> fraction<00:02:32.340> if<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:33.450> wanted<00:02:33.810> to

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
a cluttered fraction if you wanted to

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.080 
a cluttered fraction if you wanted to
torial<00:02:34.319> I<00:02:34.379> can<00:02:34.590> do<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:34.860> but<00:02:35.069> it's<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.459> final<00:02:35.879> cut

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090
