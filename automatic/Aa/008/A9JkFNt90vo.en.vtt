00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.980
 new to us from kids that from 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.360
 stacy stewart or before you start the 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.740
 pokemon legend of today without more 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.210
 I would like to thank you for these 8,000 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.520
 subscribers we've got 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.470
 recently and nothing are going to happen to the 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.910
 legend well before you should know that the 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.710
 village song the band hides 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.990
 enough mysteries one and I said that 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.480
 it was that it made people commit suicide 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.700
 in short thing that I do not believe but good 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.079
 state let's say investigating enough 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.460
 this song the band people 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.140
 today tell you that you do not plan to bring 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.430
 mystery but good we have reached the 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.560
 Another thousand subscribers is a series 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.960
 quite I liked it and I'll teach you a 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.700
 series of hidden waves this you can 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.020
 check yourselves using 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.270
 any audio editing software 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.800
 like adobe audition or such good me without 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.470
 more I have taken this internet video 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.120
 because I have no fucking idea to use my 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.230
 audition or anything but for what I have 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.850
 said is quite real and I have seen 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.230
 enough videos and videos even in the 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.660
 which show the screen and how 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.300
 they did without retouching absolutely nothing 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.980
 so we're going there well, you're going to see a 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.420
 image of how in the frequencies I'm 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.070
 let's say that the audio peaks are 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.990
 that you record videos if you are videos 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.220
 open it that are the audio spikes below 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.590
 of the time ring a series appears 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.229
 of peaks not as we say some rods 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.400
 that according to the intensity of the sound is 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.000
 higher more 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.160
 you will see clearly in the frequency 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.770
 a ghost and it's not just going to be that, not what 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.240
 you are going to see shortly I also think 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.100
 is in the normal little song either in 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.190
 I cut the band saying it because 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.630
 the video lasts 10 minutes and not only you go 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.280
 to see a goes then not only will you see 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.720
 a taste and I think you're going to come out 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.000
 here learning to speak one and all 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.370
 because you are going to have to speak one and 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.980
 this of the 11 is going to take me to do 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.750
 a question this song has a 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.340
 first generation because you because 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.350
 they are in the first generation not 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.729
 I remember that there was no pokemon 11 that 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.860
 a second generation appears because 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.840
 they are written because they have been written in 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.430
 one does not know to me it gives me enough to think 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.930
 but good 321 what name more or less in 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.060
 Attentive to what you are going to see 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.890
 continuation is worth if you notice it goes to 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.070
 look like a goal you know golf is 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.110
 graphic egos the sprite of goes of the 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.720
 mother coupon that appears in 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.850
 in pokémon in red and blue pokémon and 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.250
 yellow look there is not I'm you 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.900
 cheating are the audio frequencies 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.130
 You can buy it yourselves with 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.230
 any audio editing software 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.700
 it's not something that I want to cheat you 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.350
 no and now attention with what is going to 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.580
 appear next because I think that 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.740
 will give us enough to talk about 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.600
 attention is guys attention here change 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.580
 the way you see he looks a bit the cut 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.560
 that says it lasts 10 minutes this whole 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.090
 but good as I do not rent at all 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.030
 by psuv and two minutes now it appears 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:44.490
 voice but it appears written in one the 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:46.960
 next words live lav and naut 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.660
 come out now 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.120
 I do not know I do not know what to think these guys 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.760
 the truth that it is something quite dark 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.740
 let's say because I tell you that as I have already 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.110
 said before the 11 did not appear until 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.340
 the second generation but this song 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.140
 appears in the first games 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.730
 generation people the band and some of 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.590
 these and good of course appear little 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.000
 ammunition but I can lose you leaf and the 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.380
 that you tell me today in we can occupied 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.210
 green leaf you can get a one chip 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.860
 but a little more red and green leaf is 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.990
 the arch 7 with which we take a red and 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.940
 blue red and blue and yellow and green 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.440
 obviously not starace 7 and we can 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.060
 capture because it monde the second 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.670
 generation is that this is something quite 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.200
 quite pretty flip the truth and 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.670
 good because for the first 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.380
 I'm going to leave them at the end of the 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.740
 bid the alphabet no and you can be 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.110
 stopping the video and as I say to the 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.000
 time to stop the video so you can take 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.980
 your own conclusions but good 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.660
 in case the one that disks while and that nothing 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.770
 if you liked left I like it and 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.210
 many times for these eight thousand 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.770
 subscribers and so let's ask the 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.770
 10,000 until next time
