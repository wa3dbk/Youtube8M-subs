00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.039 
with only two people aboard a personal
watercraft<00:01:15.549> so<00:01:16.450> you<00:01:16.510> can<00:01:16.659> give<00:01:16.810> up<00:01:16.930> the

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
watercraft so you can give up the

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.600 
watercraft so you can give up the
thought<00:01:17.290> of<00:01:17.440> pulling<00:01:17.650> any<00:01:17.860> one<00:01:18.070> at<00:01:18.190> all

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
thought of pulling any one at all

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.940 
thought of pulling any one at all
but<00:01:19.390> you<00:01:19.540> can<00:01:19.750> of<00:01:19.869> course<00:01:19.900> add<00:01:20.320> a<00:01:20.380> plastic

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
but you can of course add a plastic

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.890 
but you can of course add a plastic
extension<00:01:21.490> to<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.700> back<00:01:21.909> that<00:01:21.940> miraculously

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
extension to the back that miraculously

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.260 
extension to the back that miraculously
transforms<00:01:23.619> the<00:01:23.799> spark<00:01:24.130> into<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:24.729> three<00:01:25.030> person

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
transforms the spark into a three person

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.969 
transforms the spark into a three person
watercraft<00:01:26.020> voila

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
watercraft voila

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.539 
watercraft voila
and<00:01:27.280> when<00:01:27.909> you<00:01:28.030> do<00:01:28.180> this<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:30.159> add<00:01:30.340> an

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
and when you do this you add an

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.929 
and when you do this you add an
additional<00:01:31.090> six<00:01:31.420> hundred<00:01:31.780> dollars<00:01:32.170> um<00:01:33.130> wait<00:01:33.880> a

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
additional six hundred dollars um wait a

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.390 
additional six hundred dollars um wait a
sec<00:01:34.270> here<00:01:34.540> you're<00:01:34.990> gonna<00:01:35.080> want<00:01:35.170> some<00:01:35.470> storage

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
sec here you're gonna want some storage

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.420 
sec here you're gonna want some storage
right<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:38.140> spark<00:01:38.439> starts<00:01:38.799> with<00:01:38.950> less<00:01:39.189> than<00:01:39.340> a

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
right the spark starts with less than a

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.090 
right the spark starts with less than a
half<00:01:39.670> gallon<00:01:40.150> of<00:01:40.240> storage<00:01:40.750> just<00:01:41.619> about<00:01:41.830> enough

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
half gallon of storage just about enough

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
more fuel to the fire but the spark is

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.699 
more fuel to the fire but the spark is

you go side by side from a straight cost
perspective<00:03:15.900> yeah<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:17.190> CDU<00:03:17.580> spark<00:03:17.970> is

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
perspective yeah the CDU spark is

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.140 
perspective yeah the CDU spark is
slightly<00:03:18.390> less<00:03:18.870> expensive<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.830> should<00:03:20.580> be<00:03:20.730> it

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
slightly less expensive it should be it

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
everything really I'm pretty sure I see

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.100 
everything really I'm pretty sure I see
why<00:03:28.560> it's<00:03:28.709> priced<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.190> little<00:03:29.220> less<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.540> also

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
why it's priced a little less and also

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.960 
why it's priced a little less and also
who's<00:03:31.500> going<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.709> pay<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:31.860> price<00:03:31.980> for<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.550> you

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
who's going to pay the price for it you

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.280 
who's going to pay the price for it you
think<00:03:33.900> not

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
think not
