it up and get to the package here

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.960 
it up and get to the package here
they're<00:00:28.680> gonna<00:00:28.800> be<00:00:29.010> really<00:00:29.189> quite<00:00:29.490> excited

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
they're gonna be really quite excited

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.359 
they're gonna be really quite excited
I'm<00:00:30.150> quite<00:00:30.420> sure<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:31.050> very<00:00:31.650> lightweight<00:00:31.920> as

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
I'm quite sure a very lightweight as

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.270 
I'm quite sure a very lightweight as
well<00:00:32.480> obviously<00:00:33.480> all<00:00:33.719> aircraft<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.800> this

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
well obviously all aircraft of this

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.940 
well obviously all aircraft of this
nature<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:36.180> as<00:00:36.390> light<00:00:36.630> as<00:00:36.660> possible<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.530> it's

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
nature is as light as possible so it's

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.619 
nature is as light as possible so it's
not<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.190> heavy<00:00:38.430> box<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.910> cast<00:00:39.149> around<00:00:39.329> or

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
not a heavy box to cast around or

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.250 
not a heavy box to cast around or
anything<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:40.050> that

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
anything like that

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.069 
anything like that
so<00:00:40.469> let's<00:00:40.980> put<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.309> aside<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.879> get<00:00:42.510> into<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
so let's put it aside and get into the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.260 
so let's put it aside and get into the
contents<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.129> look<00:00:44.550> at<00:00:44.670> those<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> bit<00:00:45.059> more

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
contents and look at those a bit more

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.260 
contents and look at those a bit more
closely<00:00:46.190> now<00:00:47.190> with<00:00:47.460> everything<00:00:47.850> out<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
closely now with everything out on the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.990 
closely now with everything out on the
table<00:00:48.539> here<00:00:49.010> it's<00:00:50.010> easy<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.460> get<00:00:50.610> carried<00:00:50.820> away

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
table here it's easy to get carried away

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.150 
table here it's easy to get carried away
and<00:00:51.420> look<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.350> helicopter<00:00:52.680> but

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
and look just at the helicopter but

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.100 
and look just at the helicopter but
there's<00:00:53.370> more<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.820> package<00:00:54.270> than<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:55.020> a

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
there's more to this package than just a

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.479 
there's more to this package than just a
helicopter<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.710> I'm<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.160> set<00:00:56.370> that

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
helicopter so I'm just going to set that

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.880 
helicopter so I'm just going to set that
aside<00:00:56.640> now<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.079> say<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.500> going

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
aside now I have to say that going

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.099 
aside now I have to say that going
straight<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> handbook<00:01:00.180> isn't<00:01:00.660> really

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
straight to the handbook isn't really

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.569 
straight to the handbook isn't really
something<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.710> normally<00:01:01.829> do<00:01:02.309> with<00:01:02.460> these

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
something that I normally do with these

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.579 
something that I normally do with these
videos<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.149> have<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.449> say<00:01:03.629> having<00:01:04.320> had

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
videos but I have to say having had

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.200 
videos but I have to say having had
first-hand<00:01:04.979> experience<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.760> flying<00:01:05.909> this

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
first-hand experience of flying this

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.010 
first-hand experience of flying this
helicopter

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
helicopter

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.899 
helicopter
I<00:01:07.049> found<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.680> handbook<00:01:08.100> particularly

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
I found the handbook particularly

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.539 
I found the handbook particularly
helpful<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.750> not<00:01:10.560> only<00:01:10.830> does<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.010> give<00:01:11.280> you

when you actually get into the flying of
the<00:01:47.369> helicopter<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.180> found<00:01:48.720> them<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:49.049> really

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the helicopter I found them to be really

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.380 
the helicopter I found them to be really
quite<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> challenge<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.850> enjoyed

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
quite a challenge and that I enjoyed

quite a challenge and that I enjoyed
very<00:01:51.689> much<00:01:51.890> getting<00:01:52.890> involved<00:01:53.549> with<00:01:53.610> them

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
very much getting involved with them

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
also included with the helicopter is

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.219 
also included with the helicopter is
this<00:01:58.649> great<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.280> like<00:01:59.969> polly<00:02:00.240> charger<00:02:00.899> it's<00:02:01.110> a

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
this great and like polly charger it's a

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.560 
this great and like polly charger it's a
mains<00:02:01.439> charger<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.579> basically<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.299> plug

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
mains charger that basically you plug

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.929 
mains charger that basically you plug
the<00:02:03.810> main<00:02:04.229> battery<00:02:04.710> for<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.979> helicopter<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.700> -

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
the main battery for the helicopter in -

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.380 
the main battery for the helicopter in -
it's<00:02:06.719> very<00:02:06.930> easy<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.920> use<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.849> get<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.149> long

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
it's very easy to use you get a long

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.630 
it's very easy to use you get a long
wire<00:02:09.690> with<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.739> don't<00:02:10.950> actually<00:02:11.190> have

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
wire with it so you don't actually have

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.040 
wire with it so you don't actually have
to<00:02:11.700> take<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.420> battery<00:02:12.569> out<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
to take the battery out of the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.580 
to take the battery out of the
helicopter

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
helicopter

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.640 
helicopter
and<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.970> can<00:02:15.180> hook<00:02:15.599> it<00:02:15.780> up<00:02:15.900> with<00:02:15.930> no<00:02:16.349> problem

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
and you can hook it up with no problem

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.250 
and you can hook it up with no problem
at<00:02:16.800> all<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.190> found<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.880> very<00:02:17.910> easy<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.660> use<00:02:19.020> and

I<00:03:08.340> found<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:09.209> very<00:03:09.720> easy<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.470> intuitive<00:03:10.769> to

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
I found it very easy and intuitive to

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.690 
I found it very easy and intuitive to
use<00:03:12.230> ok<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:13.290> we're<00:03:13.650> on<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.220> main<00:03:14.549> event

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
use ok so we're on to the main event

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.720 
use ok so we're on to the main event
itself<00:03:15.180> which<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.599> the<00:03:15.930> helicopter<00:03:16.680> now<00:03:16.830> I've

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
itself which is the helicopter now I've

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.580 
itself which is the helicopter now I've
actually<00:03:18.000> really<00:03:18.540> liked<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.870> scale<00:03:19.200> of<00:03:19.380> this

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
actually really liked the scale of this

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.360 
actually really liked the scale of this
it<00:03:20.519> been<00:03:20.820> so<00:03:21.090> big<00:03:21.450> it's<00:03:22.350> actually<00:03:22.680> very<00:03:23.160> good

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
it been so big it's actually very good

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.240 
it been so big it's actually very good
for<00:03:23.670> beginners<00:03:24.170> because<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.500> smaller<00:03:26.010> their

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
for beginners because the smaller their

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.979 
for beginners because the smaller their
helicopter<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:27.030> more<00:03:27.239> twitchy<00:03:27.600> and

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
helicopter the more twitchy and

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.860 
helicopter the more twitchy and
sensitive<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.709> inputs<00:03:29.370> they<00:03:29.640> are<00:03:29.850> but<00:03:30.359> you

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
sensitive to inputs they are but you

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.300 
sensitive to inputs they are but you
don't<00:03:31.049> have<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.410> quite<00:03:31.620> so<00:03:31.799> much<00:03:31.920> with<00:03:32.130> this

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
don't have that quite so much with this

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.720 
don't have that quite so much with this
now<00:03:33.350> it's<00:03:34.350> not<00:03:34.530> so<00:03:34.769> big<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.100> you<00:03:35.190> can't<00:03:35.430> fly

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
now it's not so big that you can't fly

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.729 
now it's not so big that you can't fly
it<00:03:35.790> indoors<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.420> course<00:03:36.660> you<00:03:36.780> will<00:03:36.930> need<00:03:37.079> a<00:03:37.350> bit

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
it indoors of course you will need a bit

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.130 
it indoors of course you will need a bit
of<00:03:37.890> space<00:03:38.160> but<00:03:38.700> particularly<00:03:39.690> if<00:03:39.750> you've<00:03:39.900> got

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
of space but particularly if you've got

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.140 
of space but particularly if you've got
an<00:03:40.260> indoor<00:03:40.980> flight<00:03:41.250> club<00:03:41.519> near<00:03:41.700> you<00:03:41.730> that

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
an indoor flight club near you that

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.240 
an indoor flight club near you that
would<00:03:42.569> be<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.720> perfect<00:03:43.290> place<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.500> start<00:03:43.769> with

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
would be the perfect place to start with

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.849 
would be the perfect place to start with
this<00:03:44.459> now<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:45.269> is<00:03:45.450> 4-channel<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:46.530> what<00:03:46.709> does

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
this now it is 4-channel so what does

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.030 
this now it is 4-channel so what does
that<00:03:46.889> mean<00:03:47.810> essentially<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:49.200> have<00:03:49.410> control

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
that mean essentially you have control

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.460 
that mean essentially you have control
over<00:03:50.069> four<00:03:50.670> directions<00:03:51.329> of<00:03:51.480> flight<00:03:51.780> so<00:03:52.440> you

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
over four directions of flight so you

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.559 
over four directions of flight so you
have<00:03:52.829> the<00:03:53.069> speed<00:03:53.700> of<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:53.940> roads<00:03:54.150> ahead<00:03:54.269> which

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
have the speed of the roads ahead which

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.720 
have the speed of the roads ahead which
is<00:03:54.750> you<00:03:54.900> up<00:03:55.079> and<00:03:55.290> down<00:03:55.470> you've<00:03:56.100> got<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.400> earn

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
is you up and down you've got to earn

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.650 
is you up and down you've got to earn
the<00:03:57.420> side-to-side<00:03:57.989> motion<00:03:58.620> in<00:03:59.329> this<00:04:00.329> plane

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
the side-to-side motion in this plane

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.129 
the side-to-side motion in this plane
you<00:04:01.170> have<00:04:01.380> turning<00:04:02.220> nation<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.900> course

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
you have turning nation and of course

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.229 
you have turning nation and of course
you've<00:04:04.350> got<00:04:04.380> forwards<00:04:04.920> and<00:04:05.040> backwards<00:04:05.280> so

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
you've got forwards and backwards so

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.940 
you've got forwards and backwards so
those<00:04:06.540> are<00:04:06.690> your<00:04:07.109> four<00:04:07.380> channels<00:04:07.799> of
