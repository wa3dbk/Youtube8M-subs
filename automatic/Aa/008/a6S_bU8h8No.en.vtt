00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.520
 hi to all with his two cups 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.630
 mobile.fr we are at mwc 2013 on the 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.799
 nvidia booth I will introduce you 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.660
 quickly the project thing that is a 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.699
 gaming console under android equipped with 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.170
 tegra 4 so what we have is good 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.300
 actually a device that builds around 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.400
 one of a joystick I showed you that 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.650
 of course with a 5 inch screen here that 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.620
 I see right after with a very design 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.970
 nice in the silver black tones here and 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.160
 of course the little touch of green 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.829
 typical nvidia on the back what is it 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.329
 we have a part of the controller 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.379
 hand on the rest we will look at this we have 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.600
 two triggers we have some ports here 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.420
 dondon mini hdmi etc etc so not bad 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.190
 of things microsd this kind of elements 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.960
 it is a controller that is quite heavy 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.749
 for now but that allows shots 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.749
 to hold especially not to have any 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:57.760
 worries when the screen is open since 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:59.350
 the screen is very light so finally 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.449
 here you put it here there is no 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.639
 imbalance problem then at the level 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.000
 of the joystick that is what we have 

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:08.440
 here classic keys y to b and c 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.960
 here we have a small step of 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.330
 directional and finally and there two 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.490
 controllers for thumbs 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.770
 in the middle we have the buttons we will say 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.360
 classic android here all around the 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.770
 volume management the starlet was a 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.050
 little bit different also 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.720
 and there in the middle in the middle the button that 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:30.310
 will launch report all the party 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.050
 device gaming here we have the high 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.280
 speakers with a nice system 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.810
 it's small speakers and 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.130
 finally to strengthen the bass one 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.110
 has a whole system in the controller 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.180
 integrated that helps strengthen all that 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.010
 and it's true we launched 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.570
 sound sequences or waiting for me 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.340
 really good a little more bass 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.840
 were rather nice then 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.670
 then of course it's a touch screen 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.200
 we can use like that android side 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.910
 it's not exciting because finally 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.080
 seduced android basic 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.220
 we will not necessarily go there 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.790
 in but you can for example 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.570
 download games on the playstation 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.400
 will work well but what is more 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.400
 interesting of course is to access 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.590
 the tegra zone to the whole area 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.840
 of the device so with both the 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.640
 news of the tegra zone of the games is 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.980
 also something we're not going 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.040
 to be able to see who is there 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.880
 which is streaming games via the pc and 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.160
 it 's something will not hurt 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.230
 talk cloud gaming wifi it works 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.780
 it will work quite well and that we 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.880
 will see at the exit of the device just 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.130
 show you one or two games very 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.840
 quickly so there we have some small 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.040
 games that are optimized tegra 4 and who 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.060
 really do very well 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.330
 for example here riptide 2 hockey that is 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.220
 following number one and you'll see that 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.220
 makes really very very well 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.560
 this is me what I discover 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.390
 here and there it is we see effects 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.920
 shadows that we see on the sides when 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.380
 I pass below certain elements 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.350
 we see arms of course everything is very very 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.420
 cops very much optimized for use to 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.160
 the joystick and that's really it 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.080
 really beautiful and so it's 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.800
 games that finally render that will make very 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.990
 very well on tegra terminals 4 which 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.630
 of course will be as pretty on on 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.310
 other devices like tegra May 3 which 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.770
 will still be less here on water 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.920
 on other chips is so here that's it 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:37.970
 has the little game ridge just you in 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:41.600
 show another very quickly walking 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.890
 care ok that's with the club could 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.300
 stop tomorrow 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.010
 and so then this is a the device 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.680
 should arrive in the second quarter 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.290
 this year we did not say depressed 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.640
 should be quite high but but there 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.670
 you read a fairly aggressive policy 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.590
 so we'll see that by here by a few 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.320
 in a while I'll go 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.850
 quickly see this game and then we will have 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.960
 finished me I think that this is a 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.670
 device that is that is very 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:13.620
 interesting a good little controller 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.620
 so of course it will not replace ok 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.810
 is this me I also discover 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:39.240
 I can not see her picking up my 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:40.890
 good kate point that's a game of a 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.560
 zombie game I was taking a little 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.730
 little like that so see her I can I 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.230
 can turn like that it's enough 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:54.740
 that's ok it's good I understood how 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.740
 it works and ok 

00:04:57.239 --> 00:05:04.899
 here and its surroundings down that it's 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:06.909
 really it has a nice name with them with 

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:08.499
 the whole side here is the whole game side 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:10.689
 it's really nice 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:13.959
 we can see that it was for a small 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:16.059
 overview of the tegra tegra 4 project 

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:18.669
 China host who looks really 

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:20.229
 promising we can not wait to see what 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.149
 is worth at the exit including the side 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:26.009
 streaming on pc if you have any 

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:26.009
 questions do not hesitate to see you soon
