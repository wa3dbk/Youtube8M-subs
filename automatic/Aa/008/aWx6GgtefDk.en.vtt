foot<00:03:20.730> weird<00:03:21.540> about<00:03:21.660> on<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.900> truck<00:03:22.260> heard

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
foot weird about on the truck heard

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.650 
foot weird about on the truck heard
about<00:03:22.829> on<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.250> truck<00:03:23.579> to<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.850> board<00:03:24.060> not<00:03:24.569> on

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
about on the truck to the board not on

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.879 
about on the truck to the board not on
the<00:03:24.780> tail<00:03:24.989> doesn't<00:03:25.260> need<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.500> be<00:03:25.560> on<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.709> tail

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
the tail doesn't need to be on the tail

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.819 
the tail doesn't need to be on the tail
and<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.910> back<00:03:27.269> foot<00:03:27.510> made<00:03:28.500> about<00:03:28.620> three

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
and the back foot made about three

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.590 
and the back foot made about three
quarters<00:03:28.980> of<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.190> way<00:03:29.280> down<00:03:29.489> on<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.299> ground

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
quarters of the way down on the ground

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.059 
quarters of the way down on the ground
and<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.799> you<00:03:31.859> can<00:03:32.010> lift<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.370> up<00:03:32.840> high<00:03:33.950> all<00:03:34.950> right

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
and so you can lift it up high all right

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.199 
and so you can lift it up high all right
so<00:03:36.689> lift<00:03:37.689> it<00:03:38.099> practice<00:03:39.099> doing<00:03:39.340> 180s<00:03:39.879> with<00:03:40.030> it

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
so lift it practice doing 180s with it

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.720 
so lift it practice doing 180s with it
I'm<00:03:41.049> just<00:03:41.170> get<00:03:41.379> NAT<00:03:41.590> before<00:03:41.980> you<00:03:42.069> actually<00:03:42.280> do

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
I'm just get NAT before you actually do

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.679 
I'm just get NAT before you actually do
the<00:03:43.299> next<00:03:43.510> part<00:03:43.719> of<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:43.930> trick<00:03:44.139> which<00:03:45.040> is<00:03:45.689> then
