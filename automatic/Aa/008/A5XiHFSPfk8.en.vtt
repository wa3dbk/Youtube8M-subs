00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
they had a personal touch that it's you

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.330

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
they play and that's I think that's very

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.320 
they play and that's I think that's very
important<00:01:05.940> to<00:01:06.360> try<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:06.840> as<00:01:06.990> an<00:01:07.110> artist<00:01:07.470> that

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
important to try to do as an artist that

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.450 
important to try to do as an artist that
of<00:01:09.330> course<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:10.140> we<00:01:10.440> can<00:01:10.590> imitate<00:01:10.890> people<00:01:11.190> we

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
of course we we can imitate people we

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.620 
of course we we can imitate people we
like<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:13.280> but<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.759> we<00:01:14.970> really<00:01:15.210> it's

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
like and but and we really it's

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.969 
like and but and we really it's
important<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.229> we<00:01:16.320> say<00:01:16.470> something<00:01:16.680> that's

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
important that we say something that's

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.990 
important that we say something that's
unique<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.500> special<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.590> also<00:01:20.160> genuine<00:01:20.820> I

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
mean it can't be special just for the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.630 
mean it can't be special just for the
sake<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.330> being<00:01:25.020> different<00:01:28.250> yeah<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.280> do<00:01:29.430> like
