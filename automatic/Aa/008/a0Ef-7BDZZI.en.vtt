00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
okay so you can see we're now in the

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.500 
okay so you can see we're now in the
jailbreak<00:03:44.210> mode<00:03:45.310> some<00:03:46.310> funky<00:03:46.790> stuff<00:03:47.000> is

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
jailbreak mode some funky stuff is

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:57.370 
jailbreak mode some funky stuff is
happening

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:08.350 

and<00:03:58.270> on<00:03:59.270> the<00:03:59.360> screen<00:03:59.660> it's<00:03:59.840> already<00:04:00.170> done

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.990 

so<00:04:08.960> we'll<00:04:09.560> just<00:04:09.590> wait<00:04:09.920> for<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.310> jailbreak<00:04:10.550> to

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
so we'll just wait for the jailbreak to

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.970 
so we'll just wait for the jailbreak to
complete<00:04:11.480> on<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.780> iPad<00:04:12.170> as<00:04:12.380> you<00:04:12.470> can<00:04:12.590> see<00:04:12.800> all

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
complete on the iPad as you can see all

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.630 
complete on the iPad as you can see all
the<00:04:13.840> codes<00:04:14.840> going<00:04:15.200> through<00:04:15.500> it's<00:04:16.489> a<00:04:16.519> little

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
the codes going through it's a little

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.849 
the codes going through it's a little
bit<00:04:16.870> disconcerting<00:04:17.870> because<00:04:18.320> this<00:04:18.560> is<00:04:18.680> not

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
bit disconcerting because this is not

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.230 
bit disconcerting because this is not
what<00:04:19.040> you're<00:04:19.220> used<00:04:19.250> to<00:04:19.489> seeing<00:04:19.790> on<00:04:20.390> the<00:04:20.780> iPad

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
what you're used to seeing on the iPad

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.360 
what you're used to seeing on the iPad
but<00:04:23.240> this<00:04:23.450> is<00:04:23.600> just<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.990> jailbreak<00:04:24.500> doing<00:04:25.250> it

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
but this is just the jailbreak doing it

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:36.050 
but this is just the jailbreak doing it
to<00:04:25.490> work

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.200 

ok<00:04:36.630> now<00:04:36.870> that<00:04:37.530> jailbreak<00:04:38.070> is<00:04:38.250> completed<00:04:39.000> and

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
ok now that jailbreak is completed and

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:46.350 
ok now that jailbreak is completed and
it's<00:04:39.389> booting<00:04:39.930> up

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.140 

here<00:04:46.960> we<00:04:47.080> go

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:59.210 

so

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.340 

the<00:04:59.790> only<00:05:00.000> difference<00:05:00.240> between<00:05:01.080> a

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
the only difference between a

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.040 
the only difference between a
jailbreaking<00:05:02.280> broken<00:05:02.790> ipad<00:05:03.390> is<00:05:03.600> that<00:05:03.780> we've

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
jailbreaking broken ipad is that we've

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.860 
jailbreaking broken ipad is that we've
got<00:05:04.080> cydia<00:05:04.560> now<00:05:04.860> which<00:05:05.070> is<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.310> store<00:05:05.730> that<00:05:06.030> we

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
got cydia now which is the store that we

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.860 
got cydia now which is the store that we
can<00:05:07.140> download<00:05:08.900> alternative<00:05:09.900> apps<00:05:10.280> from<00:05:11.870> well

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
can download alternative apps from well

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.230 
can download alternative apps from well
from<00:05:13.140> a<00:05:13.950> source<00:05:14.220> outside<00:05:15.000> of<00:05:15.420> Apple<00:05:17.060> so<00:05:18.060> that's

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
from a source outside of Apple so that's

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.420 
from a source outside of Apple so that's
