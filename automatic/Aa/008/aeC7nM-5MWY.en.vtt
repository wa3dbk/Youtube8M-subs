they<00:01:36.360> heated<00:01:36.600> up<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.110> pasteurize<00:01:37.649> it

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
they heated up to pasteurize it

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.919 
they heated up to pasteurize it
so<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.459> had<00:01:38.729> 30<00:01:38.909> minutes<00:01:39.240> at<00:01:39.750> that

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
so the here that had 30 minutes at that

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:41.210 
so the here that had 30 minutes at that
point<00:01:40.229> thinking<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.709> add<00:01:40.830> some<00:01:41.069> of<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
point thinking and add some of the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.399 
point thinking and add some of the
enzymes<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.970> talk<00:01:42.179> to<00:01:42.360> start<00:01:42.569> to<00:01:42.689> separate<00:01:43.229> it

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
enzymes to talk to start to separate it

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.469 
enzymes to talk to start to separate it
out<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.860> they<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.159> get<00:01:44.310> them<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.970> solids

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
out so they can get them the solids

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.930 
out so they can get them the solids
separating<00:01:46.200> out<00:01:46.349> from<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.860> waist<00:01:47.369> up<00:01:47.729> the

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
separating out from the waist up the

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.029 
separating out from the waist up the
liquid<00:01:48.360> right<00:01:49.140> at<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.349> point<00:01:49.590> what<00:01:49.890> they're

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
liquid right at this point what they're

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.130 
liquid right at this point what they're
gonna<00:01:50.160> do<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.519> that<00:01:50.670> we<00:01:50.849> take<00:01:51.119> out<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.509> solids

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
gonna do is that we take out the solids

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.940 
gonna do is that we take out the solids
and<00:01:52.410> start<00:01:52.950> putting<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.340> solids<00:01:53.819> into<00:01:54.950> some

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
and start putting the solids into some

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.710 
and start putting the solids into some
kind<00:01:56.160> of<00:01:56.280> form<00:01:56.580> or<00:01:56.849> something<00:01:57.119> about<00:01:57.209> exactly

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
kind of form or something about exactly

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.650 
kind of form or something about exactly
sure<00:01:57.840> where<00:01:58.050> they<00:01:58.200> go<00:01:58.349> from<00:01:58.500> there<00:02:02.479> most<00:02:03.479> of

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
sure where they go from there most of

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.770 
sure where they go from there most of
the<00:02:04.580> liquid<00:02:05.580> stuff<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.330> they<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.450> have<00:02:06.690> to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
the liquid stuff and they just have to

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.410 
the liquid stuff and they just have to
saw<00:02:06.959> it<00:02:07.200> they<00:02:07.920> put<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.160> into<00:02:08.310> these<00:02:08.580> molds<00:02:08.879> over

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
saw it they put it into these molds over

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.619 
saw it they put it into these molds over
here<00:02:12.260> in<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.409> press<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.819> that<00:02:14.940> they<00:02:15.060> can<00:02:15.239> smash

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
here in a press so that they can smash

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.149 
here in a press so that they can smash
it<00:02:15.900> down<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.470> at<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.709> point<00:02:16.890> they're

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
it down and at that point they're

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.509 
it down and at that point they're
getting<00:02:17.400> more<00:02:17.640> liquid<00:02:18.209> out<00:02:19.040> they<00:02:20.040> leave<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.400> in

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
getting more liquid out they leave it in

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.509 
getting more liquid out they leave it in
the<00:02:20.580> press<00:02:20.790> for<00:02:21.000> about<00:02:21.090> four<00:02:21.540> or<00:02:21.569> five<00:02:21.900> hours

the<00:02:23.519> next<00:02:23.670> step<00:02:24.120> once<00:02:24.720> they've<00:02:24.930> kind<00:02:25.140> of

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
the next step once they've kind of

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.920 
the next step once they've kind of
smashed<00:02:25.590> all<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.190> liquid<00:02:26.430> out<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:27.450> to

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
smashed all of that liquid out is to

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.020 
smashed all of that liquid out is to
actually<00:02:27.989> put<00:02:28.409> it<00:02:28.500> into<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.830> salt<00:02:29.190> bath<00:02:29.489> it's
