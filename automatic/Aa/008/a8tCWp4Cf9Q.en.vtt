guys forever that I was going to be

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.089 
guys forever that I was going to be
doing<00:00:05.940> more<00:00:06.210> water<00:00:06.509> cooling<00:00:06.899> stuff<00:00:07.470> on<00:00:07.740> this

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
doing more water cooling stuff on this

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.549 
doing more water cooling stuff on this
channel<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.790> it<00:00:08.849> may<00:00:08.970> be<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.150> bit<00:00:09.360> late<00:00:09.630> but

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
channel and it may be a bit late but

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.310 
channel and it may be a bit late but
damn<00:00:10.889> it<00:00:11.040> later<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.759> better<00:00:12.000> than<00:00:12.420> never

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
damn it later is better than never

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.829 
damn it later is better than never
now<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:13.740> recently<00:00:14.400> took<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.849> look<00:00:15.089> here<00:00:15.360> at<00:00:15.509> the

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
now I recently took a look here at the

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.769 
now I recently took a look here at the
fan<00:00:16.109> texts<00:00:16.500> into<00:00:16.680> primo<00:00:17.340> case<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.029> how<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.510> can

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
fan texts into primo case and how it can

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.830 
fan texts into primo case and how it can
be<00:00:18.960> configured<00:00:20.119> incredibly<00:00:21.119> overkill<00:00:21.630> when

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
be configured incredibly overkill when

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.630 
be configured incredibly overkill when
it<00:00:21.960> comes<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.320> water<00:00:22.590> cooling<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.189> radiators

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
it comes to water cooling and radiators

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
going in this thing which happens to be

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.330 
going in this thing which happens to be
a<00:01:26.729> laying<00:01:27.420> DDC<00:01:28.110> pump<00:01:28.439> right<00:01:28.650> here<00:01:28.950> with<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
a laying DDC pump right here with the

PWM control and 12 volt circuit but as

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.539 
PWM control and 12 volt circuit but as
you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.369> see<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.729> pretty<00:01:33.150> ugly<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.520> not<00:01:35.520> a

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
you can see it's pretty ugly and not a

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.920 
you can see it's pretty ugly and not a
whole<00:01:35.790> lot<00:01:36.000> going<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.479> with<00:01:36.720> it

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
whole lot going on with it

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.870 
whole lot going on with it
this<00:01:37.439> would<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:38.130> know<00:01:38.220> fit<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.670> there<00:01:38.850> but

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
this would you know fit in there but

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.270 
this would you know fit in there but
it's<00:01:39.180> pretty<00:01:39.570> atrocious<00:01:40.560> when<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:40.979> comes<00:01:41.159> to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
it's pretty atrocious when it comes to

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.920 
it's pretty atrocious when it comes to
appearance<00:01:41.549> now<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.150> lot<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.390> companies<00:01:42.570> have

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
appearance now a lot of companies have

recognized that this is a very popular

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.580 
recognized that this is a very popular
pump<00:01:44.939> but<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.899> needs<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.170> little<00:01:46.380> bit<00:01:46.500> of

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
pump but that it needs a little bit of

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.139 
pump but that it needs a little bit of
work<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.430> we're<00:01:47.549> going<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> be<00:01:47.790> adding<00:01:48.060> a

needed to mount the reservoir combo to
that<00:02:04.409> now<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.619> do<00:02:04.740> recognize<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.280> there<00:02:05.579> are

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
that now I do recognize that there are

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.130 
that now I do recognize that there are
pumps<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.420> come<00:02:06.600> with<00:02:06.780> some<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.049> stuff

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
pumps that come with some of this stuff

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.139 
pumps that come with some of this stuff
pre-installed<00:02:07.920> but<00:02:08.160> because<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.700> have<00:02:08.910> some

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
pre-installed but because I have some

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.180 
pre-installed but because I have some
pretty<00:02:09.420> specific<00:02:09.690> needs<00:02:10.289> on<00:02:10.500> what<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.739> need<00:02:10.979> for

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
pretty specific needs on what I need for

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.440 
pretty specific needs on what I need for
this<00:02:11.340> case<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.790> how<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:11.970> need<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.360> be

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
this case and how I need it to be

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.520 
this case and how I need it to be
configured

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
configured

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.240 
configured
had<00:02:13.740> decided<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.250> order<00:02:15.240> these<00:02:15.330> parts<00:02:15.600> myself

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
had decided to order these parts myself

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.110 
had decided to order these parts myself
individually<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.400> way<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.580> can<00:02:17.850> put<00:02:18.000> them

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
individually that way I can put them

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.820 
individually that way I can put them
together<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.630> way<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.780> want<00:02:19.170> knowing<00:02:19.680> that

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
together the way I want knowing that

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.980 
together the way I want knowing that
they're<00:02:19.950> going<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.130> fit<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.750> how<00:02:21.750> I'm<00:02:21.959> going

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
they're going to fit and how I'm going

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.260 
they're going to fit and how I'm going
to<00:02:22.230> be<00:02:22.410> configuring<00:02:23.370> this<00:02:23.490> case<00:02:23.760> especially

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
to be configuring this case especially

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.460 
to be configuring this case especially
when<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.450> comes<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.170> guess<00:02:25.290> what

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
when it comes to this so I guess what

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.600 
when it comes to this so I guess what
we're<00:02:25.560> going<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.709> do<00:02:25.860> now<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.220> I'm<00:02:26.340> just<00:02:26.370> going

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
we're going to do now is I'm just going

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.430 
we're going to do now is I'm just going
to<00:02:26.700> probably<00:02:27.120> time-lapse<00:02:27.810> or<00:02:27.990> do<00:02:28.080> some<00:02:28.260> b-roll

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
to probably time-lapse or do some b-roll

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.440 
to probably time-lapse or do some b-roll
footage<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.160> actual<00:02:29.310> installation<00:02:30.239> and

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
footage of the actual installation and

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.990 
footage of the actual installation and
then<00:02:31.140> we'll<00:02:31.350> talk<00:02:31.500> about<00:02:31.560> everything<00:02:32.400> at<00:02:32.790> the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
then we'll talk about everything at the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:03:36.770 
then we'll talk about everything at the
end

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.650 

well<00:03:37.780> there<00:03:38.050> we<00:03:38.140> go<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.470> Assembly<00:03:38.890> of<00:03:38.920> my

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
well there we go the Assembly of my

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.370 
well there we go the Assembly of my
blankey<00:03:40.660> cabe<00:03:41.140> its<00:03:41.530> power<00:03:43.080> well<00:03:44.080> it<00:03:44.170> kind<00:03:44.350> of

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
blankey cabe its power well it kind of

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.690 
blankey cabe its power well it kind of
looks<00:03:44.530> like<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.650> penis<00:03:44.890> pump<00:03:45.130> I'm<00:03:45.370> not<00:03:45.520> gonna

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
looks like a penis pump I'm not gonna

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.170 
looks like a penis pump I'm not gonna
lie

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
lie

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.970 
lie
and<00:03:47.170> you<00:03:47.260> know<00:03:47.350> this<00:03:47.470> thing<00:03:47.530> is<00:03:47.800> actually

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
and you know this thing is actually

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.970 
and you know this thing is actually
pretty<00:03:48.700> big<00:03:48.940> compared<00:03:49.420> to<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.570> case<00:03:49.870> in<00:03:50.290> fact

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
pretty big compared to the case in fact

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.210 
pretty big compared to the case in fact
you<00:03:51.940> can<00:03:52.090> see<00:03:52.300> right<00:03:52.510> there<00:03:53.070> compared<00:03:54.070> to<00:03:54.130> the

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
you can see right there compared to the

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.240 
you can see right there compared to the
case<00:03:54.430> it's<00:03:54.730> it's<00:03:55.540> pretty<00:03:55.720> big<00:03:55.990> but<00:03:56.710> it's

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
case it's it's pretty big but it's

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.740 
case it's it's pretty big but it's
actually<00:03:57.730> not<00:03:57.760> gonna<00:03:57.970> be<00:03:58.060> mounted<00:03:58.390> like<00:03:58.540> that

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
actually not gonna be mounted like that

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.620 
actually not gonna be mounted like that
it's<00:03:58.990> gonna<00:03:59.170> be<00:03:59.290> mounted<00:03:59.680> like<00:04:00.430> this<00:04:00.460> on<00:04:01.090> its

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
it's gonna be mounted like this on its

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.300 
it's gonna be mounted like this on its
side<00:04:01.900> I<00:04:02.200> know<00:04:02.680> what<00:04:02.800> you're<00:04:02.920> thinking<00:04:03.160> don't

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
side I know what you're thinking don't

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.920 
side I know what you're thinking don't
worry<00:04:03.430> it'll<00:04:03.820> all<00:04:04.060> make<00:04:04.090> sense<00:04:04.450> in<00:04:04.600> fact<00:04:04.780> this

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
worry it'll all make sense in fact this

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.390 
worry it'll all make sense in fact this
is<00:04:05.050> not<00:04:05.080> the<00:04:05.320> first<00:04:05.440> time<00:04:05.709> somebody<00:04:06.070> has<00:04:06.220> done

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
is not the first time somebody has done

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.730 
is not the first time somebody has done
that<00:04:06.550> in<00:04:06.700> this<00:04:06.880> case<00:04:07.090> I've<00:04:08.080> seen<00:04:08.260> a<00:04:08.320> couple<00:04:08.560> of

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
that in this case I've seen a couple of

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.010 
that in this case I've seen a couple of
build<00:04:08.950> lugs<00:04:09.190> and<00:04:09.720> several<00:04:10.720> people<00:04:10.870> have

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
build lugs and several people have

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.540 
build lugs and several people have
actually<00:04:11.410> mounted<00:04:11.740> this<00:04:11.860> thing<00:04:12.070> on<00:04:12.250> its<00:04:12.490> side

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
actually mounted this thing on its side

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.400 
actually mounted this thing on its side
down<00:04:13.030> here<00:04:13.060> in<00:04:13.360> the<00:04:13.450> bottom<00:04:13.600> of<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.870> case<00:04:14.050> and

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
down here in the bottom of the case and

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.440 
down here in the bottom of the case and
you<00:04:14.950> know<00:04:15.100> it's<00:04:15.670> really<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:16.030> only<00:04:16.060> way<00:04:16.330> it

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
you know it's really the only way it

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.840 
you know it's really the only way it
makes<00:04:16.660> sense<00:04:16.959> in<00:04:17.230> there<00:04:17.440> I<00:04:17.919> don't<00:04:18.459> like<00:04:18.640> to

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
makes sense in there I don't like to

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.060 
makes sense in there I don't like to
follow<00:04:19.150> suit<00:04:19.600> necessarily<00:04:20.350> or<00:04:20.470> copy<00:04:20.739> other

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
follow suit necessarily or copy other

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.159 
follow suit necessarily or copy other
people<00:04:21.549> but<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.540> people<00:04:22.660> who've<00:04:22.900> done<00:04:23.020> this

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
people but the people who've done this

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.420 
people but the people who've done this
before<00:04:23.350> me<00:04:23.620> have<00:04:23.710> figured<00:04:23.950> out<00:04:24.040> that<00:04:24.220> that

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
before me have figured out that that

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.120 
before me have figured out that that
makes<00:04:24.790> the<00:04:25.090> most<00:04:25.360> sense<00:04:25.890> assembly<00:04:26.890> on<00:04:27.010> this

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
makes the most sense assembly on this

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.740 
makes the most sense assembly on this
thing<00:04:27.310> is<00:04:27.430> extremely<00:04:27.580> easy<00:04:27.970> as<00:04:28.390> you<00:04:28.540> saw<00:04:28.690> the

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
thing is extremely easy as you saw the

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.290 
thing is extremely easy as you saw the
pump<00:04:29.140> it's<00:04:30.100> contained<00:04:30.460> inside<00:04:30.640> just<00:04:31.060> this

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
pump it's contained inside just this

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.409 
pump it's contained inside just this
plastic<00:04:31.750> housing<00:04:32.200> here<00:04:32.820> just<00:04:33.820> Hollow<00:04:34.030> it's

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
plastic housing here just Hollow it's

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.210 
plastic housing here just Hollow it's
nothing<00:04:34.720> more<00:04:34.900> than<00:04:35.140> you<00:04:35.560> know<00:04:35.710> a<00:04:35.860> clamshell

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
nothing more than you know a clamshell

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.220 
nothing more than you know a clamshell
that<00:04:36.610> goes<00:04:36.760> around<00:04:36.880> the<00:04:37.090> pump<00:04:37.270> itself<00:04:37.600> so

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
that goes around the pump itself so

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.670 
that goes around the pump itself so
we've<00:04:39.070> got<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:39.430> pump<00:04:39.940> inside<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.660> heat<00:04:41.410> sink

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
we've got the pump inside the heat sink

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.930 
we've got the pump inside the heat sink
down<00:04:41.830> here<00:04:42.100> these<00:04:42.280> pumps<00:04:42.580> actually<00:04:42.820> get

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
down here these pumps actually get

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.610 
down here these pumps actually get
pretty<00:04:43.120> damn<00:04:43.390> hot<00:04:43.690> so<00:04:43.930> there's<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.169> heat<00:04:44.350> sink

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
pretty damn hot so there's a heat sink

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.170 
pretty damn hot so there's a heat sink
even<00:04:44.770> a<00:04:44.950> thermal<00:04:45.280> pad<00:04:45.460> on<00:04:45.580> there<00:04:45.669> you<00:04:45.820> saw<00:04:45.970> get

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
even a thermal pad on there you saw get

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.820 
even a thermal pad on there you saw get
installed<00:04:46.630> so<00:04:47.200> that<00:04:47.350> the<00:04:47.440> heat<00:04:47.620> can<00:04:47.770> be

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
installed so that the heat can be

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.650 
installed so that the heat can be
radiated<00:04:48.490> out<00:04:48.669> of<00:04:48.820> the<00:04:48.910> bottom<00:04:49.210> rather<00:04:49.390> than

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
radiated out of the bottom rather than

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.510 
radiated out of the bottom rather than
dumping<00:04:49.840> all<00:04:50.110> that<00:04:50.290> heat<00:04:50.500> inside<00:04:50.890> the<00:04:51.040> loop<00:04:51.250> we

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
dumping all that heat inside the loop we

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.640 
dumping all that heat inside the loop we
got<00:04:52.060> palm<00:04:52.300> material<00:04:52.720> bits<00:04:52.900> power<00:04:53.110> top<00:04:53.440> here

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
got palm material bits power top here

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.680 
got palm material bits power top here
for<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.919> laying<00:04:54.130> DDC<00:04:54.640> and<00:04:54.880> then<00:04:55.390> we've<00:04:55.510> got

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
for the laying DDC and then we've got

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
for the laying DDC and then we've got
the<00:04:55.930> reservoir<00:04:56.830> mount<00:04:57.100> 150<00:04:57.850> millimeter<00:04:58.240> long

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
the reservoir mount 150 millimeter long

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.320 
the reservoir mount 150 millimeter long
reservoir<00:04:59.710> mount<00:04:59.950> for<00:05:00.280> the<00:05:00.310> top<00:05:00.640> of<00:05:00.850> that<00:05:01.150> if

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
reservoir mount for the top of that if

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.580 
reservoir mount for the top of that if
we<00:05:01.360> didn't<00:05:01.660> put<00:05:01.780> this<00:05:01.870> mount<00:05:02.110> on<00:05:02.260> there<00:05:02.410> than

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
we didn't put this mount on there than

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.920 
we didn't put this mount on there than
we<00:05:02.650> would<00:05:02.800> would<00:05:03.100> have<00:05:03.220> just<00:05:03.430> had<00:05:03.580> an<00:05:03.730> inlet<00:05:04.720> on

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
we would would have just had an inlet on

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.230 
we would would have just had an inlet on
the<00:05:05.110> top<00:05:05.320> and<00:05:05.500> an<00:05:05.620> outlet<00:05:06.039> right<00:05:06.070> here<00:05:06.250> but<00:05:07.090> now

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
the top and an outlet right here but now

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.180 
the top and an outlet right here but now
we<00:05:07.300> can<00:05:07.570> actually<00:05:07.930> have<00:05:08.080> the<00:05:08.350> multi<00:05:08.830> fitting

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
we can actually have the multi fitting

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.129 
we can actually have the multi fitting
up<00:05:09.310> here<00:05:09.460> on<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:09.610> top<00:05:09.789> this<00:05:09.970> is<00:05:10.030> actually<00:05:10.419> a

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
up here on the top this is actually a

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:12.540 
up here on the top this is actually a
different<00:05:11.379> top<00:05:11.560> that<00:05:11.800> I<00:05:11.830> put<00:05:12.069> on<00:05:12.249> here<00:05:12.490> that

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
different top that I put on here that

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.529 
different top that I put on here that
came<00:05:12.879> from<00:05:13.090> my<00:05:14.080> original<00:05:14.939> 900<00:05:15.939> D<00:05:16.060> build<00:05:16.330> where

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
came from my original 900 D build where

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:18.659 
came from my original 900 D build where
I<00:05:16.569> had<00:05:16.780> the<00:05:16.900> bits<00:05:17.080> power<00:05:17.319> single<00:05:18.249> tubular

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
I had the bits power single tubular

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.580 
I had the bits power single tubular
reservoir<00:05:19.120> normally<00:05:19.960> the<00:05:20.110> top<00:05:20.229> that's<00:05:20.469> on

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
reservoir normally the top that's on

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.529 
reservoir normally the top that's on
here<00:05:20.770> is<00:05:20.889> a<00:05:20.919> single<00:05:21.400> with<00:05:21.849> the<00:05:22.029> or<00:05:22.240> a<00:05:22.270> single

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
here is a single with the or a single

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.360 
here is a single with the or a single
fitting<00:05:22.930> on<00:05:23.020> the<00:05:23.110> top<00:05:23.289> but<00:05:23.800> because<00:05:24.039> I<00:05:24.129> need<00:05:24.279> to

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
fitting on the top but because I need to

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.209 
fitting on the top but because I need to
have<00:05:24.550> also<00:05:24.909> an<00:05:25.270> inlet<00:05:25.659> on<00:05:25.840> here<00:05:26.349> as<00:05:26.529> well<00:05:27.069> as<00:05:27.189> a

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:27.219 
have also an inlet on here as well as a

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:29.219 
have also an inlet on here as well as a
fill<00:05:27.520> port<00:05:27.729> I<00:05:27.999> went<00:05:28.270> ahead<00:05:28.330> and<00:05:28.509> put<00:05:28.629> my<00:05:28.659> multi

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
fill port I went ahead and put my multi

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.170 
fill port I went ahead and put my multi
fitting<00:05:29.770> top<00:05:29.979> on<00:05:30.159> there<00:05:30.310> so<00:05:30.520> as<00:05:30.759> you<00:05:30.879> can<00:05:30.999> see

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
fitting top on there so as you can see

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.510 
fitting top on there so as you can see
now<00:05:31.360> I've<00:05:31.930> got<00:05:32.139> options<00:05:32.409> but<00:05:33.189> yeah<00:05:33.279> this<00:05:33.460> is

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
now I've got options but yeah this is

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.040 
now I've got options but yeah this is
going<00:05:33.759> to<00:05:33.819> pretty<00:05:34.029> much<00:05:34.150> fill<00:05:34.539> up<00:05:34.719> the<00:05:34.900> whole

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
going to pretty much fill up the whole

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.200 
going to pretty much fill up the whole
bottom<00:05:35.439> of<00:05:35.499> the<00:05:35.560> case<00:05:35.800> down<00:05:36.069> there<00:05:36.310> but<00:05:36.999> you

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
bottom of the case down there but you

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.239 
bottom of the case down there but you
guys<00:05:37.509> get<00:05:37.719> an<00:05:37.810> idea<00:05:38.080> now<00:05:38.259> just<00:05:38.590> how<00:05:38.710> small<00:05:39.039> this

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:39.249 
guys get an idea now just how small this

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:41.879 
guys get an idea now just how small this
case<00:05:39.520> is<00:05:39.789> and<00:05:40.629> possibly<00:05:41.050> just<00:05:41.319> how<00:05:41.439> big<00:05:41.680> this

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
case is and possibly just how big this

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.529 
case is and possibly just how big this
thing<00:05:41.949> is<00:05:42.189> I<00:05:42.550> mean<00:05:42.879> I<00:05:42.939> guess<00:05:43.090> I<00:05:43.210> could<00:05:43.270> have

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
thing is I mean I guess I could have

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.869 
thing is I mean I guess I could have
found<00:05:43.750> an<00:05:44.020> even<00:05:44.319> smaller<00:05:44.620> tube<00:05:45.039> the<00:05:45.580> problem

00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:45.879 
found an even smaller tube the problem

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:49.140 
found an even smaller tube the problem
is<00:05:45.969> I<00:05:46.029> couldn't<00:05:46.330> find<00:05:46.569> the<00:05:46.750> DDC<00:05:47.729> top<00:05:48.729> kit<00:05:49.029> on

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
is I couldn't find the DDC top kit on

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.760 
is I couldn't find the DDC top kit on
here<00:05:49.360> with<00:05:49.509> the<00:05:49.629> 80<00:05:49.810> millimeter<00:05:50.379> res<00:05:50.620> that
