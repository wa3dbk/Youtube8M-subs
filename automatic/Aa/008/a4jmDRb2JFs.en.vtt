people out there but it's just the the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.820 
people out there but it's just the the
the<00:02:32.599> seems<00:02:33.599> a<00:02:33.720> little<00:02:33.900> flimsy<00:02:34.080> when<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:34.680> get

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830

they're<00:02:37.799> very<00:02:37.829> Japanese<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:38.670> would<00:02:39.000> say

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
they're very Japanese I would say

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.030

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
seems everything has been thought out

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.940 
seems everything has been thought out
before<00:02:45.840> they<00:02:45.930> put<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.319> there<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:46.709> there<00:02:46.860> was

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
and a really interesting kind of a

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.750 
and a really interesting kind of a
wooden<00:03:01.140> roof<00:03:01.709> thing<00:03:02.250> coming<00:03:02.730> down<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:05.430> explain

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
wooden roof thing coming down to explain

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.720 
wooden roof thing coming down to explain
but<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.889> one<00:03:07.889> thing<00:03:08.069> I<00:03:08.160> realized<00:03:08.430> about<00:03:08.639> is

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
but the one thing I realized about is

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.370 
but the one thing I realized about is
they<00:03:08.850> kept<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.150> toilet<00:03:09.510> apart<00:03:09.959> from<00:03:10.139> the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
they kept the toilet apart from the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.289 
they kept the toilet apart from the
washroom<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.220> that's<00:03:11.400> from<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:11.940> enough<00:03:12.150> room

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
I mean that's a big thing for some

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:14.930 
I mean that's a big thing for some
people<00:03:14.010> they<00:03:14.190> don't<00:03:14.280> need<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.579> have<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.730> toilet

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
or something but I thought that was what

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.030 
or something but I thought that was what
a<00:03:35.880> waste<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:36.239> space

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
a waste of space

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.520 
a waste of space
mmm<00:03:38.040> sink<00:03:38.519> not<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:38.910> good<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.299> bed<00:03:39.480> bed<00:03:40.410> is

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
mmm sink not that good the bed bed is

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.460 
mmm sink not that good the bed bed is
almost<00:03:40.769> like<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:41.069> sofa<00:03:41.760> couch<00:03:42.120> so<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.019> wouldn't

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
almost like a sofa couch so I wouldn't

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.770 
almost like a sofa couch so I wouldn't
even<00:03:43.560> call<00:03:43.739> it<00:03:43.859> a<00:03:43.920> bed<00:03:44.130> it's<00:03:44.690> the

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
even call it a bed it's the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.870 
even call it a bed it's the
it<00:03:46.680> looks<00:03:46.950> smaller<00:03:47.220> than<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.520> feels<00:03:47.670> like

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
it looks smaller than it feels like

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.340 
it looks smaller than it feels like
which<00:03:48.030> again<00:03:48.240> is<00:03:48.390> odd<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.660> mean<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:48.900> it's<00:03:49.110> fine

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
which again is odd I mean it it's fine

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.740 
which again is odd I mean it it's fine
but<00:03:49.680> you<00:03:50.670> know<00:03:50.790> it's<00:03:51.060> just<00:03:51.209> if<00:03:51.420> it<00:03:51.540> looks

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750

there's<00:04:43.770> some<00:04:43.950> reviews<00:04:44.340> on<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:45.060> restaurant

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
there's some reviews on the restaurant

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.879 
there's some reviews on the restaurant
they<00:04:45.540> look<00:04:45.660> older<00:04:46.020> I<00:04:46.050> think<00:04:46.139> that<00:04:46.470> gets<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.800> the

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
they look older I think that gets to the

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.310 
they look older I think that gets to the
review<00:04:47.190> but<00:04:47.780> overall<00:04:48.780> I<00:04:48.900> wasn't<00:04:49.260> that

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
review but overall I wasn't that

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.960 
review but overall I wasn't that
impressed<00:04:49.620> by<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:49.800> food<00:04:50.040> and<00:04:50.640> they<00:04:50.820> had

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
impressed by the food and they had

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.370 
impressed by the food and they had
oysters<00:04:51.180> which<00:04:51.540> are<00:04:51.690> actually<00:04:51.930> pretty<00:04:52.290> good

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
oysters which are actually pretty good

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.070 
oysters which are actually pretty good
and<00:04:53.190> I<00:04:53.520> guess<00:04:53.669> wasters<00:04:54.120> are<00:04:54.540> judged<00:04:54.840> by<00:04:55.020> the

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
and I guess wasters are judged by the

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.659 
and I guess wasters are judged by the
fact<00:04:55.320> whether<00:04:55.500> you<00:04:55.710> are<00:04:55.860> alive<00:04:56.160> or<00:04:56.220> not<00:04:56.490> after

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
fact whether you are alive or not after

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.909 
fact whether you are alive or not after
you<00:04:56.880> eat<00:04:57.000> them<00:04:57.290> they're<00:04:58.290> quite<00:04:58.470> tasty<00:04:58.890> a

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
you eat them they're quite tasty a

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.340 
you eat them they're quite tasty a
