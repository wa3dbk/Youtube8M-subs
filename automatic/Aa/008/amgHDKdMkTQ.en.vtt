00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello to all of you so this 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.299
 short video to introduce you to a 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.179
 complex of essential oils for 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.620
 avoid hair loss 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:14.130
 I think it may interest a lot 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.379
 of men so it's both for 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.920
 prevent hair loss but also 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.199
 to stimulate their regrowth then it's 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.170
 extremely difficult 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:29.789
 down once you have a small 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.330
 glass bottle a base an oil 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.910
 vegetable 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.710
 so we call it a dilution base 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.829
 and essential oils are enough for you 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.800
 to mix everything and once you 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.750
 have mixed everything my faith you stir 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.940
 and apply yourself daily on 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.489
 areas that tend to shrink 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.960
 or who could get out of it 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.399
 as a preventive treatment 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.629
 so for my part I use an oil 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.460
 of argan an organic vegetable oil 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.829
 I provided myself not to make 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.559
 advertising at as roma something 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.220
 do internet and I've been pretty 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.200
 satisfied with everything they sent me 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.909
 I have all organic price for my part I 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.010
 quickly in general the essential oils 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.640
 who are not or all 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.930
 products that are not so I have 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.860
 makes a selection of six oils 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.400
 essential for this special complex 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.189
 hair then approach us a little 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.070
 little looking at what we have we 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.540
 have first ever 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.060
 so that's the essential oil that 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.310
 is really capital I believe for all 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.650
 those who fail are berry oil 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.549
 saint thomas 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.659
 I had not heard much about it 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.700
 before 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.799
 I confess to you until I 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.229
 lean on the subject and that's the oil 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.259
 essential miracle seems it or all 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.020
 at least the one that is the most 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.969
 commonly used for this type of 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.110
 preparation 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.890
 by the way, it's marked above tonic 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.560
 capillary that can not be wrong 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.680
 b thomas saint then there is one 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.209
 second which usually comes very 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.560
 often in all recipes 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.400
 at least from what I could find 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.980
 on the Internet 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.909
 concerning essential oils it is 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.620
 the rosemary out here is BeKnown 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:23.189
 said to be an essential oil 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.110
 regenerating rosmarinus officinalis which 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:28.140
 is very interesting too that seems 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.359
 very good and that goes very well with 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.439
 b saint thomas so bessin thomas the name 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:36.420
 latin cpie same time racemosa lo 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:39.750
 for those who would like to be sure that 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.579
 it's the right plant a third or 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.959
 essential oils that are used in 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:47.280
 general also for hair 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:50.519
 lemongrass here is symbo skin good flex 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.489
 huot knew what is said to be tonic and 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:58.349
 purifying cedar of the atlas cedrus 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:01.489
 atlantica purifying and calming then 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:07.230
 this one is not necessary in my opinion 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:09.019
 for oils added 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.260
 in this composition 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.879
 that's my opinion but for me for my 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.329
 I added the hand so his nails 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.970
 clove and clove has a 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.819
 particularity is that it is super 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.919
 rich and cartonne in antioxidants it's 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:30.810
 the plant in the world that I believe in has the 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:33.239
 more so if the fact of balding is 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.680
 related to any oxidation I think 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.879
 that maybe it's not so bad 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.560
 idea to add more 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:43.530
 prescriptions it costs nothing to try and 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.680
 for my part I like the smell 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.250
 so suddenly it does not bother me 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.449
 to take 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:54.090
 that's it and then uh bulky calyptus who 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:56.099
 is the good essential oil there is the 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.069
 wholesale 250 milliliter bottle 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.019
 you do not need as many 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.340
 drops are enough then for my part I 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.859
 prices because I thought it was 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.389
 could be interesting to add 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:11.040
 simply because it helps to 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:13.270
 also do some kind of medium of 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.860
 mediator between argan oil 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.890
 all the other oils that did not 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.530
 not necessarily all the same the same 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.930
 blow density even at the level of 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.580
 the smell was very nice 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.720
 so what do you do from a point of 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.460
 practical view is that you take a 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.790
 little pot of it's a mini pot of 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.940
 knuckle jam maybe recognized trick 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:37.180
 you put your oil first others 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.250
 vegetable oils so here dropping and 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.140
 you put three drops 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.580
 three drops of each so we could 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.000
 rise to the level of saint thomas and 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.630
 rosemary because they have this action 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.400
 very particular about the hair 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.740
 then you gently stir yourself 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.700
 do not heat keep it safe from 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.010
 light because oils 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.810
 essential oxidizes to light at 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.820
 the outdoors too so you think about 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.310
 well close your skin and then the bin 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.660
 morning or after your shower or you 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.980
 put on the fingertips and then 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:11.350
 you massage the areas that could be 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:14.130
 to get rid of it here is good ben enjoy it well 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.130
 have fun
