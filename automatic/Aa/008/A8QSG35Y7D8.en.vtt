00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
challenge so that's what I did I started

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.500 
challenge so that's what I did I started
off<00:00:59.920> with<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.250> fountains<00:01:00.729> which<00:01:01.030> you<00:01:01.210> can<00:01:01.360> see

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
off with the fountains which you can see

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.160 
off with the fountains which you can see
here<00:01:01.809> I<00:01:02.080> then<00:01:02.949> moved<00:01:03.129> on<00:01:03.309> to<00:01:03.339> Garland's

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
here I then moved on to Garland's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.480 
here I then moved on to Garland's
initially<00:01:05.170> using<00:01:05.379> them<00:01:05.619> on<00:01:05.740> sugar<00:01:06.070> flowers

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
initially using them on sugar flowers

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.160 
initially using them on sugar flowers
but<00:01:06.729> as<00:01:06.880> any<00:01:07.119> of<00:01:07.240> you<00:01:07.420> know<00:01:07.600> that<00:01:07.900> makes<00:01:08.110> sure

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
but as any of you know that makes sure

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.440 
but as any of you know that makes sure
that<00:01:08.229> they<00:01:08.590> are<00:01:08.740> very<00:01:08.770> brittle<00:01:09.220> so<00:01:09.939> I've<00:01:10.180> moved

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
that they are very brittle so I've moved

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.789 
that they are very brittle so I've moved
away<00:01:10.570> from<00:01:10.750> that<00:01:10.960> and<00:01:11.350> as<00:01:11.439> you'll<00:01:11.590> see<00:01:11.619> later

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
away from that and as you'll see later

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.999 
away from that and as you'll see later
I've<00:01:12.490> use<00:01:13.119> them<00:01:13.240> in<00:01:13.299> other<00:01:13.450> ways<00:01:13.600> I<00:01:13.960> think<00:01:14.890> I

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
I've use them in other ways I think I

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.620 
I've use them in other ways I think I
was<00:01:15.130> attracted<00:01:15.220> to<00:01:15.580> be<00:01:15.729> decorations<00:01:16.420> because

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
was attracted to be decorations because

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.080 
was attracted to be decorations because
it's<00:01:16.780> so<00:01:16.960> easy<00:01:17.290> and<00:01:17.470> effective<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:18.280> they<00:01:18.970> can

it's so easy and effective and they can

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.340 
it's so easy and effective and they can
be<00:01:19.150> done<00:01:19.299> way<00:01:19.540> in<00:01:19.600> advance<00:01:19.750> so<00:01:20.229> they<00:01:20.320> can

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
be done way in advance so they can

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.410 
be done way in advance so they can
reduce<00:01:20.860> any<00:01:21.159> last-minute<00:01:21.610> stress<00:01:22.030> which<00:01:22.240> is<00:01:22.270> a

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
what they find is they actually prefer

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.809 
what they find is they actually prefer
to<00:02:10.270> make<00:02:10.600> one<00:02:11.230> garland<00:02:11.770> of<00:02:12.010> one<00:02:12.310> type<00:02:12.490> of<00:02:12.520> bead

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
to make one garland of one type of bead

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.030 
to make one garland of one type of bead
and<00:02:13.240> then<00:02:13.690> another<00:02:13.900> garland<00:02:14.410> of<00:02:14.560> another<00:02:14.800> type

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
and then another garland of another type

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.770 
and then another garland of another type
and<00:02:15.280> then<00:02:15.370> just<00:02:15.520> keep<00:02:15.730> adding<00:02:15.940> on<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.360> that<00:02:16.540> I

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
and then just keep adding on to that I

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.130 
and then just keep adding on to that I
find<00:02:17.620> for<00:02:17.800> me<00:02:17.920> what<00:02:18.100> works<00:02:18.310> is<00:02:18.700> by<00:02:19.000> doing<00:02:19.140> just

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
find for me what works is by doing just

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.600 
find for me what works is by doing just
randomly<00:02:20.560> picking<00:02:20.860> up<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.130> beads<00:02:21.340> and

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
randomly picking up the beads and

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.670 
randomly picking up the beads and
threading<00:02:21.970> them<00:02:22.120> on<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.300> wire<00:02:22.480> in<00:02:22.780> shape<00:02:23.319> any

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
threading them on the wire in shape any

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.190 
threading them on the wire in shape any
sizes<00:02:24.190> just<00:02:24.459> put<00:02:25.090> them<00:02:25.180> all<00:02:25.270> on<00:02:25.330> they're<00:02:26.020> going

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
sizes just put them all on they're going

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.620 
sizes just put them all on they're going
to<00:02:26.319> be<00:02:26.410> wrapped<00:02:26.680> around<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:27.099> cake<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:28.330> it<00:02:28.450> does

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
to be wrapped around the cake so it does

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.410 
to be wrapped around the cake so it does
she<00:02:28.840> doesn't<00:02:29.140> matter<00:02:29.319> on<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.560> order<00:02:30.270> okay<00:02:31.270> you

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
she doesn't matter on the order okay you

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.309 
she doesn't matter on the order okay you
want<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.720> find<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.440> center<00:02:34.140> it's<00:02:35.140> pinging

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
want to find the center it's pinging

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.960 
want to find the center it's pinging
around<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.680> little<00:02:35.740> bit<00:02:35.950> so<00:02:36.610> this<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:36.880> the

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
around a little bit so this is the

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.010 
around a little bit so this is the
center<00:02:37.390> I'm<00:02:37.660> going<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.200> feed<00:02:38.470> on<00:02:39.690> four<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:40.720> the

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
center I'm going to feed on four of the

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.610 
center I'm going to feed on four of the
amber<00:02:41.290> B

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
amber B

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:49.170 
amber B
to<00:02:41.830> start<00:02:42.069> with<00:02:44.190> that's<00:02:45.190> one<00:02:45.549> two<00:02:46.330> three<00:02:48.180> four

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
to start with that's one two three four

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.640 
to start with that's one two three four
and<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.930> last<00:02:50.140> one<00:02:50.500> I'm<00:02:50.739> going<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.069> put<00:02:51.250> the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
and the last one I'm going to put the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.530 
and the last one I'm going to put the
second<00:02:53.650> wire<00:02:53.830> through<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.370> so<00:02:55.120> I'm<00:02:55.209> making<00:02:55.330> a

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
second wire through it so I'm making a

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:03.559 
second wire through it so I'm making a
loop<00:02:59.610> okay<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:00.790> that<00:03:00.940> gives<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:01.239> four<00:03:01.480> beads

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
loop okay so that gives you four beads

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.830 
loop okay so that gives you four beads
I'm<00:03:04.569> then<00:03:04.810> going<00:03:05.049> to<00:03:05.140> use<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:07.450> burnt<00:03:07.659> orange

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
I'm then going to use the burnt orange

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.089 
I'm then going to use the burnt orange
and<00:03:08.110> I'm<00:03:08.260> gonna<00:03:08.379> do<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.530> same<00:03:08.680> thing<00:03:08.739> I'm

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
and I'm gonna do the same thing I'm

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:15.509 
and I'm gonna do the same thing I'm
going<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.280> take<00:03:09.430> four<00:03:14.129> I'm<00:03:15.129> going<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.340> feed

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
going to take four I'm going to feed

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.780 
going to take four I'm going to feed
them<00:03:15.640> down<00:03:15.849> the<00:03:16.000> wire<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:16.959> then<00:03:17.319> I'm<00:03:17.440> going<00:03:17.620> to

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
them down the wire and then I'm going to

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.240 
them down the wire and then I'm going to
take<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:19.780> end<00:03:20.260> of<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.470> wire<00:03:20.620> I'm<00:03:20.890> going<00:03:21.160> to

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
take the end of the wire I'm going to

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.839 
take the end of the wire I'm going to
feed<00:03:21.489> it<00:03:21.609> back<00:03:21.790> through<00:03:21.849> the<00:03:22.720> last<00:03:22.930> bead<00:03:26.849> I'm

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
feed it back through the last bead I'm

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.460 
feed it back through the last bead I'm
going<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.120> hold<00:03:28.329> that<00:03:28.480> bead<00:03:29.970> about<00:03:31.470> three

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
going to hold that bead about three

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.140 
going to hold that bead about three
centimeters<00:03:32.829> from<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.280> first<00:03:33.549> groups<00:03:33.909> I've

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
centimeters from the first groups I've

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.520 
centimeters from the first groups I've
got<00:03:34.620> two<00:03:36.090> M<00:03:37.090> groups<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:37.870> we'll<00:03:38.170> do<00:03:38.349> another

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
got two M groups and we'll do another

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.979 
got two M groups and we'll do another
one<00:03:38.680> of<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.190> orange<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:40.690> other<00:03:40.870> side<00:03:42.659> so<00:03:43.659> four

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
one of the orange the other side so four

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.379 
one of the orange the other side so four
again<00:03:44.340> now<00:03:45.340> with<00:03:45.489> this<00:03:45.639> technique<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:46.180> have

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
again now with this technique you have

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.240 
again now with this technique you have
to<00:03:46.870> experiment<00:03:47.349> with<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:47.799> beads<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:48.160> have

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
to experiment with the beads you have

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.430 
to experiment with the beads you have
because<00:03:48.910> some<00:03:49.180> of<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:49.359> beads<00:03:49.569> are<00:03:50.019> found<00:03:50.290> if

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
because some of the beads are found if

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.839 
because some of the beads are found if
they<00:03:50.530> have<00:03:50.650> larger<00:03:51.010> holes<00:03:51.299> then<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:52.989> wire

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
they have larger holes then the wire

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.699 
they have larger holes then the wire
doesn't<00:03:54.849> stay<00:03:55.299> where<00:03:55.480> you<00:03:55.569> want<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:55.900> to<00:03:56.079> so<00:03:56.650> you

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
doesn't stay where you want it to so you

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.849 
doesn't stay where you want it to so you
need<00:03:56.889> to<00:03:57.040> find<00:03:57.250> beads<00:03:57.579> that<00:03:57.819> work<00:03:58.090> I<00:03:58.859> found

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
need to find beads that work I found

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.680 
need to find beads that work I found
these<00:03:59.950> miracle<00:04:00.370> ones<00:04:00.549> work<00:04:00.819> fine<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.389> pearls

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
these miracle ones work fine the pearls

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.550 
these miracle ones work fine the pearls
also<00:04:02.139> work<00:04:03.359> so<00:04:04.359> just<00:04:04.389> see<00:04:04.900> what<00:04:05.049> you've<00:04:05.169> gotten

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
also work so just see what you've gotten

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.640 
also work so just see what you've gotten
just<00:04:05.769> have<00:04:05.980> a<00:04:06.010> go<00:04:06.900> with<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:07.989> beads<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.410> see<00:04:08.560> if

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
just have a go with the beads and see if

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.339 
just have a go with the beads and see if
they<00:04:08.769> hold<00:04:08.980> so<00:04:09.879> that's<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.299> first<00:04:12.989> step<00:04:13.989> okay

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
they hold so that's the first step okay

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.550 
they hold so that's the first step okay
so<00:04:15.340> now<00:04:15.760> we're<00:04:16.109> now<00:04:17.109> I'm<00:04:17.229> going<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:17.470> do<00:04:17.530> a

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
so now we're now I'm going to do a

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.120 
so now we're now I'm going to do a
repeat<00:04:17.979> of<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.549> amber<00:04:18.940> ones<00:04:19.560> but<00:04:20.560> I'm<00:04:20.889> going

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
repeat of the amber ones but I'm going

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.850 
repeat of the amber ones but I'm going
to<00:04:21.250> put<00:04:22.180> one<00:04:22.360> bead<00:04:22.570> on<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:25.240> then<00:04:25.360> I'm<00:04:25.479> going<00:04:25.630> to

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
to put one bead on and then I'm going to

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.350 
to put one bead on and then I'm going to
put<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:26.979> wire<00:04:27.190> through<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:28.270> other<00:04:28.479> side<00:04:30.360> so

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
put the wire through the other side so

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:39.660 
put the wire through the other side so
I've<00:04:31.449> got<00:04:31.630> wires<00:04:31.979> going<00:04:32.979> either<00:04:33.280> side

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.600

achieve here I'm then going to feed two

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.710 
achieve here I'm then going to feed two
beads<00:04:49.040> on<00:04:49.220> one<00:04:49.490> wire<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:52.240> one<00:04:53.240> bead<00:04:53.480> on<00:04:53.600> the

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
beads on one wire and one bead on the

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.580 
beads on one wire and one bead on the
other

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.250 

okay<00:04:57.590> then<00:04:58.160> the<00:04:58.250> one<00:04:58.430> that<00:04:58.550> I've<00:04:58.700> got<00:04:58.880> one<00:04:59.260> I'm

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
okay then the one that I've got one I'm

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.600 
okay then the one that I've got one I'm
going<00:05:00.680> to<00:05:00.950> feed<00:05:01.340> through<00:05:01.700> the<00:05:01.880> second<00:05:02.240> bead<00:05:03.610> to

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
going to feed through the second bead to

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:12.940 
going to feed through the second bead to
make<00:05:04.790> another<00:05:05.030> group<00:05:05.210> of<00:05:05.420> four<00:05:09.250> like<00:05:10.250> so<00:05:11.950> okay

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
make another group of four like so okay

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.230 
make another group of four like so okay
then<00:05:13.160> you<00:05:13.310> just<00:05:13.490> have<00:05:13.610> to<00:05:13.700> continue<00:05:14.060> doing

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
then you just have to continue doing

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.890 
then you just have to continue doing

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
that all the way down your wire until my

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.290 
that all the way down your wire until my
current<00:05:18.320> favorite<00:05:18.830> which<00:05:19.160> is<00:05:19.490> a<00:05:19.550> wire<00:05:19.970> flower

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
current favorite which is a wire flower

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.960 
current favorite which is a wire flower
and<00:05:20.930> using<00:05:21.830> the<00:05:21.919> knot<00:05:22.220> point<00:05:23.080> five<00:05:24.580> wire<00:05:25.580> here

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
and using the knot point five wire here

and using the knot point five wire here
and<00:05:26.120> on<00:05:27.080> this<00:05:27.260> cake<00:05:27.620> I've<00:05:28.070> got<00:05:28.490> three

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
and on this cake I've got three

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.310 
and on this cake I've got three
different<00:05:28.850> colors<00:05:29.120> I've<00:05:29.510> got<00:05:29.750> the<00:05:30.110> warm

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
different colors I've got the warm

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.909 
different colors I've got the warm
silver<00:05:30.800> I<00:05:31.010> like<00:05:31.640> that<00:05:31.850> quote<00:05:32.120> and<00:05:32.360> the<00:05:32.510> pink

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
silver I like that quote and the pink

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:34.960 
silver I like that quote and the pink
and<00:05:33.919> what<00:05:34.070> I'm<00:05:34.160> going<00:05:34.310> to<00:05:34.340> do<00:05:34.430> first<00:05:34.669> is<00:05:34.910> make

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
and what I'm going to do first is make

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.060 
and what I'm going to do first is make
the<00:05:35.270> petals<00:05:35.600> now<00:05:35.900> you<00:05:35.960> need<00:05:36.200> something<00:05:36.770> to

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
the petals now you need something to

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.100 
the petals now you need something to
make<00:05:37.190> the<00:05:37.250> petals<00:05:37.550> around<00:05:37.640> and<00:05:38.510> I<00:05:38.600> find<00:05:38.930> this

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
make the petals around and I find this

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.380 
make the petals around and I find this
candy<00:05:39.440> tube<00:05:39.710> of<00:05:39.919> beads<00:05:40.160> just<00:05:40.880> the<00:05:41.060> right<00:05:41.210> size

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
candy tube of beads just the right size

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.930 
candy tube of beads just the right size
so<00:05:42.260> I'm<00:05:42.380> going<00:05:42.590> to<00:05:42.650> make<00:05:43.010> five<00:05:43.250> petals<00:05:43.700> so<00:05:43.880> I'm

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
so I'm going to make five petals so I'm

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.159 
so I'm going to make five petals so I'm
going<00:05:44.120> five<00:05:44.390> times<00:05:44.840> round<00:05:45.880> four<00:05:46.880> five<00:05:47.450> I'm

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
going five times round four five I'm

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.000 
going five times round four five I'm
then<00:05:48.500> going<00:05:48.650> to<00:05:48.710> cut<00:05:48.919> the<00:05:49.040> wire<00:05:50.020> okay<00:05:51.020> then

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
then going to cut the wire okay then

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.500 
then going to cut the wire okay then
what<00:05:52.130> I'm<00:05:52.220> going<00:05:52.370> to<00:05:52.430> do<00:05:52.640> is<00:05:52.910> actually<00:05:53.090> twist

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
what I'm going to do is actually twist

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.990 
what I'm going to do is actually twist
it<00:05:53.780> underneath<00:05:54.140> just<00:05:54.500> to<00:05:54.710> hold<00:05:55.010> the<00:05:55.610> work<00:05:55.820> the

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
it underneath just to hold the work the

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.960 
it underneath just to hold the work the
petals<00:05:56.419> in<00:05:56.540> place<00:05:57.010> so<00:05:58.010> it<00:05:58.100> sort<00:05:58.250> of<00:05:58.310> 1/2<00:05:58.700> times

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
petals in place so it sort of 1/2 times

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.570 
petals in place so it sort of 1/2 times
around<00:05:59.120> twist<00:05:59.540> I'm<00:06:00.200> then<00:06:00.620> going<00:06:00.740> to<00:06:00.919> remove

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.460 

its<00:06:04.580> I've<00:06:04.700> got<00:06:04.850> basically<00:06:05.270> five<00:06:05.780> circles

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
its I've got basically five circles

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.830 
its I've got basically five circles
they've<00:06:07.010> been<00:06:07.130> twisted<00:06:07.520> together<00:06:07.780> now<00:06:08.780> to

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
they've been twisted together now to

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.460 
they've been twisted together now to
keep<00:06:09.229> those<00:06:09.410> in<00:06:09.650> place<00:06:09.890> and<00:06:10.280> to<00:06:11.150> make<00:06:11.270> the

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
keep those in place and to make the

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.000 
keep those in place and to make the
flower<00:06:12.470> Center<00:06:13.010> I'm<00:06:13.220> going<00:06:13.400> to<00:06:13.460> take<00:06:13.669> a<00:06:13.700> bead

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
flower Center I'm going to take a bead

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.330 
flower Center I'm going to take a bead
feed<00:06:16.010> it<00:06:16.130> through<00:06:17.500> feed<00:06:18.500> that<00:06:18.680> ends<00:06:19.040> through

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
feed it through feed that ends through

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.430 
feed it through feed that ends through
the<00:06:19.520> five<00:06:20.150> loops<00:06:20.450> so<00:06:20.870> this<00:06:20.960> is<00:06:21.110> going<00:06:21.350> to

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
the five loops so this is going to

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.840 
the five loops so this is going to
secure<00:06:21.620> the<00:06:22.520> flower<00:06:22.760> together<00:06:24.550> and<00:06:25.550> then<00:06:25.700> what

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
secure the flower together and then what

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.210 
secure the flower together and then what
I'm<00:06:25.940> going<00:06:26.060> to<00:06:26.120> do<00:06:26.270> is<00:06:26.600> just<00:06:26.960> twist<00:06:27.640> all<00:06:28.640> that

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
I'm going to do is just twist all that

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.680 
I'm going to do is just twist all that
now<00:06:31.220> because<00:06:31.490> this<00:06:31.580> is<00:06:31.640> quite<00:06:31.880> a<00:06:32.000> strong<00:06:32.390> wire

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
now because this is quite a strong wire

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.300 
now because this is quite a strong wire
it's<00:06:32.930> actually<00:06:33.169> quite<00:06:33.380> difficult<00:06:33.740> to<00:06:34.100> twist

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
it's actually quite difficult to twist

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.790 
it's actually quite difficult to twist
too<00:06:34.520> much<00:06:34.729> and<00:06:35.060> to<00:06:35.840> twist<00:06:36.050> evenly<00:06:36.530> so<00:06:36.650> what<00:06:36.770> I

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
too much and to twist evenly so what I

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.219 
too much and to twist evenly so what I
tend<00:06:37.040> to<00:06:37.130> do<00:06:37.280> is<00:06:37.400> just<00:06:37.580> a<00:06:37.700> few<00:06:37.880> twists<00:06:38.360> and<00:06:38.930> then

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:39.229 
tend to do is just a few twists and then

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:42.520 
tend to do is just a few twists and then
remove<00:06:40.450> one<00:06:41.450> so<00:06:41.690> you've<00:06:41.810> just<00:06:41.930> got<00:06:42.050> a<00:06:42.080> short

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
remove one so you've just got a short

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.750 
remove one so you've just got a short
length<00:06:42.710> of<00:06:42.890> twist<00:06:43.100> that<00:06:43.220> will<00:06:43.340> hold<00:06:43.550> it

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:43.760 
length of twist that will hold it

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.680 
length of twist that will hold it
together<00:06:43.880> but<00:06:44.810> isn't<00:06:45.110> that<00:06:45.260> visible<00:06:46.510> you<00:06:47.510> then

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.690 
together but isn't that visible you then

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.580 
together but isn't that visible you then
open<00:06:47.930> up<00:06:48.320> the<00:06:49.030> wire<00:06:50.030> petals<00:06:50.450> they've<00:06:50.900> got

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
open up the wire petals they've got

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.080 
open up the wire petals they've got
now<00:06:51.860> obviously<00:06:51.980> you<00:06:52.280> can<00:06:52.310> leave<00:06:52.580> it<00:06:52.730> like<00:06:52.760> that

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090 
now obviously you can leave it like that

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.480 
now obviously you can leave it like that
and<00:06:53.720> some<00:06:54.350> of<00:06:54.380> my<00:06:54.440> students<00:06:54.890> tend<00:06:55.130> to<00:06:55.250> do<00:06:55.370> that

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
and some of my students tend to do that

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.430 
and some of my students tend to do that
they<00:06:55.670> like<00:06:55.880> that<00:06:55.910> effect<00:06:56.420> but<00:06:57.020> to<00:06:57.170> get<00:06:57.320> the

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 
they like that effect but to get the
