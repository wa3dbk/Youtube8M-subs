00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
anyways okay when you do it you don't

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.619 
anyways okay when you do it you don't
have<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.489> can't<00:00:41.879> really<00:00:42.149> do<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.510> in

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
have to like you can't really do it in

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.510 
have to like you can't really do it in
place<00:00:43.200> because<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:43.620> really<00:00:43.980> hard<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:44.399> it

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
place because it's really hard to do it

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.520 
place because it's really hard to do it
and<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.450> have<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.930> like<00:00:46.170> some<00:00:46.320> kind<00:00:46.350> of

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
and you have to have like some kind of

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.619 
and you have to have like some kind of
momentum<00:00:46.980> while<00:00:47.070> doing<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.489> anyways<00:00:48.300> you

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
momentum while doing it so anyways you

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.630 
momentum while doing it so anyways you
can't<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:49.320> like<00:00:49.440> pop<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.039> tail<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.430> slide

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
can't just like pop the tail and slide

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.340 
can't just like pop the tail and slide
your<00:00:50.670> finger<00:00:50.879> like<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> regular<00:00:51.660> skateboard

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
your finger like on a regular skateboard

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.500 
your finger like on a regular skateboard
and<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:53.250> does<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.789> doesn't<00:00:53.969> work<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.180> that

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
and it does it doesn't work like that

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.319 
and it does it doesn't work like that
so<00:00:55.110> what<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> do<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.920> yet<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.370> scope

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
so what you have to do is yet to scope

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.720 
so what you have to do is yet to scope
you<00:00:57.570> have<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.750> go<00:00:57.870> fairly<00:00:58.199> fast<00:00:58.350> from<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.489> fast

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
you have to go fairly fast from the fast

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.090 
you have to go fairly fast from the fast
because<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.059> easier<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.629> if<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.260> go<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
because that easier it is if you go the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.650 
because that easier it is if you go the
opposite<00:01:02.520> direction<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:03.059> if<00:01:03.300> you're<00:01:03.480> using

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
opposite direction so if you're using

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.920 
opposite direction so if you're using
your<00:01:03.870> hand<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.010> go<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.600> to<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> right

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
your hand you have to go on to the right

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.500 
your hand you have to go on to the right
and<00:01:07.200> then<00:01:07.799> I'm<00:01:08.130> going<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.369> pop<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.880> tail<00:01:09.090> or<00:01:09.390> if

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
and then I'm going to pop the tail or if

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.850 
and then I'm going to pop the tail or if
you're<00:01:09.630> using<00:01:09.659> real<00:01:10.020> Kenyans<00:01:10.409> I've<00:01:10.530> got<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
you're using real Kenyans I've got the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.730 
you're using real Kenyans I've got the
luck<00:01:11.070> popular<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.909> tail<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.470> can't

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
luck popular on tail and you can't

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.830 
luck popular on tail and you can't
really<00:01:13.860> do<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.189> one<00:01:14.369> moving<00:01:14.580> forward<00:01:15.000> but

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
really do this one moving forward but

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.080 
really do this one moving forward but
anyway<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.520> pop<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.909> tail

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
anyway you like this you pop the tail

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.270 
anyway you like this you pop the tail
after<00:01:18.450> moving<00:01:18.990> back<00:01:19.049> for<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.500> fact<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.130> what

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
after moving back for the fact and what

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.520 
after moving back for the fact and what
happens<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.939> speed<00:01:21.810> from<00:01:22.110> moving<00:01:22.259> back

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
happens to that speed from moving back

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.440 
happens to that speed from moving back
will<00:01:22.710> kind<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:22.979> like<00:01:23.100> slam<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.820> board<00:01:24.180> into

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
will kind of like slam the board into

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.570 
will kind of like slam the board into
your<00:01:24.540> fingers<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.200> when<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.070> slams<00:01:26.250> into<00:01:26.460> your

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
your fingers and when it slams into your

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.370 
your fingers and when it slams into your
fingers<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.420> might<00:01:27.600> end<00:01:27.780> up<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.200> at

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
fingers it you might end up like this at

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.130 
fingers it you might end up like this at
first<00:01:28.409> but<00:01:29.360> even<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.600> get<00:01:30.720> better<00:01:30.810> at<00:01:31.020> it

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
first but even so you get better at it

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.050 
first but even so you get better at it
and<00:01:31.259> then<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.100> might<00:01:32.250> get<00:01:32.430> like<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.790> and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
and then you might get like this and

anyways like you might like the first
couple<00:02:11.220> times<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.430> might<00:02:11.580> just<00:02:11.670> go<00:02:11.819> like

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
couple times you might just go like

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.960 
couple times you might just go like
lose<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.159> border<00:02:13.430> completely<00:02:13.909> or<00:02:14.140> but<00:02:15.140> while

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
lose the border completely or but while

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.210 
lose the border completely or but while
well<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:18.110> just<00:02:18.260> kind<00:02:18.409> of<00:02:18.500> get<00:02:18.590> used<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:18.950> and

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
well you just kind of get used to it and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.809 
well you just kind of get used to it and
then<00:02:19.340> anyway<00:02:19.640> honestly<00:02:21.010> you<00:02:22.010> get<00:02:22.220> used<00:02:22.489> to<00:02:22.610> it

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
then anyway honestly you get used to it

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.539 
then anyway honestly you get used to it
this<00:02:23.000> kind<00:02:23.239> of<00:02:23.269> starts<00:02:24.200> on<00:02:24.379> and<00:02:25.040> it's<00:02:25.340> kind<00:02:25.519> of

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
this kind of starts on and it's kind of

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.640 
this kind of starts on and it's kind of
hard<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:25.760> see<00:02:25.940> in<00:02:25.970> this<00:02:26.269> video<00:02:26.599> because<00:02:27.290> it

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
hard to see in this video because it

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.030 
hard to see in this video because it
means<00:02:28.610> kind<00:02:28.879> of<00:02:28.970> fast<00:02:29.150> but<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:30.470> is<00:02:30.500> leaving

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
means kind of fast but it is leaving

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.220 
means kind of fast but it is leaving
ground<00:02:31.280> like<00:02:31.459> Holly<00:02:32.180> over<00:02:32.420> obstacles<00:02:32.690> and

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
ground like Holly over obstacles and

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.460 
ground like Holly over obstacles and
stuff<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:34.340> anyway<00:02:35.269> it's<00:02:35.780> like<00:02:35.930> just<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:36.349> have

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470
