thought<00:00:10.620> I'd<00:00:10.740> do<00:00:10.920> today<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.280> just<00:00:11.820> give<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:12.690> a

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
thought I'd do today is just give you a

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.919 
thought I'd do today is just give you a
general<00:00:12.990> overview<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:14.150> base<00:00:15.150> design<00:00:15.630> on

general overview of base design on

general overview of base design on
island<00:00:16.740> two<00:00:17.900> if<00:00:18.900> you've<00:00:19.080> got<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.199> lot<00:00:19.380> of

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
island two if you've got a lot of

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.429 
island two if you've got a lot of
valuables<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.460> trophies<00:00:21.060> taken<00:00:21.689> over<00:00:22.170> Milan

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
valuables and trophies taken over Milan

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.580 
valuables and trophies taken over Milan
one<00:00:22.880> most<00:00:23.880> important<00:00:24.420> thing<00:00:24.630> for<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.320> do

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
one most important thing for you to do

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.359 
one most important thing for you to do
is<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.490> make<00:00:27.150> sure<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.960> build<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:29.189> base

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
is to make sure that you build the base

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.880 
is to make sure that you build the base
will<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.449> most<00:00:30.660> essential<00:00:31.050> elements<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
will the most essential elements of the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.040 
will the most essential elements of the
bases<00:00:32.340> quickly<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.090> as<00:00:33.210> efficiently<00:00:33.239> as<00:00:34.020> you

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
bases quickly and as efficiently as you

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.740 
bases quickly and as efficiently as you
can<00:00:35.300> what<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.329> usually<00:00:36.719> start<00:00:37.050> with<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.680> this

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
can what I usually start with is this

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:46.880 
can what I usually start with is this
corridor<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:40.969> security<00:00:43.190> leading<00:00:44.190> up<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:45.890> this

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
corridor of security leading up to this

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.100 
corridor of security leading up to this
power<00:00:47.280> plant<00:00:47.610> here<00:00:50.270> basically<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.539> make<00:00:51.809> your

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
power plant here basically to make your

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.290 
power plant here basically to make your
second<00:00:53.690> place<00:00:54.690> secure<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:55.920> too<00:00:56.300> you've

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
second place secure and I on too you've

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.760 
second place secure and I on too you've
got<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.570> get<00:00:57.660> power<00:00:57.989> up<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.260> running<00:00:58.620> as

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
got to get power up and running as

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.930 
got to get power up and running as
quickly<00:00:58.800> as<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.960> so<00:01:01.039> this<00:01:02.039> corridor<00:01:02.489> here

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
quickly as you can so this corridor here

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.119 
quickly as you can so this corridor here
as<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.239> see<00:01:03.390> extends<00:01:04.320> all<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.530> way<00:01:04.710> down

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
as you can see extends all the way down

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.120 
as you can see extends all the way down
to<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.470> base<00:01:07.470> entrance<00:01:07.920> itself<00:01:09.799> and<00:01:10.799> that's

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
to the base entrance itself and that's

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.950 
to the base entrance itself and that's
one<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> first<00:01:11.880> things<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.659> build

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
one of the first things that you build

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.499 
one of the first things that you build
so<00:01:13.770> an<00:01:14.729> advanced<00:01:15.330> designer<00:01:16.130> will<00:01:17.130> know<00:01:18.119> how<00:01:18.479> to

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
so an advanced designer will know how to

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.700 
so an advanced designer will know how to
create<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> series<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:21.020> awkward<00:01:22.020> corridors<00:01:22.619> for

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
create a series of awkward corridors for

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.219 
create a series of awkward corridors for
the<00:01:22.890> enemies<00:01:23.220> or<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> series<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.360> coil<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:25.020> for

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
the enemies or a series of coil is for

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.660 
the enemies or a series of coil is for
traps<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.909> this<00:01:26.930> corridor<00:01:27.930> will<00:01:28.259> extend<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
traps and this corridor will extend to

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.719 
traps and this corridor will extend to
that<00:01:30.119> power<00:01:30.930> supply<00:01:31.170> system<00:01:31.950> but<00:01:32.400> obviously

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
that power supply system but obviously

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.390 
that power supply system but obviously
quite<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.060> way<00:01:33.329> away<00:01:33.689> because<00:01:34.100> these<00:01:35.100> things

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
quite a way away because these things

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.580 
quite a way away because these things
are<00:01:35.880> quite<00:01:36.270> expensive<00:01:36.390> when<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.290> want<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
are quite expensive when you want the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.399 
are quite expensive when you want the
keep<00:01:37.799> them<00:01:38.009> as<00:01:38.850> far<00:01:39.119> away<00:01:39.329> from<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.810> entrances

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
keep them as far away from the entrances

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.990 
keep them as far away from the entrances
of<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.799> base<00:01:40.979> as<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.579> but<00:01:41.790> they've<00:01:41.970> got

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
of the base as you can but they've got

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.730 
of the base as you can but they've got
to<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.420> one<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.810> first<00:01:43.049> things<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.560> you

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
to be one of the first things that you

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.999 
to be one of the first things that you
built<00:01:44.149> in<00:01:45.149> order<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.570> get<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.869> base<00:01:46.110> safe<00:01:46.560> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
built in order to get the base safe and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.280 
built in order to get the base safe and
always<00:01:47.189> do<00:01:47.490> transfer<00:01:48.030> all<00:01:48.180> your<00:01:48.210> trophies<00:01:48.659> and

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
always do transfer all your trophies and

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.380 
always do transfer all your trophies and
your<00:01:49.439> gifts<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.009> your<00:01:50.070> items<00:01:50.549> into<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.090> base

your gifts and your items into the base

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.610 
your gifts and your items into the base
so<00:01:52.380> no<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.280> can

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
so no one can
