hutch first gonna get cannon rushed I

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:30.670 
hutch first gonna get cannon rushed I
mean<00:02:16.209> what<00:02:25.030> get<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.180> beast<00:02:26.569> outta<00:02:26.870> here

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.880 

I<00:02:31.680> mean<00:02:32.189> at<00:02:32.400> this<00:02:32.519> point<00:02:32.610> like<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.890> expansion

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
I mean at this point like this expansion

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.309 
I mean at this point like this expansion
is<00:02:35.040> done<00:02:35.220> because<00:02:35.900> he's<00:02:36.900> not<00:02:36.989> going<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.170> get

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
is done because he's not going to get

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:47.360 
is done because he's not going to get
back<00:02:37.470> there<00:02:37.680> right<00:02:45.890> I'm<00:02:46.890> just<00:02:47.040> gonna<00:02:47.159> start

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
back there right I'm just gonna start

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.550 
back there right I'm just gonna start
crowing<00:02:47.519> boosting<00:02:47.849> cuz<00:02:48.000> uh<00:02:48.230> it's<00:02:49.230> pretty<00:02:49.470> much

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
crowing boosting cuz uh it's pretty much

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.199 
crowing boosting cuz uh it's pretty much
a<00:02:49.620> done<00:02:50.099> deal<00:02:50.310> here<00:02:50.609> he's<00:02:50.879> probably<00:02:51.000> gonna

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
a done deal here he's probably gonna

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.550 
a done deal here he's probably gonna
canceled<00:02:51.659> on<00:02:51.750> your<00:02:51.930> guarantee<00:02:52.290> he's<00:02:52.409> gonna

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
canceled on your guarantee he's gonna

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:11.629 
canceled on your guarantee he's gonna
cancer<00:03:09.319> did<00:03:10.319> cancel<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:11.190> was<00:03:11.280> pretty<00:03:11.459> much

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
cancer did cancel it was pretty much

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:32.400 
cancer did cancel it was pretty much
assumed<00:03:11.970> right

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.960 

those<00:03:33.410> two<00:03:33.560> follows<00:03:33.890> up<00:03:34.070> to<00:03:34.250> this<00:03:34.400> could

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
those two follows up to this could

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.810 
those two follows up to this could
either<00:03:35.090> like<00:03:35.330> for<00:03:35.630> gate<00:03:35.840> amor<00:03:36.290> I<00:03:36.790> know<00:03:37.790> I

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
either like for gate amor I know I

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.220 
either like for gate amor I know I
suppose<00:03:38.210> I<00:03:38.330> could<00:03:38.360> really<00:03:38.630> do<00:03:38.810> anything<00:03:38.990> to

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
suppose I could really do anything to

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.750 
suppose I could really do anything to
them<00:03:42.100> like<00:03:43.100> I'm<00:03:43.190> going<00:03:43.310> to<00:03:43.400> go<00:03:43.520> for<00:03:43.670> an

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
them like I'm going to go for an

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.150 
them like I'm going to go for an
expansion<00:03:44.120> though<00:03:47.290> I'm<00:03:48.290> going<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.560> just<00:03:48.920> make

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
expansion though I'm going to just make

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.100 
expansion though I'm going to just make
sure<00:03:49.340> he<00:03:49.370> hasn't<00:03:49.610> thrown<00:03:49.970> up<00:03:50.450> an<00:03:50.660> expansion

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
sure he hasn't thrown up an expansion

00:03:51.110 --> 00:04:23.640 
sure he hasn't thrown up an expansion
elsewhere

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.600 

you<00:04:24.650> know<00:04:24.770> what<00:04:24.890> i<00:04:24.920> think<00:04:25.010> i'm<00:04:25.190> gonna<00:04:25.280> go<00:04:25.400> blink

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
you know what i think i'm gonna go blink

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.880 
you know what i think i'm gonna go blink
stalkers<00:04:26.140> yeah<00:04:27.140> that's<00:04:27.560> probably<00:04:27.740> a<00:04:27.860> good

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
stalkers yeah that's probably a good

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:36.260 
stalkers yeah that's probably a good
idea

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.310 
exactly well I just know he hasn't
expanded<00:05:06.130> in<00:05:06.370> one<00:05:06.520> bases<00:05:06.670> urgh<00:05:07.030> is<00:05:07.210> not<00:05:08.110> so

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
expanded in one bases urgh is not so
