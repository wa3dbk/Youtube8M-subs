 difficult to enter the online tools 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.880

 themes that the samÃ¡n left more I 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.380
 I recommend the new applicants 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.689
 medical residences that in the course cto 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.269

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.280
 many contestants the competition is 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.940

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.850
 of the contest this is a process that 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.470
 it requires a lot of effort and dedication 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.360
 that is I consider a student that 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.270
 enroll in the cto and study 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.740
 Pretty confident in themselves to know 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.950
 who already have all the tools 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.080
 necessary to fill 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.360
 satisfactorily your examination and have faith 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.220
 that with dedication and hard work 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.280
 gets good results most 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.780
 important consideration is to keep in mind 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.500
 that you have to be calm and sure of 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.640
 yourself and if you already amazing in the cto 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.640
 this is a fact that you are inside 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.470
 hello I'm darth and rosemary and could have the 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.050
 first place in the national competition 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.880
 residences of the year 2012 that gave me the 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.590
 opportunity to get the 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.730
 specialty of otorhinolaryngology and 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.590
 head and neck surgery in the 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.090
 hospital salvador gautier esta 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.740
 specialty is a specialty that has 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.050
 gone growing is extremely important 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.500
 because it is one of the most innovative in 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.460
 these modern times and therefore 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.290
 I think it should be a great option 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.500
 a good option for all of you to 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.290
 the new residents, I urge you 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.420
 understand that this first step of your 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.510
 first year is a very big sacrifice 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.530
 what they should do must learn to tolerate 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.680
 they should always have a positive attitude 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.520
 and they should always arrive day by day to 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.520
 learn something new
