00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.899 

um<00:00:01.290> definitely<00:00:01.650> I<00:00:01.890> think<00:00:01.949> when<00:00:02.310> you<00:00:02.399> go<00:00:02.550> up<00:00:02.639> 2-0

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
um definitely I think when you go up 2-0

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.329 
um definitely I think when you go up 2-0
in<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.449> first<00:00:03.780> half<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.410> you<00:00:04.859> let<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:05.130> team

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
in the first half and you let the team

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.120 
in the first half and you let the team
back<00:00:05.580> in<00:00:06.379> you<00:00:07.379> know<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.529> think<00:00:07.620> we<00:00:07.859> fought<00:00:08.099> hard

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
back in you know I think we fought hard

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.759 
back in you know I think we fought hard
but<00:00:08.490> not<00:00:08.970> hard<00:00:09.240> enough<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.840> we<00:00:10.500> have<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.620> lot<00:00:10.650> of

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
but not hard enough and we have a lot of

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.140 
but not hard enough and we have a lot of
lessons<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.309> think<00:00:11.519> we<00:00:11.610> can<00:00:11.730> take<00:00:11.910> away<00:00:12.120> from

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
lessons I think we can take away from

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.680 
lessons I think we can take away from
this<00:00:12.480> we<00:00:12.719> scored<00:00:13.110> first<00:00:13.410> we<00:00:14.000> which<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.150> was<00:00:15.450> one

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
this we scored first we which is was one

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.200 
this we scored first we which is was one
of<00:00:15.780> our<00:00:15.900> objectives<00:00:16.590> today<00:00:16.800> but<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.670> think<00:00:18.000> all

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
of our objectives today but I think all

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.480 
of our objectives today but I think all
of<00:00:18.240> us<00:00:18.510> definitely<00:00:18.869> feel<00:00:19.320> like<00:00:19.590> we<00:00:20.100> let<00:00:20.310> them

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
of us definitely feel like we let them

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.060 
of us definitely feel like we let them
and<00:00:20.760> we<00:00:21.050> let<00:00:22.050> them<00:00:22.170> back<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.650> game<00:00:22.800> and

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
and we let them back in the game and

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.370 
and we let them back in the game and
that's<00:00:23.369> unacceptable<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:24.779> just<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.260> to

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
that's unacceptable and we just have to

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.500 
that's unacceptable and we just have to
find<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.650> way<00:00:25.710> when<00:00:26.519> we<00:00:26.640> do<00:00:26.820> get<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.119> lead<00:00:27.300> to

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
find a way when we do get the lead to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.290 
find a way when we do get the lead to
keep<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:28.859> definitely<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.760> something

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
keep it so we definitely have something

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.459 
keep it so we definitely have something
to<00:00:30.570> build<00:00:30.750> upon<00:00:31.550> but<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.820> doesn't<00:00:33.329> feel<00:00:33.660> like<00:00:34.410> a

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
to build upon but it doesn't feel like a

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:42.049 
to build upon but it doesn't feel like a
tie<00:00:34.739> that's<00:00:34.950> for<00:00:35.190> sure<00:00:37.460> which<00:00:38.460> one<00:00:40.820> their<00:00:41.820> goal

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
tie that's for sure which one their goal

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.190 
tie that's for sure which one their goal
oh<00:00:42.680> my<00:00:43.680> goal<00:00:43.890> um<00:00:44.239> yeah<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.360> was<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> corner<00:00:46.170> kick

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
oh my goal um yeah it was a corner kick

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.950 
oh my goal um yeah it was a corner kick
kick<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.399> vieira<00:00:48.059> found<00:00:48.329> me<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:48.809> able

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
kick and vieira found me and I was able

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.380 
kick and vieira found me and I was able
to<00:00:49.110> take<00:00:49.980> kind<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.309> an<00:00:50.399> awkward<00:00:50.550> first<00:00:51.030> touch

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
to take kind of an awkward first touch

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.090 
to take kind of an awkward first touch
and<00:00:51.690> then<00:00:51.840> beat<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> player<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.710> kind<00:00:53.039> of

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
and then beat a player and just kind of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.779 
and then beat a player and just kind of
slot<00:00:53.340> at<00:00:53.460> far<00:00:53.640> post<00:00:54.379> but<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.410> think<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:56.460> scored

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
slot at far post but I think we scored

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.610 
slot at far post but I think we scored
two<00:00:56.940> goals<00:00:56.969> off<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.539> set<00:00:57.750> pieces<00:00:57.930> today<00:00:58.320> which

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
two goals off of set pieces today which

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.380 
two goals off of set pieces today which
I<00:00:58.739> don't<00:00:58.920> think<00:00:59.190> we've<00:00:59.340> done<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.850> i<00:00:59.879> think<00:01:00.000> for

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
I don't think we've done so i think for

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.529 
I don't think we've done so i think for
as<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> team<00:01:01.140> i<00:01:01.469> think<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.640> maybe<00:01:03.329> that

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
as a team i think that that maybe that

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.750 
as a team i think that that maybe that
piece<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.780> coming<00:01:04.229> together<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:05.610> just

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
piece is coming together and it's just

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.179 
piece is coming together and it's just
about<00:01:06.000> putting<00:01:06.270> all<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.570> pieces<00:01:06.720> together

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
about putting all the pieces together

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.770 
about putting all the pieces together
and<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.760> think<00:01:08.790> we<00:01:09.030> all<00:01:09.060> believe<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:09.750> can

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
and I think we all believe that we can

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.980 
and I think we all believe that we can
do<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.580> we're<00:01:11.580> excited<00:01:11.850> for<00:01:12.030> we<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.720> think

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
do that and we're excited for we I think

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.929 
do that and we're excited for we I think
all<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.140> us<00:01:13.320> kind<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.680> want<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.100> next<00:01:14.580> game<00:01:14.729> to

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
all of us kind of want this next game to

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:27.020 
all of us kind of want this next game to
come

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.810 

yeah<00:01:28.030> of<00:01:28.180> course<00:01:28.479> I<00:01:29.259> think<00:01:29.799> it's<00:01:29.979> it's<00:01:30.400> getting

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
yeah of course I think it's it's getting

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.429 
yeah of course I think it's it's getting
down<00:01:30.970> to<00:01:31.030> crunch<00:01:31.180> time<00:01:31.479> a<00:01:31.689> lot<00:01:31.930> of<00:01:32.110> the<00:01:32.229> teams

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
down to crunch time a lot of the teams

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.850 
down to crunch time a lot of the teams
are<00:01:32.680> close<00:01:32.890> together<00:01:33.159> and<00:01:33.580> I<00:01:33.700> think<00:01:34.000> that<00:01:34.860> you

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
are close together and I think that you

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.160 
are close together and I think that you
know<00:01:36.009> it's<00:01:36.159> a<00:01:36.340> it's<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:37.210> short<00:01:37.479> season<00:01:37.689> but<00:01:38.080> it

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
know it's a it's a short season but it

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.260 
know it's a it's a short season but it
is<00:01:38.290> a<00:01:38.320> journey<00:01:38.649> and<00:01:38.799> I<00:01:39.039> think<00:01:39.340> that<00:01:39.549> we<00:01:39.940> aren't

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
is a journey and I think that we aren't

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.020 
is a journey and I think that we aren't
going<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.479> hang<00:01:40.659> our<00:01:40.810> heads<00:01:40.990> you<00:01:41.320> know<00:01:41.440> today

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
going to hang our heads you know today

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.580 
going to hang our heads you know today
we<00:01:43.030> didn't<00:01:43.360> grind<00:01:43.509> it<00:01:43.720> out<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:43.869> I<00:01:44.080> think<00:01:44.380> that

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
we didn't grind it out and I think that

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.580 
we didn't grind it out and I think that
we<00:01:44.950> need<00:01:44.979> to<00:01:45.159> learn<00:01:45.399> how<00:01:45.460> to<00:01:45.670> and<00:01:46.149> I<00:01:46.750> think<00:01:47.470> we

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
we need to learn how to and I think we

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.170 
we need to learn how to and I think we
all<00:01:47.619> believe<00:01:48.070> in<00:01:48.100> each<00:01:48.520> other<00:01:48.670> in<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:48.909> locker

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
all believe in each other in the locker

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.230 
all believe in each other in the locker
room<00:01:49.299> and<00:01:49.720> our<00:01:50.259> journeys<00:01:51.009> to<00:01:51.250> be<00:01:51.399> peaking<00:01:51.909> you

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.999 
know come on end of august but to get
there<00:01:54.850> we<00:01:55.090> need<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.600> start<00:01:55.929> moving<00:01:56.380> forward

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
there we need to start moving forward

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.980 
there we need to start moving forward
and<00:01:57.640> that's<00:01:58.179> what<00:01:58.270> we're<00:01:58.360> going<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.569> focus<00:01:58.690> on

and that's what we're going to focus on

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:14.520 
and that's what we're going to focus on
doing<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:11.700> think<00:02:12.700> that<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.540> more<00:02:13.840> players<00:02:14.290> you

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
doing I think that the more players you

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.960 
doing I think that the more players you
can<00:02:14.560> send<00:02:14.920> forward<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.250> more<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.549> other<00:02:15.640> team

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
can send forward the more the other team

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.880 
can send forward the more the other team
has<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:16.239> worry<00:02:16.540> about<00:02:16.690> you<00:02:16.989> and<00:02:17.260> we<00:02:17.410> have<00:02:17.560> so

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
has to worry about you and we have so

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.030 
has to worry about you and we have so
many<00:02:18.239> unbelievable<00:02:19.239> attacking<00:02:20.019> threats<00:02:20.410> up

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
many unbelievable attacking threats up

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.949 
many unbelievable attacking threats up
the<00:02:21.430> kind<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.850> center<00:02:22.180> of<00:02:22.239> our<00:02:22.480> feet<00:02:22.810> of

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
the kind of the center of our feet of

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.590 
the kind of the center of our feet of
the<00:02:23.319> field<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:24.519> when<00:02:24.700> Steph<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.120> I<00:02:25.180> or<00:02:25.330> any<00:02:25.480> of

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
the field so when Steph and I or any of

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.940 
the field so when Steph and I or any of
the<00:02:25.660> outside<00:02:25.989> backs<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.440> have<00:02:26.530> played<00:02:26.709> can

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
the outside backs that have played can

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.759 
the outside backs that have played can
get<00:02:27.160> forward<00:02:27.549> and<00:02:27.640> wit<00:02:27.790> balls<00:02:28.000> in<00:02:28.239> um<00:02:28.480> we<00:02:29.470> have

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
get forward and wit balls in um we have

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.949 
get forward and wit balls in um we have
the<00:02:30.280> players<00:02:30.549> who<00:02:30.880> can<00:02:31.030> finish<00:02:31.299> in<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.720> box

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
the players who can finish in the box

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.630 
the players who can finish in the box
and<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.320> think<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.680> that's<00:02:32.709> really<00:02:33.160> important

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
and I think that that's really important

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.880 
and I think that that's really important
and<00:02:33.730> part<00:02:33.970> of<00:02:34.120> our<00:02:34.359> definitely<00:02:35.260> part<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.590> the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
and part of our definitely part of the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.440 
and part of our definitely part of the
way<00:02:36.010> that<00:02:36.040> Paul<00:02:36.400> likes<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.820> play<00:02:37.000> in<00:02:37.120> our<00:02:37.180> game

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
way that Paul likes to play in our game

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.970 
way that Paul likes to play in our game
plan<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:38.079> think<00:02:38.290> it's<00:02:38.590> very<00:02:38.920> important<00:02:40.980> it's

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
plan so I think it's very important it's

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.270 
plan so I think it's very important it's
good<00:02:42.840> Ivan<00:02:43.840> played<00:02:44.170> with<00:02:44.350> Tobin<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:45.130> know

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
good Ivan played with Tobin you know

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.090 
good Ivan played with Tobin you know
quite<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:46.000> bit<00:02:46.120> just<00:02:46.930> more<00:02:47.170> pick<00:02:47.440> up<00:02:47.650> but<00:02:47.950> um

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
quite a bit just more pick up but um

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.949 
quite a bit just more pick up but um
it's<00:02:48.549> good<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.880> have<00:02:49.030> her<00:02:49.239> back<00:02:49.269> in<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.720> mix

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
it's good to have her back in the mix

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.289 
it's good to have her back in the mix
and<00:02:50.200> I<00:02:50.290> think<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.829> we<00:02:51.430> integrated<00:02:51.880> her<00:02:52.120> well

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
and I think that we integrated her well

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.240 
and I think that we integrated her well
today<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.900> think<00:02:53.230> it's<00:02:53.440> just<00:02:53.799> another<00:02:54.040> one

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
today and I think it's just another one

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.650 
today and I think it's just another one
of<00:02:54.280> those<00:02:54.430> pieces<00:02:54.700> we're<00:02:55.090> just<00:02:55.269> going<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.450> keep

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
of those pieces we're just going to keep

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.449 
of those pieces we're just going to keep
building<00:02:55.930> upon<00:02:56.320> and<00:02:56.590> she<00:02:56.799> can<00:02:56.980> build

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
building upon and she can build

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.009 
building upon and she can build
relationships<00:02:58.180> with<00:02:58.269> that<00:02:58.510> diamond<00:02:58.900> in<00:02:58.989> the

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
relationships with that diamond in the

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.979 
relationships with that diamond in the
middle<00:02:59.109> and<00:02:59.730> the<00:03:00.730> two<00:03:00.910> up<00:03:01.120> top<00:03:01.329> and<00:03:01.630> i<00:03:01.720> think

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
middle and the two up top and i think

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.740 
middle and the two up top and i think
that<00:03:02.730> there's<00:03:03.730> gonna<00:03:03.970> be<00:03:04.209> some<00:03:04.390> good<00:03:04.510> things

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
that there's gonna be some good things

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.720 
that there's gonna be some good things
to<00:03:04.930> come<00:03:04.959> she's<00:03:05.500> an<00:03:05.650> amazing<00:03:06.010> player<00:03:06.220> that's

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
to come she's an amazing player that's

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:19.070 
to come she's an amazing player that's
for<00:03:06.910> sure

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.560 

yeah<00:03:20.080> I<00:03:20.710> mean<00:03:20.800> I<00:03:21.040> think<00:03:21.070> that<00:03:21.460> that's<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:22.360> guess

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
yeah I mean I think that that's I guess

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.900 
yeah I mean I think that that's I guess
what<00:03:22.930> cultural<00:03:23.350> figure<00:03:23.860> out<00:03:24.010> but<00:03:24.280> I<00:03:24.310> think<00:03:24.670> for

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
what cultural figure out but I think for

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.840 
what cultural figure out but I think for
us<00:03:25.030> as<00:03:25.240> players<00:03:25.420> now<00:03:26.230> seeing<00:03:26.590> them<00:03:26.800> we<00:03:27.010> know<00:03:27.220> we

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
us as players now seeing them we know we

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.850 
us as players now seeing them we know we
can<00:03:28.030> kind<00:03:28.180> of<00:03:28.300> look<00:03:29.170> back<00:03:29.230> at<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.650> game<00:03:29.830> and

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
can kind of look back at the game and

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.620 
can kind of look back at the game and
evaluate<00:03:30.490> what<00:03:30.700> worked<00:03:30.910> what<00:03:31.180> didn't<00:03:31.540> work

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
evaluate what worked what didn't work

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.990 
evaluate what worked what didn't work
but<00:03:32.140> I<00:03:32.200> think<00:03:32.470> in<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.650> first<00:03:32.890> half<00:03:33.070> we<00:03:33.340> we<00:03:33.790> had

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
but I think in the first half we we had

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.460 
but I think in the first half we we had
the<00:03:34.120> ball<00:03:34.300> quite<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.570> bit<00:03:34.780> and<00:03:34.900> in<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.140> second

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
the ball quite a bit and in the second

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.560 
the ball quite a bit and in the second
half<00:03:35.560> we<00:03:35.680> just<00:03:35.890> let<00:03:36.070> them<00:03:36.250> have<00:03:36.550> it<00:03:36.580> more<00:03:36.970> so<00:03:37.540> I

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
half we just let them have it more so I

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.270 
half we just let them have it more so I
think<00:03:37.720> it's<00:03:37.990> a<00:03:38.110> lot<00:03:38.260> of<00:03:38.350> things<00:03:38.560> we<00:03:38.770> can<00:03:38.980> fix

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
think it's a lot of things we can fix

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.520 
think it's a lot of things we can fix
and<00:03:39.550> we<00:03:39.580> can<00:03:39.850> adjust<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:40.540> just<00:03:41.110> not<00:03:41.230> let<00:03:41.260> up

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
and we can adjust and just not let up

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.180 
and we can adjust and just not let up
our<00:03:41.680> pressure<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.250> I<00:03:42.310> think<00:03:42.580> that<00:03:43.320> it's<00:03:44.320> it'll

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
our pressure and I think that it's it'll

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.290 
our pressure and I think that it's it'll
be<00:03:45.310> good<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.550> go<00:03:45.670> into<00:03:45.820> their<00:03:46.030> home<00:03:46.270> and

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
be good to go into their home and

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.830 
be good to go into their home and
hopefully<00:03:46.570> take<00:03:47.020> three<00:03:47.260> points<00:03:47.440> so
