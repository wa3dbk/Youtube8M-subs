00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
time to look at it so but I'm going to

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.010 
time to look at it so but I'm going to
put<00:00:41.399> some<00:00:41.430> key<00:00:42.000> points<00:00:42.239> here<00:00:42.450> there's

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
put some key points here there's

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.600 
put some key points here there's
actually<00:00:43.560> some<00:00:43.710> good<00:00:43.860> points<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.399> thing

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
actually some good points to this thing

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.470 
actually some good points to this thing
believe<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.000> or<00:00:45.060> not<00:00:45.680> the<00:00:46.680> remote<00:00:47.010> runs<00:00:47.519> on<00:00:47.760> 900

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
believe it or not the remote runs on 900

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.150 
believe it or not the remote runs on 900
megahertz<00:00:48.719> band<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.620> that's<00:00:49.800> actually<00:00:49.949> a

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
megahertz band so that's actually a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.229 
megahertz band so that's actually a
really<00:00:50.219> good<00:00:50.399> point<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.120> also

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
really good point because it's also

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.650 
really good point because it's also
going<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.480> give<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.809> some<00:00:52.050> good<00:00:52.649> long-range

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
going to give you some good long-range

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.130 
going to give you some good long-range
you<00:00:54.660> can<00:00:54.809> run<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.109> two<00:00:55.500> different<00:00:56.190> machines

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
you can run up to two different machines

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.680 
you can run up to two different machines
within<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.350> 900<00:00:58.800> megahertz<00:00:59.039> band<00:00:59.539> so<00:01:00.539> that's

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
within the 900 megahertz band so that's

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.410 
within the 900 megahertz band so that's
that's<00:01:01.170> actually<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.710> cool<00:01:02.190> little<00:01:02.309> bonus<00:01:02.760> it

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420

that's actually a cool little bonus it
does<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:04.160> digital<00:01:05.720> speed<00:01:06.720> control<00:01:07.230> or

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
does have digital speed control or

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.340 
does have digital speed control or
you're<00:01:08.310> you're<00:01:08.790> running<00:01:09.150> but<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.960> still<00:01:10.020> have

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
are actually nice as far as the tread

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.040 
are actually nice as far as the tread
goes<00:01:52.190> there<00:01:53.190> they're<00:01:53.490> pretty<00:01:53.520> grippy<00:01:55.460> but<00:01:57.050> the

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
goes there they're pretty grippy but the

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.030 
goes there they're pretty grippy but the
front<00:01:59.010> end<00:01:59.250> has<00:01:59.730> its<00:02:00.300> weak<00:02:00.570> point<00:02:00.930> okay<00:02:01.320> before

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
front end has its weak point okay before

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.580 
front end has its weak point okay before
we<00:02:02.280> get<00:02:02.370> into<00:02:02.580> that<00:02:02.640> your<00:02:03.450> rear<00:02:03.780> shocks<00:02:04.200> are

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
we get into that your rear shocks are

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.620 
we get into that your rear shocks are
actually<00:02:04.950> faked<00:02:05.310> your<00:02:06.030> front<00:02:06.300> shocks

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
actually faked your front shocks

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.240 
actually faked your front shocks
actually<00:02:07.200> are<00:02:07.470> believe<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.129> or<00:02:08.190> not

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
actually are believe it or not

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.609 
actually are believe it or not
functional<00:02:08.910> which<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.209> amazing<00:02:09.450> but<00:02:10.200> that's

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
functional which is amazing but that's

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.750 
functional which is amazing but that's
really<00:02:10.950> cool<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:13.500> front<00:02:13.800> end<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.250> actually

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
really cool the front end is actually

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.140 
really cool the front end is actually
the<00:02:15.000> biggest<00:02:15.180> drawback<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:16.340> for<00:02:17.340> one<00:02:17.610> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
the biggest drawback to this for one the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.259 
the biggest drawback to this for one the
front<00:02:18.420> end<00:02:18.569> is<00:02:18.720> actually<00:02:19.080> very<00:02:19.319> very<00:02:19.980> light<00:02:20.459> so

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
front end is actually very very light so

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.150 
front end is actually very very light so
it's<00:02:21.720> very<00:02:22.050> hard<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.440> get<00:02:22.680> any<00:02:22.860> kind<00:02:22.950> of

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
it's very hard to get any kind of

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.770 
it's very hard to get any kind of
traction<00:02:23.460> out<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.060> front<00:02:24.330> end

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
traction out of the front end

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.350 
traction out of the front end
also<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:26.130> don't<00:02:26.580> know<00:02:26.670> how<00:02:26.850> well<00:02:27.090> you're<00:02:27.240> going

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
also I don't know how well you're going

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.559 
also I don't know how well you're going
to<00:02:27.450> see<00:02:27.630> this<00:02:27.840> but<00:02:28.970> lifting<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.120> up<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.480> then

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
to see this but lifting it up and then

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.020 
to see this but lifting it up and then
putting<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:31.020> down<00:02:31.260> you'll<00:02:32.130> notice<00:02:32.550> that<00:02:32.580> your

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
putting it down you'll notice that your

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.840 
putting it down you'll notice that your
front<00:02:33.420> tire<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:33.720> really<00:02:34.530> cocky<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.220> lot<00:02:35.520> on

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
front tire is really cocky and a lot on

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.320 
front tire is really cocky and a lot on
the<00:02:36.030> top<00:02:36.209> ends<00:02:36.660> right<00:02:37.230> there<00:02:37.290> they're<00:02:38.040> bad<00:02:38.430> you

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
the top ends right there they're bad you

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.479 
the top ends right there they're bad you
know<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:40.140> makes<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.500> very<00:02:40.680> hard<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:41.130> control

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
know this makes it very hard to control

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.340 
know this makes it very hard to control
for<00:02:41.850> steering<00:02:42.180> why's<00:02:44.239> it<00:02:45.239> just<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.930> wants<00:02:46.230> to

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
for steering why's it just it wants to

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.890 
for steering why's it just it wants to
spin<00:02:46.620> out<00:02:46.680> too<00:02:47.190> much<00:02:47.400> like<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.360> you<00:02:48.569> can

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
spin out too much like you you can

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.330 
spin out too much like you you can
barely<00:02:49.260> get<00:02:49.380> this<00:02:49.590> thing<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:49.890> go<00:02:49.920> straight

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
barely get this thing to go straight

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.479

better outside in the gravel I actually

took it out on the street today and I

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.949 
took it out on the street today and I

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
winter but I thought you know what I

winter but I thought you know what I
give<00:03:09.480> up<00:03:09.630> in<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.900> house<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:10.319> had<00:03:10.560> enough<00:03:10.860> it

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
give up in the house I had enough it

frustrated me to no end and I don't

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.259

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
really have enough carpet to make it

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.699 
really have enough carpet to make it
worth<00:03:15.420> while<00:03:15.600> driving<00:03:16.019> on<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.170> carpet<00:03:16.500> but<00:03:16.590> it

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
worth while driving on the carpet but it

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.690 
worth while driving on the carpet but it
should<00:03:16.860> drive<00:03:17.100> on<00:03:17.250> all<00:03:17.340> surfaces<00:03:18.920> but<00:03:19.920> other

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
should drive on all surfaces but other

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.430 
should drive on all surfaces but other
Road<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.209> actually<00:03:21.600> didn't<00:03:21.900> do<00:03:22.050> a<00:03:22.080> whole<00:03:22.200> lot

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
Road it actually didn't do a whole lot

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.900 
Road it actually didn't do a whole lot
better<00:03:22.940> it<00:03:23.940> very<00:03:24.420> skittish<00:03:25.019> to<00:03:25.519> you<00:03:26.519> have<00:03:26.760> to

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
better it very skittish to you have to

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.240 
better it very skittish to you have to
drive<00:03:27.209> as<00:03:27.450> slow<00:03:27.660> as<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:27.989> can<00:03:28.140> possibly<00:03:28.590> go

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
drive as slow as you can possibly go

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.880 
drive as slow as you can possibly go
just<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.269> get<00:03:30.630> any<00:03:30.870> kind<00:03:31.110> of<00:03:31.230> traction<00:03:31.530> and

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
just to get any kind of traction and

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.130 
just to get any kind of traction and
even<00:03:32.010> its<00:03:32.430> slowest<00:03:32.940> speed<00:03:33.209> it's<00:03:33.450> very<00:03:33.750> fast

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
even its slowest speed it's very fast

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.160 
even its slowest speed it's very fast
they<00:03:34.890> actually<00:03:35.250> put<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:35.790> lot<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.480> torque<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.079> a

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
they actually put a lot of torque and a

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.690 
they actually put a lot of torque and a
lot<00:03:37.350> of<00:03:37.380> speed<00:03:37.739> into<00:03:38.010> this<00:03:38.130> thing<00:03:38.340> which<00:03:38.519> was

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
lot of speed into this thing which was

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.479 
lot of speed into this thing which was
just<00:03:39.150> it's<00:03:39.570> amazing<00:03:40.019> you<00:03:40.620> know<00:03:40.650> for<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.340> new

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
no on and off switch by the way for the

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.120 
no on and off switch by the way for the
remote<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:54.750> it<00:03:55.380> does<00:03:55.560> come<00:03:55.799> with<00:03:55.829> all<00:03:56.100> the

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
remote and it does come with all the

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.920 
remote and it does come with all the
batteries<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:57.090> there's<00:03:57.269> a<00:03:57.359> built-in<00:03:57.570> lithium

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
batteries and there's a built-in lithium

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.319 
batteries and there's a built-in lithium
ion<00:03:58.380> battery<00:03:58.739> in<00:03:58.920> here<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.400> of<00:03:59.970> course<00:04:00.209> they

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
ion battery in here and of course they

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.280 
ion battery in here and of course they
give<00:04:00.510> this<00:04:00.660> really<00:04:01.019> cool<00:04:01.200> looking<00:04:01.620> USB<00:04:02.459> cable

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
give this really cool looking USB cable

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:11.710 
give this really cool looking USB cable
so<00:04:04.290> on<00:04:04.829> the<00:04:05.250> slowest<00:04:05.730> speed<00:04:06.030> here<00:04:09.590> though<00:04:10.590> here

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
so on the slowest speed here though here

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.490 
so on the slowest speed here though here
that's<00:04:12.720> running<00:04:13.200> really<00:04:13.769> super

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
that's running really super

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.280 
that's running really super
I<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:16.120> then<00:04:16.359> of<00:04:16.630> course<00:04:16.660> it<00:04:17.019> will<00:04:17.079> ring<00:04:17.230> the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
I and then of course it will ring the

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.900 
I and then of course it will ring the
speed<00:04:17.680> up<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:20.590> can<00:04:20.739> hear<00:04:21.040> just<00:04:21.430> a<00:04:21.579> bit<00:04:21.790> of

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
speed up you can hear just a bit of

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.880 
speed up you can hear just a bit of
difference<00:04:22.150> in<00:04:22.450> picture<00:04:22.690> that<00:04:23.050> winds<00:04:23.530> rate<00:04:23.740> up

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
difference in picture that winds rate up

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:35.020 
difference in picture that winds rate up
full<00:04:24.160> blast<00:04:25.290> as<00:04:26.290> far<00:04:26.530> as<00:04:26.560> bernos<00:04:27.070> go

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.150 

it<00:04:35.660> just<00:04:35.870> has<00:04:35.990> too<00:04:36.170> much<00:04:36.320> power<00:04:36.590> so<00:04:36.770> I'll<00:04:36.980> try

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
it just has too much power so I'll try

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.410 
it just has too much power so I'll try
the<00:04:37.220> slowest<00:04:37.820> speed<00:04:38.060> here<00:04:39.880> even<00:04:40.880> as<00:04:41.000> slow<00:04:41.180> as<00:04:41.210> I

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
the slowest speed here even as slow as I

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.700 
the slowest speed here even as slow as I
can<00:04:41.600> get<00:04:41.720> it<00:04:41.780> to<00:04:41.960> go<00:04:42.140> if<00:04:43.990> just<00:04:44.990> sit<00:04:45.260> there<00:04:45.470> to

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
can get it to go if just sit there to

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.220 
can get it to go if just sit there to
her<00:04:45.950> head<00:04:46.160> well<00:04:48.670> they<00:04:49.670> definitely<00:04:50.000> put<00:04:50.630> a<00:04:50.810> lot

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
her head well they definitely put a lot

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.470 
her head well they definitely put a lot
of<00:04:51.260> power<00:04:51.860> into<00:04:52.310> this<00:04:52.430> machine<00:04:52.670> which<00:04:53.090> is<00:04:53.240> very

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
of power into this machine which is very

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.550 
of power into this machine which is very
very<00:04:53.570> amazing<00:04:55.390> but<00:04:56.390> it's<00:04:56.780> really<00:04:57.230> not<00:04:57.500> a

very amazing but it's really not a

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.220 
very amazing but it's really not a
machine<00:04:58.070> that<00:04:58.460> i<00:04:58.790> would<00:04:59.270> recommend<00:04:59.900> to

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.380 
even testing out and it's it's just not
a<00:06:09.470> machine<00:06:09.830> that<00:06:10.340> i<00:06:10.520> would<00:06:10.760> recommend<00:06:11.270> to

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390 
a machine that i would recommend to

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.800 
a machine that i would recommend to
anybody<00:06:11.720> you're<00:06:12.560> just<00:06:12.770> wasting<00:06:13.220> your<00:06:13.250> money

unless it's just for you know put it on

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.630 
unless it's just for you know put it on
the<00:06:16.820> shelf<00:06:17.060> and<00:06:17.210> look<00:06:17.420> at<00:06:17.630> it<00:06:17.660> but<00:06:18.190> it<00:06:19.190> has<00:06:19.370> no

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640 
the shelf and look at it but it has no

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.270 
the shelf and look at it but it has no
practical<00:06:19.910> use<00:06:20.300> to<00:06:20.780> it<00:06:20.930> to<00:06:21.590> be<00:06:21.620> honest<00:06:22.100> with

practical use to it to be honest with
you<00:06:22.460> but<00:06:23.330> anyways<00:06:24.230> that's<00:06:24.560> my<00:06:25.220> viewpoints<00:06:26.120> on

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
you but anyways that's my viewpoints on

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.820 
you but anyways that's my viewpoints on
this<00:06:26.450> machine<00:06:27.220> so<00:06:28.220> you<00:06:28.250> know<00:06:28.670> i<00:06:29.830> would
