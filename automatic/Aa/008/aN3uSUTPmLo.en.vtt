00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:12.490
 Hello, how are you welcome? 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.590
 we are going to start the season of 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:19.250
 heat and spring approaches 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.520
 and for these heats, they seem like 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:28.610
 some paddles or a snow what do you think 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:32.360
 if we prepare a few pops of strawberry but 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.970
 we are going to do with luxuries need me 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.300
 I'm going to do only a few and I'm going to occupy 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:42.520
 half a cup of yogurt can already be natural 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:46.060
 Strawberry flavor that you want 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:50.280
 we are also going to need 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.280
 and one teaspoon 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:58.700
 half a cup of water 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:03.750
 we are also going to need sticks 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:07.270
 and our palette molds 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.939
 well then 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.070
 what I'm going to do is that I'm going to 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:15.689
 Empty the yogurt in the blender can 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.689
 do it also in the hand blender 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.630
 I'll put 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.080
 I'm going to empty the half cup of water 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.290
 guava making 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:40.450
 and in the other I'm going to put 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.450
 the teaspoon of grenetina 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.800
 and I will let it hydrate 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.520
 and I 'm not going to start 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.150
 beat the yogurt 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.860
 with water 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.860
 equal to hydrate from this great lie 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.870
 Once I'm going to take you to the 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.690
 microwave oven to dilute it and the 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:13.350
 I'm going to incorporate 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.350
 I already have life the truth 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.630
 air 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.940
 I'm going to put a little bit of the rest 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.890
 after 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:36.140
 it is optional if you are that he yes no 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:40.010
 and I will continue to beat well 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.370
 yogurt should stay with us as we are 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.370
 milestone 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.940
 is going to make us 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.940
 a foam 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.610
 I'm going to empty it 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.610
 to our molds on the pallets 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.150
 man 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.549
 I'm going to put the wooden sticks 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.540
 in a little while, first I'm going to take them 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:26.689
 to the freezer and when they start 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.459
 make ice then I'm going to put the 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:32.480
 stick because if I put them right now 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:35.090
 Logically, it takes me there, everything is done and 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.569
 they will not fit me then if you 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.940
 they want to put it on, put a paper on it 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.830
 aluminum 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.970
 and put the stick for those who have 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.610
 straight 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.400
 what I'm going to do is that first I go 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:53.440
 to take a few minutes of the freezer 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.440
 and then I'm going to put the stick 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.189
 after Aaron 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.569
 several hours since we made the 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:02.060
 pallets 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.780
 and we are going to disassemble them to see if 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.780
 carlos is 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.690
 to unmold the 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:15.230
 and I recommend that you put them in a lot 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.230
 of water 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.440
 so they can be demold 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:47.139
 well here already 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.030
 we have our pallets 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.650
 here we have them 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.650
 this way we have our palettes 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:07.569
 these are the offerings I put them 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:09.740
 little bit of concentrate so they had 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:12.139
 more flavour 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.870
 and how it is concentrated with color because it 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:18.630
 I painted a little bit more on the strawberry 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.370
 these are small I did not put them 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.900
 the concentrate is the directly the 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.790
 yogurt 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.790
 and that's how the color looks 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.370
 they are very rich 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:35.150
 I hope you make them that have 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:38.380
 liked the video that they prepare are 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:41.710
 very economical they will leave several 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.720
 remember that we must beat and beat and the 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.050
 secret is that we go down a lot 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.039
 yogurt 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:52.099
 I believe that minimum is about 30 minutes 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:56.389
 40 minutes beating so that it 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:59.320
 sponge and we left a texture like 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.940
 pallets that sell us in the paleterÃ­a 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.070
 I do not know if they can see 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.920
 is the texture that has which is 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.230
 in 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.660
 it's the same texture it has when 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:15.050
 we bought a palette in a paleteria 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.940
 and now in fact very easy to the are very 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.090
 economic 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.050
 the appearance of your whole family look at me 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.479
 how they were left 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:28.070
 and the truth is so beautiful very very rich 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.750
 do not forget to share the video 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.690
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:36.110
 video that they share that prepare their 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:39.080
 pallets tell me how they were like 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.650
 they came out and they liked it or not 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.650
 they liked 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:47.760
 and thank you very much see you until the 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.760
 next recipe
