00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.760
 but not voted in the toucan different ways to deploy the strong point 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.309
 in this cold pasture 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.359
 we are using some of the characters like chulapa piatÃ£ 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:14.799
 the boyfriend 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.660
 like spiders like that of kunduz with marlos and itself and panic feet 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.310
 also 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.210
 and in a similar move 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.210
 embedded in the soil the h-buster centimeter incorporated to the ground with 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.900
 City 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.609
 in a move similar to not only above 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.469
 seeing how the formation and germination is different when you play seed 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.679
 and lack of rain is a bad formation 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:41.749
 for being the seed launched by what I saw play more so it must be precarious 

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:45.579
 a larger base if I throw the embedded seed fall after working with 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.589
 less Portuguese speaking on the tactical side here we have a portion to the 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:50.760
 treatment done 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.790
 mud-like problem 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.790
 OK 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.270
 in a similar move outside of physical form 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.730
 and bring the less players - my locals fear that the ground 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.180
 we have a training 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.840
 much better than another we played a larger amount a greater descent 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.740
 but tossed the seed 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.150
 Why that happens? 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.150
 because 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.820
 the unit meets the continuity side of the germination process if I play the 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.090
 seed and launched a species that has the sea a sample of bull semen 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.740
 said 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.400
 she eat it will you really it will take a long time to germinate 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.630
 this cut to increase until missing but the lomba the bigger seed while playing it 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.290
 our book for 2 present in the act it absorbs moisture begins the process of 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.030
 germination and absorption of water continues so it can germinate 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.910
 he is the one who says that already issued by the country
