extremely smooth extremely ergonomic the
I<00:01:12.659> KBS<00:01:13.290> system<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.280> here<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.790> ball<00:01:15.570> bearing

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
I KBS system in here is a ball bearing

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.899 
I KBS system in here is a ball bearing
system<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:17.040> he<00:01:17.189> had<00:01:17.280> marked<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.700> blade

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
system it's he had marked on the blade

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.990 
system it's he had marked on the blade
there<00:01:18.500> but<00:01:19.500> basically<00:01:19.860> makes<00:01:20.189> for<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.430> super

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
there but basically makes for a super

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.460 
there but basically makes for a super
smooth<00:01:21.299> knife<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.780> might<00:01:21.960> eventually<00:01:22.290> take

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
smooth knife and I might eventually take

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.719 
smooth knife and I might eventually take
this<00:01:22.590> part<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.950> show<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.159> exactly<00:01:23.400> where<00:01:23.610> it

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
this part to show you exactly where it

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.399 
this part to show you exactly where it
is<00:01:23.790> but<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.509> course<00:01:24.780> there's<00:01:24.960> other<00:01:25.049> sources

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
is but of course there's other sources

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.469 
is but of course there's other sources
you<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.619> go<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.890> see<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:27.150> it's<00:01:27.299> not<00:01:27.420> an

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
you can go to see that but it's not an

completely manual if i push this really
slow<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:31.950> see<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:33.350> but<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.590> super

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
slow you can see that but it is super

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.319 
slow you can see that but it is super
smooth<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.520> little<00:01:35.700> bit<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.880> resistance<00:01:36.090> you

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
smooth the little bit of resistance you

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.749 
smooth the little bit of resistance you
have<00:01:36.479> from<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.900> ball<00:01:37.650> bearing<00:01:38.040> builds<00:01:38.670> up

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
have from the ball bearing builds up

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.490 
have from the ball bearing builds up
just<00:01:39.000> enough<00:01:39.150> pressure<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.810> push<00:01:39.990> down<00:01:40.020> it

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
just enough pressure you push down it

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.310 
just enough pressure you push down it
just<00:01:41.100> glides<00:01:41.549> out<00:01:41.820> perfectly<00:01:42.540> every<00:01:42.869> single

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
just glides out perfectly every single

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.130 
just glides out perfectly every single
