00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
a universal language I always say this

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.420 
a universal language I always say this
is<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.060> truth<00:01:19.330> as<00:01:19.840> far<00:01:19.990> as<00:01:20.229> the<00:01:20.320> sounds<00:01:20.740> in<00:01:21.189> the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
is the truth as far as the sounds in the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
happened I think this is the secret law

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.350 
happened I think this is the secret law
of<00:02:10.050> attraction<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.590> it's<00:02:10.770> best<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:12.090> he's<00:02:12.239> the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
of attraction and it's best and he's the

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.570 
of attraction and it's best and he's the
blueprint<00:02:12.810> for<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.080> think<00:02:13.560> any<00:02:13.890> artist<00:02:14.100> as<00:02:14.400> far
