00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
to the back of the net and now the

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.780 
to the back of the net and now the
Sharks<00:03:22.620> got<00:03:22.769> him<00:03:22.950> right<00:03:23.160> in<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.370> teeth<00:03:23.610> and

Sharks got him right in the teeth and

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.160 
Sharks got him right in the teeth and
honestly<00:03:24.360> I<00:03:24.390> don't<00:03:24.570> know<00:03:24.750> how<00:03:24.870> good<00:03:24.989> this

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
honestly I don't know how good this

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.780 
honestly I don't know how good this
theory<00:03:25.410> is<00:03:25.560> but<00:03:25.769> here's<00:03:26.010> why<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.280> Sharks

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
theory is but here's why the Sharks

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.520 
theory is but here's why the Sharks
might<00:03:27.090> win<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.450> Stanley<00:03:27.750> Cup<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.230> Sharks

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
might win the Stanley Cup so the Sharks

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.620 
might win the Stanley Cup so the Sharks
are<00:03:28.650> dominating<00:03:29.489> one<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.850> best<00:03:30.120> teams<00:03:30.450> in

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
are dominating one of the best teams in

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.120 
are dominating one of the best teams in
the<00:03:30.750> National<00:03:31.170> Hockey<00:03:31.290> League<00:03:31.530> I<00:03:31.709> don't<00:03:31.920> think

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
the National Hockey League I don't think

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.580 
the National Hockey League I don't think
anyone<00:03:32.640> had<00:03:32.940> this<00:03:33.150> series<00:03:33.630> being<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.989> sweep<00:03:34.320> and

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
anyone had this series being a sweep and

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.810 
anyone had this series being a sweep and
it's<00:03:34.680> not<00:03:34.890> a<00:03:34.920> sweep<00:03:35.250> yet<00:03:35.489> but<00:03:35.640> it's<00:03:35.760> looking

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
it's not a sweep yet but it's looking

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.670 
it's not a sweep yet but it's looking
that<00:03:36.060> way<00:03:36.209> they're<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.600> great<00:03:36.959> mixture<00:03:37.320> of

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
that way they're a great mixture of

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.620 
that way they're a great mixture of
youth<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.400> experience<00:03:38.609> if<00:03:39.299> they<00:03:39.390> get<00:03:39.600> a

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
youth and experience if they get a

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.330 
youth and experience if they get a
little<00:03:39.750> goaltending<00:03:40.380> holy<00:03:40.739> crap<00:03:41.010> but<00:03:41.190> think

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
little goaltending holy crap but think

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.190 
little goaltending holy crap but think
about<00:03:41.519> this<00:03:41.640> it's<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.120> San<00:03:42.420> Jose<00:03:42.630> Sharks<00:03:42.780> who
