00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
when I got the game it was very much

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.170 
when I got the game it was very much
indeed<00:00:35.350> like<00:00:35.590> talking<00:00:36.010> tango<00:00:36.370> but<00:00:36.550> there<00:00:36.940> were

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
indeed like talking tango but there were

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.200 
indeed like talking tango but there were
some<00:00:37.390> differences<00:00:37.600> and<00:00:38.110> it<00:00:38.830> was<00:00:39.730> interesting

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
some differences and it was interesting

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.640 
some differences and it was interesting

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
let me just show you in the box there's

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.170 
let me just show you in the box there's
a<00:00:41.710> nice<00:00:41.860> plastic<00:00:42.160> insert<00:00:42.640> here<00:00:42.790> you<00:00:42.940> can<00:00:43.060> see

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
a nice plastic insert here you can see

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.480 
a nice plastic insert here you can see
the<00:00:43.329> pieces<00:00:43.630> that<00:00:43.780> come<00:00:43.900> inside<00:00:44.230> and<00:00:44.470> I<00:00:45.160> was

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490 
the pieces that come inside and I was

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.130 
the pieces that come inside and I was
really<00:00:45.760> curious<00:00:45.970> what<00:00:46.420> these<00:00:46.690> were<00:00:46.870> I<00:00:46.900> thought

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
really curious what these were I thought

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.360 
really curious what these were I thought
is<00:00:47.320> that<00:00:47.380> some<00:00:47.590> kind<00:00:47.770> of<00:00:47.800> cup<00:00:47.980> holder<00:00:48.250> but

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
is that some kind of cup holder but

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.390 
is that some kind of cup holder but
apparently<00:00:48.880> these<00:00:49.630> are<00:00:50.020> special<00:00:50.530> synapse

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
apparently these are special synapse

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.479 
apparently these are special synapse
bracelets<00:00:52.120> because<00:00:52.570> they<00:00:53.140> snap<00:00:53.950> around<00:00:54.310> your

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
bracelets because they snap around your

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.420 
bracelets because they snap around your
wrist<00:00:54.760> like<00:00:55.000> this<00:00:55.210> and<00:00:55.750> oh<00:00:56.380> I'm<00:00:56.710> stylish<00:00:57.220> now

simple word recipe what have you did um

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.880 
simple word recipe what have you did um
basket<00:02:13.180> words<00:02:13.599> that<00:02:13.689> are<00:02:13.840> fairly<00:02:14.349> easy<00:02:14.620> to

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
basket words that are fairly easy to

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:15.840 
basket words that are fairly easy to
guess

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
guess

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.580 
guess
then<00:02:15.940> there's<00:02:16.150> on<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.930> bottom<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.320> the<00:02:17.380> car<00:02:17.560> to

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
then there's on the bottom of the car to

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.650 
then there's on the bottom of the car to
surge<00:02:17.980> which<00:02:18.250> is<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.400> much<00:02:18.580> harder<00:02:18.880> word<00:02:19.210> or<00:02:19.450> at

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
surge which is a much harder word or at

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.240 
surge which is a much harder word or at
least<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.990> more<00:02:20.320> difficult<00:02:20.500> word<00:02:21.010> like

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
least a more difficult word like

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.000 
least a more difficult word like
inspiration<00:02:22.090> or<00:02:22.240> warranty<00:02:22.900> then<00:02:23.800> there's

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
inspiration or warranty then there's

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.470 
inspiration or warranty then there's
brain<00:02:24.310> chain<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:24.820> that's<00:02:24.940> basically<00:02:25.120> just

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
brain chain and that's basically just

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.750 
brain chain and that's basically just
two<00:02:25.690> words<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.110> rhyme<00:02:26.440> for<00:02:27.160> example<00:02:27.520> mellow

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
two words that rhyme for example mellow

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.960 
two words that rhyme for example mellow
yellow<00:02:28.270> or<00:02:28.510> lazy<00:02:29.110> daisy<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.890> you<00:02:30.730> have<00:02:30.880> to

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
yellow or lazy daisy and you have to

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.550 
yellow or lazy daisy and you have to
guess<00:02:31.090> both<00:02:31.330> words<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.870> get<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.110> clue<00:02:32.290> right

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
guess both words to get the clue right

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.110 
guess both words to get the clue right
and<00:02:32.770> then<00:02:33.010> there's<00:02:33.220> cross<00:02:33.460> currents<00:02:33.880> in<00:02:33.970> which

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
and then there's cross currents in which

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.180 
and then there's cross currents in which
both<00:02:34.660> words<00:02:34.990> start<00:02:35.410> with<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.620> same<00:02:35.890> letter

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
both words start with the same letter

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.670 
both words start with the same letter
alliteration<00:02:36.910> bad<00:02:37.210> breath<00:02:37.540> or<00:02:37.840> sixth<00:02:38.290> sense

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
alliteration bad breath or sixth sense

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.460 
alliteration bad breath or sixth sense
and<00:02:38.980> so<00:02:39.790> everyone<00:02:40.480> looks<00:02:40.750> at<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.960> clue<00:02:41.140> except

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
and so everyone looks at the clue except

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.100 
and so everyone looks at the clue except
for<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.680> guesser<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.190> then<00:02:42.790> they<00:02:43.690> start<00:02:44.020> the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
for the guesser and then they start the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.610 
for the guesser and then they start the
timer<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.940> timer<00:02:46.420> is<00:02:46.540> going<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.020> they

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
timer and the timer is going and they

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.640 
timer and the timer is going and they
each<00:02:47.890> all<00:02:48.760> together<00:02:49.150> as<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.450> team<00:02:49.720> are<00:02:49.960> giving<00:02:50.500> a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
each all together as a team are giving a

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.890 
each all together as a team are giving a
clue<00:02:51.100> to<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.520> guesser<00:02:51.850> but<00:02:52.330> they<00:02:52.450> do<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.690> one

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
clue to the guesser but they do it one

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.420 
clue to the guesser but they do it one
word<00:02:53.080> at<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.260> time<00:02:53.290> one<00:02:53.470> person<00:02:54.040> will<00:02:54.130> start

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
word at a time one person will start

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.610 
word at a time one person will start

is and and they keep going back and

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.960 
is and and they keep going back and
forth<00:02:59.680> until<00:02:59.890> they<00:03:00.190> finish<00:03:00.460> your<00:03:00.610> sentence

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
sentence you can say blank you know this

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.830 
sentence you can say blank you know this
is<00:03:07.720> something<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:08.920> barks<00:03:09.400> is<00:03:09.580> a<00:03:10.060> blank<00:03:10.510> and

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
is something that barks is a blank and

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.390 
is something that barks is a blank and
the<00:03:11.440> other<00:03:11.560> person<00:03:11.860> is<00:03:11.950> trying<00:03:12.100> to<00:03:12.220> guess<00:03:12.370> the

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
the other person is trying to guess the

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.880 
the other person is trying to guess the
word<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.090> once<00:03:13.960> as<00:03:14.170> soon<00:03:14.320> as<00:03:14.410> they<00:03:14.500> guess<00:03:14.680> it

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
word and once as soon as they guess it

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.340 
word and once as soon as they guess it
you<00:03:15.340> hit<00:03:15.520> the<00:03:15.640> timer<00:03:16.210> to<00:03:16.510> show<00:03:16.840> that<00:03:16.960> you<00:03:17.080> stop

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
you hit the timer to show that you stop

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.590 
you hit the timer to show that you stop
and<00:03:17.590> then<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.800> says<00:03:18.010> look<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.910> took<00:03:19.030> us<00:03:19.150> 31

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
and then it says look it took us 31

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.420 
and then it says look it took us 31
seconds<00:03:19.960> to<00:03:20.080> guess<00:03:20.230> that<00:03:20.260> word<00:03:20.710> and<00:03:20.980> we<00:03:21.310> get

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
seconds to guess that word and we get

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.940 
seconds to guess that word and we get
three<00:03:21.700> points<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.360> so<00:03:23.110> that's<00:03:23.320> basically<00:03:23.470> the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
three points and so that's basically the

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.800 
three points and so that's basically the
game<00:03:24.190> will<00:03:24.310> actually<00:03:24.610> keep<00:03:24.760> track<00:03:24.820> of<00:03:25.060> which

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
game will actually keep track of which

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.230 
game will actually keep track of which
team<00:03:26.110> scores<00:03:26.470> which<00:03:26.680> point<00:03:27.040> continuing<00:03:27.820> on

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
team scores which point continuing on

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.330 
team scores which point continuing on
with<00:03:28.420> that<00:03:28.570> tremendously<00:03:29.350> delightful<00:03:30.070> sound

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
with that tremendously delightful sound

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.520 
with that tremendously delightful sound
and<00:03:31.120> then<00:03:31.450> it<00:03:31.540> goes<00:03:31.630> to<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.840> next<00:03:32.080> player<00:03:32.290> if

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
and then it goes to the next player if

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.470 
and then it goes to the next player if
you<00:03:33.130> can't<00:03:33.430> guess<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.670> word<00:03:33.970> play

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
you can't guess the word play

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.150 
you can't guess the word play
immediately<00:03:34.660> pass<00:03:35.110> it<00:03:35.320> to<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.470> other<00:03:35.590> team<00:03:35.890> or

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
immediately pass it to the other team or

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.070 
immediately pass it to the other team or
if<00:03:36.520> you<00:03:36.640> forfeit<00:03:37.030> by<00:03:37.150> messing<00:03:37.570> up<00:03:37.690> breaking

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
if you forfeit by messing up breaking

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.860 
if you forfeit by messing up breaking
one<00:03:38.320> of<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.500> rules<00:03:38.740> then<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:40.420> other<00:03:40.540> team<00:03:40.750> has

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
one of the rules then the other team has

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.570 
one of the rules then the other team has
a<00:03:40.900> chance<00:03:40.960> to<00:03:41.380> steal<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.950> word<00:03:42.130> from<00:03:42.400> you<00:03:42.550> and

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
a chance to steal the word from you and

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.760 
a chance to steal the word from you and
get<00:03:42.790> points<00:03:43.180> too<00:03:43.390> and<00:03:43.630> so<00:03:43.930> all<00:03:43.960> this<00:03:44.410> fits

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
get points too and so all this fits

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.310 
get points too and so all this fits
together<00:03:44.950> in<00:03:45.220> an<00:03:45.580> interesting<00:03:45.820> way<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.900> game

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
together in an interesting way the game

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.230 
together in an interesting way the game
I<00:03:47.680> mean<00:03:48.340> of<00:03:48.490> course<00:03:48.640> they're<00:03:48.850> having<00:03:49.120> these

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
I mean of course they're having these

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.810 
I mean of course they're having these
these<00:03:49.540> synapse<00:03:50.370> bracelets<00:03:51.370> you<00:03:51.490> know<00:03:51.610> that's

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
these synapse bracelets you know that's

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.870 
these synapse bracelets you know that's
all<00:03:52.270> for<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:53.380> novelty<00:03:53.860> factor<00:03:54.100> I'm<00:03:54.820> a

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
all for the the novelty factor I'm a

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.610 
all for the the novelty factor I'm a
little<00:03:55.150> disappointed<00:03:55.630> that<00:03:55.960> this<00:03:56.380> is

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
little disappointed that this is

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.200 
little disappointed that this is
basically<00:03:57.070> here<00:03:57.370> for<00:03:57.520> the<00:03:57.580> novelty<00:03:57.910> factor

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 
basically here for the novelty factor

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.810 
basically here for the novelty factor
too<00:03:58.570> I<00:03:58.810> like<00:03:59.710> the<00:03:59.860> fact<00:04:00.010> that<00:04:00.160> it<00:04:00.310> keeps<00:04:00.430> score

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
too I like the fact that it keeps score

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.250 
too I like the fact that it keeps score
that's<00:04:01.150> good<00:04:01.390> I<00:04:01.510> like<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.780> fact<00:04:01.900> that<00:04:02.020> it's<00:04:02.200> a

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
that's good I like the fact that it's a

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.530 
that's good I like the fact that it's a
timer<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:02.680> a<00:04:02.950> scorekeeper<00:04:03.370> own<00:04:03.700> one<00:04:03.910> and<00:04:04.180> that

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
timer and a scorekeeper own one and that

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.880 
timer and a scorekeeper own one and that
the<00:04:04.660> faster<00:04:05.020> you<00:04:05.140> say<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.470> word<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.770> more

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
the faster you say the word the more

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.740 
the faster you say the word the more
points<00:04:06.220> you<00:04:06.280> get<00:04:06.490> this<00:04:07.000> keeps<00:04:07.300> track<00:04:07.540> of<00:04:07.570> the

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
points you get this keeps track of the

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.840 
points you get this keeps track of the
score<00:04:07.870> you<00:04:08.140> can<00:04:08.320> redo<00:04:08.650> it<00:04:08.800> if<00:04:08.890> you<00:04:09.040> mess<00:04:09.250> up<00:04:09.280> for

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
score you can redo it if you mess up for

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.580 
score you can redo it if you mess up for
some<00:04:10.000> reason<00:04:10.300> or<00:04:10.390> whatever<00:04:10.660> but<00:04:11.230> it<00:04:11.350> works

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
some reason or whatever but it works

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.710 
some reason or whatever but it works
very<00:04:11.770> well<00:04:11.890> in<00:04:12.100> that<00:04:12.340> regard<00:04:12.730> I<00:04:12.940> also<00:04:13.450> like<00:04:13.690> the

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
very well in that regard I also like the

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.750 
very well in that regard I also like the
random<00:04:14.230> setting<00:04:14.890> of<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.070> game<00:04:15.310> in<00:04:15.460> which<00:04:15.610> it

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
random setting of the game in which it

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.490 
random setting of the game in which it
will<00:04:15.880> pick<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.210> categories<00:04:16.780> although<00:04:17.440> you

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
will pick the categories although you

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.960 
will pick the categories although you
can<00:04:17.799> also<00:04:17.950> play<00:04:18.250> where<00:04:18.460> you<00:04:18.489> pick<00:04:18.850> the

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
can also play where you pick the

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.090 
can also play where you pick the
category<00:04:19.120> or<00:04:19.720> where<00:04:20.320> you<00:04:20.410> go<00:04:20.590> through<00:04:20.830> each<00:04:21.070> of

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
category or where you go through each of

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.010 
category or where you go through each of
the<00:04:21.310> five<00:04:21.489> different<00:04:21.850> categories<00:04:22.300> five

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
the five different categories five

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.260 
the five different categories five
categories<00:04:23.290> I<00:04:23.770> should<00:04:24.250> mention<00:04:24.400> it<00:04:24.669> the<00:04:25.090> game

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
categories I should mention it the game

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.700 
categories I should mention it the game

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
it when you get creative impulse you

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.730 
it when you get creative impulse you
pick<00:04:42.720> which<00:04:43.020> other<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.410> other<00:04:43.530> four

categories<00:04:44.040> because<00:04:44.370> this<00:04:44.700> is<00:04:44.820> it's<00:04:45.270> just

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
categories because this is it's just

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.120 
categories because this is it's just
kind<00:04:45.630> of<00:04:45.660> a<00:04:45.750> pain<00:04:46.020> and<00:04:46.320> if<00:04:46.710> you<00:04:46.830> get<00:04:46.950> lucky

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
kind of a pain and if you get lucky

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.440 
kind of a pain and if you get lucky
enough<00:04:47.490> to<00:04:47.580> get<00:04:47.670> the<00:04:47.790> word<00:04:47.940> that<00:04:48.120> you<00:04:48.240> wrote

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
enough to get the word that you wrote

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.390 
enough to get the word that you wrote
that<00:04:48.480> it<00:04:48.720> just<00:04:48.900> doesn't<00:04:49.140> seem<00:04:49.350> I<00:04:49.680> don't<00:04:50.190> know

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
that it just doesn't seem I don't know

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.010 
that it just doesn't seem I don't know
it<00:04:50.580> really<00:04:51.000> disrupts<00:04:51.540> the<00:04:51.630> flow<00:04:51.660> of<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:51.960> game

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
it really disrupts the flow of the game

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.830 
it really disrupts the flow of the game
but<00:04:52.860> I<00:04:53.130> mean<00:04:53.670> they<00:04:54.030> do<00:04:54.090> include<00:04:54.390> the<00:04:54.540> pads<00:04:54.720> of

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
but I mean they do include the pads of

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.330 
but I mean they do include the pads of
paper<00:04:54.930> and<00:04:55.230> they<00:04:55.320> do<00:04:55.380> include<00:04:55.680> two<00:04:55.920> pencils

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
paper and they do include two pencils

different<00:05:00.960> forms<00:05:01.200> of<00:05:01.290> the<00:05:01.380> game<00:05:01.410> going

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
different forms of the game going

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.980 
different forms of the game going
through<00:05:02.070> all<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.430> each<00:05:02.940> category<00:05:03.300> on<00:05:03.660> a<00:05:03.690> card

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
a great opportunity here with how big

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.710 
a great opportunity here with how big
this<00:05:10.290> device<00:05:10.680> is<00:05:10.980> in<00:05:11.250> this<00:05:11.490> day<00:05:11.910> and<00:05:11.940> age<00:05:12.210> they

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
this device is in this day and age they

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.450 
this device is in this day and age they
could<00:05:12.960> have<00:05:13.050> taken<00:05:13.260> all<00:05:13.590> these<00:05:13.740> cards<00:05:14.190> and<00:05:14.310> put

could have taken all these cards and put

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.860 
could have taken all these cards and put
them<00:05:14.610> on<00:05:14.700> here<00:05:15.030> where<00:05:15.510> you<00:05:15.600> could<00:05:15.750> have

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
them on here where you could have

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.540 
them on here where you could have
pressed<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.140> button<00:05:16.410> and<00:05:16.530> up<00:05:16.680> came<00:05:16.950> the<00:05:17.190> word

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
pressed the button and up came the word

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.940 
pressed the button and up came the word
that<00:05:18.150> you<00:05:18.300> had<00:05:18.480> to<00:05:18.570> do<00:05:18.720> so<00:05:19.230> all<00:05:19.440> you<00:05:19.470> need<00:05:19.650> it

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
that you had to do so all you need it

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.560 
that you had to do so all you need it
was<00:05:20.130> this<00:05:20.340> device<00:05:20.640> you<00:05:20.850> didn't<00:05:21.060> even<00:05:21.240> need<00:05:21.360> the

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
was this device you didn't even need the

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.320 
was this device you didn't even need the
the<00:05:21.840> box<00:05:22.020> of<00:05:22.200> cards<00:05:22.410> at<00:05:22.620> all<00:05:22.940> that's<00:05:23.940> kind<00:05:24.180> of<00:05:24.210> a

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
the box of cards at all that's kind of a

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.990 
the box of cards at all that's kind of a
niggly<00:05:24.660> thing<00:05:24.960> I<00:05:25.170> mean<00:05:25.710> both<00:05:26.460> of<00:05:26.520> these<00:05:26.760> fit

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
niggly thing I mean both of these fit

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.640 
niggly thing I mean both of these fit
together<00:05:27.270> fairly<00:05:27.510> well<00:05:27.840> but<00:05:28.050> I<00:05:28.320> just<00:05:28.530> found

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
together fairly well but I just found

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.350 
together fairly well but I just found
that<00:05:28.800> it<00:05:28.950> didn't<00:05:29.250> really<00:05:29.760> work<00:05:29.880> at<00:05:30.150> cross

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
that it didn't really work at cross

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.110 
that it didn't really work at cross
currents<00:05:30.750> now<00:05:31.010> what<00:05:32.010> do<00:05:32.400> I<00:05:32.460> like<00:05:32.760> about<00:05:32.790> the

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
currents now what do I like about the

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.030 
currents now what do I like about the
game<00:05:33.300> I<00:05:33.540> like<00:05:33.870> the<00:05:34.020> I<00:05:34.050> like<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:34.500> timer<00:05:34.710> I<00:05:34.830> like

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
game I like the I like the timer I like

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.860 
game I like the I like the timer I like
the<00:05:35.130> idea<00:05:35.220> I<00:05:35.400> like<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.730> concept<00:05:35.940> it's<00:05:36.390> fun<00:05:36.660> and

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
the idea I like the concept it's fun and

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.450 
the idea I like the concept it's fun and
it's<00:05:37.260> better<00:05:37.410> than<00:05:37.590> talking<00:05:37.770> tangled<00:05:38.370> because

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
it's better than talking tangled because

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.460 
it's better than talking tangled because
in<00:05:38.669> talking<00:05:38.880> tango<00:05:39.390> you<00:05:39.840> were<00:05:39.990> paired<00:05:40.230> up<00:05:40.350> with

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
in talking tango you were paired up with

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.200 
in talking tango you were paired up with
one<00:05:40.680> other<00:05:40.770> person<00:05:40.860> and<00:05:41.430> if<00:05:41.730> you<00:05:41.820> got<00:05:41.910> paired

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
one other person and if you got paired

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.030 
one other person and if you got paired
up<00:05:42.300> with<00:05:42.419> someone<00:05:42.660> who<00:05:42.810> wasn't<00:05:43.020> really<00:05:43.770> a

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
up with someone who wasn't really a

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.890 
up with someone who wasn't really a
thick<00:05:44.640> on<00:05:44.760> the<00:05:44.850> same<00:05:45.030> wavelength<00:05:45.240> with<00:05:45.540> you<00:05:45.750> it

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
thick on the same wavelength with you it

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.060 
thick on the same wavelength with you it
might<00:05:45.990> be<00:05:46.140> really<00:05:46.290> funny<00:05:46.620> but<00:05:46.800> it<00:05:46.919> could<00:05:47.010> also

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
might be really funny but it could also

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.950 
might be really funny but it could also
be<00:05:47.250> frustrating<00:05:47.910> if<00:05:48.030> that<00:05:48.450> constantly

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
be frustrating if that constantly

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.450 
be frustrating if that constantly
happened<00:05:49.320> to<00:05:49.380> you<00:05:49.500> on<00:05:49.710> this<00:05:50.100> you<00:05:50.250> have<00:05:50.340> your

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
happened to you on this you have your

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.980 
happened to you on this you have your
whole<00:05:50.580> team<00:05:50.820> the<00:05:51.000> frustration<00:05:51.540> still<00:05:51.810> there

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
whole team the frustration still there

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.570 
whole team the frustration still there
but<00:05:52.140> it's<00:05:52.260> going<00:05:52.350> to<00:05:52.410> happen<00:05:52.560> all<00:05:52.830> the<00:05:52.860> time<00:05:53.010> to

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
but it's going to happen all the time to

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.370 
but it's going to happen all the time to
both<00:05:53.820> teams<00:05:54.120> and<00:05:54.419> it<00:05:54.690> seems<00:05:54.930> to<00:05:55.020> work<00:05:55.200> out

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
both teams and it seems to work out

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.290 
both teams and it seems to work out
better<00:05:55.560> having<00:05:55.830> multiple<00:05:56.490> players<00:05:56.700> rather

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
better having multiple players rather

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.540 
better having multiple players rather
than<00:05:57.510> just<00:05:57.750> two<00:05:57.990> I<00:05:58.200> like<00:05:58.680> that<00:05:58.860> I<00:05:59.070> like<00:05:59.250> the

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
than just two I like that I like the

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.070 
than just two I like that I like the
selection<00:05:59.970> of<00:06:00.060> words<00:06:00.240> i<00:06:00.419> like<00:06:00.540> the<00:06:00.690> rhyming

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
selection of words i like the rhyming

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.390 
selection of words i like the rhyming
word<00:06:01.230> selection<00:06:01.560> or<00:06:01.890> like<00:06:02.040> the<00:06:02.190> alliteration

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
word selection or like the alliteration

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.150 
word selection or like the alliteration
selection<00:06:03.240> that's<00:06:03.720> interesting<00:06:04.350> I<00:06:04.530> do<00:06:04.830> think

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
selection that's interesting I do think

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.950 
selection that's interesting I do think
they<00:06:05.250> miss<00:06:05.430> an<00:06:05.580> opportunity<00:06:05.760> here<00:06:06.390> I<00:06:06.540> think

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
they miss an opportunity here I think

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.260 
they miss an opportunity here I think
the<00:06:07.050> games<00:06:07.290> colors<00:06:07.770> are<00:06:07.950> hideous<00:06:08.430> but

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
the games colors are hideous but

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.670 
the games colors are hideous but
apparently<00:06:09.690> party<00:06:09.930> games<00:06:10.110> have<00:06:10.260> to<00:06:10.350> be<00:06:10.440> bright

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
apparently party games have to be bright

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.490 
apparently party games have to be bright
green<00:06:10.919> and<00:06:11.070> purple<00:06:11.190> or<00:06:11.460> something<00:06:11.820> oh<00:06:12.500> it's

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
green and purple or something oh it's

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.909 
green and purple or something oh it's
fun<00:06:14.400> and<00:06:14.760> it's<00:06:15.330> funny<00:06:15.720> and<00:06:15.990> people<00:06:16.290> enjoy<00:06:16.770> the

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
fun and it's funny and people enjoy the

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.740 
fun and it's funny and people enjoy the
game<00:06:17.100> but<00:06:17.700> it's<00:06:17.820> not<00:06:18.000> a<00:06:18.030> party<00:06:18.390> game<00:06:18.510> that

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
game but it's not a party game that

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.960 
game but it's not a party game that
people<00:06:18.900> demand<00:06:19.320> a<00:06:19.440> repeat<00:06:19.830> play<00:06:20.100> of<00:06:20.310> which<00:06:20.820> i

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
people demand a repeat play of which i

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.250 
people demand a repeat play of which i
think<00:06:21.030> is<00:06:21.330> something<00:06:21.810> that<00:06:21.990> should<00:06:22.050> be

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
think is something that should be

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.570
