00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
sounds pretty gobbling it to me but

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.550 
sounds pretty gobbling it to me but
could<00:01:19.590> also<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:20.009> since<00:01:20.250> its<00:01:20.400> warriors<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:21.090> have

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
could also be since its warriors we have

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.200 
could also be since its warriors we have

at what heroes were sponsors they were
tied<00:01:49.500> into<00:01:50.360> theros<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:52.049> was<00:01:52.140> released

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
tied into theros and it was released

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.289 
tied into theros and it was released
around<00:01:52.829> theros<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.820> could<00:01:53.939> be<00:01:54.090> something

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
around theros so this could be something

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.330 
around theros so this could be something
like<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.780> as<00:01:54.899> well<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.710> fact<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.040> set

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
like that as well and in fact the set

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.959 
like that as well and in fact the set
symbol<00:01:57.049> you<00:01:58.049> have<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.229> barbarian<00:01:58.979> helmet<00:01:59.549> it

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
symbol you have a barbarian helmet it

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.730 
symbol you have a barbarian helmet it
looks<00:02:00.030> like<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.270> nice<00:02:00.479> helmet<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.560> has

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
looks like a nice helmet but it has

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.940 
looks like a nice helmet but it has
these<00:02:01.920> wings<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.430> could<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.939> barbarian

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
these wings it could be a barbarian

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.479 
these wings it could be a barbarian
helmets<00:02:05.420> thematically<00:02:06.420> going<00:02:06.719> on<00:02:06.869> here<00:02:07.489> yeah

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
helmets thematically going on here yeah

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.249 
helmets thematically going on here yeah
so<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:08.970> duel<00:02:09.239> decks<00:02:09.390> be<00:02:09.539> versus<00:02:09.899> cunning

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
so that is duel decks be versus cunning

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.449 
so that is duel decks be versus cunning
and<00:02:10.440> my<00:02:10.530> initial<00:02:10.800> thoughts<00:02:11.009> again<00:02:11.280> there's

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
and my initial thoughts again there's

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.309 
and my initial thoughts again there's
really<00:02:11.580> not<00:02:11.819> much<00:02:12.120> here<00:02:12.420> at<00:02:12.540> all<00:02:12.660> but<00:02:13.050> if<00:02:13.260> you

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
really not much here at all but if you

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.850 
really not much here at all but if you
guys<00:02:13.440> have<00:02:13.590> any

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
guys have any

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.860 
guys have any
based<00:02:14.310> on<00:02:14.460> this<00:02:14.640> definitely<00:02:15.390> put<00:02:15.540> them<00:02:15.690> down

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
based on this definitely put them down

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.470 
based on this definitely put them down
below<00:02:16.290> more<00:02:17.250> importantly<00:02:17.760> or<00:02:17.910> rather<00:02:18.090> more

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
below more importantly or rather more

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.730 
below more importantly or rather more
excitingly<00:02:19.050> since<00:02:19.380> we<00:02:19.500> have<00:02:19.590> more

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
excitingly since we have more

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.380 
excitingly since we have more
information<00:02:19.890> we<00:02:20.340> have<00:02:20.460> some<00:02:20.730> more<00:02:20.970> bored<00:02:21.300> of

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
information we have some more bored of

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.690 
information we have some more bored of
the<00:02:21.480> journey<00:02:22.440> into<00:02:22.590> Nick's<00:02:22.860> info<00:02:23.220> not<00:02:23.430> born<00:02:23.670> of

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
the journey into Nick's info not born of

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.240 
the journey into Nick's info not born of
the<00:02:23.790> gods<00:02:23.820> that's<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:24.960> yesterday<00:02:25.250> journey

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
the gods that's so yesterday journey

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.670 
the gods that's so yesterday journey
into<00:02:26.430> Nick's<00:02:26.820> artwork<00:02:27.570> and<00:02:27.780> some<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.380> this<00:02:28.470> is

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
into Nick's artwork and some of this is

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.190 
into Nick's artwork and some of this is
awesome<00:02:29.160> first<00:02:29.820> up<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:30.420> this<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:30.810> kind<00:02:31.170> of

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
awesome first up is this this is kind of

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.470 
awesome first up is this this is kind of
like<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.350> projection<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.430> don't<00:02:33.120> know<00:02:33.180> if<00:02:33.270> she's

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
like a projection I don't know if she's

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.900 
like a projection I don't know if she's
summoning<00:02:34.080> since<00:02:34.830> this<00:02:35.070> is<00:02:35.250> nick's<00:02:35.490> born<00:02:35.790> it

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
summoning since this is nick's born it

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.370 
summoning since this is nick's born it
looks<00:02:36.060> like<00:02:36.210> so<00:02:36.390> it'll<00:02:36.570> probably<00:02:36.750> be<00:02:37.020> an<00:02:37.140> aura

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
looks like so it'll probably be an aura

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.340 
looks like so it'll probably be an aura
of<00:02:38.000> sorts<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.180> don't<00:02:39.360> think<00:02:39.630> this<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:40.050> God<00:02:40.320> of

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
of sorts I don't think this is a God of

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.470 
of sorts I don't think this is a God of
in<00:02:40.800> any<00:02:41.040> sense<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.550> think<00:02:41.820> this<00:02:41.910> is<00:02:41.970> an<00:02:42.209> ex-porn

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
in any sense I think this is an ex-porn

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.180 
in any sense I think this is an ex-porn
so<00:02:42.660> it'll<00:02:42.780> probably<00:02:42.930> be<00:02:43.110> some<00:02:43.620> kind<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.010> miss

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
so it'll probably be some kind of miss

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.550 
so it'll probably be some kind of miss
Stowe<00:02:44.540> factor<00:02:45.540> that's<00:02:45.870> what<00:02:45.990> it<00:02:46.080> seems<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.350> me

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
Stowe factor that's what it seems to me

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.680

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.060 
it does remind me of crew fix based on
the<00:03:39.630> art<00:03:39.750> we<00:03:39.840> swab<00:03:40.019> is<00:03:40.140> there<00:03:40.260> are<00:03:40.350> four<00:03:40.680> arms

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
the art we swab is there are four arms

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.479 
the art we swab is there are four arms
and<00:03:41.840> seems<00:03:42.840> like<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.019> god<00:03:43.290> outside<00:03:43.980> of<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.130> temple

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
and seems like a god outside of a temple

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.630 
and seems like a god outside of a temple
and<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:46.260> face<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:46.709> hidden<00:03:46.860> but<00:03:47.220> who<00:03:47.430> did

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
and the face is hidden but who did

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.270 
and the face is hidden but who did
pretty<00:03:48.480> sure<00:03:48.600> that's<00:03:48.720> crew<00:03:48.989> fix<00:03:49.200> then<00:03:50.070> we<00:03:50.160> have

think that would be really cool and

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.340 
think that would be really cool and
hopefully<00:04:03.120> it's<00:04:03.420> not<00:04:03.480> just<00:04:03.690> one<00:04:03.900> of<00:04:03.959> these<00:04:04.049> two

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
hopefully it's not just one of these two

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.870 
hopefully it's not just one of these two
plus<00:04:04.530> 0<00:04:04.680> and<00:04:04.830> first<00:04:05.010> strike<00:04:05.250> instant<00:04:05.670> speed
