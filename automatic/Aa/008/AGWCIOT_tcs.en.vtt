00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
hey guys away it was here they were we

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.800 
hey guys away it was here they were we
talking<00:00:02.310> about<00:00:02.399> the<00:00:02.820> three<00:00:03.060> new<00:00:03.149> subclasses<00:00:03.780> a

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
talking about the three new subclasses a

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.079 
talking about the three new subclasses a
little<00:00:04.080> bit<00:00:04.170> more<00:00:04.319> in<00:00:04.500> detail<00:00:04.879> course<00:00:05.879> in<00:00:06.029> a

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
little bit more in detail course in a

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.309 
little bit more in detail course in a
previous<00:00:06.270> video<00:00:06.509> I<00:00:06.690> mentioned<00:00:06.779> that<00:00:07.049> we<00:00:07.170> have

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
previous video I mentioned that we have

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.129 
previous video I mentioned that we have
the<00:00:07.440> ark<00:00:07.680> warlock<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.490> solar<00:00:08.849> 10<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.780> void

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
the ark warlock a solar 10 and the void

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.410 
the ark warlock a solar 10 and the void
hunter<00:00:10.740> we<00:00:11.730> are<00:00:11.820> we<00:00:11.880> starting<00:00:12.150> off<00:00:12.240> with<00:00:12.330> a

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
hunter we are we starting off with a

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.930 
hunter we are we starting off with a
void<00:00:12.630> hunter<00:00:13.019> visa<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:14.400> one<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:14.790> things

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
void hunter visa that one that things

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.400 
void hunter visa that one that things
would<00:00:15.059> be<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.150> little<00:00:15.330> bit<00:00:15.599> more<00:00:15.900> interested<00:00:16.320> in

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
would be a little bit more interested in

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.170 
would be a little bit more interested in
yellow<00:00:16.619> ones<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.190> think<00:00:17.400> we<00:00:17.580> kind<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.029> have

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
yellow ones and I think we kind of have

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.000 
yellow ones and I think we kind of have
an<00:00:18.270> idea<00:00:18.330> what<00:00:18.539> it's<00:00:18.660> going<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.810> be<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> boy

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
an idea what it's going to be so the boy

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.859 
an idea what it's going to be so the boy
hunter<00:00:20.400> has<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.850> ability<00:00:21.180> called<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.420> gravity

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
hunter has the ability called a gravity

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.599 
hunter has the ability called a gravity
bone<00:00:22.050> nah<00:00:22.289> i'm<00:00:22.590> going<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.859> assume<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.189> what

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
bone nah i'm going to assume that what

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.890 
bone nah i'm going to assume that what
happens<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.180> call<00:00:24.390> your<00:00:24.539> super<00:00:24.810> you

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
happens that you call your super you

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.359 
happens that you call your super you
thoughtless<00:00:25.320> bow<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:26.010> probably<00:00:26.220> has<00:00:26.340> a

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
thoughtless bow that probably has a

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.279 
thoughtless bow that probably has a
limited<00:00:26.789> amount<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.090> shots<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.689> don't<00:00:28.260> think

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
limited amount of shots I don't think

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.660 
limited amount of shots I don't think
any<00:00:28.560> time<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.740> do<00:00:28.920> think<00:00:29.250> will<00:00:29.400> be<00:00:29.490> limited

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
any time I do think will be limited

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.510 
any time I do think will be limited
shots<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.830> with<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.040> gravity

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
shots on this one and with it in gravity

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.819 
shots on this one and with it in gravity
bow<00:00:32.669> what<00:00:32.969> we<00:00:33.059> can<00:00:33.210> assume<00:00:33.510> at<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:33.870> point<00:00:34.170> is

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
bow what we can assume at this point is

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.250 
bow what we can assume at this point is
that<00:00:35.640> what's<00:00:36.090> going<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.360> happen<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.110> your

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
that what's going to happen is that your

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.680 
that what's going to happen is that your
to<00:00:37.380> shoot<00:00:37.620> an<00:00:37.739> enemy<00:00:38.129> probably<00:00:38.969> an<00:00:39.120> ad<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.570> don't

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
to shoot an enemy probably an ad I don't

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.479 
to shoot an enemy probably an ad I don't
think<00:00:39.750> will<00:00:39.989> work<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.260> bosses<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.800> will<00:00:41.340> be

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
think will work on bosses and will be

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.400 
think will work on bosses and will be
launched<00:00:42.030> into<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.300> air<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.930> kind<00:00:43.320> of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
launched into the air and kind of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.350 
launched into the air and kind of
visible<00:00:43.770> for<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.010> entire<00:00:44.280> team<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.910> see<00:00:45.120> and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
visible for the entire team to see and

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.020 
visible for the entire team to see and
pretty<00:00:46.020> much<00:00:46.050> at<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.469> point<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.610> enemy<00:00:47.910> will

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
pretty much at that point the enemy will

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.310 
pretty much at that point the enemy will
be<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> air<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.899> gravity

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
be in the air and like this gravity

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.080 
be in the air and like this gravity
bubble<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.890> your<00:00:50.399> teammates<00:00:50.700> get<00:00:50.820> hit<00:00:50.879> them

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
bubble and your teammates get hit them

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.299 
bubble and your teammates get hit them
pretty<00:00:51.390> easily<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:52.530> giving<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.949> hunter<00:00:53.280> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
pretty easily and giving a hunter a

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.950 
pretty easily and giving a hunter a
little<00:00:53.489> bit<00:00:53.579> more<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.820> support<00:00:53.969> role<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.870> you

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
little bit more of a support role so you

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.510 
little bit more of a support role so you
pull<00:00:55.170> out<00:00:55.199> about<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.739> shoot<00:00:55.980> an<00:00:56.070> enemy<00:00:56.340> it

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
pull out about you shoot an enemy it

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.889 
pull out about you shoot an enemy it
gets<00:00:56.640> launched<00:00:56.850> into<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.120> air<00:00:57.239> probably<00:00:57.840> in

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
gets launched into the air probably in

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.450 
gets launched into the air probably in
case<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.260> some<00:00:58.410> sort<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.620> bubble<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.100> you

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
case like some sort of bubble and you

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.580 
case like some sort of bubble and you
can<00:00:59.579> deal<00:00:59.730> credit<00:01:00.600> quite<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> bit<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.230> damage<00:01:01.260> to

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
can deal credit quite a bit of damage to

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.850 
can deal credit quite a bit of damage to
it<00:01:01.699> which<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.820> pretty<00:01:02.850> good<00:01:03.120> now<00:01:03.899> let's<00:01:04.229> talk

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
it which is pretty good now let's talk

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.649 
it which is pretty good now let's talk
about<00:01:04.920> these<00:01:05.220> solar<00:01:05.460> tighten<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.180> solar<00:01:06.420> time

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
about these solar tighten the solar time

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.120 
about these solar tighten the solar time
doesn't<00:01:07.020> come<00:01:07.170> out<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.470> pull<00:01:07.650> out<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> hammer

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
doesn't come out and pull out a hammer

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.359 
doesn't come out and pull out a hammer
now<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.850> hammer<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.810> yeah<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.770> really

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
now this hammer is on yeah it's really

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.620 
now this hammer is on yeah it's really
don't<00:01:11.610> know<00:01:11.700> much<00:01:11.850> about<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.450> really

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
don't know much about it it's really

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.850 
don't know much about it it's really
about<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.869> speculate<00:01:13.320> because<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.680> just

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
about a speculate because it is just

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.039 
about a speculate because it is just
call<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> solar<00:01:14.400> hammer<00:01:15.060> or<00:01:15.540> something<00:01:15.780> about

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
call the solar hammer or something about

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.219 
call the solar hammer or something about
nature<00:01:16.380> now<00:01:16.770> what<00:01:17.759> we<00:01:17.909> do<00:01:18.119> know<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.659> he

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
nature now what we do know is that he

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.499 
nature now what we do know is that he
will<00:01:19.350> pull<00:01:19.560> out<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> hammer<00:01:20.070> I'm<00:01:20.400> sure<00:01:20.790> people

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
will pull out a hammer I'm sure people

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.880 
will pull out a hammer I'm sure people
are<00:01:21.750> saying<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.259> might<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.470> new<00:01:22.619> slam

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
are saying that it might be a new slam

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.130 
are saying that it might be a new slam
attack<00:01:23.159> like<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.640> ark<00:01:23.880> ability<00:01:24.240> already<00:01:24.509> but

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
attack like the ark ability already but
