editing software when you export from
Premiere<00:00:40.920> you're<00:00:41.250> always<00:00:41.400> going<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.670> end<00:00:41.730> up

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
Premiere you're always going to end up

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.510 
Premiere you're always going to end up
with<00:00:42.210> 24<00:00:42.989> frames<00:00:43.230> per<00:00:43.350> second<00:00:43.860> 30<00:00:44.100> frames<00:00:44.370> per

with 24 frames per second 30 frames per
second<00:00:45.060> the<00:00:45.450> end<00:00:45.630> result<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.140> there's<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.590> lot

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
second the end result is there's a lot

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.130 
second the end result is there's a lot
of<00:00:47.100> information<00:00:47.670> there<00:00:47.850> those<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.810> who

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
of information there those of you who

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.780 
of information there those of you who
like<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.560> make<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> lot<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.100> slideshows

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
like to make a lot of slideshows

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.610 
like to make a lot of slideshows
probably<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.480> used<00:00:51.720> another<00:00:52.110> type<00:00:52.440> of

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
probably have used another type of

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.130 
probably have used another type of
software<00:00:52.950> that<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.520> strictly<00:00:54.210> for<00:00:54.510> slideshows

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
software that is strictly for slideshows

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.650 
software that is strictly for slideshows
that<00:00:55.350> allows<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.100> export<00:00:56.670> as<00:00:56.880> say<00:00:57.270> flash

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
that allows you to export as say flash

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.020 
that allows you to export as say flash
and<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.500> file<00:00:58.739> size<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.280> much<00:00:59.399> smaller<00:00:59.730> and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
and the file size is much smaller and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.819 
and the file size is much smaller and
the<00:01:00.090> exporting<00:01:00.719> process<00:01:01.110> was<00:01:01.290> much<00:01:01.530> quicker

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
the exporting process was much quicker

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.160 
the exporting process was much quicker
than<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.280> would<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.610> here<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.149> Premiere<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
than you would have here in Premiere the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.050 
than you would have here in Premiere the
reason<00:01:04.589> for<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.190> if<00:01:05.400> you're<00:01:05.580> exporting

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
reason for this is if you're exporting

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.630 
reason for this is if you're exporting
to<00:01:06.330> flash<00:01:06.690> when<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.500> flash<00:01:07.740> file<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.250> finally

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
to flash when the flash file is finally

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.330 
to flash when the flash file is finally
exported<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.990> software<00:01:10.440> has<00:01:10.650> written<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.130> say

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
exported the software has written to say

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.240 
exported the software has written to say
ok<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.909> first<00:01:12.150> image<00:01:12.570> which<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:12.930> only<00:01:13.229> say<00:01:13.830> 50

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
ok the first image which is only say 50

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.430 
ok the first image which is only say 50

kilobytes is going to remain up on the
screen<00:01:16.740> for<00:01:16.770> 5<00:01:17.190> seconds<00:01:17.760> whereas<00:01:18.720> Premiere

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
screen for 5 seconds whereas Premiere

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.250 
screen for 5 seconds whereas Premiere
would<00:01:19.560> take<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.920> same<00:01:20.220> image<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.260> duplicate

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
would take that same image and duplicate

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.530 
would take that same image and duplicate
that<00:01:22.500> 30<00:01:22.979> frames<00:01:23.280> per<00:01:23.580> second<00:01:23.970> over<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.270> 5

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that 30 frames per second over the 5

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.440 
that 30 frames per second over the 5
seconds<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.170> instead<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.560> one<00:01:26.130> frame<00:01:26.610> holding

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
seconds so instead of one frame holding

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.000 
seconds so instead of one frame holding
up<00:01:27.600> there<00:01:27.780> for<00:01:27.960> five<00:01:28.110> seconds<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.650> end<00:01:28.860> up

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
up there for five seconds you end up

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.890 
up there for five seconds you end up
with<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.460> hundred<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:29.970> fifty<00:01:30.299> frames<00:01:30.510> that<00:01:30.780> had

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
with a hundred and fifty frames that had

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.630 
with a hundred and fifty frames that had
to<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.140> rendered<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.680> certainly<00:01:32.310> when<00:01:32.520> you're

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
to be rendered and certainly when you're

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.000 
to be rendered and certainly when you're
working<00:01:32.909> with<00:01:32.939> HD<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.810> exporting<00:01:34.619> process

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
working with HD the exporting process

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.890 
working with HD the exporting process
does<00:01:35.220> take<00:01:35.250> longer<00:01:35.760> so<00:01:36.360> those<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.780> who

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
does take longer so those of you who

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.660 
does take longer so those of you who
want<00:01:37.080> to<00:01:37.140> export<00:01:37.439> your<00:01:37.530> slideshows<00:01:38.100> quickly

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
and don't really care about having that

them all down on my timeline now I've

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.789 
them all down on my timeline now I've
got<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.330> song<00:01:54.630> here<00:01:54.900> that's<00:01:55.080> exactly<00:01:55.200> five

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
got a song here that's exactly five

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.679 
got a song here that's exactly five
seconds<00:01:56.220> long<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.759> my<00:01:56.909> photos<00:01:57.299> don't<00:01:57.479> match

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
seconds long and my photos don't match

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.620 
seconds long and my photos don't match
up<00:01:57.720> how<00:01:58.439> can<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.619> extend<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.250> photos<00:01:59.820> first<00:02:00.479> I

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
up how can I extend the photos first I

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.080 
up how can I extend the photos first I
need<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.810> figure<00:02:01.020> out<00:02:01.140> how<00:02:01.439> long<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:02.369> music

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
need to figure out how long this music

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.600 
need to figure out how long this music
is<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.450> frames<00:02:03.780> all<00:02:04.470> right<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:04.920> our<00:02:04.950> music<00:02:05.490> is

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
is in frames all right so our music is

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.730 
is in frames all right so our music is
five<00:02:05.820> minutes<00:02:06.150> long<00:02:06.390> we're<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> 30<00:02:07.409> frames

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
five minutes long we're on a 30 frames

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.609 
five minutes long we're on a 30 frames
per<00:02:07.860> second<00:02:08.280> timeline<00:02:08.729> thirty<00:02:09.599> times<00:02:09.929> five<00:02:10.289> is

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
per second timeline thirty times five is

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.280 
per second timeline thirty times five is
300<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.340> we've<00:02:11.580> got<00:02:11.760> 300<00:02:12.120> frames<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:13.020> we<00:02:13.110> need

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
300 so we've got 300 frames that we need

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.270 
300 so we've got 300 frames that we need
to<00:02:13.380> space<00:02:13.650> out<00:02:13.890> over

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
to space out over

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.590 
to space out over
50<00:02:14.610> photos<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.510> 300<00:02:16.290> divided<00:02:16.620> by<00:02:16.709> 15<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.340> six<00:02:18.090> so

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
50 photos so 300 divided by 15 is six so

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.540 
50 photos so 300 divided by 15 is six so
each<00:02:18.840> image<00:02:19.350> needs<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.650> be<00:02:19.800> six<00:02:20.069> seconds<00:02:20.370> long

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
each image needs to be six seconds long

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.730 
each image needs to be six seconds long
so<00:02:21.330> we're<00:02:21.810> going<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.959> go<00:02:22.080> ahead<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.440> highlight

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
so we're going to go ahead and highlight

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.550 
so we're going to go ahead and highlight
all<00:02:23.069> of<00:02:23.100> these<00:02:23.390> right<00:02:24.390> click<00:02:24.690> its<00:02:25.230> speed

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
all of these right click its speed

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.650 
all of these right click its speed
duration<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.280> we're<00:02:26.850> gonna<00:02:26.940> change<00:02:27.270> all<00:02:27.510> of

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
duration and we're gonna change all of

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.260 
duration and we're gonna change all of
them<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.020> six<00:02:28.590> seconds<00:02:28.980> long<00:02:29.130> we're<00:02:30.000> gonna<00:02:30.090> go

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
them to six seconds long we're gonna go

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.720 
them to six seconds long we're gonna go
ahead<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.510> check<00:02:30.630> off<00:02:30.810> ripple<00:02:31.230> edit<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.739> hit

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
ahead and check off ripple edit and hit

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.240 
ahead and check off ripple edit and hit
OK<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.330> what<00:02:34.080> that's<00:02:34.260> going<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.530> do<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.980> allow

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
OK and what that's going to do is allow

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.490 
OK and what that's going to do is allow
each<00:02:35.550> clip<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:35.940> be<00:02:36.060> 6<00:02:36.300> seconds<00:02:36.660> long<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.230> not

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
each clip to be 6 seconds long and not

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.280 
each clip to be 6 seconds long and not
worry<00:02:38.069> about<00:02:38.130> bumping<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:39.300> or<00:02:39.569> overwriting

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
worry about bumping in or overwriting

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.190 
worry about bumping in or overwriting
each<00:02:40.560> other<00:02:40.830> as<00:02:41.190> far<00:02:41.459> as<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:42.060> different<00:02:42.510> clips

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
each other as far as the different clips

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.190 
each other as far as the different clips
here<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:44.220> fills<00:02:44.520> our<00:02:44.850> 5<00:02:45.690> minutes<00:02:46.050> long

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
here and that fills our 5 minutes long

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.050 
here and that fills our 5 minutes long
here<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:46.920> we<00:02:47.010> have<00:02:47.160> our<00:02:47.310> 5<00:02:47.519> minutes<00:02:47.820> of<00:02:47.910> video

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060

settings<00:02:58.530> now<00:02:59.010> usually<00:02:59.610> we<00:02:59.730> would<00:02:59.880> export<00:03:00.300> for

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
settings now usually we would export for

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.350 
settings now usually we would export for
the<00:03:00.600> web<00:03:00.780> using<00:03:01.170> h.264<00:03:02.010> we<00:03:02.940> want<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.209> maintain

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
the web using h.264 we want to maintain

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.660 
the web using h.264 we want to maintain
our<00:03:03.630> HD<00:03:04.380> resolution<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.190> we're<00:03:05.370> going<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.519> keep

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
our HD resolution so we're going to keep

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.600 
our HD resolution so we're going to keep
it<00:03:05.850> at<00:03:05.940> 1920<00:03:06.540> by<00:03:06.660> 1080<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.340> our<00:03:08.340> framerate

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
it at 1920 by 1080 and our framerate

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.880 
it at 1920 by 1080 and our framerate
again<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.390> default<00:03:09.840> 30<00:03:10.110> frames<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.500> second

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
again is a default 30 frames a second

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.340 
again is a default 30 frames a second
and<00:03:11.010> we<00:03:11.790> come<00:03:11.970> down<00:03:12.120> here<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.690> our<00:03:12.720> data<00:03:13.080> rate

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
and we come down here to our data rate

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.170 
and we come down here to our data rate
okay<00:03:13.769> so<00:03:13.830> this<00:03:14.069> is<00:03:14.250> where<00:03:14.400> we<00:03:14.519> end<00:03:14.670> up<00:03:14.790> changing

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
okay so this is where we end up changing

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.570 
okay so this is where we end up changing
the<00:03:15.269> size<00:03:15.540> of<00:03:15.750> our<00:03:15.870> file<00:03:16.170> now<00:03:16.920> this<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.340> for<00:03:17.519> the

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
the size of our file now this is for the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.690 
the size of our file now this is for the
web<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:17.970> these<00:03:18.720> are<00:03:18.959> still<00:03:19.650> images<00:03:20.250> it<00:03:20.459> is<00:03:20.519> a

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
web and these are still images it is a

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.610 
web and these are still images it is a
slideshow<00:03:21.329> so<00:03:21.570> there's<00:03:21.750> not<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.019> whole<00:03:22.290> lot<00:03:22.320> of

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
slideshow so there's not a whole lot of

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.190 
slideshow so there's not a whole lot of
information<00:03:22.860> going<00:03:23.160> on<00:03:23.640> so<00:03:24.420> our<00:03:24.600> target<00:03:25.079> we're

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
information going on so our target we're

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.660 
information going on so our target we're
going<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.380> put<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.650> all<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:25.950> way<00:03:26.040> down<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.400> 5

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
going to put that all the way down to 5

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.640 
going to put that all the way down to 5
and<00:03:27.060> we're<00:03:27.269> going<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.420> maximize<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:28.230> out<00:03:28.380> and

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
and we're going to maximize it out and

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.490 
and we're going to maximize it out and
cap<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:28.950> at<00:03:29.280> 10<00:03:29.670> megabits<00:03:30.269> per<00:03:30.329> second<00:03:30.840> now

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
cap it at 10 megabits per second now

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.280 
cap it at 10 megabits per second now
when<00:03:31.860> we<00:03:31.980> would<00:03:32.130> go<00:03:32.280> ahead<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.489> export<00:03:33.000> this

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
when we would go ahead and export this

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.350 
when we would go ahead and export this
again<00:03:34.290> using<00:03:34.620> these<00:03:34.739> parameters<00:03:35.180> let's<00:03:36.180> see

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
again using these parameters let's see

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.120 
again using these parameters let's see
how<00:03:36.480> long<00:03:36.660> it's<00:03:36.930> going<00:03:37.110> to<00:03:37.260> take<00:03:37.470> all<00:03:37.860> right<00:03:37.980> so

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
how long it's going to take all right so

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.319 
how long it's going to take all right so
we'll<00:03:38.250> go<00:03:38.400> ahead<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:38.940> click<00:03:39.630> export<00:03:41.329> alright

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
we'll go ahead and click export alright

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.640 
we'll go ahead and click export alright
and<00:03:42.480> right<00:03:42.690> away<00:03:42.840> you're<00:03:43.079> seeing<00:03:43.380> that<00:03:43.500> it's

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
and right away you're seeing that it's

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.170 
and right away you're seeing that it's
gonna<00:03:43.739> take<00:03:44.010> about<00:03:44.130> two<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.609> a<00:03:44.670> half<00:03:44.700> minutes

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
gonna take about two and a half minutes

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.690 
gonna take about two and a half minutes
to<00:03:45.239> export<00:03:45.720> this<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.380> that's<00:03:46.799> fairly<00:03:47.130> quick<00:03:47.489> is

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
to export this so that's fairly quick is

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.940 
to export this so that's fairly quick is
there<00:03:48.269> a<00:03:48.299> faster<00:03:48.570> way<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.900> do<00:03:49.170> this<00:03:49.350> well<00:03:49.739> yes

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
there a faster way to do this well yes

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.319 
there a faster way to do this well yes
there<00:03:50.160> is<00:03:50.280> let's<00:03:50.609> go<00:03:50.730> ahead<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:50.970> hit<00:03:51.090> cancel

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
there is let's go ahead and hit cancel

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.949 
there is let's go ahead and hit cancel
and<00:03:51.709> change<00:03:52.709> one<00:03:53.280> more<00:03:53.310> setting<00:03:53.940> so<00:03:54.450> depending

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
and change one more setting so depending

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.750 
and change one more setting so depending
on<00:03:55.079> our<00:03:55.200> data<00:03:55.410> rate<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:55.799> does<00:03:55.950> change<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.310> size

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
on our data rate it does change the size

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.720 
on our data rate it does change the size
of<00:03:56.940> our<00:03:57.090> file<00:03:57.390> but<00:03:57.989> also<00:03:58.019> frames<00:03:58.920> per<00:03:59.250> second

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
of our file but also frames per second

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.300 
of our file but also frames per second
so<00:04:00.510> if<00:04:00.660> we<00:04:00.810> lower<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.380> frames<00:04:01.650> per<00:04:01.890> second<00:04:02.190> all

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
so if we lower the frames per second all

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.830 
so if we lower the frames per second all
the<00:04:02.400> way<00:04:02.430> down<00:04:02.670> to<00:04:02.850> ten<00:04:03.150> because<00:04:03.450> again<00:04:03.690> we're

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
the way down to ten because again we're

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.420 
the way down to ten because again we're
just<00:04:04.019> dealing<00:04:04.170> with<00:04:04.470> slideshows<00:04:04.980> here<00:04:05.160> no

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
just dealing with slideshows here no

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.160 
just dealing with slideshows here no
movement<00:04:05.910> in<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.120> end<00:04:06.720> we're<00:04:06.840> gonna<00:04:06.900> have

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
movement in the end we're gonna have

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.039 
movement in the end we're gonna have
even<00:04:07.350> a<00:04:07.530> smaller<00:04:07.980> video<00:04:08.640> file<00:04:08.970> so<00:04:09.840> we'll<00:04:09.930> go

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
even a smaller video file so we'll go

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.810 
even a smaller video file so we'll go
ahead<00:04:10.140> and<00:04:10.260> do<00:04:10.470> 10<00:04:10.799> that's<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.340> minimum<00:04:11.489> we

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
ahead and do 10 that's the minimum we

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.810 
ahead and do 10 that's the minimum we
can<00:04:11.850> do<00:04:12.150> with<00:04:12.359> this<00:04:12.680> h.264<00:04:13.680> codec<00:04:13.920> go<00:04:14.640> ahead

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
can do with this h.264 codec go ahead

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.690 
can do with this h.264 codec go ahead
and<00:04:14.910> hit<00:04:15.030> export<00:04:15.979> so<00:04:16.979> now<00:04:17.220> instead<00:04:17.400> of<00:04:17.519> taking

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
and hit export so now instead of taking

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.520 
and hit export so now instead of taking
two-and-a-half<00:04:18.359> minutes<00:04:18.720> we're<00:04:18.900> now<00:04:19.019> down<00:04:19.320> to

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
two-and-a-half minutes we're now down to

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.289 
two-and-a-half minutes we're now down to
one<00:04:19.769> minute<00:04:19.979> so<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:20.340> can<00:04:20.459> kind<00:04:20.609> of<00:04:20.700> see<00:04:20.910> how

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
one minute so you can kind of see how

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.020 
one minute so you can kind of see how
you<00:04:21.810> can<00:04:22.049> decrease<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:23.070> time<00:04:23.220> of<00:04:23.430> exporting

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
you can decrease the time of exporting

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.690 
you can decrease the time of exporting
as<00:04:24.120> well<00:04:24.630> as<00:04:24.870> decrease<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.590> file<00:04:26.010> size

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
as well as decrease the file size

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.890 
as well as decrease the file size
now<00:04:27.060> having

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
now having

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.930 
now having
slide<00:04:28.020> shows<00:04:28.259> that<00:04:28.380> export<00:04:28.919> just<00:04:29.370> single

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
slide shows that export just single

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.879 
slide shows that export just single
frames<00:04:30.240> like<00:04:30.509> that<00:04:30.780> with<00:04:30.990> with<00:04:31.320> no<00:04:31.500> animation

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
frames like that with with no animation

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.980 
frames like that with with no animation
or<00:04:32.310> transitions<00:04:32.910> it's<00:04:33.360> certainly<00:04:33.750> very

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
or transitions it's certainly very

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.980 
or transitions it's certainly very
boring<00:04:34.320> but<00:04:34.800> again<00:04:35.580> it<00:04:35.880> is<00:04:36.060> a<00:04:36.090> slide<00:04:36.449> show<00:04:36.720> and

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
boring but again it is a slide show and

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.230 
boring but again it is a slide show and
it<00:04:37.680> may<00:04:37.889> be<00:04:37.949> enough<00:04:38.310> for<00:04:38.520> your<00:04:38.610> clients<00:04:39.120> or

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
it may be enough for your clients or

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.580 
it may be enough for your clients or
family<00:04:39.570> or<00:04:39.660> friends<00:04:39.960> or<00:04:40.050> whoever<00:04:40.229> is<00:04:40.410> going<00:04:40.530> to

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
family or friends or whoever is going to

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.980 
family or friends or whoever is going to
be<00:04:40.680> watching<00:04:40.800> this<00:04:41.210> but<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.449> professional

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
be watching this but the professional

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.749 
be watching this but the professional
way<00:04:43.080> is<00:04:43.139> to<00:04:43.350> add<00:04:43.470> some<00:04:43.740> nice<00:04:43.889> digital<00:04:44.190> motion

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
way is to add some nice digital motion

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.310 
way is to add some nice digital motion
so<00:04:45.120> I'm<00:04:45.210> gonna<00:04:45.330> just<00:04:45.539> very<00:04:45.720> quickly<00:04:45.960> go<00:04:46.229> ahead

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
so I'm gonna just very quickly go ahead

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.740 
so I'm gonna just very quickly go ahead
and<00:04:46.710> add<00:04:46.860> some<00:04:46.889> quick<00:04:47.460> digital<00:04:48.060> motion<00:04:48.389> to<00:04:48.570> my

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
and add some quick digital motion to my

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.960 
and add some quick digital motion to my
images<00:04:49.410> and<00:04:49.650> I'm<00:04:50.220> going<00:04:50.370> to<00:04:50.400> show<00:04:50.639> you<00:04:50.669> the

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
images and I'm going to show you the

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:51.529 
images and I'm going to show you the
difference

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
difference

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.960 
difference
so<00:04:52.259> I've<00:04:52.380> scaled<00:04:52.680> that<00:04:52.830> down<00:04:53.160> gonna<00:04:53.699> add

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
so I've scaled that down gonna add

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.999 
so I've scaled that down gonna add
keyframes<00:04:54.930> to<00:04:55.110> both<00:04:55.259> the<00:04:55.380> scale<00:04:55.650> and<00:04:55.860> the

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009 
keyframes to both the scale and the

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:58.219 
keyframes to both the scale and the
position<00:04:56.460> and<00:04:57.180> I<00:04:57.270> go<00:04:57.389> ahead<00:04:57.479> and<00:04:57.720> just<00:04:57.870> scale

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
position and I go ahead and just scale

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.180 
position and I go ahead and just scale
up<00:04:58.500> and<00:04:58.860> then<00:04:59.400> move<00:04:59.639> my<00:04:59.669> position<00:05:00.389> over<00:05:00.930> here

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
up and then move my position over here

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.290 
up and then move my position over here
I'm<00:05:02.190> gonna<00:05:02.310> go<00:05:02.520> ahead<00:05:02.550> and<00:05:02.729> take<00:05:03.150> these

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
I'm gonna go ahead and take these

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.870 
I'm gonna go ahead and take these
keyframes<00:05:04.020> move<00:05:04.500> them<00:05:04.620> to<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.860> end<00:05:05.010> I'm<00:05:05.789> gonna

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
keyframes move them to the end I'm gonna

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.200 
keyframes move them to the end I'm gonna
copy<00:05:06.300> this<00:05:06.750> motion<00:05:07.260> command<00:05:08.070> C<00:05:08.310> I'm<00:05:09.000> gonna

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
copy this motion command C I'm gonna

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.060 
copy this motion command C I'm gonna
highlight<00:05:09.449> all<00:05:09.840> of<00:05:09.870> my<00:05:10.080> other<00:05:10.199> videos<00:05:10.320> and

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
highlight all of my other videos and

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.060 
highlight all of my other videos and
command<00:05:11.699> V<00:05:11.820> to<00:05:12.180> paste<00:05:12.389> that<00:05:12.600> same<00:05:13.080> attributes

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
command V to paste that same attributes

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.430 
command V to paste that same attributes
to<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.729> rest<00:05:14.940> of<00:05:15.060> our<00:05:15.210> images<00:05:15.750> so<00:05:15.870> all<00:05:16.080> of<00:05:16.229> them

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
to the rest of our images so all of them

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.180 
to the rest of our images so all of them
are<00:05:16.530> going<00:05:16.710> to<00:05:16.830> be<00:05:17.160> digital<00:05:18.060> zooms<00:05:18.510> and<00:05:19.039> we<00:05:20.039> can

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
are going to be digital zooms and we can

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.420 
are going to be digital zooms and we can
see<00:05:20.340> our<00:05:20.370> motion<00:05:21.229> now<00:05:22.229> let's<00:05:23.070> go<00:05:23.220> ahead<00:05:23.340> and

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
see our motion now let's go ahead and

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.150 
see our motion now let's go ahead and
export<00:05:23.699> this<00:05:23.880> again<00:05:24.770> now<00:05:25.770> again<00:05:26.009> we're

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
export this again now again we're

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.800 
export this again now again we're
dealing<00:05:26.280> with<00:05:26.490> motion<00:05:26.970> now<00:05:27.090> so<00:05:27.270> we<00:05:27.389> can't<00:05:27.630> do

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
dealing with motion now so we can't do

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.330 
dealing with motion now so we can't do
our<00:05:27.840> 10<00:05:28.139> frames<00:05:28.440> a<00:05:28.560> second<00:05:28.860> anymore<00:05:29.160> we<00:05:29.310> have

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
our 10 frames a second anymore we have

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.980 
our 10 frames a second anymore we have
to<00:05:29.520> go<00:05:29.639> back<00:05:29.789> to<00:05:29.940> our<00:05:29.970> 30<00:05:30.330> to<00:05:30.599> make<00:05:30.720> it<00:05:30.840> look

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
to go back to our 30 to make it look

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.379 
to go back to our 30 to make it look
smooth<00:05:31.560> and<00:05:31.830> before<00:05:32.190> I<00:05:32.220> hit<00:05:32.370> export<00:05:32.639> remember

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
smooth and before I hit export remember

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.350 
smooth and before I hit export remember
exporting<00:05:34.380> with<00:05:34.500> no<00:05:34.740> motion<00:05:35.220> at<00:05:35.370> 30<00:05:36.000> frames<00:05:36.150> a

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
exporting with no motion at 30 frames a

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.700 
exporting with no motion at 30 frames a
second<00:05:36.630> was<00:05:36.750> going<00:05:36.870> to<00:05:36.930> take<00:05:37.110> two<00:05:37.349> and<00:05:37.500> a<00:05:37.530> half

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
second was going to take two and a half

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.310 
second was going to take two and a half
minutes<00:05:38.070> and<00:05:38.280> then<00:05:39.180> when<00:05:39.300> we<00:05:39.419> went<00:05:39.660> down<00:05:39.840> to<00:05:40.080> 10

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
minutes and then when we went down to 10

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.020 
minutes and then when we went down to 10
frames<00:05:40.560> a<00:05:40.740> second<00:05:41.160> exporting<00:05:41.699> was<00:05:41.849> going<00:05:41.970> to

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
frames a second exporting was going to

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.659 
frames a second exporting was going to
take<00:05:42.240> a<00:05:42.270> little<00:05:42.479> over<00:05:42.810> a<00:05:42.870> minute<00:05:43.050> now<00:05:43.770> premiere

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
take a little over a minute now premiere

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.790 
take a little over a minute now premiere
is<00:05:44.789> gonna<00:05:44.970> have<00:05:45.150> to<00:05:45.300> generate<00:05:45.840> 30<00:05:46.409> frames<00:05:46.680> a

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
is gonna have to generate 30 frames a

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.589 
is gonna have to generate 30 frames a
second<00:05:47.190> with<00:05:47.310> all<00:05:47.520> of<00:05:47.729> this<00:05:47.849> motion<00:05:48.300> have<00:05:48.479> to

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
second with all of this motion have to

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:50.960 
second with all of this motion have to
render<00:05:48.930> that<00:05:49.110> out<00:05:49.260> so<00:05:49.710> let's<00:05:50.340> see<00:05:50.520> how<00:05:50.639> long<00:05:50.760> we

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
render that out so let's see how long we

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.360 
render that out so let's see how long we
go<00:05:51.120> now<00:05:51.690> we're<00:05:51.870> at<00:05:51.990> almost<00:05:52.320> 20<00:05:52.800> minutes<00:05:53.039> it's

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
go now we're at almost 20 minutes it's

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.460 
go now we're at almost 20 minutes it's
going<00:05:53.520> to<00:05:53.580> take<00:05:53.789> here<00:05:54.060> to<00:05:54.240> export<00:05:54.720> this<00:05:54.900> so<00:05:55.380> you

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
going to take here to export this so you

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.230 
going to take here to export this so you
can<00:05:55.590> see<00:05:55.620> the<00:05:55.949> amount<00:05:56.190> of<00:05:56.310> time<00:05:56.520> it<00:05:56.699> takes<00:05:56.880> when

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
can see the amount of time it takes when

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.909 
can see the amount of time it takes when
you're<00:05:57.419> dealing<00:05:57.599> with<00:05:57.780> motion<00:05:58.289> now<00:05:58.620> in<00:05:58.770> my

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
you're dealing with motion now in my

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.040 
you're dealing with motion now in my
opinion<00:05:59.120> having<00:06:00.120> that<00:06:00.240> digital<00:06:00.630> motion

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
opinion having that digital motion

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.320 
opinion having that digital motion
digital<00:06:01.470> zoom<00:06:01.680> on<00:06:01.830> your<00:06:01.979> photos<00:06:02.340> is<00:06:02.520> very<00:06:03.060> nice

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
digital zoom on your photos is very nice

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.990 
digital zoom on your photos is very nice
because<00:06:04.320> it's<00:06:04.650> more<00:06:04.800> professional<00:06:05.130> but<00:06:05.729> it's

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
because it's more professional but it's

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.820 
because it's more professional but it's
going<00:06:06.120> to<00:06:06.210> take<00:06:06.389> longer<00:06:06.630> to<00:06:06.810> export<00:06:07.320> but<00:06:07.650> like

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
going to take longer to export but like

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.960 
going to take longer to export but like
I've<00:06:08.010> said<00:06:08.039> there's<00:06:08.400> other<00:06:08.490> software<00:06:08.940> out

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
I've said there's other software out

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.180 
I've said there's other software out
there<00:06:09.120> that<00:06:09.810> allows<00:06:10.050> you<00:06:10.229> to<00:06:10.409> create<00:06:10.680> a<00:06:10.710> flash

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
there that allows you to create a flash

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.100 
there that allows you to create a flash
file<00:06:11.520> of<00:06:11.789> your<00:06:11.940> slideshows<00:06:12.510> and<00:06:12.690> these

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
file of your slideshows and these

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.260 
file of your slideshows and these
applications<00:06:13.830> will<00:06:14.010> do<00:06:14.159> the<00:06:14.340> digital<00:06:14.610> zoom<00:06:14.880> in

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
applications will do the digital zoom in

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.480 
applications will do the digital zoom in
and<00:06:15.510> pans<00:06:15.750> and<00:06:16.080> that<00:06:16.169> kind<00:06:16.409> of<00:06:16.500> thing<00:06:16.680> but

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
and pans and that kind of thing but

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.649 
and pans and that kind of thing but
again<00:06:17.610> it's<00:06:17.880> working<00:06:18.180> in<00:06:18.270> a<00:06:18.330> flash

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:18.659 
again it's working in a flash

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:20.600 
again it's working in a flash
environment<00:06:19.260> very<00:06:19.710> different<00:06:20.070> from<00:06:20.280> here<00:06:20.520> in

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
environment very different from here in

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:21.140 
environment very different from here in
Premiere

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
Premiere

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.879 
Premiere
so<00:06:21.539> hopefully<00:06:21.930> that<00:06:22.229> kind<00:06:22.409> of<00:06:22.470> explains

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
so hopefully that kind of explains

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:26.029 
so hopefully that kind of explains
things<00:06:23.159> different<00:06:23.909> ways<00:06:24.060> to<00:06:24.449> speed<00:06:25.199> it<00:06:25.320> up<00:06:25.409> all

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 
things different ways to speed it up all

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:27.050 
things different ways to speed it up all
right<00:06:26.159> so<00:06:26.310> now<00:06:26.460> let<00:06:26.639> me<00:06:26.669> show<00:06:26.760> you<00:06:26.880> the

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
right so now let me show you the

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.760 
right so now let me show you the
different<00:06:27.360> sizes<00:06:27.510> that<00:06:27.900> we<00:06:28.020> end<00:06:28.169> up<00:06:28.380> with<00:06:28.560> with

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
different sizes that we end up with with

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.620 
different sizes that we end up with with
our<00:06:28.889> different<00:06:29.250> properties<00:06:30.150> that<00:06:30.300> we've<00:06:30.419> had

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
our different properties that we've had

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.550 
our different properties that we've had
so<00:06:31.289> the<00:06:31.440> first<00:06:31.740> one<00:06:32.270> movement<00:06:33.270> so<00:06:34.050> the<00:06:34.349> slide

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
so the first one movement so the slide

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.779 
so the first one movement so the slide
shows<00:06:34.800> that<00:06:34.889> we're<00:06:35.039> actually<00:06:35.190> moving

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789 
shows that we're actually moving

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:38.659 
shows that we're actually moving
we<00:06:36.330> export<00:06:36.690> at<00:06:36.870> 30<00:06:37.080> frames<00:06:37.349> a<00:06:37.500> second<00:06:37.950> it<00:06:38.099> took

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
we export at 30 frames a second it took

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:40.700 
we export at 30 frames a second it took
a<00:06:39.090> little<00:06:39.719> over<00:06:40.080> 20<00:06:40.469> mm

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
a little over 20 mm

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.120 
a little over 20 mm
to<00:06:40.980> export<00:06:41.460> and<00:06:41.670> the<00:06:42.630> file<00:06:42.840> size<00:06:43.080> is<00:06:43.140> 226

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.130 
to export and the file size is 226

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.760 
to export and the file size is 226
megabytes<00:06:44.640> now<00:06:45.120> that's<00:06:45.450> not<00:06:45.630> huge<00:06:46.080> but<00:06:46.410> it<00:06:46.620> is

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
megabytes now that's not huge but it is

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.560 
megabytes now that's not huge but it is
a<00:06:46.800> lot<00:06:47.040> to<00:06:47.070> upload<00:06:47.550> especially<00:06:48.180> those<00:06:48.330> of<00:06:48.450> you

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 
only 10 frames a second so we removed 20
