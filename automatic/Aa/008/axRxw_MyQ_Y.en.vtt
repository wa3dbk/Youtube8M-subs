bowl I have a pound of roma tomatoes and

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.000 
bowl I have a pound of roma tomatoes and
I'm<00:00:34.110> sure<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.440> could<00:00:34.530> squeeze<00:00:34.800> out<00:00:34.949> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
I'm sure that could squeeze out the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.920 
I'm sure that could squeeze out the
seeds<00:00:35.370> because<00:00:35.879> it's<00:00:36.059> tickets<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:36.540> liquidy

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
seeds because it's tickets so liquidy

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.290 
seeds because it's tickets so liquidy
anyway<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.440> know<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.949> honey<00:00:38.670> squeeze<00:00:39.000> out<00:00:39.150> to

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
anyway you know so honey squeeze out to

like they were doing actually basically
I<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.430> cut<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.790> half<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.090> gently<00:00:45.390> squeeze

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
I just cut it in half and gently squeeze

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.370 
I just cut it in half and gently squeeze
it<00:00:45.750> over<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.050> sink

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
it over the sink

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.950 
it over the sink
or<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.430> can<00:00:47.550> do<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.760> real<00:00:48.000> fancy<00:00:48.420> take<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.780> knife

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
or you can do it real fancy take a knife

or you can do it real fancy take a knife
that's<00:00:49.680> what<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.860> do<00:00:49.920> exist<00:00:50.190> me<00:00:50.340> forever<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.760> I

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
that's what I do exist me forever and I

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.100 
that's what I do exist me forever and I
thought<00:00:51.059> about<00:00:51.239> -<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.420> don't<00:00:51.570> want<00:00:51.750> secret

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
thought about - you don't want secret

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.110 
thought about - you don't want secret
just<00:00:52.320> squeeze<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:53.460> an<00:00:53.610> orange<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:53.969> not

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
just squeeze it like an orange but not

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.119 
just squeeze it like an orange but not
so<00:00:54.300> hard<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.540> I'm<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.110> know<00:00:55.200> smashing<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:56.010> in

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
so hard that I'm you know smashing it in

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.780 
so hard that I'm you know smashing it in
my<00:00:56.219> hand

we<00:01:06.660> have<00:01:06.780> two<00:01:06.990> cans<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.680> pinto<00:01:08.250> beans<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.729> know

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:08.789 
we have two cans of pinto beans you know

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:10.279 
we have two cans of pinto beans you know
more<00:01:09.149> lots<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.479> soluble<00:01:09.690> fiber<00:01:10.110> and

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
more lots of soluble fiber and

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:12.290 
more lots of soluble fiber and
deliciousness<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.009> means<00:01:11.550> soluble<00:01:11.970> fibers

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
deliciousness that means soluble fibers

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.029 
deliciousness that means soluble fibers
elusive<00:01:12.660> insoluble<00:01:13.170> well<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.649> literally<00:01:13.860> has

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
elusive insoluble well it literally has

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.169 
elusive insoluble well it literally has
to<00:01:14.160> do<00:01:14.280> with<00:01:14.369> whether<00:01:14.580> or<00:01:14.640> not<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.880> observes

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
to do with whether or not it observes

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:17.180 
to do with whether or not it observes
water<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.840> your<00:01:15.899> GI<00:01:16.110> tract<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.709> know<00:01:16.830> it

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
water so in your GI tract you know it

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.969 
water so in your GI tract you know it
helps<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.880> actually<00:01:18.330> absorbs<00:01:18.600> water

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
helps you it actually absorbs water

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.380 
helps you it actually absorbs water
insoluble<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.429> what<00:01:20.580> we<00:01:20.729> need<00:01:20.880> both<00:01:21.030> kinds<00:01:21.060> of

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
insoluble in what we need both kinds of

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.609 
insoluble in what we need both kinds of
fun<00:01:21.539> we<00:01:21.750> need<00:01:21.899> both<00:01:22.020> kinds<00:01:22.050> of<00:01:22.319> fiber

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
fun we need both kinds of fiber

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.960 
fun we need both kinds of fiber
absolutely<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.310> soluble<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.789> little

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
absolutely but soluble is a little

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.850 
absolutely but soluble is a little
harder<00:01:24.209> to<00:01:24.240> find<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.229> some<00:01:25.410> fruits<00:01:25.649> but

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
harder to find it's in some fruits but

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.169 
harder to find it's in some fruits but
it's<00:01:25.979> really<00:01:26.190> high<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.399> beans<00:01:26.789> and<00:01:27.119> it

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
it's really high in beans and it

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.029 
it's really high in beans and it
actually<00:01:27.690> has<00:01:27.899> this<00:01:28.229> effect<00:01:28.619> or<00:01:28.740> it's<00:01:28.860> like

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
actually has this effect or it's like

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:30.620 
actually has this effect or it's like
resistance<00:01:29.459> starch<00:01:29.789> to<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.330> what<00:01:30.509> is

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
resistance starch to it what is

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.389 
resistance starch to it what is
resistance<00:01:31.170> subject<00:01:31.560> from<00:01:31.709> dr.<00:01:32.160> Fuhrman

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
resistance subject from dr. Fuhrman

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.430 
resistance subject from dr. Fuhrman
talked<00:01:32.610> about<00:01:32.910> yeah<00:01:33.780> it's<00:01:33.929> basically<00:01:34.050> like

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
talked about yeah it's basically like

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.139 
talked about yeah it's basically like
the<00:01:34.560> way<00:01:34.679> it<00:01:34.950> acts<00:01:35.190> inside<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> body<00:01:35.819> where<00:01:36.119> it

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
the way it acts inside the body where it

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:37.669 
the way it acts inside the body where it
literally<00:01:36.539> will<00:01:36.750> take<00:01:36.929> stuff<00:01:37.200> out<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.440> your

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
literally will take stuff out of your

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:39.320 
literally will take stuff out of your
body<00:01:37.890> like<00:01:38.099> it<00:01:38.250> acts<00:01:38.429> like<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:38.940> a<00:01:38.970> sweep

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
body like it acts like a like a sweep

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.609 
body like it acts like a like a sweep
and<00:01:39.539> it<00:01:39.599> just<00:01:39.780> kind<00:01:39.899> of<00:01:39.929> like<00:01:40.080> take<00:01:40.289> everything

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
and it just kind of like take everything

no<00:03:16.370> local<00:03:16.549> what<00:03:16.760> I<00:03:16.820> like<00:03:16.970> about<00:03:17.090> this<00:03:17.299> is<00:03:17.480> it

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
no local what I like about this is it

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.330 
no local what I like about this is it
lasts<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:17.959> lot<00:03:18.079> longer<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.890> doesn't<00:03:19.190> think

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
lasts a lot longer and it doesn't think

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.220 
lasts a lot longer and it doesn't think
easily<00:03:19.670> can't<00:03:19.910> be<00:03:20.030> just<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.269> come<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:20.570> think

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
easily can't be just to come and think

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.830 
easily can't be just to come and think
about<00:03:22.160> healing<00:03:22.370> minutes<00:03:22.790> in<00:03:22.910> a<00:03:22.970> can<00:03:23.239> you<00:03:23.600> do<00:03:23.720> it

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
about healing minutes in a can you do it

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.970 
about healing minutes in a can you do it
their<00:03:23.959> chocolate<00:03:24.350> up<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:24.650> also<00:03:24.799> has

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
their chocolate up and it also has

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.860 
their chocolate up and it also has
deceits<00:03:25.340> within<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.850> cans<00:03:26.090> that's<00:03:26.360> very<00:03:26.630> very

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
deceits within the cans that's very very

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.020 
deceits within the cans that's very very
hot<00:03:27.140> this<00:03:27.560> is<00:03:27.739> much<00:03:27.920> milder<00:03:28.160> congas<00:03:28.910> that

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
hot this is much milder congas that

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.030 
hot this is much milder congas that
chipotle<00:03:29.180> is<00:03:29.750> actually<00:03:30.079> a<00:03:30.110> serial<00:03:30.410> tiny<00:03:30.650> Pinot

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
chipotle is actually a serial tiny Pinot

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.710 
chipotle is actually a serial tiny Pinot
so<00:03:31.160> it<00:03:31.280> gives<00:03:31.400> more<00:03:31.610> heat<00:03:31.940> more<00:03:32.510> than

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
so it gives more heat more than

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.370 
so it gives more heat more than
necessarily<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:35.000> a<00:03:35.390> PowerPoint

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380
