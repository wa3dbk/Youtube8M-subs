kind of an idea of where it's going to

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.819 
kind of an idea of where it's going to
end<00:00:36.600> up<00:00:36.840> with<00:00:36.960> your<00:00:37.079> parallel<00:00:37.440> parking<00:00:37.680> it

going to give you an idea of how far

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.439 
going to give you an idea of how far
away<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.390> lets<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.750> go<00:00:49.879> before<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.120> goes<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.420> a

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
away it lets you go before it goes to a

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.930 
away it lets you go before it goes to a
continuously<00:00:51.989> solid<00:00:52.410> beep<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.820> give

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
continuously solid beep and just to give

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.069 
continuously solid beep and just to give
you<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> little<00:00:54.239> bit<00:00:54.329> more<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.539> an<00:00:54.629> overview<00:00:54.870> on

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
you a little bit more of an overview on

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.139 
you a little bit more of an overview on
the<00:00:55.170> graphics<00:00:55.620> here<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.879> actually

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the graphics here this is actually

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.430 
the graphics here this is actually
pretty<00:00:57.270> comprehensive<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.109> easy<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.410> use

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
pretty comprehensive and easy to use

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.959 
pretty comprehensive and easy to use
system<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.949> find<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.280> easier<00:00:59.640> than<00:00:59.820> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
system I find this easier than the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.689 
system I find this easier than the
system<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.329> BMW<00:01:00.780> Mercedes<00:01:01.260> but<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.520> one

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
system in BMW Mercedes but on this one

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.950 
system in BMW Mercedes but on this one
is<00:01:02.850> kind<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.059> cool<00:01:03.239> because<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.629> gives<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
is kind of cool because it gives you a

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.450 
is kind of cool because it gives you a
graphic<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.439> each<00:01:04.589> individual<00:01:05.159> sensor

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
graphic of each individual sensor

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.280 
graphic of each individual sensor
there's<00:01:05.880> four<00:01:06.210> sensors<00:01:06.659> on<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> front<00:01:07.170> and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
there's four sensors on the front and

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.510 
there's four sensors on the front and
the<00:01:07.409> rear<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.770> car<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.159> gives<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.490> a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
the rear of the car and it gives you a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.039 
the rear of the car and it gives you a
little<00:01:08.640> graphic<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.299> what<00:01:09.330> each<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.780> them<00:01:09.900> can

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
little graphic of what each of them can

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.850 
little graphic of what each of them can
sense<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:11.189> if<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.369> put<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.640> vehicle<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.060> reverse

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
sense so if I put the vehicle in reverse

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.020 
sense so if I put the vehicle in reverse
take<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> electronic<00:01:14.369> parking<00:01:14.580> brake<00:01:14.700> off

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
take the electronic parking brake off

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.789 
take the electronic parking brake off
I'm<00:01:15.840> just<00:01:16.080> going<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.259> start<00:01:16.409> backing<00:01:16.619> up

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
I'm just going to start backing up

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.350 
I'm just going to start backing up
straight<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.490> watch<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.030> little<00:01:18.119> graphic

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
straight and watch the little graphic

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.940 
straight and watch the little graphic
there

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.170 

and<00:01:23.950> you<00:01:24.040> can<00:01:24.159> see<00:01:24.280> each<00:01:24.460> individual<00:01:24.970> sensor

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
and you can see each individual sensor

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.810 
and you can see each individual sensor
will<00:01:25.479> start<00:01:25.689> beeping<00:01:26.020> faster<00:01:26.350> faster<00:01:26.680> faster

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.100 

so<00:01:30.820> this<00:01:30.970> is<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.210> exactly<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.689> point<00:01:31.869> when<00:01:31.990> it

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
so this is the exactly the point when it

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.550 
so this is the exactly the point when it
turns<00:01:32.290> to<00:01:32.439> a<00:01:32.830> solid<00:01:33.490> tone<00:01:34.229> let<00:01:35.229> me<00:01:35.320> show<00:01:35.470> you

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
turns to a solid tone let me show you

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.840 
turns to a solid tone let me show you
how<00:01:35.680> much<00:01:35.799> space<00:01:36.009> you<00:01:36.280> actually<00:01:36.310> have<00:01:36.670> even

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
how much space you actually have even

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.219 
how much space you actually have even
though<00:01:36.909> you<00:01:37.000> can<00:01:37.119> kind<00:01:37.360> of<00:01:37.450> see<00:01:37.689> on<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:37.990> camera

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
though you can kind of see on the camera

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.039 
though you can kind of see on the camera
to<00:01:39.130> give<00:01:39.250> megive<00:01:39.430> in<00:01:39.700> real<00:01:39.909> life<00:01:40.180> how<00:01:40.899> much

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
to give megive in real life how much

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.630 
to give megive in real life how much
space<00:01:41.289> you<00:01:41.470> truly<00:01:41.830> have<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.890> is<00:01:45.039> how<00:01:45.189> far<00:01:45.460> you

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
space you truly have this is how far you

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.630 
space you truly have this is how far you
have<00:01:45.820> when<00:01:46.030> it<00:01:46.149> goes<00:01:46.270> to<00:01:46.299> a<00:01:46.450> solid<00:01:46.720> tone<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:48.549> you

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
have when it goes to a solid tone so you

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.730 
have when it goes to a solid tone so you
have<00:01:48.939> about<00:01:49.240> I<00:01:49.479> would<00:01:49.539> say<00:01:49.659> about<00:01:49.869> a<00:01:50.110> foot<00:01:50.530> or

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
have about I would say about a foot or

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.370 
have about I would say about a foot or
so<00:01:50.950> room<00:01:51.580> which<00:01:52.539> is<00:01:52.659> pretty<00:01:53.049> much<00:01:53.200> the

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
so room which is pretty much the

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.719 
so room which is pretty much the
standard<00:01:53.740> in<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:53.950> automotive<00:01:54.250> industry<00:01:54.429> a

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
standard in the automotive industry a

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.219 
standard in the automotive industry a
solid<00:01:55.119> tone<00:01:55.330> is<00:01:55.479> usually<00:01:55.899> about<00:01:56.229> a<00:01:56.289> foot<00:01:56.619> or<00:01:56.740> so

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
solid tone is usually about a foot or so

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.749 
solid tone is usually about a foot or so
now<00:01:59.229> this<00:01:59.350> is<00:01:59.470> a<00:01:59.500> pretty<00:01:59.799> adjustable<00:02:00.520> system

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
now this is a pretty adjustable system

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.399 
now this is a pretty adjustable system
you'll<00:02:01.509> notice<00:02:01.750> that<00:02:01.840> when<00:02:01.990> you're<00:02:02.110> in<00:02:02.229> this

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
you'll notice that when you're in this

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.039 
you'll notice that when you're in this
mode<00:02:02.679> you<00:02:03.390> can<00:02:04.390> do<00:02:04.450> a<00:02:04.479> couple<00:02:04.690> different

mode you can do a couple different
things<00:02:05.340> go<00:02:06.340> into<00:02:06.520> graphic<00:02:06.759> here<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:08.440> you<00:02:08.679> can

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
the parking sensors you press that

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.090 
the parking sensors you press that
button<00:02:13.780> there<00:02:14.110> on<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.230> corner<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.709> you<00:02:14.769> push

it again goes to rear view mode so if

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.780 
it again goes to rear view mode so if
you<00:02:17.530> just<00:02:17.680> want<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.890> sensor<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:18.489> you<00:02:18.519> can<00:02:18.640> just

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
you just want the sensor so you can just

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.300 
you just want the sensor so you can just
have<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:18.970> sensors<00:02:19.390> as<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:20.830> can<00:02:20.980> see<00:02:21.130> even

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
have the sensors as you can see even

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.190 
have the sensors as you can see even
though<00:02:21.519> I'm<00:02:21.790> in<00:02:21.970> park<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.630> have<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.930> parking

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
though I'm in park I have the parking

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.259 
though I'm in park I have the parking
system<00:02:23.560> on<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:24.190> I'm<00:02:24.280> just<00:02:24.400> in<00:02:24.580> Park<00:02:24.849> mode<00:02:25.060> it

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
system on and I'm just in Park mode it

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.360 
system on and I'm just in Park mode it
still<00:02:25.930> gives<00:02:26.260> me<00:02:26.350> an<00:02:26.470> idea<00:02:26.709> of<00:02:26.980> what<00:02:27.280> the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
still gives me an idea of what the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.890 
still gives me an idea of what the
sensors<00:02:27.700> can<00:02:27.790> sense<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.329> how<00:02:28.390> close<00:02:28.600> we<00:02:28.870> are

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
sensors can sense and how close we are

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.099 
sensors can sense and how close we are
and<00:02:29.940> same<00:02:30.940> thing<00:02:30.970> here<00:02:31.150> as<00:02:31.450> well<00:02:31.630> as<00:02:31.750> repeat<00:02:31.989> on

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109 
and same thing here as well as repeat on

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:36.750 
and same thing here as well as repeat on
the<00:02:32.230> screen<00:02:33.000> going<00:02:34.000> into<00:02:34.269> settings<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:36.640> can

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
the screen going into settings you can

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.910 
the screen going into settings you can
change<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.269> volume<00:02:37.450> front<00:02:37.959> and<00:02:38.049> rear<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.500> the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
change the volume front and rear and the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.920 
change the volume front and rear and the
frequency<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:40.090> also<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.420> entertainment

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
frequency and also the entertainment

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.440 
frequency and also the entertainment
line<00:02:41.049> as<00:02:41.290> well

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
line as well

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.170 
line as well
so<00:02:42.990> I<00:02:43.050> can<00:02:43.200> set<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.440> volume<00:02:43.590> here<00:02:43.980> an<00:02:44.849> idea<00:02:45.120> of

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
so I can set the volume here an idea of

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.910 
so I can set the volume here an idea of
how<00:02:45.300> loud<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.630> will<00:02:45.720> get<00:02:47.660> back<00:02:48.660> on<00:02:48.870> here<00:02:49.170> now

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
how loud it will get back on here now

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.860 
how loud it will get back on here now
this<00:02:50.130> is<00:02:50.250> actually<00:02:50.520> kind<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.849> built<00:02:51.270> in<00:02:51.480> joke

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
this is actually kind of a built in joke

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.449 
this is actually kind of a built in joke
that<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.140> swear<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.739> Germans<00:02:53.099> put<00:02:53.190> in

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
here it's kind of kind of funny you can

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.110 
here it's kind of kind of funny you can
change<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.349> frequency<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:56.069> adjust<00:02:56.819> unit

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
change the frequency and adjust unit

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:11.000 
change the frequency and adjust unit
sounds<00:02:57.420> out<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:57.720> little<00:02:58.020> areas<00:03:09.709> so<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:10.739> can

interrupted by another beep and let's
see<00:03:33.660> how<00:03:33.870> close<00:03:34.320> they'll<00:03:34.620> let<00:03:34.800> me<00:03:34.890> get<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.280> the

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
see how close they'll let me get to the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.310

hour but let's just focus on just the

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.160 
hour but let's just focus on just the
sensors<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:47.210> as<00:03:48.210> you<00:03:48.360> can<00:03:48.510> see<00:03:48.690> here<00:03:48.930> we<00:03:49.020> also

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
sensors and as you can see here we also

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.740 
sensors and as you can see here we also
have<00:03:49.320> trajectory<00:03:50.280> lines<00:03:50.520> here<00:03:50.940> which<00:03:51.600> I've

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
have trajectory lines here which I've

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.360

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
you can see the color of the sensors

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.400 
you can see the color of the sensors
also<00:04:08.490> change<00:04:09.030> kind<00:04:09.690> of<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.840> direction<00:04:10.290> you're

in white for forward red for reverse
anyway

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
anyway

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.620

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
the color of this part I mean ok so

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.599 
the color of this part I mean ok so
let's<00:04:18.870> see<00:04:19.109> how<00:04:19.320> far<00:04:19.890> it'll<00:04:20.130> let<00:04:20.310> me<00:04:20.430> get

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
let's see how far it'll let me get

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.660 
let's see how far it'll let me get
before<00:04:21.030> I<00:04:21.239> crash<00:04:21.630> into<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:22.019> Milan

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.369 

Oh

so Reds for the direction you're going
if<00:04:30.879> there<00:04:31.030> was<00:04:31.150> something<00:04:31.360> behind<00:04:31.509> me<00:04:31.900> two

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
if there was something behind me two

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.159 
if there was something behind me two
would<00:04:32.229> start<00:04:32.439> turning<00:04:32.710> white<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.990> now<00:04:38.080> we

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
would start turning white and now we

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.610 
would start turning white and now we
have<00:04:38.289> a<00:04:38.349> solid<00:04:38.529> tone<00:04:39.240> let<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.360> ebrake<00:04:40.689> on<00:04:40.960> and

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
have a solid tone let the ebrake on and

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.640 
have a solid tone let the ebrake on and
see<00:04:42.069> how<00:04:42.099> close<00:04:42.340> we<00:04:42.430> are<00:04:42.669> to<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:44.050> static<00:04:44.499> you

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
see how close we are to the static you

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.769 
see how close we are to the static you
hear<00:04:44.949> let's<00:04:45.669> the<00:04:45.759> vehicles<00:04:46.090> in<00:04:46.180> park<00:04:46.419> we<00:04:46.569> turn

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:46.779 
hear let's the vehicles in park we turn

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:51.179 
hear let's the vehicles in park we turn
white<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.259> same<00:04:50.499> thing<00:04:50.770> with<00:04:50.889> the<00:04:50.949> front

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:51.189

guess what give you about a foot left in
Rome<00:04:54.930> yep<00:04:55.960> you<00:04:56.110> see<00:04:56.229> it's<00:04:56.379> almost<00:04:56.469> exactly

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:57.069 
Rome yep you see it's almost exactly

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:58.860 
Rome yep you see it's almost exactly
calibrated<00:04:57.759> to<00:04:57.849> be<00:04:57.939> the<00:04:58.060> same<00:04:58.270> as<00:04:58.509> the<00:04:58.659> rear

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
calibrated to be the same as the rear

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.749 
calibrated to be the same as the rear
when<00:04:59.529> Stern<00:04:59.680> to<00:04:59.860> a<00:04:59.919> solid<00:05:00.189> tone<00:05:00.310> still<00:05:00.550> gives

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
when Stern to a solid tone still gives

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.540 
when Stern to a solid tone still gives
you<00:05:00.849> another<00:05:01.000> foot<00:05:02.039> which<00:05:03.039> is<00:05:03.159> kind<00:05:03.340> of<00:05:03.400> useful

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550
