goes<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.020> u-turn<00:01:46.380> here<00:01:46.649> which<00:01:46.890> made<00:01:47.100> no

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
goes for to u-turn here which made no

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.840 
goes for to u-turn here which made no
sense<00:01:47.720> but<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:49.079> don't<00:01:49.380> know<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:49.770> he<00:01:50.340> decided<00:01:50.729> to

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
sense but I don't know but he decided to

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.760 
sense but I don't know but he decided to
go<00:01:50.970> for<00:01:51.149> do<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.329> turn<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.869> said<00:01:52.140> he<00:01:52.590> goes

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
go for do you turn like I said he goes

thought<00:01:54.600> i<00:01:54.840> could<00:01:55.049> maybe<00:01:55.229> win<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.619> speed<00:01:55.890> tie

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
thought i could maybe win the speed tie

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.219 
thought i could maybe win the speed tie
but<00:01:56.759> i<00:01:56.790> did<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.390> he<00:01:57.600> goes<00:01:57.780> for<00:01:57.960> his<00:01:58.020> own

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
but i did it and he goes for his own

but i did it and he goes for his own
close<00:01:58.530> combat<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.189> he's<00:01:59.520> able<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.880> take<00:02:00.149> out

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
close combat and he's able to take out

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.719 
close combat and he's able to take out
my<00:02:00.329> infernape<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.799> kind<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.130> sucks<00:02:02.399> cuz

sir<00:02:28.030> is<00:02:28.210> a<00:02:28.240> major<00:02:28.540> threat<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.930> my<00:02:29.290> dog<00:02:29.770> fan<00:02:30.100> but

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
sir is a major threat to my dog fan but

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.240 
sir is a major threat to my dog fan but
i<00:02:30.580> decided<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.360> go<00:02:31.390> for<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.720> toxic<00:02:32.200> here<00:02:32.410> so<00:02:33.220> i

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
i decided to go for a toxic here so i

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.060 
i decided to go for a toxic here so i
could<00:02:33.400> cripple<00:02:33.730> his<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.300> Quagsire<00:02:35.290> but<00:02:35.590> instead

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
could cripple his a Quagsire but instead

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.790 
could cripple his a Quagsire but instead
the<00:02:36.400> Kyurem<00:02:36.880> gets<00:02:37.090> toxic<00:02:37.959> so<00:02:38.290> i<00:02:38.320> guess<00:02:38.620> that

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
the Kyurem gets toxic so i guess that

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.610 
the Kyurem gets toxic so i guess that
works<00:02:39.010> out<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.220> so<00:02:40.000> he<00:02:40.630> goes<00:02:40.780> for<00:02:40.990> a<00:02:41.050> substitute

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
works out to so he goes for a substitute

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.520 
works out to so he goes for a substitute
here<00:02:41.860> as<00:02:42.130> i<00:02:42.880> go<00:02:43.120> for<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.390> rapid<00:02:43.840> spin<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.230> get<00:02:44.380> rid

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
here as i go for a rapid spin to get rid

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.230 
here as i go for a rapid spin to get rid
of<00:02:44.560> rocks<00:02:44.890> on<00:02:45.190> my<00:02:45.310> side<00:02:45.550> of<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.760> field<00:02:45.970> and

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
of rocks on my side of the field and

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.390 
of rocks on my side of the field and
he's<00:02:46.840> still<00:02:47.080> behind<00:02:47.170> that<00:02:47.500> substitute<00:02:48.130> so

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
he's still behind that substitute so

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.850 
he's still behind that substitute so
that<00:02:48.610> kind<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:48.910> sucks<00:02:49.209> so<00:02:49.570> now<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.800> know

boost<00:02:58.840> for<00:02:59.020> special<00:02:59.440> tech<00:02:59.680> which<00:02:59.950> is<00:03:00.160> pretty

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
boost for special tech which is pretty

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.030 
boost for special tech which is pretty
awesome<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:01.209> he<00:03:01.840> does<00:03:02.050> go<00:03:02.290> through<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.830> ice

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
awesome and he does go through the ice

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.190 
awesome and he does go through the ice
beam<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.760> it<00:03:04.030> ain't<00:03:04.360> gonna<00:03:04.450> do<00:03:04.750> a<00:03:04.780> lot<00:03:05.020> to<00:03:05.170> me

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
beam and it ain't gonna do a lot to me

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.380 
beam and it ain't gonna do a lot to me
because<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.709> steel<00:03:06.280> resistance<00:03:06.850> and<00:03:07.000> all<00:03:07.150> that

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
because of steel resistance and all that

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.840 
because of steel resistance and all that
and<00:03:08.080> I<00:03:08.290> decided<00:03:08.709> instead<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.430> going<00:03:09.640> for<00:03:09.700> a

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
and I decided instead of going for a

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.390 
and I decided instead of going for a
flamethrower<00:03:10.260> just<00:03:11.260> to<00:03:11.380> break<00:03:11.560> his<00:03:11.709> sub<00:03:11.950> or

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
flamethrower just to break his sub or

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.699 
flamethrower just to break his sub or
something<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.239> go<00:03:13.450> for<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.750> u-turn<00:03:14.110> which<00:03:14.380> also

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
something I go for a u-turn which also

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.009 
something I go for a u-turn which also
breaks<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.280> sub<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:16.120> I<00:03:16.360> also<00:03:16.510> gets<00:03:16.810> which

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
breaks the sub and I also gets which

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.160 
breaks the sub and I also gets which
initiative<00:03:17.560> into<00:03:18.040> my<00:03:18.630> gyarados<00:03:19.630> which<00:03:19.900> can

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
initiative into my gyarados which can

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.460 
initiative into my gyarados which can

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
me he's probably choice so i decided to

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.630

switch out to my donphan here and then i

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.970 
switch out to my donphan here and then i
decided<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.330> double<00:04:04.600> switch<00:04:04.810> out<00:04:05.019> because

knew<00:04:56.250> that<00:04:56.280> I<00:04:56.640> would<00:04:56.910> be<00:04:57.060> faster<00:04:57.570> because<00:04:57.780> he

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
knew that I would be faster because he

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.230 
knew that I would be faster because he
is<00:04:58.170> not<00:04:58.380> to<00:04:58.530> choice<00:04:58.740> scarf<00:04:59.040> set<00:04:59.370> but<00:05:00.030> now<00:05:00.180> he

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
is not to choice scarf set but now he

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.660 
is not to choice scarf set but now he
switches<00:05:00.570> out<00:05:00.810> to<00:05:01.050> his<00:05:01.260> Infernape<00:05:01.860> and<00:05:02.070> he<00:05:02.520> is

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
switches out to his Infernape and he is

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.030 
switches out to his Infernape and he is
faster<00:05:03.090> than<00:05:03.120> my<00:05:03.390> latios<00:05:03.810> so<00:05:04.050> that<00:05:04.230> reveals<00:05:04.620> to

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
faster than my latios so that reveals to

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.210 
faster than my latios so that reveals to
me<00:05:05.070> that<00:05:05.550> he<00:05:06.330> is<00:05:06.570> a<00:05:06.900> choice<00:05:07.320> scarf<00:05:07.680> set<00:05:08.010> which

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
me that he is a choice scarf set which

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.770 
me that he is a choice scarf set which
is<00:05:08.370> kind<00:05:08.580> of<00:05:08.670> different<00:05:08.850> so<00:05:09.240> if<00:05:09.390> he<00:05:09.600> returns

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
is kind of different so if he returns

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.040 
is kind of different so if he returns
and<00:05:10.790> doesn't<00:05:11.790> kill<00:05:11.970> my<00:05:12.120> latios<00:05:12.510> which<00:05:12.690> is<00:05:12.840> good

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
and doesn't kill my latios which is good

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.050 
and doesn't kill my latios which is good
he<00:05:13.260> goes<00:05:13.440> out<00:05:13.650> to<00:05:13.770> his<00:05:13.920> gliscor<00:05:14.400> I<00:05:14.610> go<00:05:14.760> for<00:05:14.970> the

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
he goes out to his gliscor I go for the

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.500 
he goes out to his gliscor I go for the
surf<00:05:15.330> here<00:05:15.630> and<00:05:16.010> I<00:05:17.010> do<00:05:17.070> a<00:05:17.370> nice<00:05:18.000> amount<00:05:18.330> of

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
surf here and I do a nice amount of

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.890 
surf here and I do a nice amount of
health<00:05:18.780> damage<00:05:19.770> but<00:05:20.340> I<00:05:20.610> don't<00:05:21.420> kill<00:05:21.780> the

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
health damage but I don't kill the

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.690 
health damage but I don't kill the
gliscor<00:05:22.410> so<00:05:22.680> I'm<00:05:22.980> gonna<00:05:23.070> have<00:05:23.280> to<00:05:23.370> go<00:05:23.490> for

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
gliscor so I'm gonna have to go for

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.630 
gliscor so I'm gonna have to go for
another<00:05:23.940> surf<00:05:24.480> to<00:05:25.140> take<00:05:25.350> out<00:05:25.530> his<00:05:25.680> gliscor<00:05:26.280> so

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
another surf to take out his gliscor so

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.000 
another surf to take out his gliscor so
that<00:05:27.450> will<00:05:27.630> be<00:05:27.780> the<00:05:27.810> end<00:05:27.960> of<00:05:28.110> his<00:05:28.260> gliscor<00:05:28.800> with

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
that will be the end of his gliscor with

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.980 
that will be the end of his gliscor with
this<00:05:29.220> second<00:05:29.670> surf<00:05:29.880> so<00:05:30.420> now<00:05:30.630> he's<00:05:30.810> going<00:05:30.900> to

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
this second surf so now he's going to

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.830 
this second surf so now he's going to
have<00:05:31.140> to<00:05:31.200> divert<00:05:31.500> switch<00:05:31.860> into<00:05:32.310> his<00:05:32.840> infernape

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
have to divert switch into his infernape

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.420 
have to divert switch into his infernape
or<00:05:34.080> he's<00:05:34.350> going<00:05:34.470> to<00:05:34.530> have<00:05:34.710> to<00:05:34.740> switch<00:05:35.040> into<00:05:35.220> his

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
or he's going to have to switch into his

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.730 
or he's going to have to switch into his
tackle<00:05:36.060> der<00:05:36.180> in<00:05:36.450> this<00:05:36.810> case<00:05:37.050> you<00:05:37.200> decide<00:05:37.470> to<00:05:37.500> go

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
tackle der in this case you decide to go

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.070 
tackle der in this case you decide to go
to<00:05:37.800> who<00:05:38.010> Infernape<00:05:38.820> and<00:05:39.030> try<00:05:39.540> and<00:05:39.600> you<00:05:39.810> turn

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
to who Infernape and try and you turn

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.310 
to who Infernape and try and you turn
kill<00:05:40.350> me<00:05:40.560> but<00:05:41.340> I<00:05:41.760> decided<00:05:42.420> to<00:05:42.630> go<00:05:42.780> out<00:05:43.020> to<00:05:43.170> my

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
kill me but I decided to go out to my

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.700 
kill me but I decided to go out to my
genesect<00:05:43.860> here<00:05:44.100> predicting<00:05:44.700> that<00:05:44.910> so<00:05:45.710> that

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
genesect here predicting that so that

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.140 
genesect here predicting that so that
was<00:05:46.860> a<00:05:46.890> pretty<00:05:47.130> good<00:05:47.250> play<00:05:47.370> on<00:05:47.610> my<00:05:47.850> part

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
was a pretty good play on my part

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.080 
was a pretty good play on my part
because<00:05:48.540> now<00:05:49.200> my<00:05:49.500> latios<00:05:49.950> is<00:05:50.160> able<00:05:50.670> to<00:05:50.760> take<00:05:50.970> at

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
because now my latios is able to take at

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.670 
because now my latios is able to take at
least<00:05:51.240> one<00:05:51.480> more<00:05:51.660> hit<00:05:51.840> from<00:05:51.990> that<00:05:52.050> infernape

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
least one more hit from that infernape

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.220 
least one more hit from that infernape
so<00:05:53.310> he<00:05:53.580> decided<00:05:53.970> to<00:05:54.120> switch<00:05:54.540> out<00:05:54.750> here<00:05:54.960> go<00:05:55.200> into

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
so he decided to switch out here go into

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.200 
so he decided to switch out here go into
his<00:05:55.590> Quagsire<00:05:56.250> which<00:05:56.460> is<00:05:56.610> still<00:05:56.820> choice

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
his Quagsire which is still choice

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.690 
his Quagsire which is still choice
locked<00:05:57.510> and<00:05:57.810> I<00:05:58.560> went<00:05:58.800> for<00:05:58.890> an<00:05:59.070> ice<00:05:59.220> beam<00:05:59.490> here

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
locked and I went for an ice beam here

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.610 
locked and I went for an ice beam here
just<00:06:00.000> because<00:06:00.150> it's<00:06:00.570> the<00:06:00.660> best<00:06:00.990> move<00:06:01.200> I<00:06:01.320> can<00:06:01.500> do

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
just because it's the best move I can do

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.770 
just because it's the best move I can do
against<00:06:01.980> this<00:06:02.130> Quagsire<00:06:02.730> as<00:06:03.060> he<00:06:03.330> goes<00:06:03.510> for<00:06:03.720> his

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
against this Quagsire as he goes for his

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.930 
against this Quagsire as he goes for his
scaled<00:06:04.170> and<00:06:04.410> a<00:06:04.920> choice<00:06:05.130> back<00:06:05.430> skeletal

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
scaled and a choice back skeletal

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.610 
scaled and a choice back skeletal
actually<00:06:06.300> did<00:06:06.480> a<00:06:06.510> lot<00:06:06.720> to<00:06:06.900> me<00:06:06.990> but<00:06:07.260> then<00:06:07.500> again

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
actually did a lot to me but then again

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.770 
actually did a lot to me but then again
he<00:06:07.920> did<00:06:08.100> get<00:06:08.280> a<00:06:08.310> creek<00:06:08.670> I<00:06:08.910> don't<00:06:09.480> think<00:06:09.690> that

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
he did get a creek I don't think that

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.570 
he did get a creek I don't think that
mattered<00:06:10.200> oh<00:06:10.320> because<00:06:10.530> a<00:06:10.710> toy<00:06:10.950> specs<00:06:11.310> code

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
mattered oh because a toy specs code

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.100 
mattered oh because a toy specs code
that's<00:06:11.760> going<00:06:11.820> to<00:06:11.970> hit<00:06:12.120> me<00:06:12.240> hard<00:06:12.450> so<00:06:12.690> I<00:06:12.720> decided

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
that's going to hit me hard so I decided

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.519 
that's going to hit me hard so I decided
to<00:06:13.230> go<00:06:13.290> for<00:06:13.470> a<00:06:13.530> surf<00:06:13.770> here
