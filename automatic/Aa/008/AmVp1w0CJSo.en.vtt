00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.000 
promotion you know our best and happiest
patients<00:01:14.810> are<00:01:15.170> patients<00:01:15.290> that<00:01:15.620> want<00:01:15.740> to<00:01:15.860> look

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
patients are patients that want to look

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.220 
patients are patients that want to look

and feel the best they can for their age

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.490 
and feel the best they can for their age
so<00:01:18.980> we<00:01:19.520> did<00:01:19.700> a<00:01:19.730> lot<00:01:20.450> of<00:01:20.510> surgery<00:01:20.810> at<00:01:21.080> one<00:01:21.260> time

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
so we did a lot of surgery at one time

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.620 
so we did a lot of surgery at one time
so<00:01:21.740> that's<00:01:21.920> a<00:01:22.010> little<00:01:22.130> bit<00:01:22.310> bigger<00:01:22.630> recovery

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
so that's a little bit bigger recovery

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.020 
so that's a little bit bigger recovery
than<00:01:23.810> then<00:01:24.260> some<00:01:25.040> surgery<00:01:25.430> so<00:01:25.670> how<00:01:25.790> did<00:01:25.940> that

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
than then some surgery so how did that

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.020 
than then some surgery so how did that
go<00:01:26.240> for<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:26.540> it<00:01:27.260> was<00:01:27.440> really<00:01:27.770> quite<00:01:28.550> easy<00:01:28.580> a

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
go for you it was really quite easy a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.790 
go for you it was really quite easy a
lot<00:01:29.330> better<00:01:29.600> than<00:01:29.900> I<00:01:30.020> expected

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
lot better than I expected

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.200 
lot better than I expected
I<00:01:30.980> I<00:01:32.080> would<00:01:33.080> say<00:01:33.409> if<00:01:34.070> I<00:01:34.280> was<00:01:34.430> going<00:01:34.610> to<00:01:34.640> compare

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
I I would say if I was going to compare

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.750 
I I would say if I was going to compare
what<00:01:35.900> was<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.290> worst<00:01:36.530> probably<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.490> laser

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
what was the worst probably the laser

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.990 
what was the worst probably the laser
and<00:01:38.350> that<00:01:39.350> was<00:01:39.560> just<00:01:39.890> nothing<00:01:40.370> on<00:01:40.550> earth<00:01:40.580> but

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
and that was just nothing on earth but

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.270 
and that was just nothing on earth but
nerve-wracking<00:01:41.750> not<00:01:41.930> as<00:01:42.080> much<00:01:42.290> pain<00:01:42.680> as<00:01:43.070> it

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
nerve-wracking not as much pain as it

from<00:01:53.540> any<00:01:53.630> cosmetic<00:01:54.290> surgery<00:01:54.710> is<00:01:55.750> significant

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
from any cosmetic surgery is significant

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.410 
from any cosmetic surgery is significant
and<00:01:56.840> when<00:01:56.930> you<00:01:57.020> combine<00:01:57.260> procedures<00:01:58.010> you're

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
and when you combine procedures you're

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.610 
and when you combine procedures you're
probably<00:01:59.420> pretty<00:01:59.690> beat<00:01:59.930> up<00:01:59.960> there<00:02:00.320> for<00:02:00.500> that

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
probably pretty beat up there for that

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.680 
probably pretty beat up there for that
first<00:02:01.100> week<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.240> laser<00:02:02.450> is<00:02:02.630> a

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
first week and and the laser is a

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.600 
first week and and the laser is a
demanding<00:02:03.200> recovery<00:02:03.650> it's<00:02:03.799> not<00:02:03.950> so<00:02:04.159> much<00:02:04.340> that

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
demanding recovery it's not so much that

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.520 
demanding recovery it's not so much that
it's<00:02:04.760> painful<00:02:04.820> you<00:02:05.690> just<00:02:05.930> swollen<00:02:06.170> and

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
it's painful you just swollen and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.449 
it's painful you just swollen and
distorted<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.119> but<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.509> has<00:02:09.190> one<00:02:10.190> of<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.340> more

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
distorted and but it has one of the more

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.309 
distorted and but it has one of the more
demanding<00:02:10.909> recoveries<00:02:11.420> but<00:02:11.599> it<00:02:11.720> is<00:02:11.900> certainly

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
demanding recoveries but it is certainly

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.069 
demanding recoveries but it is certainly
one<00:02:12.920> of<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.099> most<00:02:13.310> dramatic

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.079 
one of the most dramatic

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.149 
one of the most dramatic
before-and-after<00:02:15.079> things<00:02:15.349> that<00:02:15.650> we<00:02:15.769> do<00:02:15.950> and

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
before-and-after things that we do and

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.960 
before-and-after things that we do and

increase this case you did have

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.180 
increase this case you did have
students<00:02:18.240> were<00:02:18.390> should<00:02:18.540> these<00:02:18.660> big<00:02:18.930> bags<00:02:19.770> that

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
students were should these big bags that

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.430 
students were should these big bags that
that<00:02:20.490> some<00:02:20.700> people<00:02:20.970> get<00:02:21.090> on<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.870> cheeks<00:02:22.170> and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
that some people get on the cheeks and

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.300 
that some people get on the cheeks and
we<00:02:23.340> really<00:02:23.610> improve<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:25.280> now<00:02:26.280> that
