00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.170
 someone said that the variety from more 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.809
 pepper to life 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.360
 for me instead are the pepper and spices a 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.699
 give variety to the aromas diet and 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.520
 condiments define whole cultures 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.760
 Chinese cuisine in general 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.590
 it is associated with ginger and garlic that 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.269
 Mexican and spicy based 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.730
 chili with cumin 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.309
 the Italian is characterized by herbs such as 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.559
 basil and rosemary in the kitchen 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.469
 American instead the typical dishes are 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.989
 simply flavored with salt and pepper 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.120
 There are very few recipes for sugar 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.350
 that make great use of spices and 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.230
 condiments 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.629
 this is a shame because herbs and spices 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.020
 they don't just make food more 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.899
 good herbs and spices are produced 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.449
 natural vegetables and therefore as fruit 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.140
 vegetables and cereals contain a great deal 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.809
 number of antioxidants and phytonutrients 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.659
 no calories herbs and spices give more 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.939
 taste compared to salt and sugar fats 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.280
 of which we make such extensive use 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.020
 we begin to employ them in ours 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.390
 kitchen in order to reduce the intake 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.360
 calorie that must be careful with 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.070
 Sodium consumption can replace salt 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.350
 with herbs and spices 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.100
 also tasty foods tend to 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.869
 satiate more than tasteless ones 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.079
 you will find that smaller portions of 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.000
 well-seasoned foods satisfy much more 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.409
 so they can help keep you under 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.930
 check the weight 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.920
 many people are puzzled when 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.299
 they must use herbs and spices in the kitchen 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.649
 cooking must be an activity 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.000
 creative and then try to experiment 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.520
 start buying herbal and 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.040
 most common spices given a sniff e 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.140
 taste to see which ones you think 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.170
 they match the dish you have best 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.930
 in mind there are no rules written in 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.659
 kitchen but if you don't know where to start 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.880
 you can find guides 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.599
 classic combinations in recipe books and on 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.759
 internet if you are particularly 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:13.069
 unsafe here is some advice 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.769
 add some basil or oregano 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.319
 dry salad or tomato sauce 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.540
 or a pinch of carrie in the rice 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.970
 steamed to give more flavor and 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.489
 more or less color we all know the 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.700
 sweet taste of cinnamon which is excellent 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.620
 on fruit or oatmeal 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.989
 try however to vary with some other 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.470
 spicy sweet spice like nails of 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.379
 carnation or nutmeg herbs and spices 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.569
 they work wonders even with vegetables 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.879
 put some ginger on the carrots or 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.430
 some mint leaves on peas 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:49.430
 fresh you will make extraordinary 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.470
 the ordinary and you can even convert 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.269
 to the vegetables also the components of the 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.879
 family that never loved them 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.280
 you can use herbs and spices either 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.890
 fresh and dried but to have the 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.290
 same intensity of flavor you have to use 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.810
 about twice the fresh version 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.609
 compared to dried spices 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.310
 can be added to any 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:12.799
 moment during the preparation while 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.920
 the herbs retain their flavor more 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.950
 if added towards the end herbs and spices 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.260
 both fresh and preserved 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.959
 away from heat and light 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.150
 pay attention to the recommended date 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.549
 given on the label because one 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.720
 prolonged storage causes one 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.720
 loss of flavor
