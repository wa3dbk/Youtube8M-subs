00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
and they're also growing in the same

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.130 
and they're also growing in the same
region<00:00:34.680> as<00:00:34.920> kiwi<00:00:35.730> fruit<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.120> New<00:00:36.239> Zealand<00:00:36.270> our

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
region as kiwi fruit in New Zealand our

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.479 
region as kiwi fruit in New Zealand our
place<00:00:37.350> called<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.770> Bay<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:37.950> Plenty

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.860 

they<00:00:41.489> are<00:00:41.640> obviously<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.120> lot<00:00:42.329> smaller<00:00:42.660> than

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
they are obviously a lot smaller than

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.560 
they are obviously a lot smaller than
kiwi<00:00:43.350> fruit<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.210> another<00:00:45.210> thing<00:00:45.450> that's

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
kiwi fruit and another thing that's

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.529 
kiwi fruit and another thing that's
different<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.200> they<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:47.270> smooth<00:00:48.270> skin

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
different is that they have smooth skin

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.350 
different is that they have smooth skin
rather<00:00:49.200> than<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.770> fuzzy<00:00:49.980> skin<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.090> can't

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
rather than the fuzzy skin so you can't

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.240 
rather than the fuzzy skin so you can't
eat<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> whole<00:00:51.719> thing<00:00:52.020> just<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:53.039> that

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
eat the whole thing just like that

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.549 
eat the whole thing just like that
without<00:00:53.550> peeling<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.989> I've<00:00:55.079> never<00:00:55.289> tasted

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
without peeling it so I've never tasted

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.439 
without peeling it so I've never tasted

I'm gonna have a go at growing these so
I'm<00:01:18.150> gonna<00:01:18.330> cut<00:01:18.570> one<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.869> half<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.619> us

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
I'm gonna cut one in half and have us

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.700 
I'm gonna cut one in half and have us
some<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.130> seeds<00:01:20.400> out<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.640> them<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.710> let's

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
some of the seeds out of them and let's

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.050 
some of the seeds out of them and let's
do<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.040> now<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.369> see<00:01:23.640> what<00:01:23.790> they<00:01:23.880> look<00:01:24.030> like

do that now and see what they look like

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.539 
do that now and see what they look like
inside<00:01:27.439> so<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.560> looks<00:01:28.740> pretty<00:01:28.890> much<00:01:29.280> identical

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
inside so it looks pretty much identical

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.600 
inside so it looks pretty much identical
to<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> kiwi<00:01:30.630> fruit<00:01:30.869> inside<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.920> has<00:01:32.130> all<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
to a kiwi fruit inside it has all the

to a kiwi fruit inside it has all the
black<00:01:32.790> seeds<00:01:33.090> around<00:01:33.890> around<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.979> core<00:01:35.220> so

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
black seeds around around the core so

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.929 
black seeds around around the core so
I'm<00:01:36.329> gonna<00:01:36.540> take<00:01:36.750> them<00:01:37.110> now<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.710> try<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> couple

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
I'm gonna take them now and try a couple

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:46.179 
I'm gonna take them now and try a couple
of<00:01:39.090> different<00:01:39.150> ways<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.990> grow<00:01:40.170> them

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.279 

so<00:01:46.789> the<00:01:46.909> best<00:01:47.060> way<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.299> get<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:47.780> flesh<00:01:48.020> off

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
so the best way to get the flesh off

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.859 
so the best way to get the flesh off
your<00:01:48.319> Kiwi<00:01:48.890> berry<00:01:49.100> or<00:01:49.249> kiwi<00:01:49.729> fruit<00:01:49.969> seeds<00:01:50.270> is

I'll sprinkle in some of the seeds stick
into<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:29.030> ends<00:02:29.390> so<00:02:32.530> okay<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:33.590> I've<00:02:33.860> got<00:02:34.069> quite

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
into the ends so okay so I've got quite

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.069 
into the ends so okay so I've got quite
a<00:02:34.340> lot<00:02:34.430> of<00:02:34.579> seeds<00:02:34.879> in<00:02:35.120> there<00:02:35.299> so<00:02:35.660> now<00:02:35.840> I'm<00:02:35.930> just

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
a lot of seeds in there so now I'm just

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:41.640 
a lot of seeds in there so now I'm just
going<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.319> cover<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.709> soil<00:02:36.980> over<00:02:37.220> top<00:02:37.700> of<00:02:37.730> them

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.960

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
and then I'll just give them a bit of a

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.259 
and then I'll just give them a bit of a
water<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:44.629> keep<00:02:44.930> them<00:02:45.109> watered<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:46.030> I'll<00:02:47.030> see

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
water and keep them watered and I'll see

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.270 
water and keep them watered and I'll see
if<00:02:47.359> they<00:02:47.510> germinate<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:48.650> one<00:02:48.829> thing<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.129> know

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
if they germinate so one thing to know

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.280 
if they germinate so one thing to know
when<00:02:49.489> you<00:02:49.579> grow<00:02:49.700> kiwi<00:02:50.120> fruit<00:02:50.389> or<00:02:50.569> Kiwi<00:02:50.900> berries

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
when you grow kiwi fruit or Kiwi berries

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.930 
when you grow kiwi fruit or Kiwi berries
is<00:02:51.500> that<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.069> vines<00:02:52.310> they<00:02:52.549> grow<00:02:52.760> off

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
is that the vines they grow off

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.960 
is that the vines they grow off
dioecious<00:02:53.769> which<00:02:54.769> means<00:02:55.069> that<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.760> need<00:02:55.940> a

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
dioecious which means that you need a

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.240 
dioecious which means that you need a
male<00:02:56.329> plant<00:02:56.630> in<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.959> female<00:02:57.380> plant<00:02:57.620> in<00:02:57.920> order

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
male plant in a female plant in order

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.659 
male plant in a female plant in order
for<00:02:58.489> pollination<00:02:59.209> to<00:02:59.690> create<00:03:00.049> fruit<00:03:00.889> so<00:03:01.459> I'll

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:01.669 
for pollination to create fruit so I'll

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:03.430 
for pollination to create fruit so I'll
show<00:03:01.849> you<00:03:01.880> what<00:03:02.150> kiwi<00:03:02.569> fruit<00:03:02.840> plants<00:03:03.260> look

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
show you what kiwi fruit plants look

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.680 
show you what kiwi fruit plants look
like<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:03.970> started<00:03:04.970> growing<00:03:05.120> these<00:03:05.359> a<00:03:05.419> while

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
like I started growing these a while

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.569 
like I started growing these a while
back<00:03:05.989> and<00:03:06.290> I<00:03:06.410> just<00:03:06.620> got<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:06.889> seeds<00:03:07.099> out<00:03:07.310> of<00:03:07.340> a

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
back and I just got the seeds out of a

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.520 
back and I just got the seeds out of a
out<00:03:08.150> of<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.359> kiwi<00:03:08.690> fruit<00:03:08.930> I<00:03:09.109> bought<00:03:09.319> from<00:03:09.440> the

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
out of a kiwi fruit I bought from the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.460 
out of a kiwi fruit I bought from the
store<00:03:09.760> I<00:03:10.760> put<00:03:11.269> them<00:03:11.419> on<00:03:11.540> a<00:03:11.569> damp<00:03:11.870> paper<00:03:12.079> towel

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
store I put them on a damp paper towel

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.440 
store I put them on a damp paper towel
and<00:03:12.799> there's<00:03:13.069> a<00:03:13.160> block<00:03:13.370> bag<00:03:13.579> and<00:03:13.910> when<00:03:14.329> they

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
and there's a block bag and when they

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.000 
and there's a block bag and when they
sprouted<00:03:14.750> I<00:03:15.019> planted<00:03:15.410> them<00:03:15.500> out<00:03:15.650> into<00:03:15.829> this

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
sprouted I planted them out into this

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.879 
sprouted I planted them out into this
pot<00:03:16.780> so<00:03:18.970> as<00:03:19.970> you<00:03:20.269> can<00:03:20.419> see<00:03:20.480> they're<00:03:20.930> sort<00:03:21.859> of

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
pot so as you can see they're sort of

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.940 
pot so as you can see they're sort of
all<00:03:22.069> fighting<00:03:22.549> for<00:03:23.019> space<00:03:24.019> in<00:03:24.380> there<00:03:24.590> I<00:03:24.769> do

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
all fighting for space in there I do

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.009 
all fighting for space in there I do
need<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.250> transplant<00:03:25.849> them<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:26.660> you<00:03:26.720> can<00:03:26.870> also

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
need to transplant them and you can also

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.599 
need to transplant them and you can also
see<00:03:27.319> roots<00:03:27.560> coming<00:03:27.829> at<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.130> bottom<00:03:28.370> of<00:03:28.489> the

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
see roots coming at the bottom of the

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.699 
see roots coming at the bottom of the
pot<00:03:28.819> so<00:03:29.750> another<00:03:30.079> sign<00:03:30.349> that<00:03:30.560> he'd

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
pot so another sign that he'd

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.509 
pot so another sign that he'd
transplanting<00:03:31.459> I<00:03:32.319> imagine<00:03:33.319> that<00:03:33.530> Kiwi<00:03:34.340> berry

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
transplanting I imagine that Kiwi berry

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.000 
transplanting I imagine that Kiwi berry
plants<00:03:35.030> do<00:03:35.239> look<00:03:35.419> similar<00:03:35.630> and<00:03:36.049> they<00:03:36.650> are<00:03:36.769> both

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
plants do look similar and they are both

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.510 
plants do look similar and they are both
finds<00:03:37.340> and<00:03:37.609> they<00:03:37.730> are<00:03:37.880> related<00:03:38.299> fruits
