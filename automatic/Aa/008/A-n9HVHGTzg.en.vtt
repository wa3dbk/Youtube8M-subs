00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.389
 I wanted to refer to fact by putting three points that maybe 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:15.099
 we can all be interested, whatever the field of 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.179
 d 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:19.720
 of action of each one of you 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.720
 1 the president of the information 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.789
 conchi criteria decided 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.779
 that when I'm looking for information 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.240
 In the net 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.940
 and I found something and it seems to me an answer to my question 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.660
 as of been of 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.280
 I have reason to consider this information as gas 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.220
 boys 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.270
 this copy and tehran 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.220
 the first thing they find 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.890
 follow 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.540
 bruno 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.410
 without considering the same moment 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.900
 if that is 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.050
 true together with the commissions that want 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.750
 science is true or not 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.950
 to get started 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.230
 we as 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.180
 as generations 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.290
 what do we get in touch with the written language 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.300
 before the internet we have built 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.150
 criteria d 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.390
 veracity 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.970
 linked with books 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.800
 is what he wants to do with the appearance 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.460
 from the book 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.400
 with 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.320
 the publishing house 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.770
 with text image distribution 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.900
 with the print quality 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.090
 with a lot of indicators that nobody taught us I think they are part of 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.429
 that we were learning through our long history 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.429
 circulation with books and collector 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.020
 those indicators no longer exist in the network 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.300
 there is an indicator that is derived from our knowledge of the world of 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.350
 paper books 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.350
 or our knowledge of the institutions 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.050
 Yes, I see it 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.890
 that this information 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.390
 is the information that comes in one of the unesco sites 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:16.969
 I say good unesco is credible 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.119
 is a responsible team 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:22.719
 the same goes for newspapers 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.719
 the same goes for publishers 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:30.539
 He considered it equivalent to what I could read on paper and if that 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:32.079
 editorial I thought 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.479
 trustworthy 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:39.019
 then I transfer to the website the same reliability before the problem 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.129
 are 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.549
 millions 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.929
 or tens of millions of sites 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:49.480
 that do not have an institutional counterpart, Victor Heredia 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.079
 to the inter existence 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.749
 We do not have time but we do not have that reason for a very good tanger 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.449
 the advice really just advice because it's a problem 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:04.579
 very serious we still do not have stance and the criteria of reliable reliability 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.379
 that we can transmit 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:07.879
 ring 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.219
 if we collectively analyze the purchase criteria 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.399
 khedira that we use in our daily practice 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:21.559
 I anticipate that we are most likely to find very partial matches 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:25.479
 i strong discrepancy 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.680
 so I do not ask that adults be in a position to tell the 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.439
 Boys 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:37.699
 what are the reliability puppets 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:40.789
 but rather what you have to do is 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:42.729
 the problem 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:45.159
 and try to discuss together 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:46.679
 how it is done 

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:49.679
 so that finding a solution to that problem 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.459
 I'm not saying because because the expression look for information 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:59.649
 it is associating almost in a way to the auto matica ana internet 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:02.879
 really the expression looks for information 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.209
 and saw the internet 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.569
 claudio chÃ¡vez of the 50 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:08.629
 as is 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.429
 I give you issue option 

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:13.559
 to the machine you are looking for 

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:15.549
 and they appear to me 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.829
 thirty forty pages effect 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.400
 we all know that nobody floats at 30 40 pages but everyone stays 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.430
 the SME 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.009
 and entered the first the first places is a task where you have to learn to 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.300
 distrust 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.909
 and trust 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:35.069
 and the criteria of distrust and trust that must be articulated 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.069
 they are not the seers I think we have learned very quickly that the 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:41.550
 button who are we 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.099
 it does not work for 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:48.099
 as on the internet lies the most Olympic way possible 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.719
 This is the ideal place to generate false identities 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.650
 and I want button that we are 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.650
 that vote the most cheating that makes 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.940
 where yes the identity will be recognized and I will only do 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.449
 corroborate it 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.289
 and if it was not known 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.269
 Well yes I had the same null tour that I had before
