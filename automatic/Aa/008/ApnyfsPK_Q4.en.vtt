00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.740
 Jojo get heart yes no I want 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.139
 actually do not call info video 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.500
 because I do not like info videos because 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:21.840
 People just push you in so well 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:23.160
 in the youtube so in the youtube and it 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.630
 It's just about me doing it 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.029
 sit down and thought right now is 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.640
 in the morning woman advertises for the cd since 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.880
 a school or actor fan wants 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.360
 and actually people online over 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.840
 look and I palaver a bit 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.500
 what became the phase then became 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.020
 loudly I am back there he is 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.160
 back there but still happening and 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:55.100
 not really what that is because 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.100
 that's exactly what I said 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.680
 that's because I'm a bit too 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.949
 do in the widest sense 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.290
 and indeed it is so that I am now 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:13.530
 back and you also have the video 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.760
 seen from the tom is the update video of 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.860
 Tom saw and there are also the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.409
 People of motion of gamers said yes 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.479
 we hope that with the foot is carbon 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.030
 etc 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:26.220
 and that's the point for me 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.770
 have problems with the foot 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.250
 and if that is the case with the doctor 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.470
 etc etc etc pp and we had 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.820
 already as said these projects the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.259
 I want to do but all first 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.689
 then when it's done with the foot 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.340
 is and to get to the point of me 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.060
 will probably in a week the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.500
 probably means 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.240
 All right, it's probably because 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.829
 It is not yet known 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.450
 even if there are still some 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.119
 values ​​and then everything stands 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.560
 not all depends on whether I fit 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.979
 I am or not 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.450
 hospital for a week drastically 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.060
 looks and that's why I have too 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.310
 always told tom for example because 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.549
 today is probably something 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.930
 project together with tom so yes 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.970
 I also said okay we can do that 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.009
 Everything at the beginning of it full of bock but 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.830
 please first 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.000
 After all, I'm not back, so to speak 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.010
 maybe not healthy because of that 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.610
 does not go right away but after I 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:25.079
 at least what if I at least 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.790
 back home and not yet 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.420
 hospital or something like that before me and 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:38.519
 that's what we want on average 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:40.109
 let it break off normally before I 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.829
 I'll just look around you 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:45.150
 really cool as a lot changed and yes 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.310
 we have to look like I only 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.290
 But I will definitely do it 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.190
 kept up to date what they did 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.299
 what I do and when I do 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.310
 again fit or 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.109
 see yes then you know what you going what 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.340
 I'll go see that, of course 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:04.260
 I still have the week left 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.489
 bring a few videos and and of course 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.379
 make a maybe what the 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.639
 come back now and that will 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.799
 breakfast funny if you slim or 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:13.620

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:16.440
 who is up for it and looks so yes 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.819
 Currently that's just the thing and 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.400
 I gag in turn and I have 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.930
 actually much much much time 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.569
 but it's not all that is 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.109
 set correctly and you can still 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:31.199
 not really do something like that is 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:33.269
 that here so you have already and 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:35.459
 How can we do it? 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.769
 What do I mean meaningful words 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.750
