 Hello Nita In the kitchen you are welcome. 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.160
 Today we are going to make carrot pudding in the microwave. 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.220
 This is a famous North Indian dessert. 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.680
 It is very healthy to eat 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.140
 And it's very easy to microwave 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.860
 And a lot of work can be made by using ghee. 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.860
 Then come see 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.980
 What we need to make carrot pudding. 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.400
 1/2 cucumber carrot, 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.820
 1/4 cup milk, 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.140
 1/4 cup or 60 grams of sugar, 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.360
 3 tablespoons cream, 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.680
 1/2 tbsp ghee, 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.920
 To decorate cashews and almonds 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.580
 First of all, we will take out the carrot peel. 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.840
 We have already washed the carrot well. 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.340
 After washing it is wiped with dry cloth. 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.240
 Now we will cut the upper part of it. 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.820
 In this way we will peel all the carrots. 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.680
 Now we have removed the peel, 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:32.180
 After peeling, we can take long carrots 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.960
 Who has taken this carrot? 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.840
 Now we will take a microwave set bowl 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.420
 And 1/2 large spoon of which we greased 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.260
 We will put it in and on 100% power 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.160
 Will keep for 30 seconds. 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.360
 Bowl will always keep us in the middle 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.660
 So whatever the thing inside is well made 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.700
 It's 30 seconds now we will get out of the bowl. 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.880
 And see if our ghee is hot. 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.580
 Now the carrot we had, we will now put it in 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.760
 Mix well and for 5 minutes 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.720
 Microwave on 100% power 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.500
 We have 100% power for 5 minutes but microwave will 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.160
 It's been 5 minutes. Now we'll take out the carrots. 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.720
 Run once good 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.820
 Now we have milk, 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.120
 Cream 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.220
 Mix sugar and mix well 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.700
 You can work more according to your taste in sugars 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:22.020
 After mixing all the things together, now we get it 100% Power 10 minutes 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.020
 And run twice 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.820
 After microwave 10% 100% power, we now have it again 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.940
 Microwave for 60 minutes on power for 10 minutes 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.540
 And shake twice in the middle 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.920

 Now we have cut the cashew nuts into two pieces 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.280
 He would put cashews and almonds on it 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.960
 After decorating it with cashew nuts 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.960
 Now we will microwave it 100% power for a minute 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.160
