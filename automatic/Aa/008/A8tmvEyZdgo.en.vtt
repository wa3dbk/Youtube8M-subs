00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.030
 is called every Christian from the basin 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.179
 This time I'll show you the camera 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.920
 surfaces of the samsung galaxy note 3 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.490
 for the first time here was one 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.410
 Panorama function introduced 360 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.270
 Panorama or panorama 360 in English 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.060
 means the whole space that means 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.570
 directly with photos four shots 360 degrees 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.949
 Recordings 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.689
 you have to google it already 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.160
 nexus four finished, for example 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.470
 I'll show you this a bit here 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.149
 straight into the smartphone of samsung and 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.910
 here you have always been a point of you 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.250
 indicates where I position the phone 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.340
 I have to go back a bit further 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.340
 above 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.990
 and wherever the point is 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.180
 will the photo 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.260
 made 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.510
 and so I can choose from many 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.600
 single photos 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.579
 a whole panorama 1 306 panorama 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.260
 patching up and if so now 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.289
 also the stop button goes so the whole 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.579
 rendered is put together and me 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.299
 Of course I can do that too 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:10.259
 watch my gallery again against that 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.820
 now would be the photo of 360 Â° I stop 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.820
 times the screen motionless on 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.970
 and you see the device makes 360 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.130
 Grad panorama now, of course, only in 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.830
 particular clipping because we are here as 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.210
 also the coach of the smartphones are located 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.320
 I think I have a small impression 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.520
 get it like the whole 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.680
 you can also work through 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.390
 turn the device on you in this room 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.580
 move around and look at the whole thing 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.010
 a very nice feature quality seems 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.900
 quite to be ok because you 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.430
 actually sees no transitions from the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.680
 individual pictures made here again 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.240
 and a really nice one 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.800
 feature something here further 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.620
 otherwise it was implemented 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.240
 Camera similar to the modes 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.390
 like the galaxy s 4 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.580
 of course, a very normal panorama you 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.560
 can delete person from the find the 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.960
 possibility to produce hd recordings 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.240
 but of course in the normal 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.630
 Auto mode to switch where the camera 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.899
 the best possible picture 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.310
 also manufacture the triggering delay is 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.989
 really damn fast 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.080
 that was it with a quick look at the 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.260
 Thanks a lot for the camera 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.260
 lotte
