00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
what we're going to do here is I already

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.250 
what we're going to do here is I already
have<00:01:17.230> a<00:01:17.680> coaster<00:01:18.670> clock<00:01:18.970> that<00:01:19.510> has<00:01:19.570> been<00:01:19.990> tryn

have a coaster clock that has been tryn

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.950 
have a coaster clock that has been tryn
it<00:01:20.410> so<00:01:21.010> we'll<00:01:21.370> swap<00:01:21.730> this<00:01:22.030> out<00:01:22.300> and<00:01:22.750> we'll

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
it so we'll swap this out and we'll

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.260 
it so we'll swap this out and we'll
bring<00:01:23.200> it<00:01:23.350> in<00:01:23.530> here<00:01:23.800> so<00:01:23.980> you<00:01:24.070> can<00:01:24.220> see<00:01:24.250> this<00:01:25.090> is

bring it in here so you can see this is

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.660 
bring it in here so you can see this is
the<00:01:25.300> one<00:01:25.690> that<00:01:25.810> we<00:01:25.930> did<00:01:26.140> from<00:01:26.470> our<00:01:26.680> sample<00:01:27.460> on

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
the one that we did from our sample on

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.300 
the one that we did from our sample on
how<00:01:28.000> to<00:01:28.060> print<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.570> coaster<00:01:28.960> clocks<00:01:29.260> and<00:01:29.650> to

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
how to print the coaster clocks and to

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.930 
how to print the coaster clocks and to
assemble<00:01:30.850> it<00:01:30.970> it<00:01:31.270> is<00:01:31.540> actually<00:01:31.930> extremely

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
assemble it it is actually extremely

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.420 
assemble it it is actually extremely
easy<00:01:34.350> basically<00:01:35.350> what<00:01:35.590> we<00:01:35.740> want<00:01:35.980> to<00:01:36.100> do<00:01:36.250> is

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
easy basically what we want to do is

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.940 
easy basically what we want to do is
first<00:01:36.670> figure<00:01:37.060> out<00:01:37.210> which<00:01:37.510> one<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.110> hands

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
first figure out which one of the hands

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.860 
first figure out which one of the hands
we<00:01:39.160> want<00:01:39.400> to<00:01:39.460> use<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:39.850> in<00:01:39.970> our<00:01:40.300> case<00:01:40.330> here

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
we want to use and in our case here

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.610 
we want to use and in our case here
we're<00:01:41.050> going<00:01:41.260> to<00:01:41.380> use<00:01:41.620> the<00:01:42.930> regular<00:01:43.930> plain

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
we're going to use the regular plain

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.650 
we're going to use the regular plain
hands<00:01:46.410> open<00:01:47.410> the<00:01:47.530> bag<00:01:47.740> up<00:01:48.040> and<00:01:48.340> you<00:01:49.270> will<00:01:49.420> have

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
hands open the bag up and you will have

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.240 
hands open the bag up and you will have
a<00:01:49.930> our<00:01:50.620> hand<00:01:51.220> a<00:01:51.460> minute<00:01:52.270> hand<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:52.810> also<00:01:53.530> the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
a our hand a minute hand and also the

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.930 
a our hand a minute hand and also the
second<00:01:54.910> movement

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
second movement

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.900 
second movement
and<00:01:57.310> getting<00:01:58.310> these<00:01:58.400> out<00:01:58.610> of<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.730> bag

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
and getting these out of the bag

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.180 
and getting these out of the bag
sometimes<00:01:59.210> can<00:01:59.660> be<00:01:59.690> a<00:01:59.780> trick<00:02:00.230> but<00:02:00.560> we<00:02:00.950> have

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
sometimes can be a trick but we have

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.320 
sometimes can be a trick but we have
these<00:02:01.460> here<00:02:02.000> okay<00:02:03.070> place<00:02:04.070> them<00:02:04.280> on<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.550> box<00:02:04.910> so

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
these here okay place them on the box so

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.260 
these here okay place them on the box so
that<00:02:05.360> we<00:02:05.630> have<00:02:05.660> easy<00:02:06.260> access<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:07.070> them<00:02:07.610> now<00:02:08.210> you

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
that we have easy access to them now you

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.540 
that we have easy access to them now you
also<00:02:08.600> want<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.140> take<00:02:09.440> note<00:02:09.470> that<00:02:09.740> there<00:02:10.040> is<00:02:10.280> a

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
also want to take note that there is a

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.770 
also want to take note that there is a
little<00:02:10.850> bit<00:02:11.060> of<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.300> plastic<00:02:12.700> covering<00:02:13.700> on<00:02:13.880> top

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
little bit of a plastic covering on top

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.730 
little bit of a plastic covering on top
of<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:16.780> hands<00:02:17.780> themselves<00:02:18.290> as<00:02:18.380> you<00:02:18.470> can<00:02:18.590> see

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
of the hands themselves as you can see

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.330 
of the hands themselves as you can see
here<00:02:19.370> I'm<00:02:20.150> peeling<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:20.690> off<00:02:20.990> and<00:02:21.620> we<00:02:22.220> can

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
here I'm peeling that off and we can

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.480 
here I'm peeling that off and we can
just<00:02:22.490> discard<00:02:22.910> that<00:02:23.630> so<00:02:24.560> we'll<00:02:25.010> want<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.310> make

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
just discard that so we'll want to make

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.780 
just discard that so we'll want to make
sure<00:02:25.520> that<00:02:25.820> we<00:02:25.970> get<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:27.200> plastic<00:02:27.680> off<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.520> each

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
sure that we get the plastic off of each

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.860 
sure that we get the plastic off of each
of<00:02:29.180> these<00:02:30.310> hands<00:02:31.310> so<00:02:32.060> we<00:02:32.210> can<00:02:32.360> assemble<00:02:32.660> the

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
of these hands so we can assemble the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.480 
of these hands so we can assemble the
clock<00:02:33.110> a<00:02:33.140> lot<00:02:33.410> easier<00:02:33.650> it'll<00:02:34.130> look<00:02:34.370> better<00:02:34.610> and

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
clock a lot easier it'll look better and

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.070 
clock a lot easier it'll look better and
the<00:02:37.490> second<00:02:38.000> hand<00:02:38.180> does<00:02:38.390> not<00:02:38.420> have<00:02:38.870> the

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
the second hand does not have the

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.720 
the second hand does not have the
plastic<00:02:39.620> on<00:02:39.770> it<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.510> can<00:02:41.720> see<00:02:42.080> so

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
plastic on it that I can see so

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.840 
plastic on it that I can see so
basically<00:02:43.730> what<00:02:44.210> we're<00:02:44.360> going<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.690> do<00:02:44.840> now<00:02:45.050> is

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
basically what we're going to do now is

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.030 
basically what we're going to do now is
going<00:02:46.850> to<00:02:47.180> assemble<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.960> clock<00:02:48.230> now<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.680> do

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
going to assemble the clock now to do

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.190 
going to assemble the clock now to do
this<00:02:49.250> it's<00:02:49.580> pretty<00:02:49.910> easy<00:02:50.060> we'll<00:02:50.930> take<00:02:51.170> our

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
this it's pretty easy we'll take our

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.130 
this it's pretty easy we'll take our
clock<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:52.570> you'll<00:02:53.570> notice<00:02:53.840> that<00:02:53.870> there<00:02:54.110> are

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
clock and you'll notice that there are

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.530 
clock and you'll notice that there are
two<00:02:54.380> holes<00:02:54.650> there<00:02:55.250> is<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.430> lower<00:02:55.850> one<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.330> an

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
two holes there is a lower one and an

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.840 
two holes there is a lower one and an
upper<00:02:56.780> one<00:02:56.990> here<00:02:57.440> this<00:02:57.950> allows<00:02:58.280> for<00:02:58.640> different

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
upper one here this allows for different

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.229 
upper one here this allows for different
mounting<00:02:59.630> of<00:02:59.810> the<00:02:59.959> clock<00:03:00.230> if<00:03:00.640> you<00:03:01.640> wanted<00:03:02.000> to

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
mounting of the clock if you wanted to

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.250 
mounting of the clock if you wanted to
print<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.989> plate<00:03:03.850> for<00:03:04.850> like<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.209> corporate<00:03:05.959> name

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
print a plate for like a corporate name

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.229 
print a plate for like a corporate name
or<00:03:06.500> logo<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:06.890> could<00:03:07.100> do<00:03:07.250> that<00:03:07.280> down<00:03:07.610> here<00:03:07.670> or

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
or logo you could do that down here or

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.780 
or logo you could do that down here or
laser<00:03:08.600> engrave<00:03:09.110> it<00:03:09.140> that<00:03:10.040> would<00:03:10.190> be<00:03:10.370> for<00:03:10.670> the

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
laser engrave it that would be for the

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.970 
laser engrave it that would be for the
top<00:03:11.030> hole<00:03:11.360> or<00:03:11.630> you<00:03:12.290> can<00:03:12.440> mount<00:03:12.650> it<00:03:12.739> on<00:03:12.950> the

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
top hole or you can mount it on the

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.970 
top hole or you can mount it on the
bottom<00:03:13.280> hole<00:03:13.640> here<00:03:14.170> so<00:03:15.170> that<00:03:15.410> it<00:03:15.500> sits<00:03:15.709> like

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
bottom hole here so that it sits like

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.170 
bottom hole here so that it sits like
that<00:03:16.810> now<00:03:17.810> what<00:03:18.170> we're<00:03:18.320> going<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:18.650> do<00:03:18.860> is<00:03:19.180> we're

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
that now what we're going to do is we're

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.000 
that now what we're going to do is we're
going<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.480> assemble<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.320> clock<00:03:21.590> and<00:03:21.860> we'll

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
going to assemble the clock and we'll

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.030 
going to assemble the clock and we'll
assemble<00:03:22.459> this<00:03:22.700> with<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.270> one<00:03:23.660> on<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.930> top<00:03:24.110> we

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
assemble this with the one on the top we

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.990 
assemble this with the one on the top we
put<00:03:25.280> our<00:03:25.370> clock<00:03:26.860> assembly<00:03:27.860> here<00:03:28.280> through<00:03:28.760> the

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
put our clock assembly here through the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.080 
put our clock assembly here through the
hole<00:03:29.739> but<00:03:30.739> before<00:03:31.160> you<00:03:31.459> do<00:03:31.640> that<00:03:31.670> you'll

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
hole but before you do that you'll

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.780 
hole but before you do that you'll
notice<00:03:32.300> that<00:03:32.480> we<00:03:33.050> actually<00:03:33.470> have<00:03:33.709> a<00:03:34.010> little

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
notice that we actually have a little

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.320 
notice that we actually have a little
bolt<00:03:35.200> or<00:03:36.200> I<00:03:36.230> should<00:03:36.500> say<00:03:36.530> a<00:03:36.709> nut<00:03:37.040> here<00:03:37.370> that

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
bolt or I should say a nut here that

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.030 
bolt or I should say a nut here that
loosens<00:03:39.080> up<00:03:39.260> and<00:03:40.040> will<00:03:40.850> come<00:03:41.090> off<00:03:41.620> we<00:03:42.620> must

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
loosens up and will come off we must

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.150 
loosens up and will come off we must
unscrew<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.970> whole<00:03:44.150> way<00:03:44.709> will<00:03:45.709> take<00:03:45.950> that

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
unscrew it the whole way will take that

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.500 
unscrew it the whole way will take that
off<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:47.140> also<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.620> little<00:03:49.190> washer<00:03:50.000> that

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
off and also the little washer that

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.130 
off and also the little washer that
assembles<00:03:51.260> with<00:03:51.500> that<00:03:51.709> now<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.190> black<00:03:53.140> foam

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
assembles with that now the black foam

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.930 
assembles with that now the black foam
piece<00:03:54.530> here<00:03:54.920> we<00:03:55.190> want<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.459> leave<00:03:55.580> on<00:03:55.730> there

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
piece here we want to leave on there

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.449 
piece here we want to leave on there
that<00:03:55.970> gives<00:03:56.360> us<00:03:56.540> friction<00:03:57.140> on<00:03:57.320> the<00:03:57.410> back<00:03:58.070> side

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
that gives us friction on the back side

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.180 
that gives us friction on the back side
of<00:03:58.780> our<00:03:59.780> clock<00:04:00.320> kit<00:04:00.620> here<00:04:00.830> as<00:04:00.920> you<00:04:01.040> can<00:04:01.070> see

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
of our clock kit here as you can see

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.230 
of our clock kit here as you can see
here<00:04:01.820> so<00:04:02.690> we'll<00:04:03.200> do<00:04:03.410> this

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
here so we'll do this

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.350 
here so we'll do this
we'll<00:04:05.050> take<00:04:05.470> our<00:04:07.320> poster<00:04:08.910> stick<00:04:09.910> it<00:04:10.030> through

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
we'll take our poster stick it through

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.780 
we'll take our poster stick it through
and<00:04:12.600> next<00:04:13.600> what<00:04:13.810> we're<00:04:13.990> going<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:14.350> do<00:04:14.560> is<00:04:14.800> we

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
and next what we're going to do is we

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.820 
and next what we're going to do is we
are<00:04:15.820> going<00:04:15.940> to<00:04:16.480> put<00:04:16.900> on<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:19.320> washer<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.500> then

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
are going to put on the washer and then

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.970 
are going to put on the washer and then
the<00:04:21.430> nut<00:04:22.180> now<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:22.930> nut<00:04:23.260> will<00:04:23.500> tighten<00:04:23.800> down

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
the nut now the nut will tighten down

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.520 
the nut now the nut will tighten down
and<00:04:24.610> you<00:04:25.360> can<00:04:25.480> pretty<00:04:25.660> much<00:04:25.750> hand<00:04:26.140> tighten

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
and you can pretty much hand tighten

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.830 
and you can pretty much hand tighten
this<00:04:26.620> down<00:04:26.680> to<00:04:27.250> get<00:04:27.400> it<00:04:27.520> really<00:04:27.910> tight<00:04:28.060> or

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
this down to get it really tight or

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.870 
this down to get it really tight or
tight<00:04:29.230> enough<00:04:29.470> for<00:04:30.370> this<00:04:30.520> if<00:04:30.730> you<00:04:30.850> are

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
tight enough for this if you are

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.850 
tight enough for this if you are
assembling<00:04:31.420> the<00:04:31.630> clock<00:04:31.870> for<00:04:32.170> your<00:04:32.200> customers

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
assembling the clock for your customers

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.550 
assembling the clock for your customers
and<00:04:33.070> then<00:04:33.880> we<00:04:34.150> can<00:04:34.300> sort<00:04:34.510> of<00:04:34.660> position<00:04:34.900> this<00:04:35.320> so

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
and then we can sort of position this so

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.530 
and then we can sort of position this so
the<00:04:35.710> fits<00:04:36.070> correctly<00:04:36.790> erdis<00:04:37.570> straight<00:04:37.990> on<00:04:38.380> our
