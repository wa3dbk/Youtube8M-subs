00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 
fruit trees here this is a peach tree

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:16.930 
fruit trees here this is a peach tree
and<00:00:09.980> we<00:00:10.980> hope<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:12.830> the<00:00:13.830> most<00:00:14.040> recent<00:00:14.580> frost

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
and we hope that the most recent frost

and we hope that the most recent frost
has<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.180> made<00:00:19.100> any<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> flowers<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.240> here

has it made any of the flowers on here
any<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.900> blooms<00:00:22.199> less<00:00:23.189> viable<00:00:23.550> for<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
any of the blooms less viable for the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.569 
any of the blooms less viable for the
beans<00:00:26.539> there's<00:00:27.539> our<00:00:27.689> second<00:00:28.109> peach<00:00:28.320> tree

pollinating<00:00:45.649> these<00:00:46.649> trees

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.560 

here<00:00:54.950> is<00:00:55.370> a<00:00:55.880> cherry<00:00:56.680> that<00:00:57.680> has<00:00:57.940> two<00:00:58.940> blooms<00:00:59.270> on

see how that one does here's another
cherry<00:01:15.050> tree<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:18.010> these<00:01:19.010> cherry<00:01:19.520> trees<00:01:19.910> have

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
cherry tree and these cherry trees have

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.050 
cherry tree and these cherry trees have
five<00:01:20.420> different<00:01:20.660> varieties<00:01:21.500> of<00:01:21.950> carries<00:01:22.820> on

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
five different varieties of carries on

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.950 
five different varieties of carries on
them<00:01:23.710> they're<00:01:24.710> grafted<00:01:28.660> these<00:01:29.660> are<00:01:29.810> all

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
them they're grafted these are all

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.080 
them they're grafted these are all
grafted<00:01:30.590> limbs<00:01:30.830> on<00:01:31.100> here<00:01:31.399> on<00:01:31.580> I<00:01:31.820> don't<00:01:32.030> know

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
grafted limbs on here on I don't know

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.480 
grafted limbs on here on I don't know
what<00:01:32.270> kind<00:01:32.450> of<00:01:32.600> root<00:01:32.780> stock<00:01:33.160> I'm<00:01:34.160> not<00:01:34.310> really

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
what kind of root stock I'm not really

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.499 
what kind of root stock I'm not really
sure<00:01:35.979> but<00:01:36.979> this<00:01:37.220> one<00:01:37.430> seems<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.910> be<00:01:38.030> blooming<00:01:38.300> a

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
sure but this one seems to be blooming a

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.080 
sure but this one seems to be blooming a
lot<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:39.020> it's<00:01:39.140> small<00:01:39.500> so<00:01:40.430> that's<00:01:41.030> good<00:01:43.090> here's

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
lot and it's small so that's good here's

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.590 
lot and it's small so that's good here's
a<00:01:44.149> plum<00:01:44.479> tree<00:01:44.710> all<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:45.950> blooms<00:01:46.280> well<00:01:49.600> there's

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
a plum tree all the blooms well there's

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.520 
a plum tree all the blooms well there's
a<00:01:50.750> couple<00:01:51.020> blooms<00:01:51.470> right<00:01:51.800> there<00:01:53.080> but<00:01:54.080> most<00:01:54.350> of

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
a couple blooms right there but most of

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.650 
a couple blooms right there but most of
the<00:01:54.649> blooms<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.399> bees<00:01:55.610> have<00:01:55.850> already<00:01:56.180> had<00:01:56.390> at

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
the blooms the bees have already had at

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.109 
the blooms the bees have already had at
and<00:01:57.590> then<00:01:58.399> it<00:01:58.580> froze<00:01:59.350> so<00:02:00.580> who<00:02:01.580> knows<00:02:01.789> what's

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
and then it froze so who knows what's

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.919 
and then it froze so who knows what's
going<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.390> happen<00:02:02.720> with<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:02.959> fruit<00:02:04.929> and

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
going to happen with the fruit and

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.889 
going to happen with the fruit and
here's<00:02:06.200> an<00:02:06.350> apple<00:02:06.530> tree

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.140 

Tom<00:02:11.560> will<00:02:11.799> tell<00:02:12.040> with<00:02:12.189> this<00:02:12.370> one<00:02:12.640> too<00:02:15.150> but

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
Tom will tell with this one too but

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.399 
Tom will tell with this one too but
that's<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.569> extent<00:02:16.900> of<00:02:17.049> our<00:02:17.760> orchard<00:02:19.409> mini

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
that's the extent of our orchard mini

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:27.240 
that's the extent of our orchard mini
orchard<00:02:22.290> definitely<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.319> mini<00:02:23.590> orchard<00:02:26.250> here's

orchard definitely a mini orchard here's
a<00:02:27.989> honeycrisp<00:02:28.989> apple<00:02:29.439> tree<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:31.540> we<00:02:31.659> ordered

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
a honeycrisp apple tree that we ordered

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.780 
a honeycrisp apple tree that we ordered
from<00:02:32.170> Gurney's<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:32.950> year<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:33.519> don't<00:02:33.700> even

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
from Gurney's this year I don't even

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.759 
from Gurney's this year I don't even
know<00:02:34.030> thing<00:02:34.480> was<00:02:34.659> alive<00:02:34.959> or<00:02:35.200> dead<00:02:35.409> when<00:02:35.650> it

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
know thing was alive or dead when it

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.449 
know thing was alive or dead when it
came<00:02:36.010> by<00:02:36.849> UPS<00:02:37.420> in<00:02:37.629> a<00:02:37.720> box<00:02:38.159> but<00:02:39.159> it<00:02:39.189> is

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
came by UPS in a box but it is

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.390 
came by UPS in a box but it is
definitely<00:02:39.700> small<00:02:40.540> as<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:42.640> can<00:02:42.819> see<00:02:44.400> and

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
definitely small as you can see and

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.110 
definitely small as you can see and
here's<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:46.950> Stanley<00:02:47.950> from<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:50.970> little<00:02:51.970> bit

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
here's a Stanley from a little bit

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.679 
here's a Stanley from a little bit
bigger<00:02:52.329> than<00:02:52.569> the<00:02:52.720> honeycrisp<00:02:53.109> apple<00:02:53.620> tree

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
bigger than the honeycrisp apple tree

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.809 
bigger than the honeycrisp apple tree
but<00:02:55.689> these<00:02:55.930> are<00:02:56.290> just<00:02:56.319> a<00:02:56.739> crapshoot<00:02:57.069> more<00:02:57.730> or

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
but these are just a crapshoot more or

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:05.490 
but these are just a crapshoot more or
less<00:02:58.349> because<00:02:59.349> I<00:03:01.590> mean<00:03:02.590> you<00:03:03.069> know<00:03:04.260> we<00:03:05.260> just

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
less because I mean you know we just

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.289 
less because I mean you know we just
don't<00:03:05.709> know<00:03:05.920> if<00:03:06.310> they're<00:03:06.549> going<00:03:06.670> to<00:03:06.760> live<00:03:07.269> or

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
don't know if they're going to live or

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.229 
don't know if they're going to live or
die<00:03:07.659> or<00:03:07.689> what<00:03:08.250> but<00:03:09.250> that's<00:03:09.489> it<00:03:09.760> that's<00:03:10.000> the

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
die or what but that's it that's the

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:16.980 
die or what but that's it that's the
orchard<00:03:10.780> so<00:03:13.530> hope<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:14.560> enjoy
