00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.679
 All great greetings with you Vika not 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.790
 I want to dedicate this video separately to that 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.279
 product is a palette of shadows and rouge from 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.279
 tires so I already promised you to do it 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.439
 video and that's it thinking will be 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.570
 short but interesting enough 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:31.140
 because this product is so rare and 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:35.130
 us in St. Petersburg to you and where you can buy and in 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.960
 other cities think too but the product 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.540
 deserves attention now tell you 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.210
 sold on bags like this 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.700
 individual beautiful com purple letters 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.320
 tire such is an american company 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.059
 as far as I know it says here that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.879
 made in Italy and the palette of shadows itself and 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.210
 blush and was packed in such a dust 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.430
 Nick is not velvet as in standard 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.829
 chanel dior and he is such a silk 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.020
 does not attract itself and not the group itself 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:09.240
 the palette looks like it is mirror and 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.220
 written tire poke on now he 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.900
 tell you more about the colors themselves 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.790
 there is a liner inside is very convenient 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.990
 because it immediately became clear to me that 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:26.100
 here it is now blush here shade it 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:30.900
 base under the shadows and it is already two shades 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:34.259
 shadows now show better rouge 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.460
 the base and the two shadows are lighter and darker 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.820
 of course for the folds so let's start with 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.890
 the fact that there is a very beautiful design 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.840
 in terms of what is on each marie fillet 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.700
 By the way, I think that these repils 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.509
 removable because here there is these 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.790
 here are the holes 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.130
 Apparently, you can change them, but we have an outfit 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.070
 example in the city can be bought on each 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.850
 the referee is depicted on 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.840
 Tiger has more reticulation so it is 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.820
 naori filah which are depicted 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.840
 dolphins or one of the fish in general 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.819
 here are tigers by the way 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.739
 it's just somehow related to security 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.019
 the environment there you like money 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.150
 for the purchase is transferred often sense 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.610
 money well, something like I heard but 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.599
 not sure about it and when I only 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:28.010
 gave this palette I opened it and 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:30.530
 I saw that on all the shadows that is all those 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.250
 peaceful niches are simply unrealistic shimmer 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.400
 and brilliant are only evening 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.200
 option but when i started using 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.239
 it turns out it was on top only 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.519
 thin coating 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.090
 shimmer on and the shadows themselves turned out 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.870
 absolutely matt so by the way palette 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.760
 very so weighty you can see that 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:57.489
 tyazhelenko written here 10 grams in total 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:00.590
 and by the way is called tiger in the wild and 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:04.069
 Now I'll tell you about the shadows themselves. 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.480
 This is generally a luxury brand such a gram 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.660
 luxury is not worth it 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.989
 more expensive than chanel dior thousand im these 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.410
 here 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.720
 berbers than these luxury brands about 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:18.200
 the textures of these shadows are features 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.609
 they are not meant for 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.079
 professional use yes 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.060
 Of course the makeup artist loves them but not 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.859
 intended ie it is a brand 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.440
 It was created specifically for women who 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:29.510
 Dumas make their own makeup just 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.130
 the last time I got used because those 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.500
 not very pigmented 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.650
 one touch is enough for you 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.269
 formed already for centuries so straight 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.760
 specifically and the stain that is needed and 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.609
 shading and these shadows do not need 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.639
 add add add and already 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.290
 somehow gets the light but it's even different 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:51.109
 parties and well because you don't 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.540
 go ahead and know better add more 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.280
 a little bit then erase too much here in 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.579
 This feature because not all 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.400
 people i have there somehow right right 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:03.410
 place to choose where to put shadows so 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.120
 further correctly shade therefore 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.220
 more convenient when you add a little bit 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.230
 shade and it is not immediately bright therefore 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.069
 agree to this plus not very 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.200
 pigmented shadows so but blush and 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.539
 generally superb shade stunning 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.269
 using actively already about their other 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.940
 blush forgotten 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.259
 don't know a stunning shade can 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.620
 fake then it will be possible somewhere 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.780
 buy 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.060
 bases also taking advantage of to give away the shadows 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.680
 no matter what shadows i am 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.319
 I used this base steadily 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:37.419
 I use it because it mattes well 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:41.560
 good on this base keeps the shadow nowhere 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.940
 not slipping and in this database is not particularly 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.150
 not what color and I like 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.740
 aligns the tone of a little century and here 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.800
 I also actively use these flowers 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.020
 Well, of course I use dark and less 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.069
 actively uses because 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.780
 I prefer everyday life 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:57.909
 brown shades this such more 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.520
 strong too sometimes for a change a 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:02.979
 I can use it and judging because 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.340
 that I have these here shimmer already 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:08.830
 let's say spraying is already a shimmer everywhere 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.440
 erased almost already visible that I use in 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:16.199
 common and these shadows and shadows and blush not 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:20.229
 dense texture so delicate silk 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:22.419
 light well, that's what it is all 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.710
 weightless and now I will of course 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:29.169
 swatches like without it 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:33.389
 and showing you swatches start from the base she 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:39.039
 almost invisible like this 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:41.560
 then more such shades are visible he 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:46.779
 for ages it is usually applied 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:49.380
 some kind of brownish gray so then 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:52.599
 dark shade 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.909
 But I pressed it hard enough 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:58.870
 this he brush is not so here on 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:06:00.400
 my love is recruited and blush new so 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:04.240
 how was I left free in my 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:11.990
 tangent blush 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:14.300
 blush here and put them here very shadow 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:19.100
 such but not so creamy 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:22.070
 but they have textures like here odnushki 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:25.370
 burberry here you see very well 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:27.730
 once brightened the blush and even 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.370
 I will transfer the other shades of the dark 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:34.360
 dark catherine so good too 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.360
 shaded perfectly but not see 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.790
 so in general I will do reviews and immediately 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.220
 I want to tell you that 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:45.230
 as far as I know in Europe the shadow 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.530
 cost much cheaper than ours 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:52.130
 so if you're interested in and you'll 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:54.740
 Europe you can see them by test 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:57.010
 Thanks for watching and see you soon 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.010
 until
