00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.100
 i 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.460
 this means that the special taste 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.650
 let's chop coriander cilantro mode 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.800
 clergy that is given here a lot in everything in the 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.800
 society 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:04.380
 here is everything nabai 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.380
 we are going to chop the paprika 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.040
 let's chop the onion 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.840
 the army that is very important that the 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.980
 that elevates we give a special touch not 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.980
 must miss the sweet pepper 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:33.220
 this also takes tomato that gives 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.220
 helps him to grab color 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:42.170
 and the most important thing that we have left is that 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:47.860
 it has been named crushed agitated that is going 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:51.680
 to give help is going to give the final touch to 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:55.280
 the food without something not because not in the 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.540
 flat because he did not know anything like who says 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.689
 finally we chop the bacon 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.700
 that really a little touch of 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:06.879
 taste already after we throw the 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.409
 dressings and we throw him the bacon let's go 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.569
 to place the flames because the flames 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:12.400
 It is usually very soft then 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.340
 this what we do is put laws 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.609
 to weigh them so that everything is 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.500
 as a sopita all that 's going to prompt 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.459
 final since we have all this 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.990
 finished 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:28.320
 I go to the kitchen to quote the seasonings and 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.320
 throw the bacon 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.630
 now let's continue the second step what 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:40.100
 what attempt is to shout it to the child 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.100
 let's see how the barbecue 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.380
 We usually accompany you with a 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.740
 white arrocito that already here we have it 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.800
 get ready and an arrocito is ready 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.550
 white project with a lot of success that what 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.550
 that gives it the flavor 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:10.340
 now let's put the times more 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.340
 that what will give the point 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:20.180
 and sofrito are the same 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.560
 and put it on gallon 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.720
 Y 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:28.720
 they are already grabbing color and I notice it 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.720
 Y 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.640
 the 15 minutes have passed 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:39.790
 let's put the flames in here they look 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.560
 that the points are three is a test 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.289
 that I am fresh but that it lasts a 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.930
 little time to cook them 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.689
 and the kitchen another fifteen minutes more 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.819
 while you are calling 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:52.819
 it is said that they are the fifth 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.610
 traditional here you can see
