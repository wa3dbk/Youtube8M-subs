00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
and I wanted to take it back down a

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.519 
and I wanted to take it back down a

with<00:00:56.940> really<00:00:57.329> simple<00:00:57.690> stencils<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.350> an

certainly<00:01:00.870> makes<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.350> lot<00:01:01.500> easier<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:01.949> I

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
certainly makes it a lot easier and I

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.470 
certainly makes it a lot easier and I
would<00:01:02.370> still<00:01:02.550> recommend<00:01:02.699> everyone<00:01:03.149> spends

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
would still recommend everyone spends

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.690

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
time on that as well but I don't think

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.429 
time on that as well but I don't think
that<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.000> can't<00:01:06.390> start<00:01:06.659> body<00:01:06.900> paint<00:01:07.229> before

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
that you can't start body paint before

that you can't start body paint before
you've<00:01:07.860> learned<00:01:08.130> how<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.340> draw<00:01:08.610> well<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.479> my

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
you've learned how to draw well so my

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.030 
you've learned how to draw well so my
first<00:01:09.810> step<00:01:10.049> if<00:01:10.229> that's<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> boat<00:01:10.710> you're<00:01:10.860> in

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
first step if that's the boat you're in

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.950 
first step if that's the boat you're in
is<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.520> use<00:01:11.640> reference<00:01:12.090> pictures<00:01:12.450> while<00:01:12.780> you

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
is to use reference pictures while you

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.899 
is to use reference pictures while you
body<00:01:13.170> paint<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.189> pick<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> real<00:01:14.670> picture

visually study as you paint I'm picking
something<00:01:19.799> very<00:01:20.009> easy<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.670> example<00:01:21.150> to

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
something very easy for this example to

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.999 
something very easy for this example to
show<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.659> if<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.140> draw<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> line<00:01:22.799> at

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
show you that if you can draw a line at

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.590 
show you that if you can draw a line at
a<00:01:23.070> time<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.610> can<00:01:23.790> still<00:01:24.030> make<00:01:24.150> something<00:01:24.450> cool

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
a time you can still make something cool

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.780 
a time you can still make something cool
but<00:01:25.259> as<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.500> keep<00:01:25.680> practicing<00:01:25.830> obviously<00:01:26.700> you

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
but as you keep practicing obviously you

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.190 
but as you keep practicing obviously you
should<00:01:26.939> challenge<00:01:27.299> yourself<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.630> move<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.020> to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
should challenge yourself to move on to

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.020 
should challenge yourself to move on to
more<00:01:28.290> complex<00:01:28.350> shapes<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.159> objects<00:01:29.549> Alex

seen<00:01:44.549> I'm<00:01:44.759> starting<00:01:45.149> off<00:01:45.240> by<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.420> laying

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
seen I'm starting off by just laying

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.230 
seen I'm starting off by just laying
down<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.990> base<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.649> bunch<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.950> colors<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.549> like

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
down a base of a bunch of colors I like

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.060 
down a base of a bunch of colors I like
the<00:01:48.390> face<00:01:48.600> on<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.960> guy<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.530> line<00:01:49.740> wise<00:01:49.920> I'll

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the face on this guy so line wise I'll

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.530 
the face on this guy so line wise I'll
be<00:01:50.189> referencing<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
be referencing that but I like the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.300 
be referencing that but I like the
colors<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.140> textures<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.920> one<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.250> I'm

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
colors and textures and this one so I'm

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.399 
colors and textures and this one so I'm
incorporating<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:54.090> as<00:01:54.329> well<00:01:54.570> I'm<00:01:54.780> using<00:01:55.200> all

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
incorporating that as well I'm using all

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.959 
incorporating that as well I'm using all
water<00:01:55.680> activated<00:01:56.159> paints<00:01:56.490> for<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:56.939> you

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
water activated paints for this but you

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.910 
water activated paints for this but you
could<00:01:57.210> use<00:01:57.390> alcohol<00:01:57.810> activated<00:01:57.960> paints<00:01:58.530> too<00:01:58.710> I

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
could use alcohol activated paints too I

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.740 
could use alcohol activated paints too I
know<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.460> sometimes<00:01:59.670> Alex<00:02:00.090> party<00:02:00.420> starts

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
know that sometimes Alex party starts

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.330 
know that sometimes Alex party starts
with<00:02:00.869> just<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.140> base<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.350> color<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.100> so

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
with just a base of color like this so

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.920 
with just a base of color like this so
I'm<00:02:02.399> kind<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.759> working<00:02:03.180> off<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.600> idea

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
I'm kind of working off of that idea

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.330 
I'm kind of working off of that idea
right<00:02:04.140> now

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.650 

once<00:02:07.340> I<00:02:07.460> have<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.640> base<00:02:07.850> laid<00:02:08.090> down<00:02:08.270> and<00:02:08.510> start

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
once I have a base laid down and start

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.330 
once I have a base laid down and start
to<00:02:08.780> very<00:02:09.020> roughly<00:02:09.440> mark<00:02:09.680> out<00:02:09.830> where<00:02:09.979> my<00:02:10.100> major

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
to very roughly mark out where my major

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.370 
to very roughly mark out where my major
lines<00:02:10.670> are<00:02:10.880> going<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.210> go<00:02:11.360> in<00:02:11.570> this<00:02:12.140> case

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
lines are going to go in this case

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.290 
lines are going to go in this case
that's<00:02:12.650> just<00:02:12.800> a<00:02:12.950> lot<00:02:13.070> of<00:02:13.190> wrinkles<00:02:13.520> I<00:02:13.820> need<00:02:14.210> to

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
that's just a lot of wrinkles I need to

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.340 
that's just a lot of wrinkles I need to
add<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.540> proper<00:02:14.870> light<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.170> dark<00:02:15.290> colors

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
add the proper light and dark colors

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.810 
add the proper light and dark colors
depending<00:02:15.770> on<00:02:16.070> where<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.370> lines<00:02:16.550> are<00:02:16.640> gonna

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
depending on where the lines are gonna

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.280 
depending on where the lines are gonna
end<00:02:16.970> up<00:02:17.060> being<00:02:17.300> which<00:02:17.480> is<00:02:17.600> why<00:02:17.720> I'm<00:02:17.870> mapping<00:02:18.080> it

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
end up being which is why I'm mapping it

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.140 
end up being which is why I'm mapping it
out<00:02:18.380> first<00:02:18.650> you<00:02:19.250> don't<00:02:19.400> have<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.790> map<00:02:19.940> it<00:02:20.090> out

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
out first you don't have to map it out

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.000 
out first you don't have to map it out
this<00:02:20.390> dark<00:02:20.660> you<00:02:20.900> could<00:02:21.110> use<00:02:21.260> white<00:02:21.470> or<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.710> gray

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
this dark you could use white or a gray

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.950 
this dark you could use white or a gray
or<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.310> thin<00:02:22.610> eyeliner<00:02:22.940> but<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.570> just<00:02:23.780> went<00:02:23.900> for

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
or a thin eyeliner but I just went for

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.490 
or a thin eyeliner but I just went for
the<00:02:24.080> dark

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
the dark

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.360 
the dark
I<00:02:26.290> left<00:02:27.290> my<00:02:27.380> eyebrows<00:02:27.590> on<00:02:27.740> at<00:02:27.860> first<00:02:28.070> because<00:02:28.280> I

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
I left my eyebrows on at first because I

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.350 
I left my eyebrows on at first because I
wasn't<00:02:28.520> sure<00:02:28.640> what<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:28.850> was<00:02:28.940> gonna<00:02:29.090> be<00:02:29.210> doing

wasn't sure what I was gonna be doing
with<00:02:29.570> them<00:02:29.690> but<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:29.840> don't<00:02:29.930> think<00:02:30.260> we're<00:02:30.410> gonna

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500

another<00:02:43.070> reason<00:02:43.460> to<00:02:43.580> start<00:02:43.760> with<00:02:43.910> something

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
another reason to start with something

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.150 
another reason to start with something
like<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.330> pre-existing<00:02:44.990> drawing<00:02:45.290> like<00:02:45.440> this<00:02:45.470> is

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
like a pre-existing drawing like this is

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.550 
like a pre-existing drawing like this is
it's<00:02:46.460> abstract<00:02:47.060> kind<00:02:47.300> of<00:02:47.510> cartoony<00:02:48.140> nature

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
it's abstract kind of cartoony nature

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.470 
it's abstract kind of cartoony nature
gives<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:48.950> some<00:02:49.130> leeway<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.790> experimenting

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
gives you some leeway and experimenting

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.970

as<00:02:50.630> you<00:02:50.780> get<00:02:50.900> comfortable<00:02:51.110> with<00:02:51.410> drawing<00:02:51.680> if

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
as you get comfortable with drawing if

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.770 
as you get comfortable with drawing if
you're<00:02:52.490> not<00:02:52.760> going<00:02:53.000> for<00:02:53.210> complete<00:02:53.570> photo

some<00:02:57.530> of<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.800> best<00:02:58.040> art<00:02:58.250> is<00:02:58.430> extremely

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
some of the best art is extremely

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.360 
some of the best art is extremely
accurate<00:02:59.330> photo<00:02:59.870> realism<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.650> some<00:03:00.980> of<00:03:01.100> it<00:03:01.220> is

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
accurate photo realism and some of it is

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.400 
accurate photo realism and some of it is
completely<00:03:01.970> unbounded<00:03:02.330> creativity<00:03:03.200> and

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
completely unbounded creativity and

stopped to add white where the teeth
would<00:03:08.209> go<00:03:08.390> before<00:03:08.570> I<00:03:08.750> did<00:03:08.959> my<00:03:08.990> rough<00:03:09.230> outline

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
would go before I did my rough outline

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.260 
would go before I did my rough outline
of<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:09.950> teeth<00:03:10.160> just<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:10.640> make<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:10.820> easier

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
of the teeth just to make it easier

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.760 
of the teeth just to make it easier
because<00:03:11.420> sometimes<00:03:11.930> filling<00:03:12.290> in<00:03:12.410> white<00:03:12.590> near

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
because sometimes filling in white near

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.740 
because sometimes filling in white near
black<00:03:12.980> can<00:03:13.220> get<00:03:13.340> a<00:03:13.370> little<00:03:13.640> messy<00:03:14.030> but<00:03:14.660> the

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
black can get a little messy but the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.360 
black can get a little messy but the
nice<00:03:14.900> thing<00:03:15.050> about<00:03:15.140> water-activated<00:03:15.560> paints

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
nice thing about water-activated paints

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.860 
nice thing about water-activated paints
is<00:03:16.489> you<00:03:16.610> can<00:03:16.760> pretty<00:03:16.940> much<00:03:17.060> put<00:03:17.330> any<00:03:17.540> color<00:03:17.810> on

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
is you can pretty much put any color on

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.449 
is you can pretty much put any color on
top<00:03:18.200> of<00:03:18.290> any<00:03:18.440> other<00:03:18.530> color<00:03:18.890> as<00:03:19.040> long<00:03:19.250> as<00:03:19.370> you

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
top of any other color as long as you

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:20.920 
top of any other color as long as you
wait<00:03:19.610> for<00:03:19.790> them<00:03:19.850> to<00:03:19.910> dry<00:03:20.150> in<00:03:20.390> between<00:03:20.420> layers

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
wait for them to dry in between layers

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.140 
wait for them to dry in between layers
if<00:03:21.380> you<00:03:21.560> use<00:03:21.739> cream<00:03:22.070> pains<00:03:22.340> you<00:03:22.610> won't<00:03:22.880> be<00:03:23.030> able

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
to do this and you'll have a hell of a

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.140 
to do this and you'll have a hell of a
time<00:03:24.650> keeping<00:03:24.950> it<00:03:25.220> off<00:03:25.340> of<00:03:25.519> everything<00:03:25.910> that

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.460 
you've touched where or pretty much look
at<00:03:28.430> then<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.269> start<00:03:29.510> filling<00:03:29.720> in<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.019> colors<00:03:30.290> to

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
at then I start filling in the colors to

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.620 
at then I start filling in the colors to
