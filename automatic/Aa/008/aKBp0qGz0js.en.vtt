 legendary habitat that produces quite 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.040
 gold and once it's been placed already 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.560

 food resources to be able to take it 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.010

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.920
 skill but you have to replace one of 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.810
 your four skills that you already have 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:24.730
 remember that once they replace that 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.560
 ability can not be used again and 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.049
 that's why they have to decide which of all 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.519
 your inferior skills have to 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.439
 replace me in this case I'm going to 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:36.540
