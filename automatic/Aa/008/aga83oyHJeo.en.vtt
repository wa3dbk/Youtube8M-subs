00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
long reach and a low stack versus her

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.600 
long reach and a low stack versus her
old<00:01:33.640> bike<00:01:33.850> which<00:01:34.210> was<00:01:34.479> built<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:36.070> opposite

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
old bike which was built the opposite

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.569 
old bike which was built the opposite
with<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:37.119> fairly<00:01:37.570> high<00:01:37.600> stack<00:01:38.170> and<00:01:38.500> a<00:01:39.219> short

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.760 
with a fairly high stack and a short
reach<00:01:39.909> and<00:01:40.270> so<00:01:40.780> this<00:01:40.899> sort<00:01:41.229> of<00:01:41.259> forced<00:01:41.619> her

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
reach and so this sort of forced her

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.399 
reach and so this sort of forced her
into<00:01:41.950> a<00:01:42.159> upgrade<00:01:42.520> packing<00:01:43.360> bunched<00:01:43.930> position

into a upgrade packing bunched position

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.880 
into a upgrade packing bunched position
versus<00:01:45.369> here<00:01:45.820> on<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.689> new<00:01:46.840> bike<00:01:47.110> now<00:01:47.560> she's

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
versus here on the new bike now she's

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.120 
versus here on the new bike now she's
able<00:01:48.039> to<00:01:48.930> able<00:01:49.930> to<00:01:50.170> relax<00:01:50.469> it<00:01:50.770> low<00:01:50.950> in<00:01:51.100> the

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
able to able to relax it low in the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.450 
able to able to relax it low in the
front<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:52.200> was<00:01:53.200> not<00:01:53.380> bunched<00:01:53.740> up<00:01:53.829> at<00:01:54.009> all<00:01:54.159> so

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
front and was not bunched up at all so

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.090 
front and was not bunched up at all so
we<00:01:55.060> think<00:01:55.240> this<00:01:55.390> is<00:01:55.570> going<00:01:55.689> to<00:01:55.750> be<00:01:55.869> a<00:01:56.590> much

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
we think this is going to be a much

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.039 
we think this is going to be a much
better<00:01:57.130> position<00:01:57.549> for<00:01:57.939> her<00:01:58.090> death<00:01:58.719> like<00:01:58.899> some

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
better position for her death like some

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.099 
better position for her death like some
aerodynamic<00:01:59.350> gains<00:02:00.039> to<00:02:00.759> be<00:02:00.820> had<00:02:00.939> there<00:02:01.450> to

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:02.109 
aerodynamic gains to be had there to

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:04.800 
aerodynamic gains to be had there to
potential<00:02:02.700> comfort<00:02:03.700> games<00:02:03.969> as<00:02:04.270> well<00:02:04.450> too<00:02:04.780> so

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
potential comfort games as well too so

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.230 
potential comfort games as well too so
so<00:02:05.619> we<00:02:06.130> look<00:02:06.310> forward<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.609> having<00:02:06.789> some<00:02:07.090> good

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
so we look forward to having some good

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.520 
so we look forward to having some good
results<00:02:07.420> in<00:02:07.869> this<00:02:08.770> position<00:02:09.280> this<00:02:09.460> year
