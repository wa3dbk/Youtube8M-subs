00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
 and where are you then welcome to jazz 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.320
 tap 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.550
 [Applause] 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.350
 [Music] 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.120
 [Applause] 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.670
 popper's today we are going to learn 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.960
 how to handle and not die trying 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.060
 I know that many of you do not know 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.190
 drive or do not like to drive but the 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.020
 net is that it's kind of fun like that 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.210
 that today we are going to learn what to do and what 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.830
 do not do so that nothing bad happens for 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.750
 start you have to adjust the seat to 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.760
 that you are like in my old car yo 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.740
 I had a cushion to catch up to see 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.780
 imagine I was so sunken I think 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.920
 that because a fat man used it then it's 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.199
 very important that you have good 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.199
 visibility so get super comfortable 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.010
 obvious it's super cool to drive if you see 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.690
 super pimp and madrota one the net no 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.280
 you going to handle you're not going to take a 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.989
 nap is super important that you 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.550
 keep in your lane because never 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.590
 miss the sing as it goes in two lanes 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.910
 because it is because it is worth it and in 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.990
 it's really annoying 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.990
 [Music] 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.950
 If you are a woman and your bubis hurt 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.359
 put on your belt 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.770
 Well, how sad are you going to have to 

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:13.170
 put because it can save your life 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.509
 I say to me it does not hurt because I do not have 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.310
 many but you could hurt you have 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.319
 to know that it's not about all the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.329
 time to be slowing and accelerating I say 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:24.599
 that is, that is from people who do not know 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.909
 handle there goodbye stoppers something that 

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:29.280
 glad to go driving is to sing so 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.819
 put your favorite songs and sing with 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.270
 your whole lung and what a rich ay ay ay ay 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:38.189
 how rich ay ay ay ay what rich 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.110
 people from other cars are going to 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.379
 to look very ugly just but not 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.649
 it matters x we are just kids you sing them 

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:48.810
 it infects them your happiness that the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.610
 women we handle wrong is pure myth what 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.469
 what happens is that later we like to make ourselves 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.329
 the fools or we get nervous 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:57.649
 because they are seeing us and judging us 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.649
 that we prefer to apply it 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:05.130
 park, I'm a woman 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.470
 [Music] 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.149
 but we can not handle the same or better 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.590
 that a man driving fast has his 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.750
 joke is not about putting speed 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.120
 for putting him through that we have here a 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.819
 professional pilot he is pp and we are going to 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.129
 give one where stoppers true pp of the 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.480
 curves do not stop 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.519
 effectively you can never stop in a 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.620
 curve because when you brake the weight the 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.030
 car is going forward and force 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.829
 of the tires goes to one side and by 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.510
 that the cars are skated you should always 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.970
 brake in line or you must stop 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.349
 before entering the curve effectively 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.209
 always in a straight line before entering 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.709
 the curve and here you are going to turn the wheel and 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.049
 you're going to start spinning around the 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.060
 brake and you start to accelerate very solicitous 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.530
 and gradually he hears pp that's what 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.540
 we have to do in case we have to 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.220
 brake fast and with little space to not 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.540
 flip us or something like that 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.849
 look at the great advantage of a car like 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.349
 these is that you have abs braked the abs 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.000
 allows to brake a short distance and 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.040
 also keep control of the steering wheel or 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.540
 the address of it is that if it 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.310
 an obstacle crosses you and you will crash 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.780
 you can brake and turn to 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.250
 dodge what makes the car 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.320
 very stable in situations 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.000
 if the road is already trying a 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.920
 spin what you have to do not 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.780
 continue to accelerate and not stop that if 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.550
 brake you stop the movement of the car 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.380
 and for those demanded in quicker good 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.480
 pp what do you think if it's not a pretty 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.310
 demonstration of how to handle well and 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.290
 fast because we have a road course because 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.290
 we are not going to enjoy let's go now 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.230
 let's go around the circuit if you're 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.490
 okay here we have a zone of 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.170
 braking wet floor 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.790
 we always brake in a straight line let's go 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.710
 the brake and a car like these sites 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.240
 where he applied wet he behaved very well 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.040
 the movements always on the steering wheel 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.750
 They must be very soft and pleasant to 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.430
 Although they go fast and all their 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.930
 aggressive movements destabilizes 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.820
 to the car and you can generate that 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.040
 They slip tropez to another brake curve in 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.070
 straight line loose the brake and start to 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.360
 accelerate today requested something super 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.130
 important the position of the hands 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.290
 always using stimulants a watch 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.790
 and the hands are for a sale and with that 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.500
 you always have perfect control of what 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.330
 what happens in the car and if you get to the 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.010
 loss of control you have much more a 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.870
 turning radius control to be able 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.670
 set I'm going to go one more turn a 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.440
 little bit faster so they feel no 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.200
 behave we are going to enter again to 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.800
 the wet floor area brake loose and a 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.800
 smooth movement 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.519
 hands 9 and 3 as a station and most 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.290
 important when it comes to driving is that 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.579
 always look where 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.829
 they want to go here what I'm doing 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.180
 is always anticipating in the distance to 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.919
 to avoid an accident I do not see the 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.549
 trees because I would go there 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:32.909
 I always see the clue that you think 

00:04:28.549 --> 00:04:34.559
 and well I hope you liked the 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:36.599
 today's video do not forget to subscribe to 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:38.219
 they top and like it if they were served 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:42.679
 these tips that we gave them today 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:42.679
 I send a kiss to the country
