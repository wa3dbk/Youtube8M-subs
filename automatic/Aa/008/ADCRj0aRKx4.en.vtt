00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.300
 I'm going to make lemon or lemon cream 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:26.640
 course in the microwave for it 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:30.280
 I need 80 milliliters of lemon juice 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.509
 15 grams of cornstarch 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:37.160
 those eggs 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.810
 30 grams of butter and 125 grams of 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.540
 sugar 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.390
 The first thing we do is beat the 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.130
 eggs once we have beaten the 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.730
 eggs we have put in a container 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:53.340
 and we have added the rest of the ingredients 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.970
 apart from the lemon juice I have also 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.950
 added a bit of lemon zest 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.260
 now let's mix a little bit all the 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.739
 ingredients and we will 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.010
 microwave 4 minutes 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.680
 I forget about turns 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.960
 although time will do four 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.170
 minutes when it has passed by 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.200
 example a minute or two we take the 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.170
 mix and we remove it then we return it 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.600
 to put another minute we take out the mixture and 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.540
 we remove it again until it 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.420
 meet the 4 minutes has passed a 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.220
 minute little by little by the sides already 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.390
 it starts to curdle a little bit so 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.390
 let's remove it well 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.330
 and we put it back in and when there's 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.900
 after another minute we will go back out 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.900
 in two cycles 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.970
 the 4 minutes have already elapsed 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.260
 you see our cream 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.770
 now you have to let it cool 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.469
 why 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.390
 species also a little more when the 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.580
 I have taken out 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.250
 it was like foam cover by 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.650
 up and I have not noticed 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.200
 record but good once you 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.140
 After the 4 minutes, remove 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.870
 very well very well with the fork and if you 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.480
 it stays that way then and the 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.280
 we have simply now since it 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.080
 cool if you do not need to use all 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.370
 then you can freeze the once you're 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.640
 cool 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.430
 I feel 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.850
 already put in a bottle our lemon 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.310
 kurt I got the little bottles I want 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.230
 that you see how he is after and is 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:44.409
 our cream to fill 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.860
 they marked pies what we most 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.860
 like
