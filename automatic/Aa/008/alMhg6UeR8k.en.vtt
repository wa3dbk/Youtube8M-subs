00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.850
 found today to do a test 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.260
 I will give you a test of the little ones 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.330
 cats that I just bought small 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.980
 shisha bulbs green here she is 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.170
 completely made of glass it is about 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.779
 the merger viewer on us is a 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.570
 little known chicha that few people 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.520
 froze had on the site take chicha 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.219
 dot com here I am not going to pay very much 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.320
 dear precisely that's why I was able 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:39.690
 take it in full to try it I 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.280
 paid 100 euros there was 100 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.210
 euros it's a flesh all the green and this 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.219
 which is I did not find it is 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.690
 to have a shisha crowd to jicha 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.280
 entirely in glass or not too expensive 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.510
 so here I am going to do this little 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.600
 video with you to make you a 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.160
 small video test first I proceed 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.690
 by the product presentation 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.960
 so you have a provided with a 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.989
 coal commitment as well as a real 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.670
 stainless for coal so that is 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.000
 for us one that comes with a little 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.950
 like the fimo you have your bread it's 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.619
 obviously you have a pipe in 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.430
 silicone with tip towards both 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.070
 sides provided with 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.740
 so we an'a shook the step while 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.310
 glass and a fixed head 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.299
 she provides glass as well as a 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.310
 glass diffuser and 4 million is 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.670
 the plugs the plug valves that is 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.439
 provided with obviously and so here 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.460
 for this record to she wants she measure 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.380
 about 40 cm so me to whom he has 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.820
 bought because I wanted files 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.280
 years old my father but first I wanted 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.340
 especially find a chicha with a price 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.979
 affordable and not 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.289
 more from 100 to 300 euros in a 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.380
 jungle and antwerp so here is this 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.240
 shisha the benefits that there is a vast 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.479
 nice if as we do it 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.659
 in all in green is nice the 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.310
 diffuser that makes a noise so that's 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.280
 not bad so we'll do a test with 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.780
 you and then bah a head duarte at xl 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.319
 which allows to make good sessions 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.530
 and then more his rapids to prepare 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.380
 with this material provided investment 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.299
 negative of 7.6 hunt that the crim 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.750
 stainless steel that is supplied with allows 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.739
 a good session of shisha may and 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.200
 we lit 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.430
 unlike an aluminum nothing that 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.120
 prevents us from always putting 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.209
 aluminum on seven texts and then of 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.690
 anyway if we can even put our 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.950
 head on because the the diffuser 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.530
 allows us to be able to put a 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.440
 hostess on it all depends on the size 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.049
 of your head that we generally have 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.150
 suited for their own heads but we 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.609
 can still put a head in the ground 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.500
 cooked or something else so I proceed 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.060
 to tests with you so I'm going to 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.470
 prepare I'm going there but we get 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.609
 found right away I prepared the 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.620
 so chicha the gemmi so I put a 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:09.380
 coal so it took a little bit of 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.540
 time it's him but hey it was not say 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.370
 it is not so long that it ultimately must 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.799
 just take a little bit of time to 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.690
 that they come on so for 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.290
 this session there so I put a little 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.209
 star buzz skype pirates so 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.459
 fo points to be vortex for when 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.099
 even a lot of tobacco so that's when 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.439
 even better to be several lassus and 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.060
 so as you can see 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.920
 in the base but to search at 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.780
 lemon to give a little bit of 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.730
 colors a little bit more costs 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.659
 even if you lemon and more for 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.849
 this one on this session here is where 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:44.109
 I proceed to the smoke test so we go 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.500
 be able to see a little noise 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.500
 of the diffuser 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.519
 so there as you will see 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.129
 so town they can film it's going 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.140
 it's not lit yet, but we 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.480
 can find that the diffuser it does 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.709
 a big sound like 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.790
 I think it looks a little bit 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.959
 a shisha fumes the noise - all 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.670
 kinds of glass shisha for 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.989
 broadcasters of this output I find that 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.159
 that's good or it's well reproduced for 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.909
 a little fischer not too expensive in 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:17.979
 glass so as I could tell you again 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:19.840
 the site still I would put in my 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.489
 info here in the skin of the video you 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.930
 but what the site so that you in 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.539
 to enjoy I'm not sure she 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.789
 was out of stock right now 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:29.250
 but it's worth it anyway 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:33.130
 able to get one 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:37.449
 since its cost and not too high so 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.470
 the chicha recipe what flaws we're going 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.150
 to say that there are some small finishes 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.770
 who are not too perfect small 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.260
 green finishes we see that noted times 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.979
 it's not perfect but I find 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:54.340
 not bad anyway 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:56.680
 I do not find myself anyway so there I 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.870
 feel the taste and it will not even 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.580
 not at all the title of tobacco only spades 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.349
 not even I really did not think thank you 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.460
 very very fluid at the shooting level and he 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:06.220
 there is really no problem 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.960
 really very well what else to say about 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.479
 so this record has this system there she 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.830
 is really nice I think 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.169
 I'll be told it's a bit long 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.520
 turn on but this system for the 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.410
 focus is really not bad but a 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.050
 not always prevent our good 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:24.070
 old aluminum if you do not feel like it 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:26.199
 to wait or if you prefer it is 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.500
 a question of two you I find myself 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.500
 it's not bad 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.400
 I think it's going to be good but it's 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.260
 really not bad not bad at all I am 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:49.720
 really happy with this little sheet to 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:52.180
 then here's what else to say to 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.600
 Apart from the fact that provide a good shisha 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.220
 towards her a certain blow I have less than 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.140
 I could have noticed I think for 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.330
 those who are interested 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.890
 it can cost between 200 and 300 euros there 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.110
 I have no title and no account in 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.390
 euros for this one I know you 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.770
 really not bad really well here I am 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.770
 am very happy with my purchase 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.530
 so here it is video so you 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.410

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.870
 so this is the physio one so I 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.880
 find it really not bad we'll talk 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.760
 quality price he was to give 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.890
 a grade out of 5 of this product 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.110
 I would like that because we have 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.880
 good smoke a good little sound and then 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.910
 I really like you are small 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.080
 shisha and then that's it so I'll go 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.260

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:05.830
 I do I put my lungs 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.830
 if ever 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.370
 my head was aching
