00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.240
 if we consider that the animal population of a community should not be taken into 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.339
 counts as a matter of state 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:14.509
 we will continue to be accomplices and the systematic killing of animals 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.169

 in totoras a city of 11 thousand inhabitants located in the department 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.930
 iriondo of the province of santa fe 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.640
 We went through a long and undisputed path before we became a 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.900
 municipality not something so basic 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.740
 keep in mind that it is very simple to be called with a simple decree 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.700
 municipalities do not avoid as well as 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.960
 but to do it in reality and sustain it in time it takes 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.230
 perseverance 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.269

 illusion strategies of all actors 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.300
 because we are the ones who in the first place have to convince us this

 draft 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.620
 to then untiringly demand the officials 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.840

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.120
 what we are doing now is to treat

 be present at the time the ordinances are debated 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.880
 the regular meetings of the animal protection 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.899
 with municipal officials caused a fundamental change of attitude of the 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.390
 authorities 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.740
 from there 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.530
 the state understood that the solution was not to enclose the dogs 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.670
 and much less 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.079
 sto 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.239
 from the beginning I testify the need to advise us 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.980
 with protectionists from localities with more experience in the treatment of 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.059
 the problem 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:23.199
 in this sense we must be especially naive Navarrese nimo 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:27.989
 protectionist of the city of Rosario that was and still is a reference 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.989
 essential 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:35.929
 today we feel the obligation to make known the experience of reeds in 

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:42.719
 1995 we take the first step an ordinance prohibits the participation of animals 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.719
 in any public spectacle 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:58.480
 and the true turning point occurs in 1999 when a 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.529
 simple ordinance and with clear objectives that declares totoras municipality not

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:11.239
 in 2003 with a high percentage of infected animals 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:16.029
 the municipal council sanctioned the ordinance that regulates the breeding 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.559
 dogs already 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:20.629
 what we did as a protectionist 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:26.030
 spread the benefits of people their early actions look for animals 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:27.619
 in every corner of the city 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:29.849
 to take them to sterilize 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.849
 work with local organizations and institutions such as 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:39.909

 among other 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.409
 they formed a main part of this integrated project

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:08.789
 oriented to improve the coexistence of man with animals 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.090
 push the provincial law project nevertheless assured that never in the

 great buenos aires the chileans 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.209
 by the way, it was not legal 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.189
 up to this point 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:45.189
 just a summary of our work experience in two 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.090
 our city understood that the solution of animal overpopulation 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.680
 is the early sterilization 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.889
 our challenge was and is to generate consensus 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.909
 public policies must be thought in the long term 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:05.229
 and this is how we lived it from the beginning and after ten years of 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.360
 sustained effort today we can affirm 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.080
 the changes are possible from us and from our will
