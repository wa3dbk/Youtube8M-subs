00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:02.810
 nature constantly makes people understand 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.899
 how important is it to keep 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:07.240
 balance which is often perceived 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.819
 for granted 

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:11.209
 so there is the importance of bees people thought 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:12.399
 Only then 

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:14.469
 this publication came out rapidly 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.049
 shrink 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.009
 it started in 2006 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.129
 american beekeepers discovered 

00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:23.819
 canister every year choosing a third of all 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:25.560
 bee colonies 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.119
 why is it so important to return the count 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.470
 the fact is that their disappearance 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.750
 threaten not only the loss of honey but also 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.309
 jeopardizes the harvest of fruit vegetables 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.260
 berry nuts and some flag 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.740
 a third of the total food 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.880
 resources 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.290
 give cultures that walk hangs with it 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.180
 up to 90 percent of the whole process was oil 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.960
 belongs precisely to recent mitigation 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.969
 and sit Miriam buty Lezhekova 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.579
 who are not capable of flying at large 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:55.480
 distances 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.230
 one bee itself can collapse 1 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.330
 about three million flowers 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.710
 causes of extinction of these insects exactly 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.810
 not installed 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.000
 but scientists are sure the person is to blame 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.040
 this is the use of pesticides 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.160
 grown genetically modified 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.090
 of plants 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.020
 use of antibiotics on them 23 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.160
 case 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.920
 if the decline in the bee population 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.160
 continue at the same pace 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.360
 in 2010 will demolish the house will disappear 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.870
 from the face of the earth 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.210
 Meanwhile, another 3 4 warned if 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.480
 bees will die out but in four years 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.150
 died humanly that's about all this and 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.830
 general balance in nature we'll talk 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.850
 Today is the guest of our studio candidate 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.040
 geographical sciences leading scientific 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.190
 geographic employee 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.380
 to the Moscow exhibition 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.510
 Yuri Nikolayev darling 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.380
 tell me how you rate and what 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.000
 such a 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.250
 ice Age 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.580
 for man for human history 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.580
 and the hindrance 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.460
 or maybe even 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.250
 largely contributed to the sly 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.020
 development 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.830
 human evolution 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.960
 you know 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.640
 for the first time the idea of ​​a period of glacier knock out 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.119
 throw away 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.069
 the owners 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.239
 here he is already president of georgi schools 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.120
 Pskov Moscow immediately made a sharp 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.150
 criticizing this concept in a month 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.609
 he himself became a huge champion 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.309
 concept for tsarist loyal immediately understood 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:23.699
 that vaccinations are crawling very slowly three 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:25.129
 meters per year from strength 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.329
 move him a stone from 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:29.569
 Putin for 1 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:30.919
 ha here to us 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:32.419
 would need 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.649
 tens of thousands and then Elizovo 2000 years 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:38.749
 huge wheel years will need 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.269
 to this medina process was 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.479
 moved by 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:44.339
 revolution man camp was big 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:46.619
 supporter of darwin hryvnia sand not everywhere 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:47.579
 logical evidence 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:48.350
 of education 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.809
 when man turn darwin 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:52.779
 defended the telephony of what religion 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:53.639
 he helped 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:54.610
 bloggers 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.670
 but I did not give necessary that premium 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.030
 darwin g revolution 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.779
 Darwin gave his weather 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.849
 millions of years lari in my opinion it was 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.799
 paradigm is needed in order to oblige 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:04.449
 president 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:06.019
 all this will be sanitized 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.089
 person 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:09.699
 here under the influence of this 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:11.859
 for riding a cold man 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.079
 dressed skins and there in the village was oh article 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.579
 hides those who have not found yet not yet 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:18.779
 found baht will highlight 

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:20.579
 in exchange for loyalty read that state 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:21.639
 will be found soon 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.249
 still not found great 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:25.739
 sorbonne professor 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.700
 proon said so judging by the fact that 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.709
 Mammoths survived Dr. Hani with a carcass 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.980
 sorry for the roof already the lead singer 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.980
 they are alive 1 as well as alive yes the same 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.769
 the process froze all this country united 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:43.079
 ruined 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:43.929
 these animals 

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:45.819
 it was some kind of cosmic cold 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.630
 holding Kiev 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.720
 consists also in the fact that he formulated 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.840
 here the concepts of eternal education 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.520
 permafrost 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.550
 modern world reserved 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.430
 don't mention at all here in 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.259
 Kosovo predecessor 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:00.519
 and Melech's accumulations lived the son of the day the skit 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.549
 ice lived 30 meters tall and how it 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:04.669
 to combine 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:06.879
 here her mother at the same time was a single process 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.749
 the mammoths had time to go where for so long and 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.569
 four people two 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.629
 fighter they could stop to find where 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.819
 It is pleasing to destroy the buffalo units 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:16.689
 could exterminate 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:18.879
 check the huge space of Eurasia 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:19.999
 gave a huge amount 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:21.739
 ecological niches 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.580
 the process was easy to leave 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.979
 unifying breath glacier and 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.220
 find yourself pastures and so on if he 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.150
 gradually there was water getting into the lamp 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.120
 discretion this sudden was a blow 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.460
 move with another city can be said 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.319
 cold with a cosmic temperature of minus 271 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:39.590
 degree so who will attack only such 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.110
 only at this temperature can 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.030
 imagine 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.710
 probably freezing 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.250
 galina forming a single lived it 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.970
 Of course, all one single process 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.190
 complex of sciences and pros looking at growth 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.669
 we wrote a whole Kiev disasters it 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.449
 generally impressive 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.770
 he planted and you are 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.819
 continues on the greatest kennet 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.939
 you will follow it revived pleasant 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:05.500
 procedure for the influx you position 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.280
 already for he was a wonderful two 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.439
 parts of the personalities of the founders 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:11.830
 absolutely atomic paleontology two 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.020
 graphic lines and white bear columns 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.720
 with english smith it too 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.070
 invention more than any manifestations 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.660
 round the story of the cat again found 6 3 6 4 and 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.560
 previously comfortable 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.280
 he concluded that biodiversity 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.439
 there used to be more more 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:28.459
 of course the animal species was big 

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:29.879
 before plants 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:31.569
 to imagine that I am all this creation 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:33.209
 created just for us talking about it and 

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:34.400
 anthropic principle 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.009
 jiang and this without feathers traced and 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.919
 big fresh oxygen process 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:41.759
 this pool percentage is understand and butina 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:42.860
 below 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.699
 could not still burn and we would not 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:46.039
 survived the fire 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:47.699
 butina 25 percent 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:49.759
 everything would burn out even in the pouring rain 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.719
 with paranzhe relations should have been 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:54.229
 hang on a huge amount 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.470
 intervals without scope conceived 

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:59.860
 Katyn giant eye 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.330
 no part of the eye itself nothing 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.090
 see a quantum of light does not perceive 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.560
 perceive light can only class 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.199
 like that without light but cannot 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:11.169
 genes and earth appear some sort 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.449
 the molecule of them live it will immediately fall apart 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:16.939
 any living thing these see food 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:17.930
 chains 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.350
 enzymes that leave to live 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.010
 food chains exist everywhere 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.280
 and initiative is meant to imagine 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.160
 what is the appearance of living nearby 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.639
 creatures can't 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.520
 but it forms immediately 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.520
 biocenoses 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.090
 immediately see spheres again 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.509
 actual Slovaks Platonov about what 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:38.999
 whole toe legs 

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:41.739
 Tochitsky in general, and we must take care of our 

00:06:41.739 --> 00:06:43.909
 nature lowering this nature can 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:44.580
 simply 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.310
 percentage to explode a disaster we 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.530
 let's find ourselves Olympic 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.199
 crap dacha she times 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:51.740
 created always give up 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.770
 debris or rather it turns out themselves 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.169
 buried under the rubble of his 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:58.900
 own house thanks for 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.569
 the warning of the bureaucrat st as we 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:03.819
 let's be careful and give under the roof 

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:05.089
 integrators house 

00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:07.559
 China coach Nicholas why they sat in Kiev
