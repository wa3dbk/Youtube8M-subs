right here and that will charge your 3ds
and<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.519> wire<00:02:54.000> goes<00:02:54.420> at<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:54.660> back<00:02:54.810> comes<00:02:55.799> with

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
and the wire goes at the back comes with

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.830 
and the wire goes at the back comes with
an<00:02:56.069> access<00:02:56.519> so<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.730> can<00:02:57.000> put<00:02:57.209> your<00:02:57.239> DS<00:02:57.510> games

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
3ds games pop it in and out so that's

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:06.920 
3ds games pop it in and out so that's
really<00:03:01.620> useful<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:03.380> next<00:03:04.380> we<00:03:05.220> have<00:03:05.930> right

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
really useful and next we have right

really useful and next we have right
here

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.130 

the<00:03:10.430> charging<00:03:10.819> wire<00:03:10.970> now<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.480> charging<00:03:11.989> wire

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
the charging wire now the charging wire

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.110 
the charging wire now the charging wire
is<00:03:12.380> pretty<00:03:12.680> simple<00:03:12.890> you<00:03:13.190> can<00:03:13.670> either<00:03:13.819> charge

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
is pretty simple you can either charge

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.110 
is pretty simple you can either charge
the<00:03:14.360> 3ds<00:03:14.690> directly<00:03:15.380> with<00:03:15.530> this<00:03:15.709> end<00:03:16.040> wire<00:03:16.459> this

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
the 3ds directly with this end wire this

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.540 
the 3ds directly with this end wire this
wire<00:03:17.420> right<00:03:17.810> here<00:03:18.110> you<00:03:18.920> can<00:03:19.099> aid<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.250> charge

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
wire right here you can aid the charge

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.240 
wire right here you can aid the charge
it<00:03:19.730> through<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:20.660> or<00:03:20.900> you<00:03:21.140> could<00:03:21.319> just<00:03:21.349> plug

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
it through that or you could just plug

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.100 
it through that or you could just plug
it<00:03:22.430> into<00:03:22.550> the<00:03:22.700> back<00:03:22.849> right<00:03:23.120> here<00:03:23.360> like<00:03:23.569> so<00:03:23.930> oh

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
it into the back right here like so oh

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.059 
it into the back right here like so oh
crap

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.650 

it's<00:03:28.069> kind<00:03:28.220> of<00:03:28.310> hard<00:03:28.489> like<00:03:28.580> plugging<00:03:29.420> this<00:03:29.510> in

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
it's kind of hard like plugging this in

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.690 
it's kind of hard like plugging this in
with<00:03:29.810> looking<00:03:30.230> at<00:03:30.349> the<00:03:30.410> camera<00:03:30.709> anyway<00:03:31.010> so

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
with looking at the camera anyway so

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.430 
with looking at the camera anyway so
yeah<00:03:32.030> that's<00:03:32.300> how<00:03:32.420> it<00:03:32.540> fits<00:03:32.720> in<00:03:32.900> fits<00:03:33.349> and

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
yeah that's how it fits in fits and

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.470 
yeah that's how it fits in fits and
snugly<00:03:33.890> looks<00:03:34.099> beautiful<00:03:34.519> put<00:03:35.209> that<00:03:35.360> aside

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
snugly looks beautiful put that aside

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.020 
snugly looks beautiful put that aside
and<00:03:35.870> now<00:03:35.989> let's<00:03:36.290> get<00:03:36.440> into<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.769> main<00:03:37.310> concern

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
and now let's get into the main concern

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.960 
or the main thing for today is the
actual<00:03:42.500> 3ds<00:03:42.920> so<00:03:43.870> yeah<00:03:44.890> let's<00:03:45.890> open<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.310> put<00:03:46.760> the

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
actual 3ds so yeah let's open it put the

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.270 
actual 3ds so yeah let's open it put the
styrofoam<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:49.840> looks<00:03:50.840> beautiful<00:03:51.319> to<00:03:52.160> the

styrofoam and looks beautiful to the

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.380 
styrofoam and looks beautiful to the
sides<00:03:52.630> let<00:03:53.630> me<00:03:53.690> actually<00:03:53.840> focus<00:03:54.349> in<00:03:54.530> on<00:03:54.650> there

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
sides let me actually focus in on there

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.490 
sides let me actually focus in on there
there's<00:03:56.390> a<00:03:56.540> wire<00:03:56.750> that's<00:03:57.019> the<00:03:57.110> wireless

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
there's a wire that's the wireless

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
believe and so let's get back here so

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.629 
believe and so let's get back here so
unfortunately<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:41.810> 3ds<00:04:42.169> is<00:04:42.530> a<00:04:42.590> finger<00:04:43.250> magnet

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
unfortunately the 3ds is a finger magnet

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.690 
unfortunately the 3ds is a finger magnet
so<00:04:44.090> yeah<00:04:45.080> just<00:04:45.380> keep<00:04:45.620> it<00:04:45.740> clean<00:04:45.919> and<00:04:46.190> here's

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
so yeah just keep it clean and here's

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.190 
so yeah just keep it clean and here's
the<00:04:46.820> two<00:04:46.940> cameras<00:04:47.360> keep<00:04:47.570> those<00:04:47.720> clean<00:04:47.960> as<00:04:48.050> well

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200

a<00:04:50.180> light<00:04:50.360> sensor<00:04:50.750> and<00:04:51.560> you<00:04:51.710> open<00:04:52.130> it<00:04:52.250> up<00:04:52.370> got

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
a light sensor and you open it up got

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.400 
a light sensor and you open it up got
this<00:04:53.450> piece<00:04:53.660> of<00:04:53.690> styrofoam

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
this piece of styrofoam

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.159 
this piece of styrofoam
let's<00:04:54.650> get<00:04:54.740> that<00:04:54.889> way<00:04:55.310> and<00:04:55.930> obviously<00:04:56.930> let's

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
let's get that way and obviously let's

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.390 
let's get that way and obviously let's
focus<00:04:57.530> in<00:04:57.860> a<00:04:57.950> little<00:04:58.070> on<00:04:58.310> this<00:04:59.440> so<00:05:00.440> here's<00:05:01.160> the

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
focus in a little on this so here's the

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.580

convenient because you can download
stuff<00:06:14.960> immediately<00:06:15.409> off<00:06:15.560> the<00:06:15.770> eShop<00:06:16.279> channel

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 
stuff immediately off the eShop channel

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:21.670 
stuff immediately off the eShop channel
so<00:06:18.339> that's<00:06:19.339> basically<00:06:19.909> it<00:06:20.300> I<00:06:20.330> guess<00:06:20.749> and<00:06:21.259> I

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
so that's basically it I guess and I

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.670 
so that's basically it I guess and I
will<00:06:22.520> have<00:06:22.669> a<00:06:22.699> review<00:06:22.969> soon<00:06:23.389> and<00:06:23.629> let<00:06:24.409> me<00:06:24.499> just
