00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
campaign i think it would be fun to do a

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.830 
campaign i think it would be fun to do a
head-to-head<00:02:19.770> campaign<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.550> Caesar<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.660> goal

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.540 
head-to-head campaign in Caesar and goal
because<00:02:22.140> it's<00:02:22.260> very<00:02:22.410> it's<00:02:22.740> much<00:02:22.920> more<00:02:23.100> focused

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
because it's very it's much more focused

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.700 
because it's very it's much more focused
and<00:02:23.760> in<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.540> smaller<00:02:24.810> area<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.320> wouldn't<00:02:25.560> take

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
and in a smaller area and wouldn't take

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.070 
and in a smaller area and wouldn't take
his<00:02:25.860> long<00:02:26.270> but<00:02:27.270> they<00:02:27.510> simply<00:02:27.570> don't<00:02:27.930> work

his long but they simply don't work
right<00:02:28.140> now<00:02:28.320> so<00:02:28.560> I'm<00:02:29.070> not<00:02:29.310> going<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.520> be<00:02:29.670> that's

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.070 
goal like I mean I did the research but
I<00:03:20.489> didn't<00:03:20.700> actually<00:03:20.850> I<00:03:21.209> don't<00:03:21.720> have<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.840> piece

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
I didn't actually I don't have a piece

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.390 
I didn't actually I don't have a piece
of<00:03:22.110> paper<00:03:22.290> in<00:03:22.470> front<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.709> me<00:03:22.769> telling<00:03:23.010> me<00:03:23.190> what

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
of paper in front of me telling me what

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.250 
of paper in front of me telling me what
units<00:03:23.760> they<00:03:23.850> have<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:24.239> it's<00:03:24.660> kind<00:03:24.840> of<00:03:24.870> be<00:03:24.959> going

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
units they have so it's kind of be going

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.750 
units they have so it's kind of be going
off<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.470> top<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.650> my<00:03:25.739> head<00:03:25.799> I<00:03:26.160> believe<00:03:26.730> that

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
off the top of my head I believe that

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.220 
off the top of my head I believe that
they<00:03:26.940> also<00:03:27.090> have<00:03:27.530> ambushed<00:03:28.530> archers<00:03:30.110> so<00:03:31.110> they

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
they also have ambushed archers so they

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.380 
they also have ambushed archers so they
apparently<00:03:32.010> have<00:03:32.340> some<00:03:32.519> flavor<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.910> them<00:03:33.150> and

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
apparently have some flavor to them and

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.140 
apparently have some flavor to them and
then<00:03:33.870> Galatia<00:03:34.519> design<00:03:35.519> decision<00:03:35.880> from<00:03:35.970> CA

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
then Galatia design decision from CA

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.190 
then Galatia design decision from CA
that<00:03:36.269> I<00:03:36.360> really<00:03:36.570> don't<00:03:36.690> understand<00:03:37.049> is<00:03:37.170> why

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
that I really don't understand is why

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.440 
that I really don't understand is why
they<00:03:37.470> don't<00:03:37.650> have<00:03:37.830> an<00:03:38.130> elite<00:03:38.610> sword<00:03:39.030> unit<00:03:39.269> they

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
they don't have an elite sword unit they

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.210 
they don't have an elite sword unit they
have<00:03:39.540> Galatian<00:03:39.900> Legionnaires<00:03:40.350> which<00:03:41.070> are

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
have Galatian Legionnaires which are

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.000 
have Galatian Legionnaires which are
like<00:03:41.340> six<00:03:41.670> hundred<00:03:42.170> talents<00:03:43.170> which<00:03:43.380> is<00:03:43.560> like<00:03:43.980> a

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
like six hundred talents which is like a

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.470 
like six hundred talents which is like a
mid-tier<00:03:44.579> sworn<00:03:44.850> infantry<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.269> they<00:03:45.329> do<00:03:45.390> have

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
mid-tier sworn infantry and they do have

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.500 
mid-tier sworn infantry and they do have
very<00:03:45.750> good<00:03:45.959> stats<00:03:46.260> but<00:03:46.530> if<00:03:47.329> Egypt's<00:03:48.329> going<00:03:48.450> to

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
very good stats but if Egypt's going to

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.860 
very good stats but if Egypt's going to
have<00:03:48.660> access<00:03:49.110> to<00:03:49.230> culation<00:03:49.440> Royal<00:03:49.799> Guards<00:03:50.190> I

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
have access to culation Royal Guards I

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.120 
have access to culation Royal Guards I
understand<00:03:51.870> that<00:03:52.019> that<00:03:52.170> was<00:03:52.380> a<00:03:52.410> feature<00:03:52.980> of

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
understand that that was a feature of

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.160 
understand that that was a feature of
Ptolemaic<00:03:53.670> Egypt<00:03:53.850> that<00:03:54.180> they<00:03:54.329> recruited

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
Ptolemaic Egypt that they recruited

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.949 
Ptolemaic Egypt that they recruited
elite<00:03:55.650> mercenaries<00:03:56.190> from<00:03:56.280> Galatia<00:03:56.610> but<00:03:57.030> they

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
elite mercenaries from Galatia but they

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.479 
elite mercenaries from Galatia but they
are<00:03:58.110> Galatians<00:03:58.739> so<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.040> would<00:03:59.160> assume<00:03:59.310> that

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
are Galatians so you would assume that

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.920 
are Galatians so you would assume that
the<00:03:59.579> Galatians<00:03:59.940> would<00:04:00.060> also<00:04:00.150> have<00:04:00.390> an<00:04:00.600> elite

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
the Galatians would also have an elite

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.560 
the Galatians would also have an elite
tier<00:04:01.260> sword<00:04:01.620> unit<00:04:01.860> as<00:04:01.980> well<00:04:02.090> so<00:04:03.090> I<00:04:03.150> think<00:04:03.390> that

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
tier sword unit as well so I think that

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.240 
tier sword unit as well so I think that
was<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:03.810> strange<00:04:04.110> design<00:04:04.590> decision<00:04:04.950> from<00:04:05.070> them

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
was a strange design decision from them

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.259 
was a strange design decision from them
not<00:04:05.459> really<00:04:05.640> sure<00:04:05.790> what<00:04:05.970> they<00:04:06.060> were<00:04:06.120> thinking

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
not really sure what they were thinking

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.539 
not really sure what they were thinking
about<00:04:06.480> that<00:04:06.810> but<00:04:07.049> maybe<00:04:07.680> that<00:04:07.890> has<00:04:08.040> some<00:04:08.220> basis

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
about that but maybe that has some basis

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.110 
about that but maybe that has some basis
in<00:04:08.579> reality<00:04:08.700> i'm<00:04:09.150> not<00:04:09.329> sure<00:04:10.430> in<00:04:11.430> caesar<00:04:11.910> in

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
in reality i'm not sure in caesar in

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.759 
in reality i'm not sure in caesar in
gaul<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:12.510> get<00:04:12.660> access<00:04:13.049> to<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.410> Battle<00:04:13.739> of

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
gaul you get access to the Battle of

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.440 
gaul you get access to the Battle of
Alesia<00:04:14.250> I've<00:04:14.430> seen<00:04:14.640> it<00:04:14.730> played<00:04:14.850> on<00:04:14.910> youtube<00:04:15.299> it

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
Alesia I've seen it played on youtube it

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.050 
Alesia I've seen it played on youtube it
looks<00:04:15.769> interesting<00:04:16.769> in<00:04:17.370> fact<00:04:17.549> I<00:04:17.729> think<00:04:17.820> it's

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
looks interesting in fact I think it's

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.599 
looks interesting in fact I think it's
one<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.140> better<00:04:19.289> features<00:04:19.590> of<00:04:20.039> the<00:04:20.280> the

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
one of the better features of the the

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.510 
one of the better features of the the
pack<00:04:20.880> honestly<00:04:21.710> but<00:04:22.710> it's

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
pack honestly but it's

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.890 
pack honestly but it's
the<00:04:23.550> day<00:04:23.669> it's<00:04:23.819> only<00:04:23.970> one<00:04:24.120> historical<00:04:24.569> battle

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
the day it's only one historical battle

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.059 
the day it's only one historical battle
and<00:04:24.990> I<00:04:25.050> haven't<00:04:25.289> even<00:04:25.379> touched<00:04:25.590> any<00:04:25.889> of<00:04:25.949> the

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:26.069 
and I haven't even touched any of the

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:28.670 
and I haven't even touched any of the
other<00:04:26.190> historical<00:04:26.729> battles<00:04:27.060> on<00:04:27.379> room<00:04:28.379> to

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
other historical battles on room to

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.710 
other historical battles on room to
accept<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.610> battle<00:04:29.879> for<00:04:30.090> Thea<00:04:30.270> and<00:04:30.479> that<00:04:30.599> was

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
accept the battle for Thea and that was

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.439 
accept the battle for Thea and that was
fine<00:04:31.169> but<00:04:31.500> it<00:04:31.650> was<00:04:31.740> nothing<00:04:31.860> special<00:04:33.800> and

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
fine but it was nothing special and

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.790 
fine but it was nothing special and
ultimately<00:04:36.449> the<00:04:36.659> campaign<00:04:37.169> game<00:04:37.409> while<00:04:37.680> it's

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
ultimately the campaign game while it's

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.170 
ultimately the campaign game while it's
adding<00:04:38.099> some<00:04:38.250> features<00:04:38.580> that<00:04:38.610> I<00:04:38.909> think<00:04:38.940> are

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
adding some features that I think are

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.800 
adding some features that I think are
nice<00:04:39.360> like<00:04:39.629> seasons<00:04:40.110> and<00:04:40.409> a<00:04:41.250> new<00:04:41.810> recruitment

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
nice like seasons and a new recruitment

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.510 
nice like seasons and a new recruitment
system<00:04:43.080> from<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.530> satrapies<00:04:44.039> that<00:04:44.250> will<00:04:44.340> also

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
system from the satrapies that will also

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.640 
system from the satrapies that will also
get<00:04:44.610> put<00:04:44.819> back<00:04:44.849> into<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.810> original<00:04:46.080> grand

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
get put back into the original grand

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.860 
get put back into the original grand
campaign<00:04:47.159> honestly<00:04:48.090> I<00:04:48.180> could<00:04:48.389> just<00:04:48.539> go<00:04:48.659> into

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
campaign honestly I could just go into

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.689 
campaign honestly I could just go into
the<00:04:48.960> original<00:04:49.259> grant<00:04:49.409> campaign<00:04:49.620> and<00:04:50.039> play

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.860 
Caesar in Gaul and roleplay myself I
don't<00:04:53.280> need<00:04:53.400> to<00:04:53.460> spend<00:04:53.639> $15<00:04:54.240> for<00:04:54.449> it<00:04:54.569> I<00:04:54.690> could

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
don't need to spend $15 for it I could

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.300 
don't need to spend $15 for it I could
literally<00:04:55.050> pick<00:04:55.919> up<00:04:56.130> a<00:04:56.400> Roman<00:04:57.180> or<00:04:58.310> Germanic

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
literally pick up a Roman or Germanic

made a forum post about it and that was

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.189 
made a forum post about it and that was
it<00:06:27.509> that<00:06:27.690> was<00:06:27.719> the<00:06:27.840> extent<00:06:28.110> of<00:06:28.319> their<00:06:28.500> support

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:30.199 
it that was the extent of their support

making<00:06:32.370> me<00:06:32.430> mad<00:06:32.610> is<00:06:32.789> that<00:06:32.820> they're<00:06:33.029> not<00:06:33.120> really

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:34.729

viewers<00:06:54.780> simultaneously<00:06:55.500> on<00:06:55.770> the<00:06:55.830> stream<00:06:56.550> so

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
viewers simultaneously on the stream so

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.110 
viewers simultaneously on the stream so
it<00:06:57.300> was<00:06:57.660> really<00:06:57.840> good<00:06:58.140> for<00:06:58.380> the<00:06:58.500> community<00:06:59.120> and

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
it was really good for the community and

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.810 
it was really good for the community and
I<00:07:00.240> think<00:07:00.270> it<00:07:00.660> does<00:07:01.050> I<00:07:01.440> think<00:07:02.430> it's<00:07:02.580> a<00:07:02.640> step

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:02.820 
I think it does I think it's a step

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.880 
I think it does I think it's a step
forward<00:07:02.880> for<00:07:03.270> the<00:07:03.540> franchise<00:07:03.750> in<00:07:04.290> terms<00:07:04.620> of<00:07:04.830> a

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:08.550 
multiplayer may be moving more towards

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.640 
multiplayer may be moving more towards
the<00:07:08.640> eSports<00:07:09.420> side<00:07:09.600> of<00:07:09.750> things<00:07:09.870> but<00:07:10.440> again

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:10.650 
the eSports side of things but again

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.620 
the eSports side of things but again
Creative<00:07:11.250> Assembly<00:07:11.340> didn't<00:07:11.790> show<00:07:11.940> up<00:07:11.970> they

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:12.630 
Creative Assembly didn't show up they

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.840 
Creative Assembly didn't show up they
didn't<00:07:12.870> support<00:07:13.080> their<00:07:13.410> game<00:07:13.560> at<00:07:13.710> all<00:07:13.770> and<00:07:14.070> I

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:14.850 
didn't support their game at all and I

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.030 
didn't support their game at all and I
think<00:07:14.910> that<00:07:15.120> that's<00:07:15.510> a<00:07:16.050> big<00:07:16.200> mistake<00:07:16.380> because

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.040 
think that that's a big mistake because

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.640 
think that that's a big mistake because
if<00:07:17.940> you<00:07:18.330> are<00:07:18.450> going<00:07:18.600> to<00:07:18.690> support<00:07:18.930> your

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:48.690 
why wouldn't you go that extra step to

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.300 
why wouldn't you go that extra step to
be<00:07:48.810> involved<00:07:49.020> with<00:07:49.200> the<00:07:49.260> community<00:07:49.350> I'm<00:07:50.160> not
