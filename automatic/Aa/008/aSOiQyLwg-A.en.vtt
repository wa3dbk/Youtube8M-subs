of<00:01:48.659> his<00:01:48.780> clan<00:01:48.990> Council<00:01:49.200> wasn't<00:01:49.740> good<00:01:49.890> at<00:01:50.070> all

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
of his clan Council wasn't good at all

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.010 
of his clan Council wasn't good at all
because<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.640> was<00:01:50.729> right<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.119> edge<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.899> as

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
because it was right on the edge so as

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.920 
because it was right on the edge so as
you<00:01:52.140> see<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.350> drew<00:01:52.619> them<00:01:52.740> out<00:01:52.890> very<00:01:53.159> easily<00:01:53.930> get

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
you see I drew them out very easily get

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.810 
you see I drew them out very easily get
in<00:01:55.049> there<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.770> as<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.130> Wizards<00:01:56.430> work<00:01:56.610> their

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
in there so as the Wizards work their

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.069 
in there so as the Wizards work their
way<00:01:56.909> around<00:01:57.060> we're<00:01:57.479> going<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.659> need<00:01:57.810> to

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
way around we're going to need to

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.330 
way around we're going to need to
hopefully<00:01:58.469> clear<00:01:58.890> out<00:01:59.040> some<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.250> these

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
hopefully clear out some of these

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.940 
hopefully clear out some of these
buildings<00:01:59.610> around<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.060> outside<00:02:00.619> so<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.649> we

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
buildings around the outside so that we

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.160 
buildings around the outside so that we
can<00:02:02.280> make<00:02:02.880> sure<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.240> our<00:02:03.390> pekka's<00:02:03.930> head

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
can make sure that our pekka's head

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.450 
can make sure that our pekka's head
straight<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.680> because<00:02:04.979> we<00:02:05.070> don't<00:02:05.250> want<00:02:05.399> them

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
straight in because we don't want them

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.859 
straight in because we don't want them
to<00:02:05.640> get<00:02:05.729> distracted<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.390> run<00:02:06.570> around<00:02:06.780> the

to get distracted and run around the

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.290 
to get distracted and run around the
edges<00:02:07.160> these<00:02:08.160> golems<00:02:08.399> are<00:02:08.759> doing<00:02:09.090> absolutely

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300

going to almost to shop this town hall
that<00:03:16.840> only<00:03:16.959> took<00:03:17.290> like<00:03:17.350> three<00:03:17.799> seconds<00:03:18.989> but

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
that only took like three seconds but

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.180 
that only took like three seconds but
hopefully<00:03:20.320> they<00:03:20.470> can<00:03:20.530> work<00:03:20.680> their<00:03:20.829> way<00:03:21.070> around

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
hopefully they can work their way around

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.160 
hopefully they can work their way around
it<00:03:21.700> looks<00:03:21.910> like<00:03:22.060> all<00:03:22.180> these<00:03:22.329> Tesla's<00:03:22.780> are<00:03:22.959> down

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
it looks like all these Tesla's are down

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.069 
it looks like all these Tesla's are down
so<00:03:23.380> we<00:03:23.500> don't<00:03:23.650> have<00:03:23.739> to<00:03:23.920> worry<00:03:24.130> about<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.420> two

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
so we don't have to worry about the two

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.900 
so we don't have to worry about the two
hundred<00:03:26.290> percent<00:03:26.560> damage<00:03:26.799> from<00:03:27.310> those<00:03:27.640> when

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
hundred percent damage from those when

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.500 
hundred percent damage from those when
it<00:03:28.030> comes<00:03:28.209> to<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.450> pekka's<00:03:29.340> so<00:03:30.340> I<00:03:30.940> think<00:03:31.090> the

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
it comes to the pekka's so I think the

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.030 
it comes to the pekka's so I think the
only<00:03:31.660> enemy<00:03:31.870> that<00:03:32.140> we<00:03:32.260> have<00:03:32.410> at<00:03:32.560> this<00:03:32.650> point<00:03:32.769> in

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
only enemy that we have at this point in

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.610 
only enemy that we have at this point in
time<00:03:33.070> is<00:03:33.340> going<00:03:33.459> to<00:03:33.519> be<00:03:33.610> time<00:03:33.940> hopefully<00:03:34.620> the

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
time is going to be time hopefully the

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.530 
time is going to be time hopefully the
golems<00:03:36.070> and<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.430> pekka's<00:03:36.790> can<00:03:37.060> work<00:03:37.360> their

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
golems and the pekka's can work their

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.120 
golems and the pekka's can work their
way<00:03:37.630> around<00:03:37.780> i<00:03:38.140> really<00:03:38.410> want<00:03:38.590> at<00:03:38.739> least<00:03:38.799> one<00:03:39.040> of

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.930 
and get out there and get us all that
gold<00:03:47.620> because<00:03:47.980> it<00:03:48.010> does<00:03:48.250> look<00:03:48.400> like<00:03:48.489> most<00:03:48.790> of

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
gold because it does look like most of

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.120 
gold because it does look like most of
it<00:03:49.030> is<00:03:49.209> in<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.660> collectors<00:03:50.500> as<00:03:50.650> you<00:03:50.769> can<00:03:50.890> see

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
it is in the collectors as you can see

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.330 
it is in the collectors as you can see
that<00:03:51.160> one<00:03:51.519> right<00:03:51.640> there<00:03:51.850> had<00:03:52.060> about<00:03:52.269> 15,000

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
that one right there had about 15,000

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.979 
that one right there had about 15,000
gold<00:03:54.340> in<00:03:54.579> it<00:03:54.700> so<00:03:55.030> they're<00:03:55.660> just<00:03:55.840> going<00:03:55.930> to

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
gold in it so they're just going to

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.420 
gold in it so they're just going to
continue<00:03:56.140> working<00:03:56.560> their<00:03:56.799> way<00:03:56.829> around<00:03:57.130> the

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
continue working their way around the

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.210 
continue working their way around the
outside<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:59.410> golems<00:03:59.769> are<00:03:59.860> just<00:04:00.070> going<00:04:00.190> to

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
outside and the golems are just going to

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.810 
outside and the golems are just going to
keep<00:04:00.370> doing<00:04:00.430> their<00:04:00.910> work<00:04:01.320> and<00:04:02.400> it<00:04:03.400> looks<00:04:03.670> like

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
keep doing their work and it looks like

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.490
