something<00:00:03.840> in<00:00:03.959> here<00:00:04.170> about<00:00:04.410> how<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:04.740> pullers

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
something in here about how the pullers

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.169 
something in here about how the pullers
work<00:00:06.440> this<00:00:07.440> one<00:00:07.649> here<00:00:07.890> years<00:00:08.130> ago<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.490> modified

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
work this one here years ago I modified

work this one here years ago I modified
it<00:00:09.210> when<00:00:10.139> it<00:00:11.130> was<00:00:11.370> originally<00:00:11.670> provided<00:00:12.570> it

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
it when it was originally provided it

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.150 
it when it was originally provided it
had<00:00:13.469> kind<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.130> coarse<00:00:14.549> thread<00:00:15.240> bolt<00:00:15.949> we<00:00:16.949> kind

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
had kind of a coarse thread bolt we kind

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.590 
had kind of a coarse thread bolt we kind
of<00:00:17.250> get<00:00:17.340> as<00:00:17.430> good<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.640> lighting<00:00:17.970> as<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.180> can<00:00:18.420> here

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
of get as good a lighting as I can here

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.349 
of get as good a lighting as I can here
so<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.930> can<00:00:19.080> see<00:00:19.260> we've<00:00:19.470> got<00:00:19.560> good<00:00:19.740> sunlight

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
so you can see we've got good sunlight

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.359 
so you can see we've got good sunlight
but<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.539> can<00:00:21.689> see<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> giant<00:00:22.710> it's

but you can see this is a giant it's

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.710 
but you can see this is a giant it's
probably<00:00:23.730> about<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.199> 3/4<00:00:25.199> inch<00:00:25.230> grade<00:00:26.099> eight

you'll<00:00:43.230> see<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.860> thread<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.340> I'm

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
you'll see that this thread and I'm

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.790 
you'll see that this thread and I'm

but<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.129> thread<00:00:47.489> right<00:00:47.760> here<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:49.320> very

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
but this thread right here is very

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.770 
but this thread right here is very
coarse<00:00:50.070> meaning<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.879> no<00:00:51.090> matter<00:00:51.239> how<00:00:51.480> hard

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
coarse meaning that no matter how hard

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.840 
coarse meaning that no matter how hard
you<00:00:51.840> tighten<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> wrench<00:00:53.340> you're<00:00:53.730> at

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
you tighten this with a wrench you're at

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.389 
you tighten this with a wrench you're at
a<00:00:53.879> big<00:00:54.120> disadvantage<00:00:54.800> because<00:00:55.800> those<00:00:56.129> threads

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
a big disadvantage because those threads

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.740 
a big disadvantage because those threads
are<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.760> coarse<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.120> don't<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.570> good

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
are so coarse you don't have good

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.349 
are so coarse you don't have good
leverage<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:59.010> years<00:00:59.219> ago<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.910> hugged<00:01:00.180> out

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
leverage so years ago that I hugged out

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.000 
leverage so years ago that I hugged out
this<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.870> inside<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.440> thing<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.829> put

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
this the inside of this thing and put

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.529 
this the inside of this thing and put
this<00:01:02.129> enormous<00:01:02.489> bolt<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.059> there<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.420> it's

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
this enormous bolt in there and it's

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.210 
this enormous bolt in there and it's
been<00:01:03.690> working<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.229> good<00:01:04.409> five<00:01:04.680> years<00:01:04.710> since

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
been working for a good five years since

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.730 
been working for a good five years since
I<00:01:05.369> put<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.670> together<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.560> we'll<00:01:07.560> take<00:01:07.680> a

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
I put this together and we'll take a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.010 
I put this together and we'll take a
look<00:01:07.950> here<00:01:08.130> how<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.430> goes

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
look here how this goes

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.840 
look here how this goes
so<00:01:10.020> basically<00:01:10.380> we<00:01:10.650> explain<00:01:11.070> how<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.430> washer

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
so basically we explain how this washer

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.179 
so basically we explain how this washer
goes<00:01:12.030> fits<00:01:12.720> nicely<00:01:13.020> over<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> bolt<00:01:13.799> has<00:01:14.159> a

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
goes fits nicely over the bolt has a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.149 
goes fits nicely over the bolt has a
nice<00:01:14.400> chamfer<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.750> see<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.110> space<00:01:16.470> that

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
nice chamfer we can see the space that

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.249 
nice chamfer we can see the space that
it<00:01:17.310> provides<00:01:17.670> right<00:01:17.939> here<00:01:18.180> that's<00:01:18.689> enough<00:01:19.110> to

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
it provides right here that's enough to

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.690 
it provides right here that's enough to
make<00:01:19.290> sure<00:01:19.470> we're<00:01:19.860> tightening<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.340> into<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
make sure we're tightening it into the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.289 
make sure we're tightening it into the
crank<00:01:21.090> not<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.659> flywheel<00:01:22.880> we'll<00:01:23.880> just<00:01:24.030> start

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
crank not the flywheel we'll just start

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.690 
crank not the flywheel we'll just start
it<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:25.140> made<00:01:25.380> sure<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.009> loose

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
it and you made sure this is loose

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.620 
it and you made sure this is loose
enough<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.030> we're<00:01:27.299> not<00:01:27.390> going<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.540> be

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
enough that we're not going to be

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.289 
enough that we're not going to be
hanging<00:01:27.840> up<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.409> outer<00:01:29.030> lock<00:01:30.030> tab

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
can just start this lightly we're free

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:46.069
