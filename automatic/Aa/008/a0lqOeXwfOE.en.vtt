normally on the public test realm
I<00:00:23.430> don't<00:00:23.580> wants<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.789> go<00:00:23.939> live<00:00:24.119> or<00:00:24.390> what<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
I don't wants to go live or what the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.950 
I don't wants to go live or what the
purpose<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.170> but<00:00:25.350> it's<00:00:25.470> gone<00:00:25.619> up<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.890> 20

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
purpose this is but it's gone up to 20

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.480 
purpose this is but it's gone up to 20
so<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:27.990> mean<00:00:28.320> that's<00:00:28.439> not<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.980> biggest<00:00:29.160> thing

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
so I mean that's not the biggest thing

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.939 
so I mean that's not the biggest thing
ever<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.789> long<00:00:30.269> teamfight<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.349> can<00:00:31.500> hold<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.920> to

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
ever a long teamfight you can hold on to

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.770 
ever a long teamfight you can hold on to
your<00:00:32.160> old<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.399> bit<00:00:32.550> longer<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:32.969> that's<00:00:33.300> kind<00:00:33.660> of

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
your old a bit longer so that's kind of

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.229 
your old a bit longer so that's kind of
neat<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.020> guess<00:00:34.610> certainly<00:00:35.610> doesn't<00:00:36.000> affect

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
neat I guess certainly doesn't affect

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.680 
neat I guess certainly doesn't affect
the<00:00:36.360> lane<00:00:36.570> at<00:00:36.809> all<00:00:36.960> really<00:00:38.300> it's<00:00:39.300> definitely

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the lane at all really it's definitely

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.330 
the lane at all really it's definitely
not<00:00:39.809> like<00:00:39.870> Darius<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.500> old<00:00:40.680> Oh<00:00:40.860> where<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.219> know

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
not like Darius is old Oh where you know

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.479 
not like Darius is old Oh where you know
you<00:00:42.090> just<00:00:42.270> had<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.629> forever<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.500> sewer<00:00:43.950> like

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
you just had it forever so on sewer like

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.660 
you just had it forever so on sewer like
there's<00:00:44.670> no<00:00:44.820> refresh<00:00:45.270> time<00:00:45.510> thing<00:00:46.579> you<00:00:47.579> know

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
there's no refresh time thing you know

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.220 
there's no refresh time thing you know
if<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> more<00:00:48.120> important<00:00:48.629> thing<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.780> actually

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
if the more important thing is actually

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.360 
if the more important thing is actually
the<00:00:49.350> fact<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.829> happened<00:00:50.190> got<00:00:50.280> me

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the fact that this happened got me

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.369 
the fact that this happened got me
thinking<00:00:50.640> about<00:00:50.700> Darius<00:00:51.120> again<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.320> is

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
thinking about Darius again and this is

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.020 
thinking about Darius again and this is
just<00:00:52.620> pure<00:00:52.829> speculation<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.520> my<00:00:53.579> part<00:00:53.640> not<00:00:53.969> a

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
just pure speculation on my part not a

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.069 
just pure speculation on my part not a
Darius<00:00:54.420> player<00:00:56.270> don't<00:00:57.270> like<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.750> fact<00:00:57.989> that

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
Darius player don't like the fact that

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.569 
Darius player don't like the fact that
he's<00:00:58.260> kind<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.530> easy<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.920> kites<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.250> don't<00:00:59.430> play

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
he's kind of easy to kites I don't play

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.799 
he's kind of easy to kites I don't play
them<00:00:59.640> too<00:00:59.789> much<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.030> did<00:01:00.149> play<00:01:00.300> him<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> little

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
them too much it did play him a little

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.360 
them too much it did play him a little
bit<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.050> release<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:01.379> not<00:01:01.770> too<00:01:02.039> much<00:01:02.160> other

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
bit of release but not too much other

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.770 
bit of release but not too much other
than<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:04.670> but<00:01:05.670> yeah<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> was<00:01:06.450> kind<00:01:06.689> of

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
than that but yeah I was kind of

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.109 
than that but yeah I was kind of
thinking<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.560> maybe<00:01:08.040> Darras<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.760> sort<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.000> a

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
thinking that maybe Darras is sort of a

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.870 
thinking that maybe Darras is sort of a
counter<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> whole<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.860> go<00:01:11.159> peer<00:01:11.549> tank

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
counter to the whole just go peer tank

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.330 
counter to the whole just go peer tank
and<00:01:12.150> sit<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.479> farm<00:01:12.720> top<00:01:13.049> lane<00:01:13.320> thing<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.950> mean<00:01:14.250> I

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
and sit and farm top lane thing I mean I

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.340 
and sit and farm top lane thing I mean I
had<00:01:14.549> my<00:01:14.580> own<00:01:14.850> counters<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.570> anyway<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.020> I'm

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
had my own counters that anyway so I'm

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.840 
had my own counters that anyway so I'm
not<00:01:16.380> gonna<00:01:16.770> suddenly<00:01:17.040> gonna<00:01:17.369> start<00:01:17.610> spamming

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
not gonna suddenly gonna start spamming

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.060 
not gonna suddenly gonna start spamming
Darius<00:01:18.240> because<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.509> well<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.350> have<00:01:19.560> my<00:01:19.710> ways<00:01:19.890> of

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
Darius because I well I have my ways of

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.140 
Darius because I well I have my ways of
dealing<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.610> that's<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.850> whole<00:01:20.970> nother

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
dealing it and that's a whole nother

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.490 
dealing it and that's a whole nother
matter<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.689> it's<00:01:21.810> not<00:01:21.960> relevant<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.350> this

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
matter that it's not relevant to this

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.469 
matter that it's not relevant to this
video<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:24.140> there's<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.200> tall<00:01:25.350> plan<00:01:25.560> player<00:01:25.770> but

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
video but there's a tall plan player but

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.240 
video but there's a tall plan player but
yeah<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.509> was<00:01:27.659> thinking<00:01:27.930> darkness<00:01:28.320> might<00:01:28.770> be<00:01:29.220> a

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
yeah I was thinking darkness might be a

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.460 
yeah I was thinking darkness might be a
good<00:01:29.820> way<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.090> basically<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.930> counter<00:01:31.200> that

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
good way to basically a counter that

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.170 
good way to basically a counter that
sort<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.770> very<00:01:32.040> passive<00:01:32.700> I'm<00:01:32.820> gonna<00:01:33.000> build

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
sort of very passive I'm gonna build

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.420 
sort of very passive I'm gonna build
pure<00:01:33.479> tank<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.049> farm<00:01:34.320> my<00:01:34.530> way<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.310> know

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
pure tank and farm my way to you know

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
weaknesses there are very very specific

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.080 
weaknesses there are very very specific
ways<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:17.680> counter<00:03:18.069> are<00:03:18.310> very<00:03:18.489> effective<00:03:18.939> ways

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
ways to counter are very effective ways

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.939 
ways to counter are very effective ways
to<00:03:19.269> counter<00:03:19.569> namely<00:03:20.259> like<00:03:20.439> poke<00:03:20.709> and

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:20.949 
to counter namely like poke and

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:22.469 
to counter namely like poke and
understanding<00:03:21.609> all<00:03:21.790> like<00:03:22.060> if<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.269> memorize

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:22.479 
understanding all like if you memorize

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:24.869 
understanding all like if you memorize
his<00:03:22.780> cooldowns<00:03:23.079> and<00:03:23.409> know<00:03:23.560> his<00:03:23.739> exact<00:03:24.250> range

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
his cooldowns and know his exact range

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.999 
his cooldowns and know his exact range
you<00:03:25.449> just<00:03:25.689> stand<00:03:26.019> outside<00:03:26.259> of<00:03:26.590> apprehend

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:27.009 
you just stand outside of apprehend

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:28.740 
you just stand outside of apprehend
range<00:03:27.220> waiting<00:03:27.669> to<00:03:27.790> waste<00:03:28.000> something<00:03:28.389> and

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
range waiting to waste something and

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.809 
range waiting to waste something and
then<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:29.019> know<00:03:29.139> you<00:03:29.199> go<00:03:29.470> in<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.859> smarter<00:03:30.519> Darius

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
then you know you go in a smarter Darius

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:31.949 
then you know you go in a smarter Darius
is<00:03:30.909> gonna<00:03:31.060> be<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.209> bit<00:03:31.389> hard<00:03:31.599> to<00:03:31.629> deal<00:03:31.840> with

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
is gonna be a bit hard to deal with

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.569 
is gonna be a bit hard to deal with
because<00:03:32.049> you<00:03:32.199> know<00:03:32.229> he<00:03:32.470> saves<00:03:32.829> his<00:03:33.069> abilities

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
because you know he saves his abilities

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.099 
because you know he saves his abilities
and<00:03:33.790> he's<00:03:33.909> gonna<00:03:34.030> hit<00:03:34.239> you<00:03:34.389> with<00:03:34.419> the<00:03:34.689> the

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
and he's gonna hit you with the the

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.759 
and he's gonna hit you with the the
outside<00:03:35.319> portion<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.220> Q<00:03:36.370> every<00:03:36.669> time<00:03:36.909> and

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
outside portion the Q every time and

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.929 
outside portion the Q every time and
it's<00:03:38.769> it's<00:03:39.009> a<00:03:39.099> bit<00:03:39.250> more<00:03:39.400> difficult<00:03:39.759> to<00:03:39.819> manage

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:39.939 
it's it's a bit more difficult to manage

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.789 
it's it's a bit more difficult to manage
thus<00:03:40.299> long<00:03:40.479> as<00:03:40.569> you<00:03:40.629> have<00:03:40.720> good<00:03:40.930> poke<00:03:41.290> and<00:03:41.560> an

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
thus long as you have good poke and an

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.589 
thus long as you have good poke and an
understanding<00:03:42.489> of<00:03:42.549> his<00:03:42.729> threat<00:03:43.060> range<00:03:43.329> like

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
understanding of his threat range like

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.920 
understanding of his threat range like
Darius<00:03:43.900> is<00:03:44.079> very<00:03:44.409> very<00:03:44.739> easy<00:03:44.979> to<00:03:45.129> control<00:03:45.930> if

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
Darius is very very easy to control if

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.679 
Darius is very very easy to control if
you<00:03:47.079> screw<00:03:47.439> up<00:03:47.470> then<00:03:48.159> yeah<00:03:48.489> it's<00:03:49.090> pretty<00:03:49.329> scary

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:49.689 
you screw up then yeah it's pretty scary

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:50.879 
you screw up then yeah it's pretty scary
because<00:03:49.780> Darius<00:03:50.199> all<00:03:50.349> those<00:03:50.470> champions<00:03:50.829> it

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
because Darius all those champions it

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.020 
because Darius all those champions it
even<00:03:51.099> if<00:03:51.189> you're<00:03:51.280> winning<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.639> lane<00:03:51.790> if<00:03:51.939> you

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
even if you're winning the lane if you

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.610 
even if you're winning the lane if you
stop<00:03:52.419> paying<00:03:52.599> attention<00:03:52.689> half<00:03:53.139> a<00:03:53.229> second

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
stop paying attention half a second

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.530 
stop paying attention half a second
decide<00:03:53.829> to<00:03:53.949> go<00:03:54.040> hey<00:03:54.370> I<00:03:54.400> can<00:03:54.729> ignore<00:03:55.000> his<00:03:55.180> damage

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
decide to go hey I can ignore his damage

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.729 
decide to go hey I can ignore his damage
I'm<00:03:55.629> gonna<00:03:55.689> get<00:03:55.959> that<00:03:56.049> one<00:03:56.259> last<00:03:56.500> hit<00:03:56.709> and

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
I'm gonna get that one last hit and

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:57.689 
I'm gonna get that one last hit and
ignore<00:03:57.099> his<00:03:57.219> cooldowns

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
ignore his cooldowns

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.309 
ignore his cooldowns
you<00:03:57.939> can<00:03:58.120> die<00:03:58.329> even<00:03:58.780> though<00:03:58.900> you<00:03:58.959> have<00:03:59.199> the

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
you can die even though you have the

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.229 
you can die even though you have the
lead<00:03:59.500> which<00:03:59.680> is<00:03:59.829> quite<00:04:00.370> unusual<00:04:00.879> for<00:04:00.909> a<00:04:01.060> top

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
lead which is quite unusual for a top

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.240 
lead which is quite unusual for a top
lane<00:04:03.750> but<00:04:04.750> aside<00:04:05.620> from<00:04:05.680> those<00:04:05.979> weaknesses

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
lane but aside from those weaknesses

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.189 
lane but aside from those weaknesses
that's<00:04:06.759> not<00:04:07.030> what's<00:04:07.299> really<00:04:07.359> going<00:04:07.780> on<00:04:07.900> top

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:08.199 
that's not what's really going on top

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.319 
that's not what's really going on top
lane<00:04:08.530> anymore<00:04:08.889> it's<00:04:09.039> not<00:04:09.219> so<00:04:09.549> much<00:04:09.729> about<00:04:09.879> poke

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
lane anymore it's not so much about poke

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:11.670 
lane anymore it's not so much about poke
and<00:04:10.689> that<00:04:10.780> kind<00:04:10.959> of<00:04:10.989> thing<00:04:11.109> it's<00:04:11.229> tanky

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
and that kind of thing it's tanky

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.899 
and that kind of thing it's tanky
sustain<00:04:12.039> it's<00:04:12.219> mainly<00:04:12.370> what<00:04:12.579> I'm<00:04:12.669> seeing

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
sustain it's mainly what I'm seeing

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.059 
sustain it's mainly what I'm seeing
largely<00:04:13.479> most<00:04:13.930> likely<00:04:14.289> due<00:04:14.469> to<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.709> change<00:04:14.919> to

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
largely most likely due to the change to

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.770 
largely most likely due to the change to
the<00:04:15.189> defensive<00:04:15.849> tree<00:04:16.030> which<00:04:16.209> you<00:04:16.419> can<00:04:16.570> argue

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
the defensive tree which you can argue

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.899 
the defensive tree which you can argue
or<00:04:17.109> overpowered<00:04:17.709> I<00:04:17.859> think<00:04:18.099> it's<00:04:18.280> probably

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:18.909 
or overpowered I think it's probably

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:22.290 
or overpowered I think it's probably
like<00:04:20.010> when<00:04:21.010> I<00:04:21.039> did<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.430> the<00:04:21.669> preview<00:04:22.060> video

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
like when I did the the preview video

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.850 
like when I did the the preview video
for<00:04:22.449> the<00:04:22.510> changes<00:04:22.900> to<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.080> season<00:04:23.500> for

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
for the changes to the season for

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.070 
for the changes to the season for
masteries<00:04:24.520> trees

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
masteries trees

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.510 
masteries trees
like<00:04:25.319> that's<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.680> first<00:04:25.800> thing<00:04:26.039> I<00:04:26.099> queued<00:04:26.370> in

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
like that's the first thing I queued in

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.809 
like that's the first thing I queued in
on<00:04:26.639> it<00:04:26.789> was<00:04:26.879> like<00:04:27.560> wow<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.620> defensive<00:04:29.580> tree<00:04:29.759> is

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:29.819 
on it was like wow the defensive tree is

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:31.309 
on it was like wow the defensive tree is
really<00:04:30.180> powerful<00:04:30.539> and<00:04:30.900> it's<00:04:31.020> been<00:04:31.139> nerfed

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:31.319 
really powerful and it's been nerfed

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:36.050 
really powerful and it's been nerfed
since<00:04:31.740> then<00:04:32.479> maybe<00:04:33.479> not<00:04:34.050> enough<00:04:34.520> but<00:04:35.520> in<00:04:35.819> any

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
since then maybe not enough but in any

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.939 
since then maybe not enough but in any
case<00:04:36.150> for<00:04:36.509> the<00:04:36.569> time<00:04:36.840> being<00:04:37.289> it's<00:04:37.620> really

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
case for the time being it's really

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:39.290 
case for the time being it's really
strong<00:04:38.190> people<00:04:38.340> been<00:04:38.610> doing<00:04:38.789> the<00:04:38.849> tanky<00:04:39.150> thing

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
strong people been doing the tanky thing

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.960 
strong people been doing the tanky thing
like<00:04:39.449> I<00:04:39.539> keep<00:04:39.690> saying<00:04:39.860> Darius<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:41.129> think<00:04:41.610> yeah

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
like I keep saying Darius I think yeah

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
it's you don't counter Darius why

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.119 
it's you don't counter Darius why
becoming<00:04:44.699> tanky<00:04:45.270> really<00:04:45.599> not<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.889> notch

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:47.129

this<00:05:00.240> considering<00:05:00.930> like<00:05:01.139> this<00:05:01.710> is<00:05:01.830> pure

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
this considering like this is pure

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.640 
this considering like this is pure
speculation<00:05:02.129> again<00:05:02.729> is<00:05:03.180> maybe<00:05:03.599> going<00:05:04.020> boots

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
speculation again is maybe going boots

easiness<00:06:30.449> to<00:06:30.599> kite<00:06:30.870> and<00:06:31.379> you<00:06:31.560> know<00:06:31.680> that<00:06:31.889> kind

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
easiness to kite and you know that kind

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.480 
easiness to kite and you know that kind
of<00:06:32.400> thing<00:06:32.810> but<00:06:33.889> at<00:06:34.889> the<00:06:34.979> very<00:06:35.070> least<00:06:35.310> you'll

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
of thing but at the very least you'll

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.459 
of thing but at the very least you'll
have<00:06:35.610> a<00:06:35.639> very<00:06:35.880> strong<00:06:36.270> leaning<00:06:36.659> faith<00:06:36.930> laning

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:37.469 
have a very strong leaning faith laning

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:38.239 
have a very strong leaning faith laning
phase<00:06:37.649> I<00:06:37.800> would

00:06:38.239 --> 00:06:38.249 
phase I would

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:39.649 
phase I would
Anjan<00:06:38.549> so<00:06:38.789> like<00:06:38.939> I<00:06:39.029> said<00:06:39.149> I<00:06:39.209> really<00:06:39.389> want<00:06:39.599> to

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:39.659 
Anjan so like I said I really want to

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:40.849 
Anjan so like I said I really want to
experiment<00:06:40.109> with<00:06:40.199> this<00:06:40.259> if<00:06:40.439> it<00:06:40.529> doesn't<00:06:40.739> work

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:40.859 
experiment with this if it doesn't work

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:42.049 
experiment with this if it doesn't work
out<00:06:41.009> well<00:06:41.189> it<00:06:41.309> doesn't<00:06:41.519> work<00:06:41.609> out<00:06:41.789> and<00:06:41.939> this<00:06:41.999> is

00:06:42.049 --> 00:06:42.059 
out well it doesn't work out and this is

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:47.599 
out well it doesn't work out and this is
just<00:06:42.389> to<00:06:42.569> fail<00:06:43.789> hypothesis<00:06:44.789> but<00:06:46.429> that's<00:06:47.429> it

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:47.609 
just to fail hypothesis but that's it

00:06:47.609 --> 00:06:49.819 
just to fail hypothesis but that's it
for<00:06:47.789> me<00:06:47.939> gonna<00:06:48.509> test<00:06:48.869> out<00:06:49.049> Dora's<00:06:49.349> probably<00:06:49.709> my

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:49.829 
for me gonna test out Dora's probably my

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:52.009 
for me gonna test out Dora's probably my
stream<00:06:50.069> today<00:06:50.339> I<00:06:50.369> see<00:06:51.029> you<00:06:51.089> guys<00:06:51.269> around<00:06:51.479> with
