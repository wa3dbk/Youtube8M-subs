00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 it's new 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.109
 each player who remains however that he does not have at all 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.230
 they are visible by all that was hiding his plot to the identical this 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.009
 territory 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.169
 last night 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.030
 then to start the game and was a girl on the rail 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.030
 each of the players even though I have a four-letter word 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.090
 these words are then placed alphabetically 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.910
 the player in the word is the closest to the retreat in this 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.630
 I will announce 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.630
 the demand 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.180
 I announce bordeaux so it's up to me to start 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.170
 I want to have proposed an amount from a culture to express themselves 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.610
 using resistance 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.610
 at least 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.760
 it's at 10 o'clock 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.950
 this side 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.420
 I can propose a beautiful 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.920
 ending with 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.630
 bezos 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.170
 b &amp; o r 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.960
 b &amp; o rdc 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.260
 for example by adding 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.400
 and Bam 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.400
 I can do anything on board 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.490
 I was also chosen for the other side 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.920
 and this time what to think a word among the schools 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.560
 good dynamic 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.150
 we do not talk about the eyes 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.060
 com avenue 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.060
 ouattara l took place 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.980
 the goal of the game being to get rid of all these wars 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.950
 I look at whether the reverse side of voting face a more favorable situation 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:14.449
 I can finish 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:15.589
 billiards or snooker 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:17.369
 for example proposed 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:20.249
 between the var 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:21.939
 at the other end 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.079
 how is it a word 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.009
 obÃ©lix 

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:29.919
 or not verbalize 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:32.919
 in combined 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:37.619
 I chose this solution because it allows to place four letters 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.519
 I do not think I can do better 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.429
 even if it was not an eight-letter word 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:48.439
 it does not matter the moment we respected the principle of his colleague 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.289
 ag of letters minimum present 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:54.269
 I slide my letters on the rail 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.559
 the letters in a flying trick can recover without a warrant 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.449
 here is the principle of the game 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:02.629
 Warning 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.089
 in no case not to strike letters 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:09.089
 interspersed with letters by the media 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:14.579
 I get the letters fall and it's my turn to play 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:18.689
 it should be noted that we can play with all the words of the 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:22.099
 dictionary except 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.939
 and after cancellation 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:27.939
 conjugated verbs and plurals are allowed 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:32.839
 so here I will visualize the different possibilities of play 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.749
 and I see that I can do borders 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.649
 by adding 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:41.969
 s on board 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:45.450
 the extra letters fell alas we have the examples of a year earlier 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:47.849
 indeed 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.849
 I composed a bit of jubilation 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:54.999
 it allows me to get rid of a letter of my choice 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:57.639
 that I put in the pick 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.639
 I choose the goal 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.179
 as the game progresses 

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:06.029
 there are fewer and fewer letters 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:09.029
 the game becomes fluid thanks to the hospitals 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.169
 day four possibilities of things 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.139
 you have to know that you do not have the right to replay a memo 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.009
 so 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:27.469
 combined 

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:30.469
 as soon as possible 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.919
 on time by ending with which solar 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.800
 I will compose 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.159
 conducted 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.050
 and constituted lawyer 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.050
 our turn 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:54.279
 I reject 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:57.279
 the slope 

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:03.309
 lover 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.830
 so here I visualize the game 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:13.900
 texting 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.389
 Custom 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.210
 and I'm going to compose the word maple 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.349
 starting 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:22.779
 of clerck 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:25.779
 it's not a little earlier but hey we can not always do better 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.909
 attention in case of adoption 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:49.349
 it is stated that last year was important of the game 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.539
 this version is an interactive game 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.379
 while s &amp; p has sagged I see his game 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:56.520
 I will also look for hospitals 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.309
 in this case there is a whole afternoon 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:00.819
 three late strokes 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:03.860
 it was aggravated by the fact of having found another tournament gives 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.050
 neighborhood law a new letter 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.050
 I reject categorically 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.279
 the slightest gust of wind it can not be played anymore 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:17.939
 now it's my turn to propose again 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:19.749
 I made choices 

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:20.759
 it's a little earlier 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:22.709
 so I'm getting rid of the last year
