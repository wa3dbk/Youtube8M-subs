they meet other foreigners it's the same
thing<00:03:21.740> they<00:03:21.890> just<00:03:22.070> talk<00:03:22.250> about<00:03:22.430> it<00:03:22.640> for<00:03:22.840> she's

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
thing they just talk about it for she's

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.970 
thing they just talk about it for she's
like<00:03:23.990> she<00:03:24.440> been<00:03:24.590> wearing<00:03:24.830> shoes

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.300 

and<00:03:32.550> it's<00:03:32.849> hot<00:03:33.209> man<00:03:33.540> I<00:03:33.900> just<00:03:34.800> left<00:03:34.920> my<00:03:35.010> house

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
and it's hot man I just left my house

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.150 
and it's hot man I just left my house
like<00:03:36.140> two<00:03:37.140> or<00:03:37.230> three<00:03:37.290> minutes<00:03:37.709> ago<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:38.099> I'm

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
like two or three minutes ago and I'm

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.770 
like two or three minutes ago and I'm
already<00:03:38.370> like<00:03:38.610> starting<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:38.970> sweat<00:03:39.300> here<00:03:39.599> and

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
already like starting to sweat here and

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.119 
already like starting to sweat here and
every<00:03:39.930> time<00:03:40.050> I<00:03:40.080> come<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.319> a<00:03:40.410> stop<00:03:40.739> it's<00:03:40.980> just

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
every time I come to a stop it's just

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.509 
every time I come to a stop it's just
like<00:03:41.250> instant<00:03:41.700> roasting<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:44.040> temperature<00:03:44.459> is

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
like instant roasting the temperature is

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.490 
like instant roasting the temperature is
like<00:03:44.640> 35<00:03:45.300> 36<00:03:45.750> degrees<00:03:46.080> Celsius

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.350 

and<00:03:49.830> then<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.100> got<00:03:50.220> high<00:03:50.430> timidity<00:03:50.790> so<00:03:51.180> it

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
and then you got high timidity so it

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.840 
and then you got high timidity so it
makes<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.600> a<00:03:51.690> lot<00:03:51.840> worse<00:03:52.280> I'm<00:03:53.280> not<00:03:53.550> getting

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
makes it a lot worse I'm not getting

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.790 
makes it a lot worse I'm not getting
these<00:03:53.940> lights

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.810 

my<00:04:00.340> bags<00:04:00.580> dirty<00:04:01.120> as<00:04:01.360> hell<00:04:01.390> man<00:04:02.640> embarrassed<00:04:03.640> to

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
my bags dirty as hell man embarrassed to

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.540 
my bags dirty as hell man embarrassed to
ride<00:04:04.090> it<00:04:04.290> but<00:04:05.290> I'm<00:04:05.410> gonna<00:04:05.500> I'm<00:04:05.590> gonna<00:04:05.830> go<00:04:06.040> I'm

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
going to make my life's light bulbs

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.610 
going to make my life's light bulbs
burned<00:04:08.980> out<00:04:09.220> so<00:04:09.460> me<00:04:09.820> being<00:04:10.030> as<00:04:10.270> useless<00:04:11.200> as<00:04:11.470> I

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
burned out so me being as useless as I

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.430 
burned out so me being as useless as I
am<00:04:11.800> on<00:04:12.040> risk<00:04:12.220> I'm<00:04:12.460> gonna<00:04:12.780> take<00:04:13.780> it<00:04:13.930> to<00:04:13.960> someone

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
am on risk I'm gonna take it to someone

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.350 
am on risk I'm gonna take it to someone
else<00:04:14.590> to<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.100> mechanics<00:04:15.550> to<00:04:15.700> get<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.120> bulb

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.360 
else to the mechanics to get the bulb

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.350 
else to the mechanics to get the bulb
change<00:04:16.830> and<00:04:17.830> I'm<00:04:17.950> thinking<00:04:18.280> I<00:04:18.549> might<00:04:19.209> as<00:04:19.299> well

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.360 
change and I'm thinking I might as well

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.420 
change and I'm thinking I might as well
go<00:04:19.600> to<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:20.110> mechanics<00:04:20.650> first<00:04:20.890> and<00:04:21.130> then<00:04:21.220> get

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
go to the mechanics first and then get

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.550 
go to the mechanics first and then get
the<00:04:21.549> bike<00:04:21.730> washed<00:04:22.450> as<00:04:22.750> opposed<00:04:22.990> to<00:04:23.110> what<00:04:23.380> and

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
the bike washed as opposed to what and

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.290 
the bike washed as opposed to what and
then<00:04:23.680> of<00:04:23.770> course<00:04:23.800> all<00:04:24.160> you<00:04:24.550> know<00:04:24.640> hey<00:04:25.000> someone

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
then of course all you know hey someone

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.540 
then of course all you know hey someone
else<00:04:25.450> do<00:04:25.570> that<00:04:25.600> as<00:04:25.870> well<00:04:25.990> because<00:04:29.310> that's<00:04:30.310> when
