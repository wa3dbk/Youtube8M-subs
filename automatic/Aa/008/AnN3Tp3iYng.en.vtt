00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.859 
the starter kit and bare minerals but
this<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.759> way<00:01:23.880> softer<00:01:24.119> than<00:01:24.450> their<00:01:24.630> brushes

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
this is way softer than their brushes

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.359 
this is way softer than their brushes
and<00:01:25.560> also<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.460> was<00:01:26.700> by<00:01:26.880> 50<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:28.100> its<00:01:29.100> bamboo

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
and also this was by 50 and its bamboo

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.780 
and also this was by 50 and its bamboo
its<00:01:30.049> tackle<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.439> it's<00:01:31.619> synthetic<00:01:32.340> brushes

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790

its tackle and so it's synthetic brushes
bristles<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.900> hypoallergenic<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.850> really

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
bristles and hypoallergenic so I really

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.069 
bristles and hypoallergenic so I really

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
moment but I'm going to put this on

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.429

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
tonight so i will post a picture on

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.929 
tonight so i will post a picture on
twitter<00:01:49.770> at<00:01:49.950> some<00:01:50.130> point<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.610> what<00:01:50.790> this

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
twitter at some point of what this

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.300 
twitter at some point of what this
actually<00:01:51.119> looks<00:01:51.329> like<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:52.560> from<00:01:53.189> looking

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
actually looks like on but from looking

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.190 
actually looks like on but from looking
at<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.610> formulation<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.600> bottle<00:01:55.020> I

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
at the formulation of it in the bottle I

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.300 
at the formulation of it in the bottle I
think<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:55.500> gonna<00:01:55.649> be<00:01:55.710> really<00:01:55.799> pretty<00:01:56.070> color

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
think it's gonna be really pretty color

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.850 
think it's gonna be really pretty color
because<00:01:56.820> it's<00:01:56.969> not<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.329> take<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> formulation

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
because it's not to take a formulation

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.590 
because it's not to take a formulation
so<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.250> should<00:01:59.430> come<00:01:59.460> as<00:01:59.670> quite<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.969> girl<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.329> a

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
so it should come as quite a girl like a

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.539 
so it should come as quite a girl like a
wash<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.380> color<00:02:01.619> rather<00:02:01.799> than<00:02:01.950> just<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.250> strong

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
wash of color rather than just a strong

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.880 
wash of color rather than just a strong
bright<00:02:03.149> pink<00:02:03.450> which<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.780> was<00:02:04.530> going<00:02:04.680> for<00:02:04.740> a

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
bright pink which I was going for a

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.969 
bright pink which I was going for a
light<00:02:05.009> color<00:02:05.219> anyway<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.950> then<00:02:07.950> I

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
light color anyway it and then I

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.430 
light color anyway it and then I
got<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.670> liquid<00:02:09.090> eyeliner<00:02:09.569> in<00:02:09.780> black<00:02:09.810> which

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
got the liquid eyeliner in black which

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.340 
got the liquid eyeliner in black which
is<00:02:10.470> just<00:02:10.709> from<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.920> normal

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
is just from the normal

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.060 
is just from the normal
I<00:02:12.480> then<00:02:13.480> i<00:02:13.840> also<00:02:13.930> got<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.440> liquid<00:02:14.590> eyeliner

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
I then i also got the liquid eyeliner

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.750 
I then i also got the liquid eyeliner
and<00:02:15.340> round<00:02:16.140> if<00:02:17.140> i<00:02:17.290> can<00:02:17.440> find<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.800> which<00:02:18.400> i<00:02:18.550> used

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
and round if i can find it which i used

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.790 
and round if i can find it which i used

wearing I really like these colors it's
a<00:02:51.700> little<00:02:52.000> bit<00:02:52.120> hard<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.480> pick<00:02:52.780> up<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.080> color

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
a little bit hard to pick up the color

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.530 
a little bit hard to pick up the color
out<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.890> thing<00:02:54.880> because<00:02:55.120> I'm<00:02:55.270> used<00:02:55.480> to

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
out of the thing because I'm used to

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.030 
out of the thing because I'm used to
like<00:02:55.720> open<00:02:55.870> decay<00:02:56.290> which<00:02:56.500> are<00:02:56.620> really<00:02:56.770> soft

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
like open decay which are really soft

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.460 
like open decay which are really soft
but<00:02:57.970> they're<00:02:58.330> easy<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.690> blend<00:02:58.900> which<00:02:59.200> I<00:02:59.320> really

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
but they're easy to blend which I really

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.820 
but they're easy to blend which I really
like<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.890> they're<00:03:00.010> so<00:03:00.220> cheap<00:03:00.520> so<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:02.260> far<00:03:02.590> I

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
like and they're so cheap so so far I

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.650 
like and they're so cheap so so far I
mean<00:03:03.010> after<00:03:03.130> one<00:03:03.400> use<00:03:03.580> I<00:03:03.790> think<00:03:04.090> for<00:03:04.330> one<00:03:04.450> pound

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.230 
mean after one use I think for one pound
fifty<00:03:04.840> per<00:03:05.140> quod<00:03:05.410> they<00:03:05.590> are<00:03:05.710> worth<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:06.240> which

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
fifty per quod they are worth it which
