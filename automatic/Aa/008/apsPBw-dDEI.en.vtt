00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.830
 hello everybody today we see the nest 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.650
 of bee made with Tunisian crochet 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.920
 this too will be a video proof test 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.630
 if you want to prepare them with the necessary 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.699
 just a crochet hook is enough 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.199
 normal to do the test initially 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.269
 with a few stitches and the appropriate thread 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.689
 I now continue on this piece already 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.279
 did you see this is the point 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.279
 otherwise it starts to do 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.110
 simply a chain and bring it up 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.059
 points as in all departures of the 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.710
 of the Tunisian crochet hook the number of the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.129
 points is indifferent you can do a 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.860
 even or odd number and time 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.789
 we can begin to see how it is 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.110
 then the first point is taken 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.780
 the north wire the point normally 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:02.870
 passing behind the vertical bar like 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:06.240
 the base point of the Tunisian crochet hook 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.900
 in the other points the point alternates 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.270
 normal basis and another point made in 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.600
 this way you take the trust you bring 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.750
 in front you pass behind the bar 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.840
 vertical you get rid of the thread yes 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.049
 pick up the thread from behind and do it 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.590
 pass the point then we make a point 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.790
 normal behind the bar and we pass the 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.950
 wire 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.470
 the other point again we take the 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.049
 son we carry it in front we pass 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.590
 behind the vertical bar we free ourselves 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.009
 take the thread and make the thread 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.590
 point now again the base point 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.040
 let's go behind the vertical bar 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.829
 we take the thread and we now pass it by 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.840
 new this point we bring the front 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.689
 thread we pass behind the bar 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.610
 vertical we get rid of the film 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.610
 take and make the point 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.179
 now we make a normal point base point 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.630
 let's go behind the vertical bar e 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.600
 let 's make the point now we bring up front 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.760
 the thread pass behind the bar ci 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.290
 let's get rid of the thread 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.780
 take the thread and make a point 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.290
 base point behind the bar and we do the 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.340
 point 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:33.120
 we carry the trusty before us pass behind 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.540
 the bar we get rid of the thread we take 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:42.660
 the thread we pass in the last point 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:46.530
 point we normally do it as in 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.500
 almost all the processes 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.770
 we have all the points pulled up 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.280
 now let's do a usual return line 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:03.810
 we pass only one point first and from here 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:08.430
 we pass two points at a time we do 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:13.820
 all our points in this way 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:18.690
 we have created points that are one 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:22.620
 a straight bar as in all 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.920
 base point machining that would be 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.799
 like this the other is a bar with 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.940
 the bottom the knot so this is the 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.549
 truth all straight 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.209
 this is the bar with knot now 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:39.060
 all we have to do is alternate 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.620
 these processes where we find the 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.140
 straight bar 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.049
 we must make the point that creates the 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.709
 nonino and where we find the point with 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.060
 nodino we must make the straight point 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.870
 so here we have no 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.989
 no dino we have to pass the 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.310
 front thread pass behind the bar ci 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:05.310
 let's get rid of the thread and make the point 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.650
 here we have the knot we do 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.769
 simply the basic point to create 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.670
 a straight bar here we have the 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:16.120
 straight bar we pass the thread in front of us 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.329
 let's go behind the point 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:24.040
 we get rid of the thread we take the thread 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:27.280
 let's move on to the basic point point behind the 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.660
 barra we take the thread we pass in front 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.000
 the wire 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.720
 let's go behind the bar we get rid of 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.750
 thread we take the thread we pass we do 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.490
 the normal point point because here 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.720
 there were dino so now we do it 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.080
 straight ahead 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.370
 here there is no modino we take the trust 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.160
 we pass it in front 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.070
 let's turn the bar we get rid of 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:57.970
 thread we take the thread we pass it under 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:05:01.120
 the normal straight point account since 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.180
 so there I was at the modino we take the thread 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.979
 we pass it in front of us we get rid of 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:12.190
 thread we take it 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:16.030
 let's move on to the point now let's do another 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:23.430
 basic point I do 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:28.349
 the last point and a chain closure 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.349
 and two points at a time 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:39.880
 we have seen the execution of the point 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.860
 honeycomb with Tunisian crochet 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.870
 the final effect is very pleasant 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.080
 made more compactly can be 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.280
 used for fabrics for processing 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.020
 more rigid 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.600
 otherwise it can be done with a 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.880
 larger and crochet is used 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.380
 also to make meshes of things 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.390
 softer 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:07.990
 this is the final effect of the honeycomb 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:07.990
 very simple hello to all good work
