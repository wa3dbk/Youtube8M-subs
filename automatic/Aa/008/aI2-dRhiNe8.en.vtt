00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.020
 she is 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.130
 the waves know the united state 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.049
 exam 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.369
 changes changing every year 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:13.579
 Naturally that should have come 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:15.249
 the next day 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:17.199
 that's what's traditional in so much 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.400
 cardinal changes i 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.060
 I can only assume 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.699
 we all know that 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.189
 so its part and are called part 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.390
 harvest 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.429
 m 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.429
 it seems to me 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.840
 I want wine here as well 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.180
 practicing teacher say yourself 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.180
 and then not always 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.839
 she is very 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.839
 bulk 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.220
 the new year is tremendous 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.700
 number of tasks 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.030
 and there it is very 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.969
 big cork is saturated with this 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.220
 practice intervention 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.370
 percentage of m floor children who study 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.720
 in specialized classes 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.720
 sometimes it seems that does not happen 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.789
 I will give a simple example to the question 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.350
 me 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.440
 62 question is not for us 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.330
 one girl got 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
 when playing 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.190
 if you make a mistake 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.810
 and second 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.890
 have a job 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.980
 he fears so to speak I can't but 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.239
 saw 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.239
 here are some 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.109
 it helps to get quality education 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:21.959
 stiskin 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.709
 metal community and 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.709
 governmental relatively 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:28.200
 to the question regarding 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.200
 changes occur and 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.249
 she knows all the days 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:53.709
 every year we believe that he is 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:54.639
 will change 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.169
 I calmly relate to this but on 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.099
 our practice ever cardinal 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.359
 changes 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.379
 on the fact that any cardinal 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.419
 changes we surely need to be lit 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.219
 probably need 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.219
 at least a year to 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:18.539
 there what 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.519
 children started this information 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:36.169
 describe the claim 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:38.759
 analyze cisco with which 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:39.869
 text 

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:42.039
 and even five years later 

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:45.039
 supply has changed chile format 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:52.799
 long they are possible to change 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.799
 in the moment 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:58.429
 separately 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.429
 technique 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.309
 if everything is there now and 

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:17.309
 parts 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.710
 plead a circle of task 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.710
 because firstly 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.759
 the percentage is possibly so similar 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:44.960
 transformed 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.960
 in two 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:57.439
 his 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:01.599
 grandson 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:04.599
 we should be saving savings 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.250
 and that it will be easier to adapt as on 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:15.319
 actually has something there 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.319
 the children are already finished 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:24.629
 and can't read the assignments 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.909
 of course it will be harder at 10 25 per annum 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:44.779
 if on pages next five years ii 

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:47.399
 on rides works which 

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:48.710
 could reveal 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:49.819
 possibility or impossibility 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:51.800
 joining children 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.819
 and we have a stronger opportunity to score 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:57.030
 necessary 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.030
 you can get rid of 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:06.819
 here but by itself that any 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.580
 the changes we are having in the world 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.789
 aim to 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.789
 good to see our green light worth 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:22.289
 output status changes
