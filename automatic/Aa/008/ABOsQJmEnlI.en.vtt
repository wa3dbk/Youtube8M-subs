00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
of jumps forward which a lot of them do

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.289 
of jumps forward which a lot of them do
when<00:02:31.739> they're<00:02:31.890> trying<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.220> block<00:02:32.519> a<00:02:32.580> shot<00:02:32.790> they

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
sideways into the path and that's what

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.789 
sideways into the path and that's what
makes<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.269> illegal<00:02:39.599> and<00:02:40.019> there's<00:02:40.349> a<00:02:40.410> few<00:02:40.620> other

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.229 
okay okay let's take a look at it here
and<00:03:28.200> we<00:03:28.260> have<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.530> on<00:03:28.680> screen<00:03:28.919> here<00:03:29.280> so<00:03:29.519> we<00:03:30.060> got

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
and we have it on screen here so we got

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.420 
and we have it on screen here so we got
the<00:03:30.389> drive<00:03:30.630> to<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.930> basket<00:03:31.139> so<00:03:31.410> we're<00:03:32.010> looking

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
the drive to the basket so we're looking

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.360 
the drive to the basket so we're looking
again<00:03:32.599> when<00:03:33.599> does<00:03:33.840> all<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.079> people<00:03:34.440> start<00:03:34.980> his

again when does all the people start his

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.780 
again when does all the people start his
upward<00:03:35.970> shooting<00:03:36.720> motion<00:03:36.959> is<00:03:37.319> Paul<00:03:38.040> Pierce<00:03:38.519> at

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
upward shooting motion is Paul Pierce at

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.030 
upward shooting motion is Paul Pierce at
the<00:03:39.139> position<00:03:40.139> okay

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
the position okay

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.030 
the position okay
so<00:03:41.250> right<00:03:41.639> about<00:03:42.000> here<00:03:42.060> he<00:03:42.660> starts<00:03:43.079> up<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.500> Paul

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
so right about here he starts up so Paul

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.780 
so right about here he starts up so Paul
Pierce<00:03:44.459> is<00:03:44.700> his<00:03:45.599> body<00:03:45.930> directly<00:03:46.410> in<00:03:46.859> the<00:03:47.549> path

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
Pierce is his body directly in the path

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.670 
Pierce is his body directly in the path
of<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.329> shooter<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.930> answer<00:03:49.260> is<00:03:49.440> yes

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
of the shooter and the answer is yes

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.860 
of the shooter and the answer is yes
even<00:03:50.459> though<00:03:50.639> he<00:03:51.090> was<00:03:51.239> slightly<00:03:51.510> in<00:03:51.780> the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
even though he was slightly in the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.809 
even though he was slightly in the
restricted<00:03:52.230> area<00:03:52.590> right<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.190> next<00:03:53.370> area

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
restricted area right the next area

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.140 
restricted area right the next area
we're<00:03:53.940> looking<00:03:54.299> at<00:03:54.450> does<00:03:54.959> pole<00:03:55.380> jump<00:03:56.150> vertical

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
we're looking at does pole jump vertical

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.059 
we're looking at does pole jump vertical
mm-hmm<00:03:57.660> okay<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.230> I<00:03:58.290> think<00:03:58.500> from<00:03:58.620> this<00:03:58.769> angle

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
mm-hmm okay and I think from this angle

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.129 
mm-hmm okay and I think from this angle
you're<00:03:59.760> going<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.030> see<00:04:00.239> Paul<00:04:00.780> jumps

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
you're going to see Paul jumps

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.680 
you're going to see Paul jumps
relatively<00:04:01.769> vertical<00:04:01.980> until<00:04:02.910> that<00:04:03.090> contact

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
relatively vertical until that contact

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.539 
relatively vertical until that contact
comes<00:04:03.959> which<00:04:04.200> knocked<00:04:04.530> him<00:04:04.769> over<00:04:04.799> to<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.310> side

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
comes which knocked him over to the side

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.729 
comes which knocked him over to the side
and<00:04:05.730> backwards<00:04:06.209> a<00:04:06.359> little<00:04:06.389> bit<00:04:06.690> so<00:04:07.200> that<00:04:07.230> is<00:04:07.709> a

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
and backwards a little bit so that is a

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.050 
and backwards a little bit so that is a
legal<00:04:08.700> defensive<00:04:09.690> play<00:04:09.930> by<00:04:10.230> Paul<00:04:10.829> Pierce<00:04:11.060> all

illegal anywhere on the court as long as

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.890 
illegal anywhere on the court as long as
you<00:04:20.669> are<00:04:20.849> at<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.329> spot

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
you are at the spot

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.680 
you are at the spot
prior<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.919> upward<00:04:23.280> motion<00:04:23.789> and<00:04:24.090> you<00:04:24.390> jump

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
prior to the upward motion and you jump

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.140 
prior to the upward motion and you jump
vertical<00:04:25.289> you're<00:04:25.950> in<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.130> legal<00:04:26.370> positions

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
vertical you're in a legal positions

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.840 
vertical you're in a legal positions
so<00:04:27.210> it<00:04:27.479> should<00:04:27.900> not<00:04:27.930> be<00:04:28.290> a<00:04:28.430> blocking<00:04:29.430> foul<00:04:29.610> now

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
so it should not be a blocking foul now

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.939 
so it should not be a blocking foul now
you<00:04:29.910> still<00:04:30.090> have<00:04:30.240> two<00:04:30.360> other<00:04:30.510> choices<00:04:30.860> you<00:04:31.860> can

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
you still have two other choices you can

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.400 
you still have two other choices you can
have<00:04:32.100> a<00:04:32.130> no<00:04:32.340> call<00:04:32.639> or<00:04:33.150> an<00:04:33.210> offensive<00:04:33.720> foul<00:04:33.900> but

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
have a no call or an offensive foul but

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.379 
have a no call or an offensive foul but
so<00:04:34.949> that<00:04:34.979> basically<00:04:35.340> is<00:04:35.580> three<00:04:35.910> calls<00:04:36.150> that

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
so that basically is three calls that

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:37.580 
so that basically is three calls that
you<00:04:36.479> guys<00:04:36.690> are<00:04:36.900> looking<00:04:36.990> to<00:04:37.199> make<00:04:37.380> your
