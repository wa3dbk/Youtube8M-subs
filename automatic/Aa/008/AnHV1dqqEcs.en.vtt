00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.519
 hello girls that such welcome in the 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.259
 channel I hope you are very well 

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:09.080
 You can put it on this occasion 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.300
 I bring this look that is the same as 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.760
 had in the favorite video of 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.970
 February is a very simple look very 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.529
 neutral can be combined with almost 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.109
 Any color of clothes is pretty 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.380
 favorable for those people who 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.869
 they have eyes in green coffee tones and 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.970
 the truth is that it looks very nice it seems 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.519
 elaborated but it's not for nothing are 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.530
 three umbrellas of different color 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.570
 you can get them in your 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.890
 collection so good is super 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.540
 easy to remember that all 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.700
 products that I use I'll leave them in 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.080
 the information box expandable if you 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.030
 liked this video so remember that 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.330
 share it with your friends so that 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.040
 have them this look advice and 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.230
 this idea to leave your house quickly 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.720
 So, well, let's go completely with the 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.300
 tutorial and already start applying a little 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.450
 test is used of which is the nix 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.940
 hd high definition and now I'm going to 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.220
 proceed to apply this umbrella 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.380
 here is cost sense and is a hot 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.049
 because it 's the 07 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.079
 although now they have other versions 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.960
 that is, they are called different but good 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:17.390
 to explain this a tone like between 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.049
 coffee with a bit of brick like 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.890
 nothing here is here and I'm going to apply it in 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.890
 all the eyelid mobile 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.670
 in the next color it will be this 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.490
 it's also a hotspot and it's s 10 is in 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.860
 finished and mary is a tone between lead 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.410
 with a touch of gray with a touch of 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.510
 green is very very interesting this 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.450
 color but you can replace it with 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.800
 a gray tone my tone lead and I'll 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.800
 apply in the basin 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.440
 basically these two are going to be the 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.440
 only colors that I will use 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.440
 it diffuses very well 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.080
 I will pass the first color lightly 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.080
 on top of this lead color 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.280
 and with a brush a little more precise 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.870
 it's super small I'm going to use this 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.870
 lead color on the corner 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.989
 to give it more depth 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.300
 and again I pass to blur 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.350
 and to illuminate the arch of the eyebrow I'm going to 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.850
 use this jordan shadow since it is 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.850
 a vanilla tone is the mate 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.319
 for the part of the animal I will use 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:33.030
 this shadow that is a golden with much 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:35.340
 shine is a diesel hotspot that 29 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.600
 and then use on the lacrimal to 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.230
 give more openness to the look 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.730
 I really like to give this touch because 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.480
 Visually I am separated more 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.340
 the eyes that do not look so close together and with 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.180
 this same thin brush I'm going to 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.110
 use 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.520
 the first color 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.000
 this here I will use it in the 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.000
 downstairs 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.239
 all over the lash line 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.150
 basically it's all girls is very very 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.540
 simple very easy I will use 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:21.370
 coffee eyeliner within the line of 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.370
 water and this is jordan 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.420
 it's a matte coffee 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.710
 to the top line I will use the 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.360
 vissum plugin and I'm going to make a line 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.870
 a little thick so it looks good 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.870
 checked 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.610
 I'm going to check the tab 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.920
 and I'm going to apply the rate of increase of 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.920
 change 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.130
 the labial I will use the same as 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.160
 use in the video that was this 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:48.860
 look that are of the line ultimate color 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.860
 It is a very beautiful orange color 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.330
 I'm going to apply it, I'm just not going to 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.330
 delineate or anything 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.310
 Well, that would be the complete makeup 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:06.370
 you can replace this lipstick with 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.470
 Anyone else that pleases even 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.300
 also a glitter or if you do not want 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.039
 use some color and leave it longer 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.289
 neutral, well, it's also his 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:16.690
 preference remember that if you liked it 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.129
