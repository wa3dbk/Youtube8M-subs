00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 memorization technique a service the 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.870
 school or small apprenticeships 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.880
 words of personal presentation school j 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.299
 join an education description 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.529
 national on the court this half-breed and I'm 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.590
 am specialized in the techniques of 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.439
 memorization and today I'm doing some 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.320
 tools to help me memorize 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.670
 in all areas at school 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.250
 application spelling as well as 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.669
 words the grammatical rules again 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.219
 the conjugation terminations then this 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.480
 this interest this desire to fuck in 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.360
 memorization techniques is me 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.010
 come even while I was still 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.860
 school teacher come out of this 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.570
 frustration that I will go to shared space his 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.160
 frustration but for the needs of 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.770
 Children who have difficulties 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.110
 break up and be a little bit helpless 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.079
 to help them in this process 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.120
 so compared to this frustration I 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.100
 I'm interested 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.710
 precisely to memorization techniques 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.189
 I did research in different 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.659
 areas I wanted to present 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.760
 so that's what I wanted to tell you 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.710
 before a departure from a management route 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.700
 so this morning I'm going to share the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.070
 sewers so prioritization strategies 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.689
 to help you concretely to remedy 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.689
 to memorization difficulties 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.500
 I told you firemen these tools which 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.479
 the first is that he was finishing that passes 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.700
 phillips and multi madam ticket in hand 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.520
 and memorizing notifications 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.620
 to borrow 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.800
 my approach is proud to bring you this 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:46.050
 morning concrete inputs for 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:49.590
 the spelling cited the bad ones are 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.120
 also registered so to create all 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.430
 these things I'm inspiring but I 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.340
 take information from 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.890
 four specific areas of information 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.270
 first I slip the last 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.760
 repechage in the field of 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.200
 neuroscience 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.910
 I also believe information from 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.869
 planning the mental management I got 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.430
 trained in the field of management 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.690
 mental third source of information 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:16.170
 and there it was a discovery for you 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.150
 this is the year the world championships 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.459
 of memorization must know how to sort to all 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.000
 the years the world championships of 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.500
 memorizing 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.900
 the true followers of people's memory 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.810
 shop passion to multiply their 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.850
 memory capabilities so by 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.930
 example a test in these 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.330
 world championships memorization 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.220
 it is to be able again targeted in 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.230
 only a few minutes and hundreds 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.730
 slap is probably the number in 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.769
 few minutes what is absolutely 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.870
 impossible if we do not use 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.640
 editing technique ci people there are 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.260
 able to do this using 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.630
 real strategies and judgment of a 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.830
 stream 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.680
 we inspire to adapt to 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.960
 learning on the legs everything to 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.900
 does ordinary as you and I know 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.820
 we need to develop our discussions yet 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.250
 once it's a mental technical tool 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.550
 will appear beginning of the north while at 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.840
 to hide even occasion between the 4th and 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.840
 last source of information very 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.260
 active it's a person it's daniel 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.300
 thanet I will not return you this is 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.530
 someone who recognized by the 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.500
 scientific community as being a 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.550
 genius ie that the tablet is 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.830
 with particular autism the cup 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.530
 strong stone pattern that's called 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.420
 also the scholarly record that gives him 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.630
 naturally computing abilities 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.980
 mental and mobilizations absolutely 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.240
 phenomenal 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.700
 the gait of 1 km to the east really 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.510
 interesting because it shares with 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.340
 everyone and create your brain a 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.380
 mulled wine with the idea of ​​being conserved 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.610
 effectively increase the capacity of 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.980
 memorization chosen paths 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.350
 particular to really memorize 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.290
 effectively and sustainably and well his 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.019
 shared idea about the world that all the 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.300
 world can derive benefits for 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.790
 his own life and me what interests me 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.830
 especially we can put it in the service 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.830
 learning still spoken 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:15.240
 specifically this morning program we 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.070
 let's go see the four keys of our 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.859
 brain for effective memorization 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.200
 because his four rooms 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.620
 the information for could not present their 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.750
 science 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.960
 I surely have technical talent of 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.490
 world champions of memorization and 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.980
 brain of young people from the delta med 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:36.330
 gym and all that in coherence and I have 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.710
 guarantee keys to adapt to all 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.930
 areas in your own life 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.380
 personal and so that these four 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.180
 replicas I'll introduce them to you 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.680
 then from these small 4 kg 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.500
 experience of his lot to memorize 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.570
 ten lots very quickly and 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.630
 durably in the said in these four 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.630
 country 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.650
 then the banks will pass on 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.230
 concrete about things that interest l 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.669
 school learning so we'll see 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.070
 how you can use this framework 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:09.300
 dreamed to memorize the tables of 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:11.970
 multiplication the digital suite 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.440
 when I try to adapt normally 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.360
 this lecture was adapted on the 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.220
 top site of cycle 3 and knowing that they 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.510
 had all the teachers of six 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.490
 killers tried to bring in some 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.940
 concrete contributions to respond to 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.340
 concerns also your daily in 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:30.050
 cyclo so we'll see how can we 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:33.240
 help memorize the digital suite 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.979
 we will see in a third time 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.230
 how to help memorize 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:41.090
 the lexical spelling of words 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.970
 and we will then see the memorization 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.350
 rules of the medical art about a 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.000
 example the very grand prize with a pot 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:52.130
 with the difficult words like the 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 obviously outside and we'll finish 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:59.270
 not actually give leads 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.880
 concrete memorized our call yet 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.020
 once to come back but on six points 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.270
 here to bring elements 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.200
 unlike knowing that because I 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.060
 compose but you also have 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.920
 certainly concerns and 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.240
 shock and do not deserve maurice 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.610
 is in place you will not hesitate 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.370
 interrupt me and ask questions to 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.440
 say here is this or that area 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.050
 how can we do it and there we 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.540
 can think together to answer these 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.930
 questions I would not have 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.930
 fully
