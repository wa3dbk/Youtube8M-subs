00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:33.120
 x-men comic strip of a reality 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.469
 Alternatively happened this scene where the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.360

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.899

 cause of you because the staff and asked 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.309
 my opinion on this history of 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.680
 Next wolverine would be this video that 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.059
 I did last year 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.129
 talking in games or standing in the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.530
 popular culture recently brought 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.470
 to the gay cause is again afloat in the marvel 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.720
 comics or gay marriage between the north 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.500
 store polar star first if not 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.210
 in Portuguese 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.650
 He married the car something. 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.350
 I know you're the long-term boyfriend . 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.900
 date and this marriage was the cover of 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.900
 a recent issue of the x men 's magazine 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.619
 the comics dc not to be behind and 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.860
 decided to transform one of the characters 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.170
 her classics in gay also the coca them 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.150
 is the original green lantern was revealed 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.890
 now that he is gay he has a boyfriend 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.780
 kiss in the mouth smoke more at night 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.030
 character will search for nobody 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.610
 connects a former member of the fifth category 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.259
 evans scott a green antenna run 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.720
 40 years ago nobody cares 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.329
 nor are there fans of the student choose you fan 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.329
 her cosme pardon does not exist and I found 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.130
 means that it is weak and not because they 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.189
 want to polemize they want to change the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.890
 things want to increase the diversity of 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.390
 his character pantheon I can 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.979
 to speak thus only in truth when 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.229
 pick up the search character to start 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.240
 door to try to bring controversy to 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.710
 cause such controversy is one thing 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.119
 very easy to do the galley a lot 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.370
 easy to catch a character who can 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.800
 can change the face that way because 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.380
 Last 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.930
 however the marvel and DC scenario 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.000
 the same would get batman for example 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.340
 the wolverine speak so out of nowhere that the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.950
 Guys are gay there, yes. 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.510
 so in this video I approached the question of 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.520
 homosexual heroes 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.710
 And then how did you see I said it's too much? 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.780
 easy it simply catch on a hero 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.620
 that nobody cares how north store 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.440
 us ex man or the owner's green lantern 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.570
 or green lantern scott student is 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.340
 very easy very comfortable until I would say 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.590
 catch those heroes who do not care 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.410
 nobody is a fan nobody cares anyway 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.090
 make them gay in case I know again 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.620
 that our history he has been gay since 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.370
 But you know I want it. 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.890
 tell 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.990
 marvel brought the subject up in the year 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.970
 when our story got married 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.740
 with his boyfriend as you see in the 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.530
 video I said that I find it very comfortable 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.350
 It's almost cowardly until you do this type. 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.390
 of controversy but using characters 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.890
 bushes that nobody cares about and 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.500
 I said I wanted to see if he put it on. 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.110
 a main character a character 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.420
 famous character full of fans and 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.040
 put that crazy man to give his ass and 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.230
 this power of the brand was so great that they 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.600
 did the two things they got 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.430
 simultaneously a character full of 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.739
 fans but who is at the same time a 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.270
 character with cones matters because it is a 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.330
 wolverine of an alternative reality 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.760
 is not the real wolverine so look 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.340
 this shame they benefit from the 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.380
 two ways first they get a 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.660
 immense attention because they are 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.670
 becoming a main character of the 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.930
 line of them homosexual 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.239
 only at the same time it is not a 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.890
 main character because it is a 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.650
 wolverine of an alternative reality 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.150
 from a parallel dimension they end up 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.620
 benefiting from two things 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.750
 they do not need to make such a 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.220
 big in their universe but call it all 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.040
 that tension to make a character 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.440
 big homosexual now look what 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.070
 that this government and the former team 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.989
 maxmen 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.790
 he was already gay what they did 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.950
 has simply been placed more 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.170
 of the magazine and I imagine that 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.140
 main intention is clear controversy 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.109
 which has a background of pants activism 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.790
 I believe that a good part of the 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.890
 motivation to do some kind of thing 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.859
 bring the gay public that does not 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.599
 shown in 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.520
 comics do not see the truth in 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:27.800
 practically no media can count on 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.719
 the movies you watch series that 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.759
 Do you watch the books the books? 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:33.860
 almost all the main characters of 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:36.169
 all these media are heterosexual then 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.759
 gay people do not see each other much, they do not 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.340
 they see a lot in the media that they consume 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.199
 so I think it's nice to bring this 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.330
 staff bring some of the reality 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:46.370
 from these people to the comic books but 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.069
 At the same time I'm a very skeptical guy. 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.830
 I think so if I were to measure myself 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:53.780
 I say 70% is more motivation 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.819
 selling by dressing through controversy the 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.189
 What do you think of that, do you think? 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:00.169
 many said that it is unnecessary for you 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:02.270
 do you think it's cool or you're shitting 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.159
 for this because it is a wolverine of a 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.139
 alternative reality same as always 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:08.270
 please enter the comments here 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.490
 Underneath I have not read the comic book yet. 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.650
 accompany the former team to be honest I 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.759
 I do not like x men, you see back there. 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.740
 ok here 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:18.050
 this is my collection of Seoul or 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.689
 civil war in hell I bought all 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:24.110
 I bought even the x men and I never read 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:25.580
 this shit because I do not like x men 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.990
 So although I do not like it here at all. 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.789
 even though it's ironic because I like to 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.169
 Last December fucking on colossus tv 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.089
 but I do not like the comic but I 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.009
 I'll read at least so I can give it to you later. 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:35.900
 of my impressions that way. 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.669
 necessary was nice story 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.589
 because without having gone to history I 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.300
 I can not say much I can not give 

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:43.009
 a perfectly grounded opinion 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.050
 let's say more talk without knowing what 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.699
 is talking never stopped me from speaking 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.710
 nothing that the internet then leaf is in 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:50.539
 My opinion I think it's cool I 'm going 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.460
 talk without integrity and nice story 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:53.479
 This is it, and I want to know what you 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.250
 found 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.169
 put the comments in low click 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.150
 in the ladybug sign up do that 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.889
 stop to this and to staff the week 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.449
 comes 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:04.629
 ignore that part that was the making off 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.629
 after
