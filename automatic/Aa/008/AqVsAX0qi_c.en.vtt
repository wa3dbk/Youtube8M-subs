not<00:02:04.590> wearing<00:02:04.860> any<00:02:05.040> makeup<00:02:05.310> which<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.670> such<00:02:06.510> a

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
not wearing any makeup which is such a

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.780 
not wearing any makeup which is such a
compliment<00:02:07.020> because<00:02:07.290> my<00:02:07.770> skin<00:02:08.010> isn't<00:02:08.220> the

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
compliment because my skin isn't the

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.940 
compliment because my skin isn't the
best<00:02:09.030> um<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.170> would<00:02:10.470> definitely<00:02:10.500> recommend

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
best um so I would definitely recommend

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.000 
best um so I would definitely recommend
trying<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.150> out<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.780> does<00:02:13.260> give<00:02:13.590> more<00:02:13.800> like<00:02:13.980> a

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
trying this out it does give more like a

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.740 
trying this out it does give more like a
medium<00:02:14.580> coverage<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.180> sometimes<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.570> have<00:02:15.690> to

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
medium coverage and sometimes I have to

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.960 
medium coverage and sometimes I have to
go<00:02:15.870> back<00:02:15.900> through<00:02:16.290> my<00:02:16.380> spot<00:02:17.040> treat<00:02:17.670> some<00:02:17.940> of

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
go back through my spot treat some of

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.230 
go back through my spot treat some of
the<00:02:18.240> blemishes<00:02:18.630> with<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:20.160> little<00:02:20.430> side<00:02:20.640> but

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
the blemishes with this little side but

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.240

and it is a lip liner and the only

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.740 
and it is a lip liner and the only
reason<00:05:15.120> I<00:05:15.419> bought<00:05:15.630> this<00:05:15.690> was<00:05:16.500> because<00:05:16.770> of<00:05:17.750> the

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
reason I bought this was because of the

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.080 
reason I bought this was because of the
two<00:05:18.960> colors<00:05:19.229> I<00:05:19.860> thought<00:05:20.460> I<00:05:20.520> kind<00:05:20.820> of<00:05:20.880> had<00:05:21.060> to

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
two colors I thought I kind of had to

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.149 
two colors I thought I kind of had to
line<00:05:21.389> my<00:05:21.570> lips<00:05:21.840> so<00:05:22.289> that<00:05:22.500> it<00:05:22.590> wouldn't<00:05:22.800> believe

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159 
line my lips so that it wouldn't believe

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:25.040 
line my lips so that it wouldn't believe
but<00:05:23.220> I'm<00:05:23.520> glad<00:05:23.789> I<00:05:23.880> did<00:05:24.030> end<00:05:24.419> up<00:05:24.599> picking<00:05:24.750> it<00:05:24.930> up

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
but I'm glad I did end up picking it up

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.920 
but I'm glad I did end up picking it up
I<00:05:25.169> think<00:05:25.229> this<00:05:25.380> is<00:05:25.440> also<00:05:25.860> 499<00:05:26.400> um<00:05:26.880> and<00:05:27.720> this

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
I think this is also 499 um and this

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.560 
I think this is also 499 um and this
isn't<00:05:28.139> natural<00:05:28.889> it<00:05:29.310> goes<00:05:29.789> with<00:05:30.030> both<00:05:30.270> of<00:05:30.300> the

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
isn't natural it goes with both of the

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.330 
isn't natural it goes with both of the
shade<00:05:30.810> so<00:05:31.020> if<00:05:31.110> I<00:05:31.169> want<00:05:31.289> to<00:05:31.380> use<00:05:31.500> a<00:05:31.530> nude<00:05:31.830> I<00:05:32.099> put

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
shade so if I want to use a nude I put

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.339 
shade so if I want to use a nude I put
this<00:05:32.490> color<00:05:32.789> on<00:05:33.030> or<00:05:33.300> the<00:05:33.479> Euro<00:05:33.659> trash<00:05:34.020> and<00:05:34.289> it

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
this color on or the Euro trash and it

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.649 
this color on or the Euro trash and it
goes<00:05:34.530> absolutely<00:05:34.919> well<00:05:35.610> with<00:05:36.030> both<00:05:36.270> of<00:05:36.300> them

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659 
goes absolutely well with both of them

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:38.420 
goes absolutely well with both of them
and<00:05:36.930> it<00:05:37.320> really<00:05:37.500> helps<00:05:37.889> sometimes<00:05:38.070> if<00:05:38.310> i<00:05:38.370> do

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
and it really helps sometimes if i do

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.300 
and it really helps sometimes if i do
want<00:05:38.699> to<00:05:38.729> do<00:05:38.880> like<00:05:39.030> the<00:05:39.270> fuller<00:05:39.570> lips<00:05:40.310> like

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
want to do like the fuller lips like

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.219 
want to do like the fuller lips like
kylie<00:05:41.729> jenner<00:05:42.000> I'll<00:05:42.240> line<00:05:42.510> my<00:05:42.690> lips<00:05:42.840> just<00:05:43.080> a

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
kylie jenner I'll line my lips just a

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:46.640 
kylie jenner I'll line my lips just a
little<00:05:43.530> bit<00:05:43.710> outside<00:05:44.070> of<00:05:44.909> the<00:05:45.810> natural<00:05:46.050> line

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
little bit outside of the natural line

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.379 
little bit outside of the natural line
and<00:05:47.010> I<00:05:47.070> think<00:05:47.310> that<00:05:47.460> this<00:05:47.610> looks<00:05:47.849> really<00:05:48.120> good

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
and I think that this looks really good

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.460 
and I think that this looks really good
and<00:05:48.449> so<00:05:48.840> it's<00:05:49.770> probably<00:05:50.099> not<00:05:50.639> necessary<00:05:51.260> but<00:05:52.260> I

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
and so it's probably not necessary but I

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.960 
and so it's probably not necessary but I
picked<00:05:52.740> it<00:05:52.889> up<00:05:52.979> and<00:05:53.190> I'm<00:05:53.310> really<00:05:53.460> glad<00:05:53.610> I<00:05:53.729> did

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
picked it up and I'm really glad I did

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.480 
picked it up and I'm really glad I did
so<00:05:54.840> my<00:05:54.990> last<00:05:55.169> favorite<00:05:55.500> is<00:05:55.800> a<00:05:55.860> book<00:05:56.130> and<00:05:56.370> I<00:05:56.430> know

their lives and kind it kind of just
puts<00:06:44.300> into<00:06:44.449> perspective<00:06:44.690> the<00:06:45.500> time<00:06:46.070> that<00:06:46.370> we

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
puts into perspective the time that we

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.240 
puts into perspective the time that we
have<00:06:46.789> with<00:06:47.240> one<00:06:47.509> another<00:06:47.539> and<00:06:48.139> how<00:06:48.919> little

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
have with one another and how little

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.189 
have with one another and how little
that<00:06:49.610> time<00:06:49.940> is<00:06:50.180> because<00:06:50.419> the<00:06:50.690> only<00:06:50.900> absolute

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 
that time is because the only absolute

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:54.999 
that time is because the only absolute
in<00:06:51.770> life<00:06:52.009> is<00:06:52.340> death<00:06:52.970> and<00:06:53.330> so<00:06:54.199> it<00:06:54.470> kind<00:06:54.680> of<00:06:54.770> hits

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:55.009 
in life is death and so it kind of hits

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:57.189 
in life is death and so it kind of hits
home<00:06:55.220> because<00:06:55.550> i'm<00:06:55.669> a<00:06:55.699> twin<00:06:56.000> but<00:06:56.509> i<00:06:56.570> think<00:06:56.960> even

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 
home because i'm a twin but i think even

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:58.570

if you're not at one you could really

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.390 
if you're not at one you could really
take<00:06:58.970> some<00:06:59.300> key<00:06:59.479> points<00:06:59.720> from<00:06:59.990> it<00:07:00.440> i<00:07:00.740> actually
