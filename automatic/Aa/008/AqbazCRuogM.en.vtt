00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:20.289
 the win that showing part is done now 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.570
 to make a shrimp steak was 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:27.130
 but the dollar is worth because the 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.050
 our focus is the largest were already here not 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.339
 is the best since it is a shrimp 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:36.030
 frozen 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:38.289
 I want to be a little soft okay but I think 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.640
 that the easiest thing that has only 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.640
 It is difficult to speak of us 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:53.920
 will stay with dog shrimp later 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.860
 moral to whom I already told you will 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.140
 take 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.140
 will cut it has 16 fulfilled 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.540
 Okay , you're going to have two believers cried out. 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.850
 tried to make good choices 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.890
 okay it was a very small goal you 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.350
 can cut in half but usually 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.620
 by half of every right athlete to 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.220
 to do this was worth this quick practice 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.220
 Who liked the video I liked? 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.560
 Who is not if the channel is good? 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.740
 and we will follow the channel has been undone 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.720
 then in front are two steaks here 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.150
 notice that will only be peeling port 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.100
 in the middle with the cold, there you are then 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:42.259
 I hope to get the country material 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:48.160
 okay playing at home out already today 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.160
 It's okay, it's going to the video itself.
