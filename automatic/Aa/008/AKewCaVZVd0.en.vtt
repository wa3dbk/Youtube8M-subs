 description and today we are here with a 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.330

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.309

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.080
 credits as well as 2000 pivot points which 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.390
 but not or if you do n't remember them 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.400
 then scared to hear these speeches from 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.920
 intellectual people this voice a lot 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.420
 mature and with this beautiful little face 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.920
 because you know that I am beautiful 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.140
 even if you don't see me if you saw me 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.240
 you know that I am beautiful 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.390
 anyway call to the talk we start 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.640
 we open the first 100 thousand package 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.930
 credits hoping for something good e 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.379
 they are still intimate roof rarely 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.350
 then for two hours what it is then 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.920
 we try and we open and we don't find 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.840

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.469
 well well from the gentlemen we found a 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.489

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.820
 joke we found we found 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.710
 an iv 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.590
 here we have found a book then us 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.780
 we send to clubs maybe could in the event 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.739
 also unfortunately the review arrives 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.740
 I have no time 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.720
 lately i'm really taken with the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.220
 poop to the throat we still find siani 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.990
 as in the last package I think 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.299
 we also found those in the last one 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.320
 last pack opening package 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:24.080
 so very nice package let's see if 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.080
 had found some trans 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.880

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.970
 pale idea 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.000
 sturridge we send in the transfer list 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.390
 as well as fellini so because I want 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.189
 keep me and discard 13,000 credits 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.110
 in short, gentlemen after unpacking 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:51.530
 after opening a nice star we have 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.259
 open unpacked unified a black 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.720

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.700
 immediately hicks also in this and we find 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:05.600

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.000
 this time we don't find anything 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.239
 this opening package really makes me 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.340
 very very very very proud of me I have 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:24.019
 made other andry credits screw up 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.549
 but a ramires melo tendo higuain lo 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:30.200
 send the transfer list not having to 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:36.799
 take a thousand I keep it in my 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:40.040
 lap alex huntelaar bilic vucinic and a 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:42.470
 transfer is what I seem to have it 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.959
 seen badly we found a transfer 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.299
 one of the useless guys though 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.090
 this we refer to the transfer list 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:54.590
 let's see if 2000 is still podolski cai 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.230
 santana but very interesting companions 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.209
 in the rings of pleasure and above all of 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.829
 spirituality 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:05.709
 so this stuff is discarded here 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:07.489
 everything if we listen to everything we see if 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.340
 let's try 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.120
 we reject all this and yours 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.000
 joy 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.470
 there is no two without three and the fourth comes 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.400
 by itself we then open the last two 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.940
 7500 packets indeed since the creeds 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.430
 we have reopened them for 15,000 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.739
 as I always say 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.459
 there is no two without three the fourth comes from 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.680
 itself would be to write me in the comments 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.960
 if you know, continue this sentence 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.270
 meanwhile we find cleverley 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.160
 much of liverpool another 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.180
 transfair guys we're in the mood for 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.060
 transfer 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:49.010
 we live on the transfer list or one 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.570
 physical form our beloved forms 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:56.570

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.700
 mirza rainews coming out and we also send 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:02.000
 this contracts do not send because ne 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.620
 I have like 600 facts yesterday came gods 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.930
 friends play by me and asked me how 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.330
 have 600 contracts and we open 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.160
 the last package I put of 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.620

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:25.370
 behind we turn lewandowski gentlemen 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.730
 we found transfer ewandowski e 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:33.410
 lewandowski transfer is still worth 40 thousand 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:35.960
 I think lewandowski trans good guys is 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.090
 it was a little profitable opening 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.920
 because apart from these two we have 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.750
 found these two 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.330
 who is it that we have found alex Molto di 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.860
 self and lewandowski but lewandowski me 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.910

 so we send it to you instead we give you 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:07.040
 valentine account price comparison 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.500
 comparison at a price we see 17,000 a year 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.180
 this and that of Borussia at least there 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.170
 we were redone in the package 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.930
 any case 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:18.590
 and then we return to the list 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.360
 transfer this stuff here as at 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.490
