00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.009
 in our opportunity to learn 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.750
 we will learn about ordinal numbers 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:14.050
 and the dates 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.750
 well let's start we did first when 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.119
 we define the first dry place when 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.630
 we went to the second place true 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.240
 we built the third holtz we went 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.630
 the fourth shift we do not mean the 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.509
 fifth if we refer to the sixth 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.829
 how to remember almost the same 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.079
 structure that from the numbers 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.120
 simply add the th in the 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:41.040
 majority and in the first one it is added to the 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.040
 sct and in the second the nl 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:49.040
 we have the seventh place that would be event 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.480
 the 8th place that would be heights 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.079
 the name of the place that is in 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.559
 night 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.130
 the tenth that would be in the eleventh the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.250
 event 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.440
 the 12 water as you will always see in the 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.950
 pronunciation also that they end up with 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.170
 tea 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.450
 if it were a normal human we would say 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.880
 but since it is an ordinal number we say 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.880
 cents we always end people 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.150
 the 13 water would be surfing 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:26.510
 37 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:29.930
 the 21 6 twenty first from 22 to 30 second 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.159
 the 37 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.680
 always strict is the production 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:40.290
 always strict 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:45.290
 the 33 would be sirte york 40 sa 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.290
 fort 7 and the 100 would be hands 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.480
 good order them both we use it 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.110
 for dates as I explained for example 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.750
 we have December 25 this we can 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.520
 say it the following way 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.210
 December 36 using the numbers 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.750
 ordinals that we had previously 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:13.290
 we use for a very session 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.569
 specific when we speak we talk about them 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.910
 on floors of a building we can say 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.030
 of class 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.950
 and if that wave is a flower that means 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.950
 class is on the third floor 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.620
 I hope that has been advised and 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.620
 fun
