you guys ask about it but not this

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.189 
you guys ask about it but not this
weapon<00:00:50.160> now<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:51.239> does<00:00:51.390> come<00:00:51.600> with<00:00:51.629> quite<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> bit

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
weapon now it does come with quite a bit

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.860 
weapon now it does come with quite a bit
magazine<00:00:53.129> wise<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.820> fires<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.360> fast<00:00:54.629> and

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
magazine wise but it fires so fast and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.840 
magazine wise but it fires so fast and
takes<00:00:55.110> about<00:00:55.530> five<00:00:55.739> bolts<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.489> kill<00:00:56.640> them<00:00:56.789> to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
takes about five bolts to kill them to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.610 
takes about five bolts to kill them to
me<00:00:56.969> oh<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.480> will<00:00:57.690> go<00:00:57.840> through<00:00:57.870> your<00:00:58.140> your

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
me oh you will go through your your

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.740 
me oh you will go through your your
bullets<00:00:58.920> quickly<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.480> kind<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.660> a

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
bullets quickly so it's kind of a

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.450 
bullets quickly so it's kind of a
downside<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.320> run<00:01:01.559> out<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.710> bullets

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
downside is you run out of bullets

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.039 
downside is you run out of bullets
quickly<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.270> can't<00:01:03.449> actually<00:01:03.690> put<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
quickly and you can't actually put a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.570 
quickly and you can't actually put a
grip<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.530> gun<00:01:04.739> has<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.100> built-in<00:01:05.430> one

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
grip on this gun has a built-in one

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.170 
grip on this gun has a built-in one
which<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.420> recoil<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:06.990> very<00:01:07.590> low<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.310> it's

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
which the recoil is very low it's it's

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.539 
which the recoil is very low it's it's
not<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.080> hard<00:01:10.260> if<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.560> are<00:01:10.979> bad<00:01:11.189> at<00:01:11.220> control

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
not that hard if you are bad at control

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.010 
not that hard if you are bad at control
recoil<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.270> control<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.630> quite<00:01:12.840> well

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
recoil you can control this quite well

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.750 
recoil you can control this quite well
if<00:01:13.170> your<00:01:13.350> go<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.530> control<00:01:13.830> recoil<00:01:14.010> then<00:01:14.610> you're

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
if your go to control recoil then you're

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.609 
if your go to control recoil then you're
going<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> be<00:01:15.090> absolutely<00:01:15.720> dead<00:01:16.170> I've<00:01:16.290> at<00:01:16.439> this

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
going to be absolutely dead I've at this

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.130 
going to be absolutely dead I've at this
but<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:18.030> damage<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.479> quite<00:01:18.630> good<00:01:18.810> do<00:01:18.930> drop

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
but the damage is quite good do drop

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.980 
but the damage is quite good do drop
people<00:01:19.320> with<00:01:19.850> five<00:01:20.850> shots<00:01:21.180> maximum<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.869> then

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
people with five shots maximum and then

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.810 
people with five shots maximum and then
it'll<00:01:22.560> take<00:01:22.770> upwards<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.280> 989<00:01:24.060> minimum<00:01:24.869> and

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
it'll take upwards of 989 minimum and

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.890 
it'll take upwards of 989 minimum and
this<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.939> great<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.210> close<00:01:27.479> quarters<00:01:27.689> and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
this is great for close quarters and

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.780 
this is great for close quarters and
it's<00:01:28.259> actually<00:01:28.619> decent<00:01:28.979> at<00:01:29.340> medium<00:01:29.759> range

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
it's actually decent at medium range

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.700 
it's actually decent at medium range
even<00:01:30.270> though<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.570> some<00:01:30.930> machine<00:01:31.200> gun<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
even though it is some machine gun the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.020 
even though it is some machine gun the
medium<00:01:32.009> range<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.340> quite<00:01:32.610> well<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.150> and

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
medium range is quite well on it and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.719 
medium range is quite well on it and
sorry<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:37.020> magazine<00:01:37.439> extended<00:01:38.189> mags<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.460> think

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
sorry the magazine extended mags I think

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.789 
sorry the magazine extended mags I think
it<00:01:38.880> raises<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.479> up<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.720> 36<00:01:40.229> i'm<00:01:40.439> not<00:01:40.530> sure<00:01:40.770> but

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
it raises it up to 36 i'm not sure but

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.980 
it raises it up to 36 i'm not sure but
you<00:01:41.310> would<00:01:41.490> need<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.180> get<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.479> invest<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:42.869> it

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
you would need to get to invest in it

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.480

those<00:02:10.009> are<00:02:10.160> just<00:02:10.250> my<00:02:10.340> personal<00:02:10.819> favorites<00:02:11.209> but

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
those are just my personal favorites but

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.589 
those are just my personal favorites but
this<00:02:12.160> so<00:02:13.160> far<00:02:13.310> if<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.550> wasn't<00:02:13.819> it's<00:02:14.239> really

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
this so far if it wasn't it's really

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.089 
this so far if it wasn't it's really
worth<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:15.020> effort<00:02:15.110> if<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:15.680> think<00:02:15.800> about<00:02:15.950> it

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
worth the effort if you think about it

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.930 
worth the effort if you think about it
getting<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.380> tier<00:02:18.380> 4<00:02:18.590> in<00:02:18.709> 10<00:02:18.830> matches<00:02:19.010> it's

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
getting the tier 4 in 10 matches it's

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.790 
getting the tier 4 in 10 matches it's
really<00:02:20.390> worth<00:02:20.569> it<00:02:20.750> but<00:02:21.050> it's<00:02:21.230> very<00:02:21.560> difficult

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
really worth it but it's very difficult

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.440 
really worth it but it's very difficult
