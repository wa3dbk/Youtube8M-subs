00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
contact with the CPU and by the way the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.080 
contact with the CPU and by the way the
base<00:02:31.230> plate<00:02:31.470> on<00:02:31.710> this<00:02:31.860> is<00:02:32.070> very<00:02:32.400> smooth<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:32.820> it

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
base plate on this is very smooth so it

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.570 
base plate on this is very smooth so it
will<00:02:33.420> make<00:02:33.660> excellent<00:02:33.840> contact<00:02:34.740> with<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.040> CPU

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
will make excellent contact with the CPU

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.010 
will make excellent contact with the CPU
then<00:02:36.390> all<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:37.200> heat<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.770> basically<00:02:38.160> drawn<00:02:38.550> up

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
then all the heat is basically drawn up

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.050 
then all the heat is basically drawn up
by<00:02:40.020> all<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.440> heat<00:02:40.650> pipes<00:02:40.920> into<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.580> fins<00:02:41.850> and

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.380 
by all the heat pipes into the fins and
then<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:43.110> fins<00:02:43.410> dissipate<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.430> heat<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:45.120> by

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
then the fins dissipate the heat and by

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.360 
then the fins dissipate the heat and by
the<00:02:45.450> way<00:02:45.720> they<00:02:46.050> include<00:02:46.560> this<00:02:46.740> protective

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370

fan pop the clips through the holes and
then<00:03:39.330> just<00:03:39.720> attach<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:41.160> fan<00:03:41.460> to<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.690> heatsink

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.590 
then just attach the fan to the heatsink
like<00:03:43.620> so<00:03:43.950> do<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.370> same<00:03:44.580> thing<00:03:44.880> for<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.360> other

side and you can also move the fan up or

00:03:49.080 --> 00:04:12.520 
side and you can also move the fan up or
down<00:03:49.980> for<00:03:50.490> compatibility<00:03:51.240> reasons
