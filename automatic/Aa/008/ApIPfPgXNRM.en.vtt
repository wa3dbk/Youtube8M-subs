00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.210
 in a session 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.790
 and who normally have 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.269
 we know it in the form of one in every place that we realized 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.499
 it's about 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:13.499
 of the pacman game 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:18.570
 for the realization of this player we needed 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.659
 amended to 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:22.589
 worse this form 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.050
 a small mouth 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.599
 m annelies 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:26.849
 henkel we go the world 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.649
 closed for you his mouth continually continually 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.520
 we have legalize for tonight 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.550
 a clip 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.930
 the occurrence and the next 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.310
 so it's an animation 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.660
 image by image 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.600
 they involve 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.090
 3rd age plus 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.870
 and which consists of frontage le mans 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.720
 accomplish is closed 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.790
 the mouth 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.430
 in our body 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.640
 once finished and we have it is split the occurrence of this clip 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.920
 to equalize 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.870
 the four directions on the other hand anyway because we do it's a game 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.540
 which consists of 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.630
 control the movement 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.970
 of its heritage 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.840
 through the golden keys of the keyboard action 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.290
 the right key 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.100
 rotate our pack not even right 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.830
 the left key 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.100
 rotate it 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.230
 towards the left 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.160
 the layer touches it by tooth 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.630
 the devolo turns it 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.480
 and finally the touch per year 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.410
 makes it turn down so once one has created 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.480
 the four directions of our manna pack 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.620
 based 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.789
 of the first clip 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:41.590
 click opens and closes his mouth 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.890
 continually 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.770
 we did not tighten 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.310
 inscriptions he walks 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.770
 in the first image there which simply consist 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.460
 to stop at the head of the team because once on stage 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.930
 this occurrence it does not have to 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.100
 % move ie 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.080
 tour 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.530
 all the time we have to have 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.920
 a first departure 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.840
 the departure for pacman 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.589
 percent and is heading towards 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:10.630
 to the right 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.719
 hence the necessity 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:13.940
 dostom pay 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.579
 the reading head 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.579
 in the scenario of our side 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:26.589
 we will need dabo so she is here he is in the context of a tour 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:30.199
 it's a good invisible time 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.509
 because we do not want it to appear time our main stage 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:39.989
 finally just use it 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.390
 for programming our keyboard keys 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:48.709
 very well 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.109
 now 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.299
 we are going 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.559
 we will take a look at 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:57.079
 our script 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.819
 so I select my end of time 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.930
 p I open the parliament 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.649
 ap critical sense 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:06.899
 and as you can see 

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:10.179
 like it's a long time so we'll need a manager 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:11.459
 event 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.419
 an event manager who will control 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.199
 the deferential redirection key 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:18.979
 2 our keyboard 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:20.299
 the right key 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.879
 that is right right left key left 

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:27.019
 in parent 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.009
 so we have the possibility 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:30.350
 to program 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.899
 just a little while 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:32.809
 with 

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:34.429
 several managers 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:36.109
 every manager 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.109
 he controls the event well determined 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:44.449
 in the coma besides the users press the right key 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.049
 we must 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.739
 our displaced 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.489
 evra first keyframes 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.560
 others during his parents ie 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.829
 in the other object pacman 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.129
 whose occurrence it is called art 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.709
 because simply 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.180
 the right key 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.189
 turn it to the right 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:06.389
 lower 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.129
 allah the best he threw me 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.409
 when nani 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.489
 position 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.679
 I come back proscribed 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:17.370
 the same for you 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.859
 the green key 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.739
 she turns another object on the left 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.300
 and that corresponds 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.210
 at the second he threw me 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.560
 in the scenario 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.020
 from the other object 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.020
 the institute more 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.779
 the other two keys ap 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:37.409
 and the time 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:38.469
 if you like 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:40.419
 simple destruction 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.069
 allowing 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:48.309
 redirected the mans obliged either to the right or to the left his report to 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:51.309
 Roma either 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.479
 for which 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.189
 displacement 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:03.059
 for investments 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:07.150
 for moving because of nozal talent in changing 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.490
 the value' 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.529
 of the property it touches the object by 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:14.460
 but in a continuous way 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.990
 that is to say 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.240
 modest obi-1 sometimes the user 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.099
 he is not pressing the key 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:26.150
 any key for example the right key 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.629
 our object 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:30.349
 he has to move 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:32.520
 canteen and german 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.939
 help 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:38.189
 or arezzo dallest by ap because of a step forward 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:39.770
 when we call here 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.420
 or understood that it's called here b so it's a variable normally 

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:46.889
 in the main stage 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.930
 we gave an initial value to this variable d 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.159
 so when we see their wise 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.159
 so for every nice weather right vehicle 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:02.349
 the property they give themselves at the end I have a year and it will continue a sacred 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:03.689
 mounted 5 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:06.520
 so it's a variable 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.090
 it's the role of symbols 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.520
 more speculative not to say we're not going to add 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.310
 when you are born German the value 5 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.529
 at the property x2 no 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:19.760
 as long as the user and press 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.379
 the right key 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:23.020
 the same for the head 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.550
 but for lyon more in May - and instead of variability we did not 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.860
 mik a ride called g 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.300
 that is to say on the left 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.710
 archambault 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.849
 ebay to see 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:37.599
 we only read and there 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:40.189
 property paul high 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:43.360
 to show that sometimes we need 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.230
 to specify the showman 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.319
 that is to say 

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:49.789
 the ulm location where the variable is located 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:51.289
 in our project 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:53.300
 the other of the scene 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.569
 in May appealing that it targets variability 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:58.639
 we use the variability 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:06:59.689
 all the holes 

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:00.719
 secure 

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:01.539
 scene 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:03.629
 so at every click what is space 

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:06.089
 android move 

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:08.129
 to the position 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:09.419
 adequate 

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:11.619
 it all depends on the tight close touch 

00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:14.419
 more moving the envied 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:18.259
 is not praying the world in this course but which aims to propose 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:18.800
 texts 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.399
 be vertically 

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:23.399
 in this case use the property 

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:25.389
 the appointment 

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:26.819
 see you 

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:29.349
 or as a result of this workshop
