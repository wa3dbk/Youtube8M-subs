00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 and as they are, I hope they are 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.750
 quite pretty well and well 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.490
 time it's going to bring a different 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.099
 good tutorial more tutorials I'll 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.040
 teach this a package of resources the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.750
 truth is very good seriously if you 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.779
 they do like it and everything then download 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.550
 about that leaves the link in the description 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.330
 and it is a package of resources that you 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.400
 help 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.769
 I do not know you can not the truth is a little bit 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.140
 of traps and that yes I do not deny it but 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.060
 to find materials in a way 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.380
 easier because of the type of materials 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.980
 two materials that are inside the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.560
 Yes mine more than once that and then 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.290
 they will also help you 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.000
 if you are arming something you must be axis if 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.430
 I want you like to make maps that 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.500
 contain subtracted or something like that can 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.720
 telling yourself helps you a lot since you can 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.420
 Well, let's go to the case I 'll show you 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.390
 this resource pack that is very 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.070
 good and here I made a mine ok 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.510
 Well, as you can see, it 's a normal mine 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.809
 comes to him 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.189
 to the coordinate 11 where it is 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.460
 by now we already know the 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:10.820
 diamonds ok then well now what 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.890
 let's make it easy then let's change 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.720
 our resource package that is made 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.030
 good these days and those are the 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.350
 they want to download here by inviting 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.630
 a suggestion will be appearing 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.450
 where these packages are downloaded from 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.180
 resources and there's also there for there 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.280
 can see how to install the different 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.560
 resource packages that can be 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.450
 install on my car and so that is the same 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.580
 they install this which is the one that today 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.259
 I'm teaching there you can see how 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.350
 settle them and well we get 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:44.619
 to this because we give him the ready is he 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:49.270
 the resource pack we need and 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.920
 ok see how they see is a package of 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.869
 resources that helps you see all the 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.460
 materials there is what this does 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.649
 package of resources is transparent 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.750
 all all the materials and when I say 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.220
 all are all ok now 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:09.210
 we have been coming down 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:13.320
 and this is what makes it more transparent 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.900
 that are some materials I do not know how good 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.690
 in themselves better they see it easier to tell them that 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.390
 not what is not transparent are those of the 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.020
 These cubes are ok and good in English 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:28.050
 they are like ok so then ok and if 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.970
 I'm in this layer that is eleven 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.740
 here where are the diamonds like 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.740
 You can see I do not know if after more here 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:42.980
 ok here already because this is a way then 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.980
 much easier for you thousands though 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.340
 here 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.160
 I do not have 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:01.109
 and well that's how you can see 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.749
 within them I do not know not only in 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.459
 the mines can see this everywhere 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:07.760
 so we're going to take a turn towards 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.760
 above 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:24.640
 and here I can see the different types 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.640
 of materials that I have near 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.660
 there are the diamonds because it is a 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.140
 way very well they are much facilitated 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:44.610
 this with this detector bar is not tunisia 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:47.030
 or nothing with just knowing how to install what 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.830
 that is the text pack that I already told you 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.170
 this there I have a video where the lord 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:58.380
 how to install is very good be a 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:04:01.590
 detector of vegetar of the series good 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.660
 You see, this one is very good, it's a lot 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.370
 help is not very father either 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.920
 have this space good if you 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.110
 So, you may as well be ahead, but 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.470
 Well, as I say most of the 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.100
 especially if material is transparent 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.100
 we go up here 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.539
 if you can see how they see everything, how they see 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.550
 clippers 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:34.530
 well here converted out of this 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:40.319
 in Lake out here because if 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:43.229
 manages to see how I tell them it works 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:44.970
 systems have much if rectum and 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.949
 Well, you want to see more or less what 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.590
 is what is inside the cis of this 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:51.360
 system can work quite well 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.759
 even then this text but can use 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.210
 everywhere if they are playing or not 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:59.759
 a few games of hunger 'so to speak 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.970
 of those to eat well if you are 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.710
 there playing in those ones because this one I do not know if 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.240
 someone is checking out hiding 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:11.340
 that you simply will only be 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.870
 these texts because this one can already 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.320
 see where he is responding not with much 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.840
 ease with here we are going down we are 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.860
 in the layer 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.130
 in layer 29 well here we are seeing 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.949
 all all the materials that after 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:30.650
 They are close to us I say so 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:34.240
 if it is something to cheat the truth then nothing 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.919
 combined to the then to the traditional no 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.630
 we fill in so we already know where they are 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.400
 the materials then we directly 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.949
 let's go to what we need I do not know I want 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.130
 something recipe here is something here 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:48.860
 of gold then more here and then more than anything 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:52.010
 as important as they are called you 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:56.330
 Obviously, you can already have this 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:06:01.760
 identified at a glance without much 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:05.200
 be searched and searched here is ok 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.750
 well here we go out again 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.460
 and well, as I say, I can use it 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.390
 everywhere since this is not any 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.640
 mode and no this any map or something 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.740
 so you can use it then in 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:25.990
 any game 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:28.090
 ok what I have done is this because 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.230
 This is a tree that I have made and 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.900
 obviously we are going to see why they are 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.580
 half blocks but for example blocks 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.710
 between two like these these see as they see 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:40.150
 they are half blocks but then blocks 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:42.420
 whole here with a trap that I 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.420
 I did 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.960
 is a trap for mods and how they see there 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.780
 up all 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:55.020
 falling every month since now I say 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:58.819
 for responsive systems is very very 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.819
 good this text 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:05.420
 well then we return to our map 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.420
 normal 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.140
 age if you have a chance to 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.350
 download you can download your 

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:14.720
 state is very good this text pack ok 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:18.490
 can not know we go back to normal 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:21.620
 ratos explicarollow the bambÃº 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:23.390
 we give this and here on a ribbon you see 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.720
 if they want this to know how to use 

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:29.530
 these different textures because this one just 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.530
 go to my videos 

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:39.310
 just go to my videos and then I have 

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:41.200
 none that can work and good 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.000
 Well, I think we're going to let 

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.550
 today's video I hope you have them 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.920
 liked it is true that your plan very useful 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.570
 that can help them because it's going to 

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.730
 facilitate your life Christmas brand 

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:53.830
 It evolves a lot to the michaal since 

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:56.050
 it helps them in everything virtually everything 

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:58.090
 what you do then you do not have 

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.470
 that is culminating hours and hours until 

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:02.860
 find diamonds or to find 

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:04.570
 very little texts, well, I hope that 

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.090
 you liked the video subscribe 

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:09.610
 give my videos like chiquis and then 

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:13.480
 wait for more videos to comment if they have 

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:15.460
 some doubt and then leave your like and 

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.700
 subscribe if we see each other in the next 

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.700
 video
