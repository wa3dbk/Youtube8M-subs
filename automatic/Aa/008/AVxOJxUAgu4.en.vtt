 secret by an emperor of the sacrum 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.789
 Germanic empire the legend points out that the 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.769
 author of the codex gigas was a monk 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.869
 Benedictine condemned to be walled 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.540
 I live for a serious crime and so that 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.670
 sorry he was condoned the monk proposed 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.170
 create a monumental work that would honor 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.270
 to the monastery 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.180
 a codex that would contain the bible and 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.489
 all the knowledge of the world the time 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.520
 stipulated by the same monk was one 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.560
 night the monk's task was superhuman 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.260
 so it is said that he requested the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.239
 help from satan himself who accepted 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.489
 create the book in one night by putting 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.200
 as a condition to appear your image in a 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.180
 of the pages 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.819
 it is certainly only a matter of 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.459
 legend very subsequent to its creation not 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.040
 However, it is undoubted that it was written 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.410
 by a single man a note on the 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.480
 first sheet of the codex league is established 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.030
 to a Benedictine monastery in Bohemia 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.799
 I could make it close to his ding as 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.590
 first known owner of the 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.840
 manuscript is unlikely that this 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.989
 huge book has been written in putla 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.090
 and the monastery was too small 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.220
 and too poor to carry out 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.400
 such advanced enterprise that requires 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.230
 Huge human and material resources 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.239
 as far as we know no other 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.530
 medieval manuscript is conserved 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.930
 monastery 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.390
 the name of the scribe of the codex gigas not 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.060
 it is known but it has been conjectured that it was 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.090
 the german hill whose name and nickname was 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.790
 even his brothers monachus german 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.420
 Monge secluded appears on 10 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.520
 November in the obituary the epithet 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.220
 it was even linked to the legend 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.440
 of the book it is believed that the monk is self 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.630
 isolated from the world by penance and he 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.030
 He dedicated to writing the book as part of 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.160
 his punishment then he transformed into 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.150
 a sacred text was considered a 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.150
 way to redeem
