to<00:00:41.900> do<00:00:42.110> this<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:42.440> think<00:00:42.920> I'm<00:00:43.010> just<00:00:43.190> going<00:00:43.280> to

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
to do this and think I'm just going to

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.770 
to do this and think I'm just going to
grab<00:00:43.489> it<00:00:43.610> in<00:00:43.790> my<00:00:43.910> hand<00:00:44.210> and<00:00:44.960> just<00:00:46.510> kind<00:00:47.510> of<00:00:47.600> just

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
grab it in my hand and just kind of just

00:00:47.780 --> 00:01:00.820 
grab it in my hand and just kind of just
sprinkle<00:00:48.260> across<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:48.890> whole<00:00:49.070> area<00:00:58.900> yes<00:00:59.900> done

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
sprinkle across the whole area yes done

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:07.530 
sprinkle across the whole area yes done
pretty<00:01:01.070> quickly<00:01:01.370> look<00:01:01.930> that<00:01:02.930> I'm<00:01:03.050> going<00:01:03.080> for

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.750 

think<00:01:08.540> I'm<00:01:08.750> gonna<00:01:08.840> have<00:01:08.960> to<00:01:09.080> do<00:01:09.170> is<00:01:09.290> put<00:01:09.530> on<00:01:09.760> let

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
think I'm gonna have to do is put on let

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.660 
think I'm gonna have to do is put on let
it<00:01:10.790> dry<00:01:14.620> this<00:01:15.620> is<00:01:15.770> an<00:01:15.890> experiment<00:01:16.370> i'll<00:01:16.520> know

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
it dry this is an experiment i'll know

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.469 
it dry this is an experiment i'll know
next<00:01:16.700> time<00:01:17.030> I<00:01:17.090> should<00:01:17.299> have<00:01:17.390> probably

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
next time I should have probably

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.930 
next time I should have probably
experimented<00:01:18.140> on<00:01:18.229> a<00:01:18.369> piece<00:01:19.369> of<00:01:19.400> scrap<00:01:19.909> wood

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
experimented on a piece of scrap wood

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.640 
experimented on a piece of scrap wood
but<00:01:20.299> that's<00:01:20.479> not<00:01:20.659> that's<00:01:21.049> not<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.380> way<00:01:21.500> I<00:01:21.530> do

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
but that's not that's not the way I do

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.910 
but that's not that's not the way I do
things<00:01:22.010> I<00:01:22.930> tend<00:01:23.930> to<00:01:23.990> jump<00:01:24.440> right<00:01:24.710> in

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.620 

and<00:01:28.369> then<00:01:28.610> suffer<00:01:29.420> with<00:01:29.540> the<00:01:29.570> consequences

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
and then suffer with the consequences

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.219 
and then suffer with the consequences
okay<00:01:32.630> i<00:01:32.659> just<00:01:32.780> finished<00:01:33.380> putting<00:01:33.680> on<00:01:34.040> the

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
okay i just finished putting on the

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.899 
okay i just finished putting on the
finnish<00:01:36.229> museum<00:01:37.130> in<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.280> little<00:01:37.549> bit<00:01:37.670> so<00:01:37.820> you

finnish museum in a little bit so you

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.010 
finnish museum in a little bit so you
can<00:01:37.970> kind<00:01:38.270> of<00:01:38.390> see<00:01:38.830> what<00:01:39.830> it<00:01:39.920> looks<00:01:40.100> like<00:01:41.020> it's

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
can kind of see what it looks like it's

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.180 
can kind of see what it looks like it's
very<00:01:42.409> interesting<00:01:43.310> i<00:01:44.110> can't<00:01:45.110> say<00:01:45.409> that<00:01:45.440> i<00:01:45.710> like

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
very interesting i can't say that i like

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.340 
very interesting i can't say that i like
it<00:01:46.399> yeah<00:01:49.270> just<00:01:50.270> because<00:01:50.509> this<00:01:50.659> island<00:01:51.049> is<00:01:51.170> such

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
it yeah just because this island is such

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.630 
it yeah just because this island is such
a<00:01:51.380> huge<00:01:52.240> space<00:01:53.240> in<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.720> kitchen<00:01:53.899> it<00:01:54.680> seems<00:01:55.280> to

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
a huge space in the kitchen it seems to

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.010 
a huge space in the kitchen it seems to
it<00:01:56.270> really<00:01:56.509> changes<00:01:58.180> changes<00:01:59.180> it<00:01:59.330> I<00:01:59.479> guess

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
it really changes changes it I guess

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.660 
it really changes changes it I guess
because<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:00.319> was<00:02:00.409> so<00:02:00.530> dark<00:02:00.770> before<00:02:01.039> and<00:02:01.399> now<00:02:01.520> it

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
because it was so dark before and now it

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.880 
because it was so dark before and now it
just<00:02:01.700> seems<00:02:02.179> to<00:02:02.479> like<00:02:02.630> just<00:02:02.899> pop<00:02:03.830> right<00:02:03.860> out

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
just seems to like just pop right out

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.320 
just seems to like just pop right out
you<00:02:06.890> have<00:02:07.159> to<00:02:07.280> let<00:02:07.369> it<00:02:07.429> set<00:02:07.670> up<00:02:07.789> now<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:08.209> see

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
you have to let it set up now and see

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.020 
you have to let it set up now and see
what's<00:02:08.509> going<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:08.750> happen<00:02:09.110> I<00:02:09.880> guess<00:02:10.880> this

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
what's going to happen I guess this

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.809 
what's going to happen I guess this
stuff<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.480> pretty<00:02:11.630> much<00:02:11.950> have<00:02:12.950> let<00:02:13.160> it<00:02:13.250> dry<00:02:13.489> and

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
stuff is pretty much have let it dry and

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.050

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
then I put the attachment on the vacuum

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.830 
then I put the attachment on the vacuum

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
two I took a bunch of footage of me

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.870 
two I took a bunch of footage of me
putting<00:02:30.380> on<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.620> polyurethane<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:31.580> forth

putting on the polyurethane and so forth

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.840 
putting on the polyurethane and so forth
but<00:02:32.450> for<00:02:32.690> some<00:02:32.840> reason<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.320> camera<00:02:33.850> screwed

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
but for some reason the camera screwed

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.060 
but for some reason the camera screwed
up<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.329> I<00:02:35.690> didn't<00:02:35.959> none<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:36.709> was

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
up and I didn't none of that was

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.210 
up and I didn't none of that was
salvageable<00:02:37.900> so<00:02:38.900> I<00:02:39.230> have<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:40.010> finished

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
salvageable so I have the finished

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.680 
salvageable so I have the finished
product<00:02:40.730> i'm<00:02:40.850> going<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.150> show<00:02:41.329> you<00:02:41.359> this

a little bit longer before I start
putting<00:04:24.560> stuff<00:04:24.680> on<00:04:25.010> it<00:04:25.070> even<00:04:25.340> though<00:04:25.490> it's<00:04:25.820> it

so forth on it might be a little bit too

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.200 
so forth on it might be a little bit too
soon<00:04:31.250> for<00:04:31.430> this<00:04:31.550> I<00:04:31.669> need<00:04:31.700> to<00:04:31.850> let<00:04:31.910> him<00:04:32.060> set<00:04:32.180> up
