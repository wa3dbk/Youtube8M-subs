from last season these are they're great

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.180 
from last season these are they're great
they<00:00:42.670> were<00:00:42.730> designed<00:00:43.210> for<00:00:43.860> being<00:00:44.860> extremely

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
they were designed for being extremely

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.360 
they were designed for being extremely
liked<00:00:46.230> someone<00:00:47.230> that<00:00:47.620> only<00:00:47.830> needs<00:00:48.010> to<00:00:48.190> touch

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
liked someone that only needs to touch

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.540 
liked someone that only needs to touch
the<00:00:48.490> ball<00:00:48.640> once<00:00:48.880> or<00:00:49.030> twice<00:00:49.210> before<00:00:49.450> a<00:00:49.690> strike

the ball once or twice before a strike

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.220 
the ball once or twice before a strike
usually<00:00:51.550> someone<00:00:51.850> in<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.030> up<00:00:52.180> top<00:00:52.480> would<00:00:53.080> wear

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
usually someone in the up top would wear

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.890 
usually someone in the up top would wear
something<00:00:53.440> like<00:00:53.650> this<00:00:53.800> because<00:00:54.220> of<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:54.900> the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
something like this because of the the

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.190 
something like this because of the the
very<00:00:56.110> light<00:00:56.380> carbon<00:00:56.920> fiber<00:00:57.250> bottoms<00:00:57.990> the<00:00:58.990> only

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
very light carbon fiber bottoms the only

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.290 
very light carbon fiber bottoms the only
challenge<00:01:00.130> with<00:01:00.310> this<00:01:00.490> particular<00:01:00.880> type<00:01:01.270> of

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
challenge with this particular type of

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.229 
challenge with this particular type of
shoe<00:01:01.540> is<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:02.380> upper<00:01:02.710> I<00:01:02.890> mean<00:01:03.160> you're<00:01:04.150> not

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
shoe is the upper I mean you're not

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.490 
shoe is the upper I mean you're not
going<00:01:04.390> to<00:01:04.479> be<00:01:04.570> able<00:01:04.659> to<00:01:04.750> feel<00:01:05.049> the<00:01:05.290> ball<00:01:05.470> a

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
going to be able to feel the ball a

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.679 
going to be able to feel the ball a
whole<00:01:05.830> lot<00:01:06.040> through<00:01:06.250> this<00:01:06.430> but<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.060> reason<00:01:07.359> it

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689 
whole lot through this but the reason it

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:10.050 
whole lot through this but the reason it
was<00:01:07.840> designed<00:01:08.289> this<00:01:08.409> way<00:01:08.469> is<00:01:08.950> just<00:01:09.249> for<00:01:09.700> speed

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
was designed this way is just for speed

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.910 
was designed this way is just for speed
okay<00:01:10.829> and<00:01:11.829> as<00:01:12.100> we<00:01:12.280> go<00:01:12.429> on<00:01:12.579> to<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:12.939> next<00:01:13.859> type<00:01:14.859> of

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
okay and as we go on to the next type of

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.639 
okay and as we go on to the next type of
vapor<00:01:15.429> here<00:01:15.759> these<00:01:16.390> got<00:01:16.719> in<00:01:17.020> my<00:01:17.200> opinion<00:01:17.590> a

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
vapor here these got in my opinion a

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.120 
vapor here these got in my opinion a
little<00:01:17.979> bit<00:01:18.130> better<00:01:18.569> the<00:01:19.569> upper<00:01:20.049> is<00:01:20.170> extremely

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
little bit better the upper is extremely

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.580 
little bit better the upper is extremely
soft<00:01:21.479> you'd<00:01:22.479> be<00:01:22.659> able<00:01:22.749> to<00:01:22.899> feel<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.380> ball

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
soft you'd be able to feel the ball

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.880 
soft you'd be able to feel the ball
through<00:01:24.189> this<00:01:24.689> very<00:01:25.689> very<00:01:25.960> well<00:01:26.079> again

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
through this very very well again

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.279 
through this very very well again
designed<00:01:27.429> with<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:27.909> carbon<00:01:28.240> fiber<00:01:28.270> bottom<00:01:28.899> to

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
designed with the carbon fiber bottom to

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.980 
designed with the carbon fiber bottom to
be<00:01:29.439> super<00:01:29.890> liked<00:01:30.130> someone<00:01:30.909> up<00:01:31.119> top<00:01:31.389> or<00:01:31.689> someone

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
be super liked someone up top or someone

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.270 
be super liked someone up top or someone
that<00:01:32.079> needs<00:01:32.229> a<00:01:32.319> lot<00:01:32.530> of<00:01:32.560> speed<00:01:32.920> would<00:01:33.100> wear

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
that needs a lot of speed would wear

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.599 
that needs a lot of speed would wear
something<00:01:33.520> like<00:01:33.670> this<00:01:34.139> this<00:01:35.139> was<00:01:35.409> my<00:01:35.619> personal

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
something like this this was my personal

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:39.059 
something like this this was my personal
favorite<00:01:37.539> because<00:01:38.020> it<00:01:38.259> was<00:01:38.350> super<00:01:38.530> light<00:01:38.829> but

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069 
favorite because it was super light but

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:40.950 
favorite because it was super light but
you<00:01:39.249> know<00:01:39.609> when<00:01:39.819> you<00:01:39.939> go<00:01:40.119> super<00:01:40.569> light<00:01:40.749> like

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
you know when you go super light like

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.270 
you know when you go super light like
this<00:01:41.109> what<00:01:41.710> it<00:01:41.799> lacks<00:01:42.039> is<00:01:42.340> durability<00:01:43.149> okay<00:01:44.280> so

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
this what it lacks is durability okay so

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.489 
this what it lacks is durability okay so
then<00:01:45.429> we<00:01:45.520> got<00:01:45.609> this<00:01:45.789> season's<00:01:46.240> what<00:01:47.049> they<00:01:47.259> did

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:47.499 
then we got this season's what they did

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:50.129 
then we got this season's what they did
was<00:01:47.859> it's<00:01:48.189> a<00:01:48.429> little<00:01:48.969> combo<00:01:49.420> of<00:01:49.600> both<00:01:49.810> of<00:01:50.020> those

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:50.139 
was it's a little combo of both of those

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:53.099 
was it's a little combo of both of those
still<00:01:50.950> with<00:01:51.159> the<00:01:51.369> ultralight<00:01:52.109> carbon-fiber

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:53.109 
still with the ultralight carbon-fiber

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.039 
still with the ultralight carbon-fiber
bottom<00:01:53.979> this<00:01:54.670> is<00:01:54.999> designed<00:01:55.479> with<00:01:55.600> a<00:01:55.659> little

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
bottom this is designed with a little

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.730 
bottom this is designed with a little
bit<00:01:56.170> more<00:01:56.319> durability<00:01:56.799> and<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.899> is<00:01:59.170> a<00:01:59.200> little

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
bit more durability and it is a little

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.149 
bit more durability and it is a little
bit<00:01:59.979> more<00:02:00.420> soft<00:02:01.420> so<00:02:02.139> you<00:02:02.229> can<00:02:02.560> feel<00:02:02.799> the<00:02:02.829> ball<00:02:03.130> a

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
bit more soft so you can feel the ball a

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.399 
bit more soft so you can feel the ball a
little<00:02:03.340> bit<00:02:03.520> better<00:02:03.579> so<00:02:04.029> out<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:04.869> those<00:02:05.139> two

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
little bit better so out of those two

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.620 
little bit better so out of those two
