light and that way you're going to have

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.330 
light and that way you're going to have
two<00:00:24.449> different<00:00:24.630> shades<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.080> lettuce<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.680> what

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.279 
I did was I rolled it down on the pasta
machine<00:00:29.240> smaller<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.449> smaller<00:00:30.630> until<00:00:30.810> it's

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
machine smaller and smaller until it's

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.930 
machine smaller and smaller until it's
the<00:00:31.380> very<00:00:31.590> very<00:00:31.830> finished<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.430> could<00:00:32.580> be<00:00:32.730> and

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
the very very finished it could be and

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.009 
the very very finished it could be and
that's<00:00:33.090> where<00:00:33.269> you<00:00:33.360> get<00:00:33.510> all<00:00:33.660> these<00:00:33.809> little

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:34.019 
that's where you get all these little

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:36.950 
that's where you get all these little
lumps<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.590> bumps<00:00:34.770> like<00:00:35.070> real<00:00:35.309> lettuce<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.960> I

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
lumps and bumps like real lettuce and I

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.830 
lumps and bumps like real lettuce and I
took<00:00:37.430> this<00:00:38.430> thing<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.940> has<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> ball<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.660> don't

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
took this thing it has a ball you don't

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.240 
took this thing it has a ball you don't
have<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.140> use<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.620> could<00:00:40.739> probably<00:00:40.950> use

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
have to use this you could probably use

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.610 
have to use this you could probably use
the<00:00:41.399> end<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.940> like<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> big<00:00:42.870> pin<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.469> don't

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the end of a like a big pin you don't

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.410 
the end of a like a big pin you don't
have<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.829> buy<00:00:43.950> anything<00:00:43.980> special<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.850> just

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
start putting holes in it in different

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.840 
start putting holes in it in different
places<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:48.989> way<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.680> roughs<00:00:49.920> up<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
places in that way it roughs up the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.799 
places in that way it roughs up the
edges<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:52.350> want<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.680> all<00:00:52.800> wrinkly<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
edges and you want it all wrinkly and

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.930 
edges and you want it all wrinkly and
you<00:00:54.809> know<00:00:54.930> tear<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.469> apart<00:00:55.680> here<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.610> here

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
you know tear it apart here and here

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.670 
you know tear it apart here and here
that<00:00:57.360> gives<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.719> all<00:00:57.809> those<00:00:57.960> great<00:00:58.199> edges<00:00:58.829> just

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
that gives it all those great edges just

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.920 
that gives it all those great edges just
keep<00:01:01.680> working<00:01:02.100> at<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.539> enough

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
okay now take these and i put the TLS on

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.520 
okay now take these and i put the TLS on
top<00:05:24.430> of<00:05:24.550> it<00:05:24.669> and<00:05:24.789> i<00:05:24.970> mix<00:05:25.180> it<00:05:25.270> all<00:05:25.419> together<00:05:25.539> this

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
top of it and i mix it all together this

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.379 
top of it and i mix it all together this
is<00:05:26.620> just<00:05:26.740> my<00:05:26.889> little<00:05:27.039> quick<00:05:27.280> bowl<00:05:27.490> and<00:05:27.789> this

is just my little quick bowl and this

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.620 
is just my little quick bowl and this
the<00:05:28.720> TLS<00:05:29.139> acts<00:05:29.380> as<00:05:29.620> a<00:05:29.650> glue<00:05:29.919> in<00:05:30.639> that<00:05:31.270> way<00:05:31.419> it

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
the TLS acts as a glue in that way it

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.560 
the TLS acts as a glue in that way it
