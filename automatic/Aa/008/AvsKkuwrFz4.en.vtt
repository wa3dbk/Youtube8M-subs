universal<00:00:44.940> century<00:00:45.239> act<00:00:45.809> guy<00:01:18.380> you're<00:01:19.380> gonna

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
universal century act guy you're gonna

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.380 
universal century act guy you're gonna
be<00:01:19.619> painting<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.160> ultimately<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.970> should<00:01:21.240> be

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
be painting it ultimately you should be

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.139 
be painting it ultimately you should be
trimming<00:01:22.200> off<00:01:22.470> all<00:01:22.740> these<00:01:22.920> pegs<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.580> an<00:01:23.790> angle

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
trimming off all these pegs at an angle

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.150 
trimming off all these pegs at an angle
so<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.930> makes<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.259> easier<00:01:25.649> to<00:01:25.680> dismantle

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
so that it makes it easier to dismantle

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.969 
so that it makes it easier to dismantle
afterwards<00:01:26.940> and<00:01:27.590> gluing<00:01:28.590> everything

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
afterwards and gluing everything

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.880 
afterwards and gluing everything
together<00:01:29.900> all<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.080> bits<00:01:31.229> aren't<00:01:31.560> supposed<00:01:31.830> to

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
together all the bits aren't supposed to

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.820 
together all the bits aren't supposed to
move<00:01:32.100> anyway<00:01:33.020> so<00:01:34.020> that's<00:01:34.200> pretty<00:01:34.409> much<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.650> for

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
move anyway so that's pretty much it for

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.590 
move anyway so that's pretty much it for
the<00:01:35.240> h3<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.560> I<00:01:37.560> should<00:01:37.920> say<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.280> unique<00:01:38.729> new

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the h3 and I should say the unique new

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.870 
the h3 and I should say the unique new
parts<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.710> kit<00:01:41.010> because<00:01:41.130> otherwise<00:01:41.460> it

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
parts in this kit because otherwise it

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.750 
parts in this kit because otherwise it
is<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> high-grade<00:01:42.780> AK<00:01:43.080> guy<00:01:43.520> it<00:01:44.520> would<00:01:44.640> have

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
is a high-grade AK guy it would have

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.100 
is a high-grade AK guy it would have
been<00:01:44.850> nicer<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.360> had<00:01:45.570> more<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.900> these

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.070 
been nicer if you had more of these

have on the tree don't I think I've
forgotten<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.480> mono<00:03:08.810> why<00:03:09.970> now<00:03:10.970> I<00:03:11.000> did<00:03:11.630> hear

myself dropping something on the floor
but<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.730> must<00:03:17.000> have<00:03:17.060> been<00:03:17.240> the<00:03:17.420> little<00:03:17.540> mono

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
but it must have been the little mono

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.230 
but it must have been the little mono
why<00:03:18.140> I<00:03:18.500> can't<00:03:19.040> find<00:03:19.280> it<00:03:19.490> doesn't<00:03:20.030> matter

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.440 
why I can't find it doesn't matter
because<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:20.959> didn't<00:03:21.920> actually<00:03:22.100> fancy<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.150> look

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
because I didn't actually fancy the look

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.199 
because I didn't actually fancy the look
of<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.840> bright<00:03:24.380> pink<00:03:24.920> or<00:03:25.160> bright<00:03:25.580> red<00:03:25.910> mono

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
of the bright pink or bright red mono

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.630 
of the bright pink or bright red mono
eye<00:03:26.300> on<00:03:26.900> this<00:03:27.200> head<00:03:27.440> I<00:03:27.470> prefer<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.250> look<00:03:28.430> of<00:03:28.520> it

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
eye on this head I prefer the look of it

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.870 
eye on this head I prefer the look of it
as<00:03:28.820> it<00:03:28.970> is<00:03:29.000> now<00:03:29.420> so<00:03:30.220> if<00:03:31.220> I<00:03:31.340> wanted<00:03:31.610> to<00:03:31.730> make

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
as it is now so if I wanted to make

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.520 
as it is now so if I wanted to make
another<00:03:32.000> piece<00:03:32.420> it<00:03:32.690> wouldn't<00:03:32.990> be<00:03:33.140> too<00:03:33.500> much

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
another piece it wouldn't be too much

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.830 
another piece it wouldn't be too much
effort<00:03:34.390> and<00:03:35.390> this<00:03:35.570> is<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.750> neck<00:03:36.200> piece<00:03:37.360> so<00:03:38.360> I

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
effort and this is a neck piece so I

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.470 
effort and this is a neck piece so I
think<00:03:39.350> that<00:03:39.500> covers<00:03:39.769> all<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.250> unique<00:03:40.850> parts

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
think that covers all the unique parts

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.370 
think that covers all the unique parts
that<00:03:42.200> we<00:03:42.350> have<00:03:42.620> for<00:03:43.510> transforming<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.810> guy

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
that we have for transforming the a guy

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.410 
that we have for transforming the a guy
kit<00:03:45.769> into<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.670> bear<00:03:46.940> ji<00:03:47.480> guy<00:03:48.880> now<00:03:49.880> I<00:03:49.910> can<00:03:50.209> see

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
kit into the bear ji guy now I can see

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.600 
kit into the bear ji guy now I can see
that<00:03:50.600> this<00:03:50.750> black<00:03:51.200> piece<00:03:51.590> going<00:03:52.100> into<00:03:52.430> this

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
that this black piece going into this

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.780 
that this black piece going into this
socket<00:03:53.180> here<00:03:53.209> is<00:03:53.600> gonna<00:03:53.780> be<00:03:54.050> a<00:03:54.700> bit<00:03:55.700> of<00:03:56.000> a<00:03:56.690> pain

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
socket here is gonna be a bit of a pain

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.820 
socket here is gonna be a bit of a pain
to<00:03:58.790> pop<00:03:59.239> out<00:03:59.450> again<00:03:59.660> after<00:04:00.200> it's<00:04:00.320> been<00:04:00.470> pushed

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
to pop out again after it's been pushed

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.509 
to pop out again after it's been pushed
in<00:04:01.100> I've<00:04:01.310> given<00:04:01.640> it<00:04:01.760> a<00:04:01.880> bit<00:04:02.060> of<00:04:02.150> a<00:04:02.269> fitting<00:04:02.780> and

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
in I've given it a bit of a fitting and

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.460 
in I've given it a bit of a fitting and
yeah<00:04:04.519> it's<00:04:04.730> gonna<00:04:04.850> be<00:04:05.000> troublesome<00:04:05.420> so<00:04:06.410> to

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
yeah it's gonna be troublesome so to

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.530 
yeah it's gonna be troublesome so to
prepare<00:04:06.739> for<00:04:07.250> that<00:04:07.400> I'm<00:04:07.549> gonna<00:04:07.730> drill<00:04:08.180> using

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
prepare for that I'm gonna drill using

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.720 
prepare for that I'm gonna drill using
this<00:04:08.870> pin<00:04:09.620> vise<00:04:10.780> through<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:12.260> back<00:04:12.590> of<00:04:12.950> this

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
this pin vise through the back of this

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.960 
this pin vise through the back of this
socket<00:04:14.450> right<00:04:14.989> through<00:04:15.440> it<00:04:15.560> and<00:04:15.830> when<00:04:16.580> I<00:04:16.609> want

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
socket right through it and when I want

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.120 
socket right through it and when I want
to<00:04:17.030> take<00:04:17.540> it<00:04:17.690> apart<00:04:18.019> I<00:04:18.260> can<00:04:18.410> just<00:04:18.620> take<00:04:18.919> this

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
to take it apart I can just take this

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.610 
to take it apart I can just take this
again<00:04:19.400> I<00:04:19.489> suppose<00:04:19.850> or<00:04:20.030> a<00:04:20.120> pin<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:20.810> push<00:04:21.320> that

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
again I suppose or a pin and push that

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.120 
again I suppose or a pin and push that
component<00:04:22.190> out<00:04:22.580> from<00:04:22.940> behind<00:04:23.919> always<00:04:24.919> think

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
component out from behind always think

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.510 
component out from behind always think
ahead

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.659

not<00:04:34.090> have<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.479> be<00:04:34.690> worrying<00:04:35.380> I<00:04:36.360> can<00:04:37.360> push<00:04:37.660> that

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
not have to be worrying I can push that

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.700 
not have to be worrying I can push that
all<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.080> way<00:04:38.259> in<00:04:38.650> and<00:04:40.020> later<00:04:41.020> on<00:04:41.289> when<00:04:41.500> I<00:04:41.530> want
