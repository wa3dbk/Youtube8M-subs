case we're using a metal facade the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.880 
case we're using a metal facade the
trick<00:01:05.970> with<00:01:06.119> ours<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.630> uses<00:01:06.990> tiny<00:01:07.560> tiny

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
trick with ours is it uses tiny tiny

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.240 
trick with ours is it uses tiny tiny
