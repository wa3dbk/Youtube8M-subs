for<00:00:41.700> about<00:00:41.879> $40<00:00:42.570> after<00:00:43.079> taxes<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.680> was<00:00:43.829> fairly

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.750 
for about $40 after taxes it was fairly
cheap<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.809> we<00:00:45.809> decided<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.260> give<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.530> try

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
cheap and we decided to give it a try

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.610 
cheap and we decided to give it a try
comparing<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.030> our<00:00:48.270> name<00:00:48.450> brands<00:00:48.930> like

comparing it to our name brands like
Sony<00:00:49.950> Toshiba<00:00:50.420> LG<00:00:51.980> Panasonic<00:00:52.980> which<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:54.090> about

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
Sony Toshiba LG Panasonic which is about

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.229 
Sony Toshiba LG Panasonic which is about
double<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.680> price<00:00:55.980> starting<00:00:56.610> around<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.030> say

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
double the price starting around I say

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.439 
double the price starting around I say
80<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.710> 130<00:00:58.710> even<00:00:59.399> more<00:00:59.640> depending<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.210> what

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
80 to 130 even more depending on what

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.779 
80 to 130 even more depending on what
features<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.410> want<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.430> player<00:01:02.640> itself

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
features you want on the player itself

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.260 
features you want on the player itself

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
the bottom here this was actually I

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.850 
the bottom here this was actually I
guess<00:01:26.189> sort<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.720> interesting<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.750> see<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:28.619> you

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
guess sort of interesting to see but you

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.190 
guess sort of interesting to see but you
know<00:01:29.460> give<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> try<00:01:30.060> see<00:01:30.450> how<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.720> goes<00:01:30.900> if

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
know give it a try see how it goes if

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.840 
know give it a try see how it goes if
it's<00:01:31.350> not<00:01:31.560> good<00:01:31.799> then<00:01:31.829> almost<00:01:32.460> more<00:01:32.820> than

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
it's not good then almost more than

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.120 
it's not good then almost more than
likely<00:01:33.119> I'll<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:33.659> returning<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.500> buying<00:01:34.890> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
likely I'll be returning it and buying a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.920 
likely I'll be returning it and buying a
better<00:01:35.400> unit<00:01:36.049> perhaps<00:01:37.049> from<00:01:37.680> Toshiba<00:01:37.890> they're

now<00:02:45.099> looking<00:02:45.400> at<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.549> front<00:02:45.579> there<00:02:46.390> is<00:02:46.420> a

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
now looking at the front there is a

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.970 
now looking at the front there is a
blu-ray<00:02:48.150> disc<00:02:49.150> imprint<00:02:49.870> on<00:02:50.260> top<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:50.829> it's

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
blu-ray disc imprint on top so it's

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.030 
blu-ray disc imprint on top so it's
pretty<00:02:51.160> cool<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:52.450> obviously<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.650> might<00:02:53.920> take

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
pretty cool and obviously I might take

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.970 
pretty cool and obviously I might take
this<00:02:54.190> all<00:02:54.370> off<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:54.670> does<00:02:54.819> have<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.000> USB<00:02:55.299> port

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
this all off it does have a USB port

tray<00:03:00.640> right<00:03:00.790> here<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.660> I<00:03:01.750> guess<00:03:01.900> I'll<00:03:02.049> hook<00:03:02.140> it

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
tray right here and I guess I'll hook it

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.349 
tray right here and I guess I'll hook it
up<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.560> we'll<00:03:02.920> give<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.069> a<00:03:03.160> try<00:03:03.370> alright<00:03:04.239> so

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
up and we'll give it a try alright so

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:05.309 
up and we'll give it a try alright so
we're<00:03:04.450> done<00:03:04.540> with<00:03:04.600> testing<00:03:05.049> the<00:03:05.139> unit

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
we're done with testing the unit

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.319 
we're done with testing the unit
although<00:03:05.889> I<00:03:05.920> only<00:03:06.010> did<00:03:06.310> play<00:03:06.609> one<00:03:06.850> movie<00:03:07.180> which

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
although I only did play one movie which

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.780 
although I only did play one movie which
is<00:03:07.359> Fast<00:03:07.720> Five<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.260> it<00:03:08.769> was<00:03:08.889> a<00:03:08.920> blu-ray<00:03:09.340> I'll

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
is Fast Five and it was a blu-ray I'll

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.110 
is Fast Five and it was a blu-ray I'll
be<00:03:10.030> just<00:03:10.930> fine<00:03:11.200> went<00:03:11.980> through<00:03:12.100> chapters<00:03:12.489> fine

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
be just fine went through chapters fine

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.490 
be just fine went through chapters fine
I<00:03:13.150> don't<00:03:13.720> have<00:03:13.900> it<00:03:14.019> connected<00:03:14.350> to<00:03:14.410> the

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
I don't have it connected to the

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.840 
I don't have it connected to the
Internet<00:03:14.889> so<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:15.100> don't<00:03:15.310> know<00:03:15.430> how<00:03:15.609> it<00:03:15.700> works

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
Internet so I don't know how it works

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.849 
Internet so I don't know how it works
with<00:03:16.030> BD<00:03:16.209> live<00:03:16.480> but<00:03:17.170> I<00:03:17.200> did<00:03:17.410> read<00:03:17.590> some<00:03:17.709> reviews

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
with BD live but I did read some reviews

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.650 
with BD live but I did read some reviews
online<00:03:18.160> where<00:03:18.549> the<00:03:18.910> machine<00:03:19.209> would<00:03:19.359> actually

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
online where the machine would actually

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.740 
online where the machine would actually
freeze<00:03:19.959> up<00:03:20.200> and<00:03:20.880> not<00:03:21.880> go<00:03:22.060> through<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.480> so

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
freeze up and not go through it so

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.920 
freeze up and not go through it so
that's<00:03:23.319> one<00:03:23.829> thing<00:03:24.100> I<00:03:24.220> have<00:03:24.760> read<00:03:25.359> about<00:03:25.480> but<00:03:25.900> I

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
that's one thing I have read about but I

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.840 
that's one thing I have read about but I
haven't<00:03:26.170> tested<00:03:26.350> myself<00:03:26.829> so<00:03:27.220> I<00:03:27.250> wouldn't<00:03:27.670> know

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
haven't tested myself so I wouldn't know

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.690 
haven't tested myself so I wouldn't know
if<00:03:28.690> every<00:03:29.290> machine<00:03:29.590> does<00:03:29.799> that<00:03:29.980> or<00:03:30.220> just<00:03:30.250> only

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
if every machine does that or just only

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.750 
if every machine does that or just only
certain<00:03:31.420> machine<00:03:31.690> I<00:03:31.870> also<00:03:32.260> did<00:03:32.560> read<00:03:32.769> that<00:03:32.799> you

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
certain machine I also did read that you

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.530 
certain machine I also did read that you
know<00:03:33.819> some<00:03:34.060> people<00:03:34.090> are<00:03:34.299> having<00:03:34.420> problems

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
know some people are having problems

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.009 
know some people are having problems
with<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:35.049> actually<00:03:35.560> even<00:03:35.889> powering<00:03:36.310> up<00:03:36.430> and

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
with it actually even powering up and

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.840 
with it actually even powering up and
functioning<00:03:38.019> properly<00:03:38.170> so<00:03:38.440> you<00:03:39.340> know<00:03:39.430> I<00:03:39.459> guess

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
functioning properly so you know I guess

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.970 
functioning properly so you know I guess
for<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.180> long<00:03:40.389> term<00:03:40.720> or<00:03:41.019> long<00:03:41.170> run<00:03:41.620> for<00:03:41.889> this

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
for the long term or long run for this

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.620 
for the long term or long run for this
machine<00:03:42.160> it<00:03:42.459> might<00:03:42.670> not<00:03:42.880> be<00:03:43.030> so<00:03:43.180> great

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
machine it might not be so great

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.599 
machine it might not be so great
one<00:03:43.930> thing<00:03:44.079> I<00:03:44.260> dislike<00:03:44.799> about<00:03:44.829> the<00:03:45.160> machine<00:03:45.459> is

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
one thing I dislike about the machine is

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.440 
one thing I dislike about the machine is
that<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.450> district<00:03:46.959> has<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.319> bit<00:03:47.829> of<00:03:48.120> odd<00:03:49.120> noise

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
that the district has a bit of odd noise

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.110 
that the district has a bit of odd noise
to<00:03:49.750> it<00:03:49.870> just<00:03:50.049> doesn't<00:03:50.470> sound<00:03:50.620> right<00:03:50.889> so<00:03:51.250> more

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
to it just doesn't sound right so more

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.059 
to it just doesn't sound right so more
than<00:03:52.239> likely<00:03:52.420> I'll<00:03:52.840> be<00:03:52.959> returning<00:03:53.290> this<00:03:53.440> one

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
than likely I'll be returning this one

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.069 
than likely I'll be returning this one
and<00:03:54.310> then<00:03:54.400> finding<00:03:54.910> a<00:03:54.970> different<00:03:55.359> one<00:03:55.510> so<00:03:55.540> let

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
and then finding a different one so let

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.870 
and then finding a different one so let
me<00:03:56.170> just<00:03:56.319> show<00:03:56.500> you<00:03:56.560> real<00:03:56.859> quick<00:03:57.130> what<00:03:57.519> the

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
me just show you real quick what the

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.179 
me just show you real quick what the
district<00:03:58.299> coming<00:03:58.540> out

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:01.189 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:04.190 

this<00:04:02.189> is<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.489> remote<00:04:02.790> itself<00:04:03.120> that's<00:04:03.930> very

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
this is the remote itself that's very

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.789 
this is the remote itself that's very
light<00:04:04.560> but<00:04:04.799> it's<00:04:05.040> well<00:04:06.030> laid<00:04:06.239> out<00:04:06.560> easy<00:04:07.560> to

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
light but it's well laid out easy to
