here and today you're watching a game of

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.499

Kill<00:00:04.470> Confirmed<00:00:04.500> on<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.490> map<00:00:05.700> stand<00:00:06.120> off<00:00:06.299> and

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
Kill Confirmed on the map stand off and

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.830 
Kill Confirmed on the map stand off and
today<00:00:07.440> I'll<00:00:07.710> be<00:00:07.740> using<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.370> PDW<00:00:09.090> once<00:00:09.540> again

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
today I'll be using the PDW once again

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.570 
today I'll be using the PDW once again
because<00:00:10.200> it<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.469> arguably<00:00:11.010> one<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.309> best

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
because it is arguably one of the best

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.240 
because it is arguably one of the best
guns<00:00:11.910> in<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.150> game<00:00:12.559> now<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:13.920> might<00:00:14.099> disagree

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
guns in the game now you might disagree

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.359 
guns in the game now you might disagree
with<00:00:14.490> me<00:00:14.610> but<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.330> I'd<00:00:15.900> still<00:00:16.350> I'd<00:00:16.740> still<00:00:17.100> argue

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
with me but I I'd still I'd still argue

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.429 
with me but I I'd still I'd still argue
that<00:00:17.490> point<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.119> grave<00:00:18.330> just<00:00:18.690> because<00:00:19.109> I

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
that point to the grave just because I

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.609 
that point to the grave just because I
mean<00:00:19.980> it's<00:00:20.220> got<00:00:20.430> 50<00:00:21.000> rounds<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:22.020> each<00:00:22.289> magazine

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
mean it's got 50 rounds in each magazine

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.910 
mean it's got 50 rounds in each magazine
without<00:00:23.300> extended<00:00:24.300> mags<00:00:24.510> which<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.529> way<00:00:25.890> more

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
without extended mags which is way more

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.880 
without extended mags which is way more
than<00:00:26.160> any<00:00:26.490> assault<00:00:26.820> rifle<00:00:27.529> not<00:00:28.529> only<00:00:28.740> that

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
than any assault rifle not only that

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.769 
than any assault rifle not only that
it's<00:00:29.070> near<00:00:29.369> recoilless<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.269> does<00:00:30.599> have<00:00:30.720> a

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
it's near recoilless I does have a

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.330 
it's near recoilless I does have a
little<00:00:31.170> bit<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.320> recoil<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.800> do<00:00:31.859> like<00:00:32.189> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
little bit of recoil so I do like the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.520 
little bit of recoil so I do like the
throw<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> grip<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:32.910> silencer<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.440> on

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
throw the grip and silencer on it and on

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.900 
throw the grip and silencer on it and on
top<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.520> don't<00:00:35.610> need<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.880> extra

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
top of that you don't need the extra

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.119 
top of that you don't need the extra
range<00:00:36.390> for<00:00:36.630> assault<00:00:36.870> rifles<00:00:37.230> if<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.530> rush<00:00:37.829> and

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
range for assault rifles if you rush and

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.590 
range for assault rifles if you rush and
you<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.370> like<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.730> mean<00:00:38.879> even<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.180> three-bar

you have like I mean even a three-bar

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.869 
you have like I mean even a three-bar
rushing<00:00:40.079> you'll<00:00:40.920> just<00:00:41.070> destroy<00:00:41.160> people<00:00:41.760> up

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
rushing you'll just destroy people up

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.240 
rushing you'll just destroy people up
close<00:00:42.120> it's<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.660> very<00:00:42.960> high<00:00:43.110> damage<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.649> yeah

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250

cheap gun but hey if you want to learn

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.950 
cheap gun but hey if you want to learn
how<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.860> get<00:00:47.100> infinite<00:00:47.489> V<00:00:47.820> sets<00:00:48.149> then<00:00:48.809> you

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
how to get infinite V sets then you

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.779 
how to get infinite V sets then you
better<00:00:49.140> listen<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.770> surprisingly<00:00:50.579> enough

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
better listen in and surprisingly enough

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.090 
better listen in and surprisingly enough
I<00:00:50.969> only<00:00:51.149> get<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.480> or<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.379> first<00:00:52.590> V<00:00:52.770> set<00:00:52.980> that

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
I only get the or the first V set that

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.740 
I only get the or the first V set that
comes<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.430> game<00:00:53.640> because<00:00:53.820> three<00:00:54.480> minutes

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
comes in this game because three minutes

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.689 
comes in this game because three minutes
in<00:00:54.930> which<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.320> kind<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.590> important<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> mention

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
in which is kind of important to mention

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.779 
in which is kind of important to mention
this<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.859> once<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.010> get<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.460> loop

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
this is that once you get this loop

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.700 
this is that once you get this loop
going<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.809> really<00:01:01.079> easy<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.379> keep<00:01:01.500> going

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
going it's really easy to keep going

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.680 
going it's really easy to keep going
once<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.609> get<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.850> started<00:01:02.969> getting<00:01:03.629> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
once you get it started getting the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.030 
once you get it started getting the
first<00:01:03.870> ones<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.229> little<00:01:04.320> bit<00:01:04.530> difficult<00:01:04.890> then

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
first ones a little bit difficult then

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.980 
first ones a little bit difficult then
it<00:01:05.129> takes<00:01:05.280> us<00:01:05.460> about<00:01:05.610> three<00:01:05.939> minutes<00:01:06.090> but<00:01:06.390> we

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
it takes us about three minutes but we

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.500 
it takes us about three minutes but we
really<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.740> pretty<00:01:08.130> much<00:01:08.220> about<00:01:08.700> five

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
really have pretty much about five

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.539 
really have pretty much about five
minutes<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.170> solid<00:01:10.920> V<00:01:11.040> set<00:01:11.280> that's

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
minutes of solid V set that's

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.179 
minutes of solid V set that's
essentially<00:01:12.299> what<00:01:12.450> happens<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:12.900> game<00:01:13.189> but

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
you should use this as a game play just

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.730 
you should use this as a game play just
because<00:01:45.450> he<00:01:45.540> did<00:01:46.020> pretty<00:01:46.229> well<00:01:46.320> too

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
because he did pretty well too

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.980 
because he did pretty well too
but<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.549> did<00:01:47.850> pretty<00:01:48.060> well<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.270> think<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.570> get<00:01:48.750> like

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
but I did pretty well I think I get like

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.170 
but I did pretty well I think I get like
a<00:01:49.020> nearly<00:01:49.380> innate<00:01:49.649> kdr<00:01:50.009> not<00:01:50.579> too<00:01:50.729> sure<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:50.939> can't

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
a nearly innate kdr not too sure I can't

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.280 
a nearly innate kdr not too sure I can't
really<00:01:51.329> remember<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.689> think<00:01:51.750> nearly<00:01:52.020> innate

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
really remember I think nearly innate

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.770 
really remember I think nearly innate
kdr<00:01:52.680> but<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.850> was<00:01:53.970> really<00:01:54.149> good<00:01:54.270> game<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.750> I

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
kdr but it was really good game so I

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.810 
kdr but it was really good game so I
playing<00:01:55.110> with<00:01:55.200> him<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.740> game<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.189> really

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
playing with him this game and really

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.630 
playing with him this game and really
want<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.090> have<00:01:57.180> one<00:01:57.509> good<00:01:57.689> teammate<00:01:58.640> more

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
want to have one good teammate more

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.760 
want to have one good teammate more
would<00:01:59.820> be<00:01:59.939> better<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:00.570> one<00:02:01.110> good<00:02:01.320> teammate

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
would be better but one good teammate

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.440 
would be better but one good teammate
and<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.130> rest<00:02:02.310> randoms<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:02.939> also<00:02:03.180> really

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
and the rest randoms it's also really

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.700 
and the rest randoms it's also really
good<00:02:03.659> because<00:02:03.840> chances<00:02:04.290> are<00:02:04.350> you're<00:02:04.530> going<00:02:04.649> to

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
good because chances are you're going to

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.170 
good because chances are you're going to
get<00:02:04.829> most<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.549> kills<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.000> your

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.559 
get most of the kills you and your
friend<00:02:06.530> so<00:02:07.530> yeah<00:02:08.250> once<00:02:08.459> again<00:02:08.729> using<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.300> strong

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
friend so yeah once again using a strong

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.720 
friend so yeah once again using a strong
SMG<00:02:10.170> playing<00:02:10.770> Kill<00:02:10.979> Confirmed<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.550> pretty

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
SMG playing Kill Confirmed is pretty

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.280 
SMG playing Kill Confirmed is pretty
much<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.970> only<00:02:12.000> game<00:02:12.390> type<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:12.720> can<00:02:12.870> do<00:02:12.989> this

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
much the only game type you can do this

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.800 
much the only game type you can do this
and<00:02:13.379> just<00:02:14.219> because<00:02:14.459> if<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.849> if<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.540> can<00:02:15.659> get

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
and just because if you if you can get

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.449 
and just because if you if you can get
kills<00:02:16.049> and<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.319> get<00:02:16.439> 50<00:02:16.680> points<00:02:17.040> but<00:02:17.189> in<00:02:17.280> team

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
kills and you get 50 points but in team

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.039 
kills and you get 50 points but in team
deathmatch<00:02:17.489> you<00:02:18.000> only<00:02:18.090> get<00:02:18.209> 100<00:02:18.540> points<00:02:18.840> but

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
deathmatch you only get 100 points but

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.289 
deathmatch you only get 100 points but
you<00:02:19.859> don't<00:02:20.040> get<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.280> tag<00:02:20.459> so<00:02:20.790> if<00:02:20.939> you<00:02:21.030> really

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
you don't get the tag so if you really

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.270 
you don't get the tag so if you really
start<00:02:21.930> collecting<00:02:22.349> tags<00:02:22.560> almost<00:02:22.920> like<00:02:23.010> 50

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
start collecting tags almost like 50

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.000 
start collecting tags almost like 50
points<00:02:23.519> off<00:02:23.609> the<00:02:23.700> Pieta<00:02:24.030> made<00:02:24.480> me<00:02:24.629> angry<00:02:25.010> but

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
points off the Pieta made me angry but

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.160 
points off the Pieta made me angry but
if<00:02:26.129> you<00:02:26.219> get<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.489> tags<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.030> 250<00:02:27.750> points<00:02:28.019> per

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
if you get the tags and 250 points per

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.559 
if you get the tags and 250 points per
kill<00:02:28.379> so<00:02:28.829> and<00:02:29.280> plus<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.819> get<00:02:29.909> denies<00:02:30.239> that<00:02:30.269> are

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
kill so and plus you get denies that are

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.300 
kill so and plus you get denies that are
lying<00:02:30.720> around<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:31.290> it's<00:02:31.500> really<00:02:31.769> easy<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.159> get

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
lying around so it's really easy to get

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.690 
lying around so it's really easy to get
kills<00:02:32.579> and<00:02:32.879> lots<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:33.930> points<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.409> so<00:02:35.159> the<00:02:35.489> first

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
kills and lots of points to so the first

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.640 
kills and lots of points to so the first
things<00:02:35.879> first<00:02:35.939> you<00:02:36.540> got<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.930> get<00:02:37.079> your<00:02:37.290> UAV

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
things first you got to get your UAV

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.619 
things first you got to get your UAV

right

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.589 
right
I'm<00:02:40.319> right<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:41.280> what<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.030> need<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.239> do<00:02:42.329> is<00:02:42.480> get

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
I'm right so what you need to do is get

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.390 
I'm right so what you need to do is get
your<00:02:42.719> UAV<00:02:42.959> it's<00:02:43.290> pretty<00:02:43.500> simple<00:02:43.769> to<00:02:43.829> get<00:02:44.040> its<00:02:44.310> a

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
your UAV it's pretty simple to get its a

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.309 
your UAV it's pretty simple to get its a
few<00:02:44.579> tags<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:45.030> think<00:02:45.150> it's<00:02:45.239> 425<00:02:45.900> points<00:02:46.019> it's<00:02:46.290> a

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
few tags I think it's 425 points it's a

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.229 
few tags I think it's 425 points it's a
few<00:02:46.470> tags<00:02:46.680> few<00:02:47.010> kills<00:02:47.280> maybe<00:02:47.579> a<00:02:47.670> deny<00:02:47.939> or<00:02:48.090> two

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
few tags few kills maybe a deny or two

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.599 
few tags few kills maybe a deny or two
and<00:02:48.450> boom<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.170> got<00:02:49.290> your<00:02:49.439> UAV<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:50.010> good<00:02:50.459> thing

team that dies you get a UAV SS is what

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.970 
team that dies you get a UAV SS is what
that's<00:03:00.090> called<00:03:00.359> and<00:03:01.139> eventually<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.739> know<00:03:01.859> if

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
that's called and eventually you know if

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.770 
that's called and eventually you know if
you<00:03:02.099> have<00:03:02.250> really<00:03:03.030> good<00:03:03.150> teammates<00:03:03.629> or

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
you have really good teammates or

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.319 
you have really good teammates or
someone<00:03:03.989> gets<00:03:04.139> a<00:03:04.200> nice<00:03:04.349> triple<00:03:04.620> spray<00:03:04.919> or

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
someone gets a nice triple spray or

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.379 
someone gets a nice triple spray or
whatever<00:03:06.329> may<00:03:06.540> happen<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:07.459> get<00:03:08.459> quite<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.209> few

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
whatever may happen you get quite a few

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.970 
whatever may happen you get quite a few
points<00:03:09.599> from<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.290> normally<00:03:10.620> ends<00:03:10.859> up

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
points from it and it normally ends up

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.849 
points from it and it normally ends up
being<00:03:11.220> about<00:03:11.810> 70<00:03:12.810> points<00:03:13.109> or<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.349> 70<00:03:13.709> I've

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
being about 70 points or so 70 I've

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.399 
being about 70 points or so 70 I've
gotten<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:14.700> know<00:03:14.790> I've<00:03:14.879> gotten<00:03:15.180> UAVs<00:03:16.109> where<00:03:16.379> I

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
gotten you know I've gotten UAVs where I

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.500 
gotten you know I've gotten UAVs where I
get<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:16.829> what<00:03:16.980> people<00:03:17.189> get<00:03:17.280> like<00:03:17.430> 11<00:03:17.879> or<00:03:18.030> you

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
get that what people get like 11 or you

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.390 
get that what people get like 11 or you
know<00:03:18.569> twelve<00:03:18.870> kills<00:03:19.199> while<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.709> UAV<00:03:20.069> is<00:03:20.220> up

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
know twelve kills while the UAV is up

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.460 
know twelve kills while the UAV is up
which<00:03:20.609> is<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:20.879> lot<00:03:21.299> of<00:03:21.419> kills<00:03:21.659> in<00:03:21.810> 30<00:03:22.019> seconds

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
which is a lot of kills in 30 seconds

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.640 
which is a lot of kills in 30 seconds
and<00:03:22.879> you<00:03:23.879> know<00:03:23.970> hey<00:03:24.060> that's<00:03:24.209> 120<00:03:25.079> points<00:03:25.229> free

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
and you know hey that's 120 points free

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.349 
and you know hey that's 120 points free
for<00:03:25.889> me<00:03:26.099> which<00:03:26.489> is<00:03:26.639> going<00:03:26.819> to<00:03:26.879> work<00:03:27.000> towards<00:03:27.269> my

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
for me which is going to work towards my

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.000 
for me which is going to work towards my
lightning<00:03:27.659> strike<00:03:27.900> which<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.470> also<00:03:28.829> really

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
lightning strike which is also really

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.069 
lightning strike which is also really
good<00:03:29.159> because<00:03:29.370> especially<00:03:30.180> in<00:03:30.389> small<00:03:30.870> maps

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
good because especially in small maps

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.839 
good because especially in small maps
like<00:03:31.290> these<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.919> if<00:03:32.370> you're<00:03:32.519> killing<00:03:32.790> them

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
like these and if you're killing them

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.240 
like these and if you're killing them
really<00:03:33.090> well<00:03:33.209> here's<00:03:33.479> our<00:03:33.659> first<00:03:33.840> UAV<00:03:34.349> or<00:03:34.560> he

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
really well here's our first UAV or he

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.800 
really well here's our first UAV or he
set<00:03:35.489> three<00:03:35.790> minutes<00:03:36.060> forty<00:03:36.269> seconds<00:03:36.510> into<00:03:36.690> the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
set three minutes forty seconds into the

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.080 
set three minutes forty seconds into the
game<00:03:37.010> which<00:03:38.010> pretty<00:03:38.280> much<00:03:38.370> means<00:03:38.819> that<00:03:38.909> we're

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
game which pretty much means that we're

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.250 
game which pretty much means that we're
going<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.239> get<00:03:39.359> resets<00:03:39.870> all<00:03:40.049> game<00:03:40.229> long

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
going to get resets all game long

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.610 
going to get resets all game long
because<00:03:40.799> the<00:03:40.919> infinite<00:03:41.310> VSAT<00:03:41.940> trick<00:03:42.470> it<00:03:43.470> were

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
because the infinite VSAT trick it were

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.619 
because the infinite VSAT trick it were
really<00:03:43.949> it's<00:03:44.159> not<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.400> trick<00:03:45.030> or<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.239> glitch<00:03:45.540> or

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
really it's not a trick or a glitch or

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:46.939 
really it's not a trick or a glitch or
anything<00:03:45.840> like<00:03:46.019> that<00:03:46.049> it's<00:03:46.349> just<00:03:46.379> a<00:03:46.590> simple

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
anything like that it's just a simple

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:48.039 
anything like that it's just a simple
loop<00:03:47.129> that<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.459> can<00:03:47.609> do<00:03:47.699> with<00:03:47.790> your<00:03:47.879> friends

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
loop that you can do with your friends

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.439 
loop that you can do with your friends
but<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:50.370> way<00:03:50.519> you<00:03:50.579> do<00:03:50.849> it<00:03:51.000> is<00:03:51.120> once<00:03:51.329> you<00:03:51.389> get

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
but the way you do it is once you get

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:52.729 
but the way you do it is once you get
that<00:03:51.599> lightning<00:03:51.840> strike<00:03:52.079> you<00:03:52.229> call<00:03:52.409> it<00:03:52.530> in<00:03:52.620> on

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
that lightning strike you call it in on

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.009 
that lightning strike you call it in on
a<00:03:52.769> group<00:03:52.889> of<00:03:53.040> people<00:03:53.099> and<00:03:53.519> hopefully<00:03:54.019> ruin

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
a group of people and hopefully ruin

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.740 
a group of people and hopefully ruin
their<00:03:55.169> spawn<00:03:55.470> if<00:03:55.709> you<00:03:55.829> can<00:03:56.010> flip<00:03:56.250> a<00:03:56.400> spawn

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
their spawn if you can flip a spawn

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.300 
their spawn if you can flip a spawn
which<00:03:57.750> is<00:03:57.870> really<00:03:58.109> important<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.530> do<00:03:58.709> then<00:03:59.189> you

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
which is really important to do then you

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.770 
which is really important to do then you
can<00:03:59.489> go<00:03:59.579> click<00:03:59.819> all<00:03:59.970> those<00:04:00.120> tags<00:04:00.359> you<00:04:00.540> see<00:04:00.659> what

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
can go click all those tags you see what

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.809 
can go click all those tags you see what
I'm<00:04:00.870> not<00:04:00.989> saying<00:04:01.319> is<00:04:01.500> if<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.189> call<00:04:02.370> it<00:04:02.519> in<00:04:02.639> on<00:04:02.790> a

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
I'm not saying is if you call it in on a

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.909 
I'm not saying is if you call it in on a
group<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.239> people<00:04:03.629> as<00:04:03.810> your<00:04:04.409> teammates<00:04:04.739> are

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
group of people as your teammates are

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.520 
group of people as your teammates are
closing<00:04:05.489> in<00:04:05.669> on<00:04:05.819> them<00:04:06.169> hopefully<00:04:07.169> you<00:04:07.319> can<00:04:07.409> get

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
closing in on them hopefully you can get

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.960 
closing in on them hopefully you can get
the<00:04:07.680> tags<00:04:07.889> yourself<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:08.459> can<00:04:08.489> get<00:04:08.609> 100

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
the tags yourself so you can get 100

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.759 
the tags yourself so you can get 100
points<00:04:09.269> but<00:04:09.389> what<00:04:09.540> you<00:04:09.629> end<00:04:09.810> up<00:04:09.900> doing<00:04:10.109> is<00:04:10.349> you

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
points but what you end up doing is you

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.920 
points but what you end up doing is you
kill<00:04:11.009> people<00:04:11.159> in<00:04:11.489> that<00:04:11.879> wave<00:04:12.150> of<00:04:12.180> that<00:04:12.599> spawn

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
kill people in that wave of that spawn

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.809 
kill people in that wave of that spawn
and<00:04:13.199> then<00:04:13.739> you<00:04:13.859> can<00:04:13.979> go<00:04:14.099> collect<00:04:14.310> those<00:04:14.549> tags

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
and then you can go collect those tags

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.089 
and then you can go collect those tags
but<00:04:15.389> if<00:04:15.509> you<00:04:15.629> just<00:04:15.780> kill<00:04:16.049> them<00:04:16.229> in<00:04:16.409> a<00:04:16.470> spawn

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
but if you just kill them in a spawn

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.870 
but if you just kill them in a spawn
that<00:04:17.250> they're<00:04:17.370> spawning<00:04:17.579> in<00:04:17.729> quite

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
that they're spawning in quite

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.969 
that they're spawning in quite
frequently<00:04:18.329> what<00:04:19.109> you're<00:04:19.229> ended<00:04:19.409> up<00:04:19.500> doing<00:04:19.799> is

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
frequently what you're ended up doing is

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.039 
frequently what you're ended up doing is
just<00:04:20.579> killing<00:04:21.299> them<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:21.599> they're<00:04:21.870> going<00:04:21.959> to

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
just killing them and they're going to

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.300 
just killing them and they're going to
respawn<00:04:22.260> back<00:04:22.529> and<00:04:22.710> collect<00:04:22.889> those<00:04:23.039> tags

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
respawn back and collect those tags

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.640 
respawn back and collect those tags
which<00:04:23.580> is<00:04:23.820> just<00:04:23.969> going<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.240> deny

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
which is just going to deny

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.129 
which is just going to deny
points<00:04:25.250> and<00:04:25.430> you<00:04:25.970> only<00:04:26.090> get<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.330> 25<00:04:26.690> points

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
points and you only get the 25 points

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:28.990 
points and you only get the 25 points
per<00:04:27.169> kill<00:04:27.710> for<00:04:27.979> the<00:04:28.070> lightning<00:04:28.310> strike<00:04:28.520> so<00:04:28.910> you

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
per kill for the lightning strike so you

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.310 
per kill for the lightning strike so you
can<00:04:29.150> see<00:04:29.330> that<00:04:29.479> collecting<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:29.960> tax<00:04:30.139> from

this game that is making the V sets a

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.370 
this game that is making the V sets a
whole<00:04:42.470> lot<00:04:42.800> easier<00:04:42.830> which<00:04:43.729> I<00:04:43.850> suggest<00:04:44.240> doing

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
whole lot easier which I suggest doing

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.810 
whole lot easier which I suggest doing
is<00:04:45.380> one<00:04:45.680> thing<00:04:45.800> I'm<00:04:45.889> running<00:04:46.100> ghost<00:04:46.340> which<00:04:46.639> is

you can dolphin dive and continue

that's<00:05:16.639> where<00:05:16.760> you're<00:05:16.880> clicking<00:05:17.260> but<00:05:18.260> it

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
that's where you're clicking but it

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.969 
that's where you're clicking but it
lowers<00:05:19.039> the<00:05:19.160> UAV<00:05:19.550> from<00:05:20.000> 425<00:05:20.780> points<00:05:20.990> to<00:05:21.229> 340

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
lowers the UAV from 425 points to 340

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.760 
lowers the UAV from 425 points to 340
which<00:05:22.130> is<00:05:22.250> really<00:05:22.550> easy<00:05:22.729> to<00:05:23.419> get<00:05:23.870> 340<00:05:24.590> points

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
which is really easy to get 340 points

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.420 
which is really easy to get 340 points
that's<00:05:25.160> like<00:05:25.400> 3<00:05:25.850> 3<00:05:26.300> tags<00:05:26.539> and<00:05:26.720> a<00:05:26.780> kill<00:05:27.039> or<00:05:28.039> a

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
that's like 3 3 tags and a kill or a

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.089 
that's like 3 3 tags and a kill or a
couple<00:05:28.789> kills<00:05:29.030> and<00:05:29.210> a<00:05:29.270> couple<00:05:29.510> tags<00:05:29.720> and<00:05:30.099> then

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
couple kills and a couple tags and then

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:32.290 
couple kills and a couple tags and then
your<00:05:31.340> lightning<00:05:31.520> strike<00:05:31.820> is<00:05:31.940> lowered<00:05:32.150> from

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
your lightning strike is lowered from

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.320 
your lightning strike is lowered from
750<00:05:32.660> to<00:05:33.110> 600<00:05:33.800> points<00:05:34.099> that<00:05:34.460> is<00:05:34.610> a<00:05:34.639> full<00:05:35.000> kill

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
750 to 600 points that is a full kill

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.379 
750 to 600 points that is a full kill
and<00:05:35.570> tag<00:05:35.840> lower<00:05:36.470> than<00:05:36.740> normal<00:05:36.889> and<00:05:37.190> then<00:05:37.669> the<00:05:38.180> V

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
and tag lower than normal and then the V

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.270 
and tag lower than normal and then the V
set<00:05:38.660> which<00:05:38.840> is<00:05:38.990> where<00:05:39.139> as<00:05:39.410> you<00:05:39.650> go<00:05:39.770> up<00:05:39.950> really

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
set which is where as you go up really

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.100 
set which is where as you go up really
high<00:05:40.550> in<00:05:40.849> your<00:05:40.910> kill<00:05:41.330> strings<00:05:41.599> which<00:05:41.780> is<00:05:41.900> V

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
high in your kill strings which is V

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.900 
high in your kill strings which is V
that's<00:05:42.349> a<00:05:42.410> pretty<00:05:42.530> high<00:05:42.650> kill<00:05:42.889> streak<00:05:43.099> it

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
that's a pretty high kill streak it

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.460 
that's a pretty high kill streak it
lowers<00:05:44.300> a<00:05:44.419> whole<00:05:44.750> 3<00:05:45.620> 240<00:05:46.340> points<00:05:46.729> rather<00:05:47.470> from

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
lowers a whole 3 240 points rather from

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.310 
lowers a whole 3 240 points rather from
1200<00:05:49.039> to<00:05:49.070> 960<00:05:49.700> so<00:05:49.910> you<00:05:50.419> can<00:05:50.599> see<00:05:50.750> how<00:05:50.870> hardline

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
1200 to 960 so you can see how hardline

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.890 
1200 to 960 so you can see how hardline
really<00:05:51.680> helps<00:05:51.950> you<00:05:52.070> get<00:05:52.280> that<00:05:52.550> first<00:05:52.910> VSAT<00:05:53.510> and

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
really helps you get that first VSAT and

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.779 
really helps you get that first VSAT and
once<00:05:54.050> you<00:05:54.139> get<00:05:54.260> the<00:05:54.380> V<00:05:54.500> set<00:05:54.710> your<00:05:54.860> friend<00:05:55.250> now

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
once you get the V set your friend now

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:57.400 
once you get the V set your friend now
has<00:05:55.970> essentially<00:05:56.449> wallhacks<00:05:56.810> and<00:05:57.110> if<00:05:57.260> he's

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
has essentially wallhacks and if he's

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.839 
has essentially wallhacks and if he's
working<00:05:57.590> on<00:05:57.800> a<00:05:57.889> streak<00:05:58.130> then<00:05:58.490> he<00:05:58.669> should

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:58.849 
working on a streak then he should

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:01.120 
working on a streak then he should
easily<00:05:59.150> be<00:05:59.360> able<00:05:59.539> to<00:05:59.660> get<00:05:59.780> his<00:05:59.990> V<00:06:00.199> set<00:06:00.440> and<00:06:00.680> then

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
easily be able to get his V set and then

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.710 
easily be able to get his V set and then
as<00:06:01.220> he<00:06:01.460> gets<00:06:01.639> his<00:06:01.760> V<00:06:01.970> set<00:06:02.180> you<00:06:02.449> should<00:06:02.479> get

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
as he gets his V set you should get

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.810 
as he gets his V set you should get
yours<00:06:02.960> again<00:06:03.289> so<00:06:03.560> you<00:06:04.070> can<00:06:04.220> see<00:06:04.370> this<00:06:04.580> playing

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
yours again so you can see this playing

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.089 
yours again so you can see this playing
back<00:06:05.090> and<00:06:05.270> forth<00:06:05.510> gets<00:06:05.690> you<00:06:05.810> into<00:06:06.260> V<00:06:06.590> SATs<00:06:06.860> and

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099 
back and forth gets you into V SATs and

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:08.260 
back and forth gets you into V SATs and
that's<00:06:07.220> what's<00:06:07.430> important<00:06:07.820> about<00:06:07.849> this<00:06:08.060> game

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
that's what's important about this game

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.770 
that's what's important about this game
you<00:06:08.479> see<00:06:09.199> B<00:06:09.710> set<00:06:10.039> it<00:06:10.220> seems<00:06:10.610> cheap<00:06:10.940> because<00:06:11.479> it

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
you see B set it seems cheap because it

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.379 
you see B set it seems cheap because it
is<00:06:11.900> it's<00:06:12.380> essentially<00:06:12.860> wallhacks<00:06:13.280> and<00:06:13.550> the

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:14.389 
is it's essentially wallhacks and the

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:16.750 
is it's essentially wallhacks and the
most<00:06:14.570> important<00:06:14.930> thing<00:06:15.080> you<00:06:15.169> do<00:06:15.320> is<00:06:15.620> is<00:06:16.190> get

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
most important thing you do is is get

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.029 
most important thing you do is is get
that<00:06:16.880> V<00:06:17.090> set<00:06:17.330> and<00:06:17.570> try<00:06:18.199> to<00:06:18.260> keep<00:06:18.590> your<00:06:18.740> streak

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 
that V set and try to keep your streak

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:20.710 
that V set and try to keep your streak
going<00:06:19.310> for<00:06:19.520> some<00:06:19.669> reason<00:06:20.000> I<00:06:20.090> have<00:06:20.210> the<00:06:20.360> hardest

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
going for some reason I have the hardest

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.719 
going for some reason I have the hardest
time<00:06:20.870> keeping<00:06:21.560> my<00:06:21.740> streak<00:06:22.099> going<00:06:22.370> and<00:06:22.520> getting

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
time keeping my streak going and getting

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.089 
time keeping my streak going and getting
multiple<00:06:22.910> V<00:06:23.330> stats<00:06:23.599> per<00:06:23.840> game<00:06:24.139> now<00:06:24.800> some

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:25.099 
multiple V stats per game now some

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:26.320 
multiple V stats per game now some
people<00:06:25.190> can<00:06:25.430> do<00:06:25.580> that<00:06:25.729> really<00:06:25.849> easily<00:06:26.060> but

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
people can do that really easily but

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.969 
people can do that really easily but
seems<00:06:26.570> like<00:06:26.750> once<00:06:26.960> I<00:06:27.080> hit<00:06:27.260> my<00:06:27.440> last<00:06:27.710> kill

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979 
seems like once I hit my last kill

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:29.830 
seems like once I hit my last kill
streak<00:06:28.280> is<00:06:28.400> like<00:06:28.520> boom<00:06:28.699> I'm<00:06:28.970> going<00:06:29.300> to<00:06:29.449> die<00:06:29.599> or

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
streak is like boom I'm going to die or

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.270 
streak is like boom I'm going to die or
something<00:06:30.050> I<00:06:30.199> stop<00:06:30.410> aiming<00:06:30.830> I<00:06:30.919> stop<00:06:31.130> doing

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
something I stop aiming I stop doing

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.610 
something I stop aiming I stop doing
whatever<00:06:31.550> and<00:06:31.880> also<00:06:32.780> when<00:06:32.990> you<00:06:33.050> get<00:06:33.140> the<00:06:33.260> V<00:06:33.409> set

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
whatever and also when you get the V set

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.260 
whatever and also when you get the V set
one<00:06:34.099> thing<00:06:34.250> I<00:06:34.310> have<00:06:34.490> trouble<00:06:34.849> with<00:06:34.940> is<00:06:35.120> I

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
one thing I have trouble with is I

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.090 
one thing I have trouble with is I
essentially<00:06:35.750> stop<00:06:35.990> aiming<00:06:36.469> really<00:06:36.710> well

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
essentially stop aiming really well

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.430 
essentially stop aiming really well
I'm<00:06:37.550> not<00:06:37.760> sure<00:06:38.300> why<00:06:38.540> I<00:06:38.570> do<00:06:38.810> this<00:06:39.020> but<00:06:39.170> I<00:06:39.200> become

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
I'm not sure why I do this but I become

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.130 
I'm not sure why I do this but I become
lazy<00:06:39.710> and<00:06:40.160> I<00:06:40.310> just<00:06:40.520> stare<00:06:40.760> at<00:06:40.790> the<00:06:40.910> UAV<00:06:41.570> for<00:06:41.810> the

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140 
lazy and I just stare at the UAV for the

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.740 
lazy and I just stare at the UAV for the
radar<00:06:42.920> for<00:06:43.190> a<00:06:43.220> extended<00:06:44.060> period<00:06:44.330> of<00:06:44.390> time<00:06:44.450> but

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:44.750 
radar for a extended period of time but

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.290 
radar for a extended period of time but
you<00:06:44.810> can<00:06:44.990> see<00:06:45.200> how<00:06:45.740> easy<00:06:46.160> points<00:06:46.940> come<00:06:47.150> in

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
you can see how easy points come in

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.510 
you can see how easy points come in
whenever<00:06:47.480> you're<00:06:47.810> using<00:06:48.020> the<00:06:48.710> good<00:06:48.860> old<00:06:48.920> beset

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.170 
or infinite view set trick so I've

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.570 
or infinite view set trick so I've
already<00:06:51.650> gotten<00:06:51.800> the<00:06:51.920> lightning<00:06:52.190> strike<00:06:52.400> my

people if you're dealing with people
that<00:07:08.630> aren't<00:07:09.200> you<00:07:09.350> know<00:07:09.500> that<00:07:10.280> can't<00:07:10.550> get<00:07:10.670> a

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:10.730 
that aren't you know that can't get a

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:11.890 
that aren't you know that can't get a
visa<00:07:10.970> at<00:07:11.120> every<00:07:11.330> game<00:07:11.480> like<00:07:11.660> if<00:07:11.780> you're

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:11.900 
visa at every game like if you're

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.630 
visa at every game like if you're
getting<00:07:11.990> a<00:07:12.140> visa<00:07:12.320> at<00:07:12.530> every<00:07:12.800> game<00:07:13.010> then<00:07:13.520> you

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:13.640 
getting a visa at every game then you

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.800 
getting a visa at every game then you
should<00:07:13.790> be<00:07:13.910> able<00:07:14.000> to<00:07:14.120> do<00:07:14.270> this<00:07:14.420> with<00:07:14.600> another

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:14.810 
should be able to do this with another

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.650 
should be able to do this with another
person<00:07:15.200> that<00:07:15.320> gets<00:07:15.440> besets<00:07:15.950> each<00:07:16.340> game<00:07:16.640> and<00:07:17.570> I

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:17.660 
person that gets besets each game and I

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.840 
person that gets besets each game and I
get<00:07:17.840> a<00:07:17.870> visa<00:07:18.080> at<00:07:18.200> nearly<00:07:18.380> every<00:07:18.560> game<00:07:18.860> so<00:07:19.460> I

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:19.850 
get a visa at nearly every game so I

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.220 
get a visa at nearly every game so I
should<00:07:20.180> be<00:07:20.270> able<00:07:20.330> to<00:07:20.450> do<00:07:20.570> that<00:07:20.720> with<00:07:20.900> Huskies

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:21.230 
should be able to do that with Huskies

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.370 
should be able to do that with Huskies
because<00:07:21.410> he<00:07:21.560> does<00:07:21.920> as<00:07:22.130> well<00:07:23.020> so<00:07:24.020> with<00:07:24.230> those

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:24.380 
because he does as well so with those

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.770 
because he does as well so with those
two<00:07:24.440> people<00:07:24.980> works<00:07:25.400> perfectly<00:07:25.820> if<00:07:26.120> you<00:07:26.630> have

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:26.780 
two people works perfectly if you have

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.630 
two people works perfectly if you have
people<00:07:27.110> that<00:07:27.140> can't<00:07:27.530> do<00:07:27.710> that<00:07:27.890> then<00:07:28.460> about

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:28.640 
people that can't do that then about

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.280 
people that can't do that then about
three<00:07:28.940> people<00:07:29.270> is<00:07:29.390> the<00:07:29.480> perfect<00:07:29.870> number<00:07:30.110> for

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:30.290 
three people is the perfect number for

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.500 
three people is the perfect number for
running<00:07:30.590> this<00:07:30.740> kind<00:07:30.950> of<00:07:30.980> loop<00:07:31.160> so<00:07:31.670> the<00:07:32.270> final

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:32.510 
running this kind of loop so the final
