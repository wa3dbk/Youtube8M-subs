00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.559 
an eight eight and a half because I mean
they<00:02:38.900> plays<00:02:39.170> perfectly<00:02:40.060> almost<00:02:41.060> perfectly<00:02:41.480> I

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
they plays perfectly almost perfectly I

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.190 
they plays perfectly almost perfectly I
mean<00:02:41.980> it's<00:02:42.980> easy<00:02:43.250> to<00:02:43.519> get<00:02:43.640> into<00:02:43.939> it<00:02:44.200> fairly

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
mean it's easy to get into it fairly

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.630 
mean it's easy to get into it fairly
straight<00:02:45.709> simple<00:02:46.159> controls

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.060 

the<00:02:49.570> only<00:02:49.780> reason<00:02:50.020> I<00:02:50.110> don't<00:02:50.170> give<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:50.620> a<00:02:50.680> 9<00:02:50.890> or

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
the only reason I don't give it a 9 or

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.070 
the only reason I don't give it a 9 or
10<00:02:51.280> is<00:02:51.460> because<00:02:51.580> there<00:02:51.940> are<00:02:52.060> moments<00:02:52.300> when<00:02:52.780> as

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
10 is because there are moments when as

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.750 
10 is because there are moments when as
you<00:02:53.260> know<00:02:53.380> she<00:02:53.440> doesn't<00:02:53.770> grab<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.370> edge<00:02:54.490> when

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
you know she doesn't grab the edge when

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.390 
you know she doesn't grab the edge when
you<00:02:54.850> want<00:02:55.030> her<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.800> but<00:02:56.800> when<00:02:56.950> you<00:02:57.040> drop<00:02:57.220> off

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
you want her to but when you drop off

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.630 
you want her to but when you drop off
the<00:02:57.430> edge<00:02:57.670> there<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.710> sometimes<00:02:59.710> yeah<00:03:00.400> she

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
the edge there and sometimes yeah she

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.640 
the edge there and sometimes yeah she
can<00:03:00.760> get<00:03:00.910> sort<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.180> stuck<00:03:01.540> or<00:03:01.900> whatever<00:03:02.320> and<00:03:02.560> it

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
can get sort of stuck or whatever and it

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.830 
can get sort of stuck or whatever and it
can<00:03:02.740> be<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:02.890> bit<00:03:03.070> dodgy<00:03:03.250> but<00:03:03.760> really<00:03:04.450> that

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
can be a bit dodgy but really that

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.200 
can be a bit dodgy but really that
doesn't<00:03:04.870> happen<00:03:05.170> very<00:03:05.320> often<00:03:05.650> so<00:03:06.040> yeah<00:03:06.940> hey

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
doesn't happen very often so yeah hey

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.570 
doesn't happen very often so yeah hey
eight<00:03:07.600> and<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.810> half<00:03:07.840> four<00:03:08.410> yeah<00:03:09.040> hey<00:03:09.190> forgave

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
eight and a half four yeah hey forgave

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.020 
eight and a half four yeah hey forgave
me

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
me

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.340 
me
now<00:03:10.690> replay<00:03:11.200> value<00:03:11.610> hmm<00:03:12.820> I<00:03:12.930> always<00:03:13.930> find<00:03:14.200> it

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
now replay value hmm I always find it

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.380 
now replay value hmm I always find it
hard<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:14.770> rate<00:03:14.980> replay<00:03:15.459> value<00:03:15.670> because<00:03:16.240> I

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
hard to rate replay value because I

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.940 
hard to rate replay value because I
compare<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.959> stuff<00:03:17.200> like<00:03:17.290> final<00:03:17.800> fantasy

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
compare it to stuff like final fantasy

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.280 
compare it to stuff like final fantasy
which<00:03:18.459> is<00:03:18.490> obviously<00:03:18.940> got<00:03:19.150> like<00:03:19.540> hundreds<00:03:20.140> of

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
which is obviously got like hundreds of

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.610 
which is obviously got like hundreds of
side<00:03:20.500> quests<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.070> stuff<00:03:21.370> but<00:03:22.180> I<00:03:22.510> guess<00:03:23.260> I<00:03:23.410> give

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
side quests and stuff but I guess I give

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.990

this<00:03:24.540> six<00:03:25.540> yeah<00:03:26.380> a<00:03:26.590> six<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.430> replay<00:03:27.820> value

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
this six yeah a six the replay value

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.270 
this six yeah a six the replay value
maybe<00:03:28.420> seven<00:03:28.930> because<00:03:29.770> it's<00:03:29.980> got<00:03:30.100> all<00:03:30.160> the
