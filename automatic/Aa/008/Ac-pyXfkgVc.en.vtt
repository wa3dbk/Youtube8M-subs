00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.950
 In this video I am going to call you from Nielson and 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.060
 miss montreal 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.060
 let play along 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:25.369
 there are a number of according to it 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:27.140
 number first let the attack go 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.279
 so you can strum you 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:39.379
 and that is then to pom pom pom pom pom 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:46.640
 of so or you can do it with an attack 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:50.000
 and that sounds like late 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.929
 fails up up down 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.670
 down up so down once and then 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.179
 down up down up down 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.179
 up 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.390
 that is a fairly simple number 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.580
 chords that are in it is a ca 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.479
 agree and openshaw short and don't forget 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.090
 for you 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.670
 to put the chapel in the third position 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.700
 so you have a collective agreement you have a d 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.700
 agreement 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.540
 you can not agree 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.690
 you have a minor agreement 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.320
 and you agree to their hour and that a 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.890
 minor agreement that only comes in it 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.890
 also nice for that 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.270
 start with the intro 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.900
 the intro consists of the ca could two 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.950
 times 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.720
 d agreement twice the cattle agreement 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:02:02.120
 twice and it a minors 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:03.530
 twice so 1 2 3 4 2 2 3 4 2 2 3 2 2 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.490
 to none 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.490
 gt3 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.870
 in a day 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.569
 CD 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.659
 your fuse 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.659
 here 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.730
 in an idea 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.370
 now it actually starts with 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.390
 so you hit on the house next to me and 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.390
 then hammer with your middle finger 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.250
 that is starting and if you are sliding you can 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.250
 So it was spinning 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.380
 give this video 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:15.720
 and then here goes to the first verse 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.720
 and the couplet consisting of c 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.700
 bye 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.280
 and you 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.200
 so a 2222 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.030
 No 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.030
 edi nag 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.780
 how a 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.319
 Who 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:46.770
 both that being one more time I was right away 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.770
 bottom two times and winner none 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.760
 oh well 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.160
 then c 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:59.160
 and we walked on together and I thought and 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:04.770
 Lord stops that verse 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:08.040
 so and we walked on together and me 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.260
 thought and there you go to it 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.140
 Chorus 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:20.310
 and the chorus there is a g &amp; d and 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:22.620
 subscribe and a c and so no sense in that 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:27.740
 you only play once but not 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.740
 twice but once so that 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.780
 ngn 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.850
 and sentence 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.850
 the gdn 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:49.220
 and cm and here he traffic back to 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.220
 the a minor and then hd 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:59.729
 everybody 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:05:01.939
 so that is the chorus gdn cnv 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.939
 and 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.569
 a sentence 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.839
 nv 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:07.839
 am 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.170
 mtng 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.910
 then he goes back to the boarding school 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.910
 and 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.349
 well then get one with mechanic 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.369
 also a couplet and then one too 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.319
 Chorus 

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:44.809
 and after the chorus comes the bridge and that 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:47.990
 is how that is nice but how 

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:49.459
 bit of a saint but it takes 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.340
 the four sizes 

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:53.820
 it's how 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.820
 home 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.580
 and 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.129
 and then you have the chorus again 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:07.169
 you can also refine the denominator for yes 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:07.169
 call the outro and that is again 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.759
 no 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.950
 we see 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.950
 No 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:24.300
 tim 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.889
 and i thought 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.780
 and c and g and t 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:51.220
 and he agrees with the g agreement 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:54.320
 that's the whole number 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.180
 well if you want the chords then you have to 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:01.000

 momentarily 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.910
