 Cover on driver's seat to protect from wind or rain

 creating the vehicle model is not exclusive and precious of that time 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.330
 so the limousine culture started a car associated 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:27.600
 permanently to extreme luxury 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.500

 In our country

 Faust also had the initiative to create a limousine with his own hands 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.220
 and unlike the majority of models made he did it using a very 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.040
 peculiar 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.370
 the little me to you 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.290

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.830
 i + d in our country where these types of vehicles are not seen every day 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.189
 but favorite had the dream of building some and just did it

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.749
 conquer a dream of more than 24 years 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:35.660
 to assemble this vehicle 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.420
 three little Austin austin were used that were in disuse and their pieces of the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.540
 fish and more conditions but with a lot of creativity and talent he went thinking about 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.099
 how to occupy each one 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.280
 in a new model that was graphed 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.800
 and it was recreated several times from a computer taking into account 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.879
 the pieces that were available to choose the most appropriate 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.869
 this work has lasted about 12 months 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:04.509
 requiring assembling parts 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:06.069
 yes without the precision 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.369
 which for box 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.939
 It has been a tough challenge because he suffers from Parkinson's 

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:12.870

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.459
 tremors slowness and lack of movement throughout the body 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.399
 Parkinson's is the second most frequent degenerative disease after 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:27.299
 alzheimer 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.439
 as it is the case of the best boxer in history moja ahmed ali or 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.149
 recognized actor mark tullo info 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:39.499
 which are two of the 25 million cases in the world that as a Faust have been 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:42.849
 victims of this disease anyway 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.219
 although it is very preventive limiting 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:47.979
 It has not been an impediment 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:50.959
 Many elements of this model is recommended 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.699
 the lights that even the little details 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.389
 they were made by hand with great patience 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:59.939
 and as we could notice making a giant effort 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.609
 given the characteristics of his disease 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.699
 I feel that it is a great 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:07.629
 then for me he said is the truth 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.230
 the initiate a draft amendment of erc joan will take popularity

 if they would go from scrap to make an elegant built body 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.229
 by skilled Ecuadorian artisans 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.900
 he was made a complaint of some in an act of faith centimeters 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.610
 few as with seals 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:37.849
 but still 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:43.289
 missing the most important thing is the Marchioness at 10 am each element is going to 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.360
 be part of the interior of the vehicle 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.750
