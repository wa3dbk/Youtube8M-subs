you'll see guys that or we'll try to

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.000 
you'll see guys that or we'll try to
wrap<00:01:05.790> their<00:01:06.060> wires<00:01:06.330> around<00:01:09.590> not<00:01:10.590> really<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
wrap their wires around not really the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.850 
wrap their wires around not really the
best<00:01:11.040> thing<00:01:11.810> okay<00:01:13.640> as<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.880> notice<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.420> this

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
best thing okay as you notice in this

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.920 
best thing okay as you notice in this
punch<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.159> out<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.360> plastic

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
punch this out this is just a plastic

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.070 
punch this out this is just a plastic
cap<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:22.040> pulled<00:01:23.040> off<00:01:23.420> okay<00:01:24.420> it's

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
cap that can be pulled off okay it's

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.700 
cap that can be pulled off okay it's
made<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.939> be<00:01:27.090> threaded<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.750> we<00:01:28.470> have

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
made for this to be threaded in we have

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.749 
made for this to be threaded in we have
a<00:01:28.740> three-inch<00:01:30.079> clamp<00:01:31.079> connector<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.920> youth

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
a three-inch clamp connector and youth

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.380 
a three-inch clamp connector and youth
read<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.350> enables<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.159> to

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
read this in and that enables you to

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.149 
read this in and that enables you to
clamp<00:01:36.390> down<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.020> wiring<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.799> when<00:01:38.009> you're

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
clamp down on the wiring so when you're

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.160 
clamp down on the wiring so when you're
pulling<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> wire<00:01:39.180> if<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.630> gets<00:01:39.810> tugged

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
pulling on the wire if it gets tugged

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.340 
pulling on the wire if it gets tugged
kicked<00:01:41.030> basically<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.390> pulling<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.140> this

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
kicked basically it's pulling on this

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.670 
kicked basically it's pulling on this
not<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.979> wire<00:01:44.189> connections<00:01:45.380> okay<00:01:46.380> we<00:01:46.530> have

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
not on the wire connections okay we have

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.359 
not on the wire connections okay we have
that<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.159> let's<00:01:48.350> see<00:01:49.350> if<00:01:49.470> we<00:01:49.590> can't<00:01:49.860> feed<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
that in let's see if we can't feed the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.260 
that in let's see if we can't feed the
wire<00:01:50.579> through<00:01:50.610> there<00:01:52.460> we'll<00:01:53.460> try<00:01:53.729> not<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.090> use

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
wire through there we'll try not to use

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.600 
wire through there we'll try not to use
bad<00:01:54.630> language<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:55.740> they<00:01:55.829> can't<00:01:56.070> promise<00:01:56.369> you

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
bad language and they can't promise you

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.780 
bad language and they can't promise you

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.530 
and the green wire which is your ground
goes<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.810> right<00:02:32.290> underneath<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.819> green<00:02:34.090> screw

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
goes to right underneath the green screw

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.110 
goes to right underneath the green screw
I<00:02:35.910> mean<00:02:36.910> that's<00:02:37.030> really<00:02:37.360> how<00:02:37.690> simple<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:38.319> is<00:02:38.349> to

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
I mean that's really how simple it is to

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.740 
I mean that's really how simple it is to
wire<00:02:40.120> motor<00:02:40.630> ok<00:02:41.530> let's<00:02:42.430> put<00:02:42.700> this<00:02:42.910> tighten

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
wire motor ok let's put this tighten

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.800 
wire motor ok let's put this tighten
this<00:02:43.870> down<00:02:43.930> so<00:02:44.530> we're<00:02:44.709> not<00:02:44.829> pulling<00:02:45.099> of<00:02:45.340> the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
this down so we're not pulling of the

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:55.950 
this down so we're not pulling of the
connections

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.300 

and<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:57.310> again<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:57.970> noticed<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.660> lot<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:59.080> people

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
and this again I noticed a lot of people

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.980 
and this again I noticed a lot of people
I'll<00:03:00.310> see<00:03:00.640> their<00:03:00.820> motors<00:03:01.270> and<00:03:01.600> they<00:03:01.780> don't

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
I'll see their motors and they don't

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.290 
I'll see their motors and they don't
have<00:03:02.320> this<00:03:02.590> in<00:03:02.890> they<00:03:03.070> just<00:03:03.250> have<00:03:03.490> the<00:03:03.640> wire<00:03:03.850> fed

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
have this in they just have the wire fed

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.380 
have this in they just have the wire fed
through<00:03:04.540> there<00:03:04.840> so<00:03:05.650> if<00:03:05.950> someone's<00:03:06.670> walking<00:03:06.910> by

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
through there so if someone's walking by

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.900 
through there so if someone's walking by
and<00:03:07.450> kicks<00:03:07.930> your<00:03:08.140> wire<00:03:08.440> basically<00:03:09.310> they're

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
and kicks your wire basically they're

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.090 
and kicks your wire basically they're
pulling<00:03:10.300> on<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.570> connections<00:03:11.200> connection

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
pulling on the connections connection

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.100 
pulling on the connections connection
comes<00:03:12.370> off<00:03:12.640> touches<00:03:13.210> something<00:03:13.480> else<00:03:13.840> you're

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
comes off touches something else you're

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.950 
comes off touches something else you're
going<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.290> short<00:03:14.620> your<00:03:14.860> motor<00:03:15.130> out<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.810> in<00:03:16.810> all

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
going to short your motor out and in all

going to short your motor out and in all
honesty<00:03:16.990> it's<00:03:17.680> really<00:03:18.070> not<00:03:18.250> worth<00:03:18.310> losing<00:03:18.820> a

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
honesty it's really not worth losing a

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:29.990
