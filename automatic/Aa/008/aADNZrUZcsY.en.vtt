00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
reason for pain yeah her nervous system

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.789 
reason for pain yeah her nervous system
has<00:01:52.969> choked<00:01:53.240> off<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.899> kidneys<00:01:54.289> and<00:01:54.469> adrenal

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
has choked off the kidneys and adrenal

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.020 
has choked off the kidneys and adrenal
glands<00:01:54.979> aren't<00:01:55.189> gonna<00:01:55.280> function<00:01:55.549> right<00:01:55.850> she's

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
glands aren't gonna function right she's

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.240 
glands aren't gonna function right she's
going<00:01:56.149> to<00:01:56.240> have<00:01:56.359> malabsorption<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:57.859> I<00:01:57.890> got<00:01:58.100> an

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
going to have malabsorption so I got an

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.789 
going to have malabsorption so I got an
