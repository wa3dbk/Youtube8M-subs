 Your face is going to be giving you a 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.509
 but the only bad thing is that 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.549
 You can not keep these cars. 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.770
 in your garage if you could save 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.600
 the cars in the garage would be wonderful, huh? 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.479
 At least I can not, I do not know if 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.630
 no level so you can 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.910
 I'm at level 26 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.680
 5 to 26 something more or less so I 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.900
 I could not keep these guys in the 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.060
 garage and as you know I am 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.420
 giving the clueless cop to you 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.490
 They have to take a look also in s over right 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.000
 which are very cool cars very 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.470

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.050

 beauty before you ask the galley 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.710
 This video is not the one I saw, so I can 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.570
 Commented it's not always possible to record 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.350
 live videos that sometimes take place in the 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.540
 local 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.340
 It's all very fast and if you find a car 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.320
 there is also that you have caught 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.050
 unprepared ends up aggravating the gameplay 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.490
 then make the audio comment the audio by 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.680
