00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.100 
but um I think it's cool they've redone
this<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.990> much<00:01:07.170> cheaper<00:01:07.200> set<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.780> we've<00:01:12.900> got

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
this in a much cheaper set so we've got

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.450 
this in a much cheaper set so we've got
a<00:01:14.540> certificate<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.630> authenticity<00:01:16.049> card<00:01:16.710> here

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.190 

and<00:01:20.460> then<00:01:21.740> sort<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:23.390> card<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:24.840> Agent
