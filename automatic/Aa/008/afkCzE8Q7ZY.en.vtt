nevermind<00:04:56.540> I<00:04:57.910> mean<00:04:58.910> at<00:04:58.970> this<00:04:59.030> point<00:04:59.090> you<00:04:59.480> know

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
nevermind I mean at this point you know

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.150 
nevermind I mean at this point you know
bacon<00:04:59.810> can<00:04:59.960> realize<00:05:00.260> that<00:05:00.410> Gil<00:05:00.620> has<00:05:00.740> been<00:05:00.920> up

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
bacon can realize that Gil has been up

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.160 
bacon can realize that Gil has been up
being<00:05:01.550> and<00:05:01.730> then<00:05:01.820> holding<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.150> edge<00:05:02.360> because

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
being and then holding the edge because

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.480 
being and then holding the edge because
he's<00:05:03.320> waiting<00:05:03.620> for<00:05:03.650> bacon<00:05:03.950> to<00:05:04.040> do<00:05:04.160> something

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
he's waiting for bacon to do something

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.920 
he's waiting for bacon to do something
so<00:05:04.760> next<00:05:04.880> time<00:05:05.000> bacon<00:05:05.270> can<00:05:05.390> just<00:05:05.510> hold<00:05:05.660> it<00:05:05.780> and

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
so next time bacon can just hold it and

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.330 
so next time bacon can just hold it and
then<00:05:05.960> just<00:05:06.200> all<00:05:06.320> down<00:05:06.470> and<00:05:06.680> do<00:05:06.800> that<00:05:06.980> like<00:05:07.220> that

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.740 
then just all down and do that like that
yeah<00:05:07.730> that's<00:05:07.910> what<00:05:08.000> I<00:05:08.060> expected<00:05:08.420> it<00:05:08.510> to<00:05:08.570> do

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
yeah that's what I expected it to do

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.960 
yeah that's what I expected it to do
more<00:05:09.320> but<00:05:09.650> it<00:05:10.190> doesn't<00:05:10.430> matter<00:05:10.550> up<00:05:10.700> there<00:05:10.730> up

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
more but it doesn't matter up there up
