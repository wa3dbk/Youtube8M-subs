00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.920 
walkthrough is that I got it a little
bit<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.310> noise<00:01:32.460> towards<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.120> part<00:01:33.390> 20<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
bit of noise towards like part 20 of the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.570 
bit of noise towards like part 20 of the
walkthrough<00:01:34.290> series<00:01:34.440> and<00:01:34.740> that's<00:01:35.190> because<00:01:35.550> I

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
walkthrough series and that's because I

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.100 
walkthrough series and that's because I
was<00:01:35.850> playing<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.240> increased<00:01:36.720> difficulty

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
was playing on the increased difficulty

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.740 
was playing on the increased difficulty
emissions<00:01:37.740> were<00:01:37.860> literally<00:01:38.400> impossible<00:01:38.850> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
emissions were literally impossible to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.840 
emissions were literally impossible to
do<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.290> increased<00:01:40.680> difficulty<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.670> was

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
do on the increased difficulty it was

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.670 
do on the increased difficulty it was
just<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.120> huge<00:01:42.450> pain<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.690> the<00:01:42.840> butt<00:01:43.049> but<00:01:43.440> aside

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
just a huge pain in the butt but aside

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.170 
just a huge pain in the butt but aside
from<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.950> anything<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.670> terms<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.970> gameplay

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
from that anything in terms of gameplay

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.670 
from that anything in terms of gameplay
mechanics<00:01:45.870> and<00:01:45.990> stuff<00:01:46.080> like<00:01:46.260> that<00:01:46.440> we're<00:01:46.650> not

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
mechanics and stuff like that we're not

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.310 
mechanics and stuff like that we're not
really<00:01:47.280> an<00:01:47.400> issue<00:01:47.610> at<00:01:47.970> all<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.900> the<00:01:49.020> game<00:01:49.170> is

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
really an issue at all like the game is

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.060 
really an issue at all like the game is
very<00:01:49.380> well<00:01:49.860> made<00:01:50.100> for<00:01:50.370> being<00:01:50.580> on<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.000> Xbox<00:01:51.479> 360

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
very well made for being on the Xbox 360

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.110 
very well made for being on the Xbox 360
specifically<00:01:53.070> because<00:01:53.190> you<00:01:53.430> know<00:01:53.549> it's

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
specifically because you know it's

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.910 
specifically because you know it's
mainly<00:01:54.510> on<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> next-gen<00:01:55.350> consoles<00:01:55.799> because

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
mainly on the next-gen consoles because

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.710 
mainly on the next-gen consoles because
you<00:01:56.130> know<00:01:56.220> they<00:01:56.310> even<00:01:56.580> skipped<00:01:56.970> over<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.540> on

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
you know they even skipped over the on

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.530 
you know they even skipped over the on
PlayStation<00:01:58.290> 3<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.710> for<00:01:59.220> beyond<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.640> Xbox<00:02:00.000> 360

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
PlayStation 3 so for beyond the Xbox 360

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.210 
PlayStation 3 so for beyond the Xbox 360
it<00:02:00.659> was<00:02:00.840> very<00:02:01.110> well<00:02:01.409> made<00:02:01.650> because<00:02:02.010> there's

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
it was very well made because there's

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.010 
it was very well made because there's
barely<00:02:02.430> any<00:02:02.790> differences<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.930> only

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
barely any differences the only

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.080 
barely any differences the only
difference<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.710> graphics<00:02:05.400> and<00:02:05.610> I'm<00:02:05.790> telling

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
difference is graphics and I'm telling
