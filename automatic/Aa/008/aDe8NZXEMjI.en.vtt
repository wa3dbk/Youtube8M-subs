00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
the work that he's done at Arsenal but I

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.100 
the work that he's done at Arsenal but I
think<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.489> he<00:02:08.580> he's<00:02:09.030> not<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.209> fan<00:02:09.390> Arsenal<00:02:09.899> fan

at<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.349> end<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.679> day<00:02:10.799> and<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:10.979> think<00:02:11.160> what

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
at the end of the day and I think what

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.339 
at the end of the day and I think what
he<00:02:11.490> needs<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.700> consider<00:02:12.240> is<00:02:12.480> where<00:02:13.230> the

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
he needs to consider is where the

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.480 
he needs to consider is where the
conditions<00:02:13.709> are<00:02:13.800> best<00:02:13.980> for<00:02:14.099> him<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.280> win

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
conditions are best for him to win

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.250 
conditions are best for him to win
trophies<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.170> maximizes
