problem that I was having was any time I
move<00:00:12.269> my<00:00:12.480> left<00:00:12.750> joystick<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.530> would<00:00:13.769> get<00:00:13.920> random

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
move my left joystick I would get random

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.480 
move my left joystick I would get random
button<00:00:14.700> pushes<00:00:15.560> sometimes<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.680> triangle<00:00:17.250> would

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
button pushes sometimes a triangle would

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.080 
button pushes sometimes a triangle would
go<00:00:18.199> sometimes<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.470> was<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:20.330> r1<00:00:21.330> r2<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:23.090> found

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
go sometimes it was the r1 r2 so I found

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.950 
go sometimes it was the r1 r2 so I found
a<00:00:24.180> fix<00:00:24.449> for<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.949> it's<00:00:25.949> pretty<00:00:26.160> simple<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.699> just

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
a fix for it it's pretty simple I just

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.269 
a fix for it it's pretty simple I just
basically<00:00:29.150> disassembled<00:00:30.150> my<00:00:30.330> remote<00:00:31.289> if<00:00:32.040> you

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
basically disassembled my remote if you

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.770 
basically disassembled my remote if you
remove<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> screw<00:00:33.570> here<00:00:34.020> here<00:00:34.920> here<00:00:35.760> here<00:00:36.120> and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
remove the screw here here here here and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.670 
remove the screw here here here here and
here<00:00:37.190> it's<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.250> total<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.640> five<00:00:38.850> screws<00:00:39.300> and

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
here it's a total of five screws and

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.500 
here it's a total of five screws and
then<00:00:40.680> once<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.610> remove<00:00:41.879> those<00:00:42.059> I've<00:00:42.300> already

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
then once you remove those I've already

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.119 
then once you remove those I've already
done<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.020> sake<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.230> time<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:43.649> if<00:00:43.950> once

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
done it for the sake of time but if once

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.670 
done it for the sake of time but if once
you<00:00:44.190> remove<00:00:44.579> those<00:00:44.870> if<00:00:45.870> you'll<00:00:46.050> be<00:00:46.200> careful

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
and tilt this thing forward then your r2

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.450 
and tilt this thing forward then your r2
and<00:00:51.840> l2<00:00:51.899> buttons<00:00:52.440> won't<00:00:52.620> fall<00:00:52.800> off<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.250> just

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
and l2 buttons won't fall off and just

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.529 
and l2 buttons won't fall off and just
kind<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.670> wiggle<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.270> will<00:00:54.360> come<00:00:54.510> right

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
kind of wiggle that it will come right

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.970 
kind of wiggle that it will come right
off<00:00:54.890> just<00:00:55.890> slip<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.190> aside<00:00:56.960> now<00:00:57.960> once<00:00:58.770> you're

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
off just slip that aside now once you're

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.720 
off just slip that aside now once you're
in<00:00:59.160> here<00:01:00.440> your<00:01:01.440> battery<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:02.070> sits<00:01:02.489> right<00:01:02.670> here

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
in here your battery it sits right here

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.929 
in here your battery it sits right here
it's<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.149> great<00:01:03.660> thing<00:01:04.580> if<00:01:05.580> you'll<00:01:05.820> just

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
way and then there will be a screw

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.260 
way and then there will be a screw
located<00:01:12.060> right<00:01:12.450> here<00:01:13.670> now<00:01:14.670> for<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> sake<00:01:15.180> of

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.600 
of foam now once you get this ribbon off
here<00:02:15.530> this<00:02:15.830> foam<00:02:16.070> is<00:02:16.100> here

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
here this foam is here

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.970 
here this foam is here
this<00:02:17.300> foam<00:02:17.570> what<00:02:17.900> happens<00:02:18.260> over<00:02:18.440> time<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.860> it

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
this foam what happens over time is it

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.210 
this foam what happens over time is it
gets<00:02:19.130> compressed<00:02:19.490> and<00:02:19.990> so<00:02:20.990> it<00:02:21.290> doesn't<00:02:21.770> force

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
gets compressed and so it doesn't force

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.820 
gets compressed and so it doesn't force
this<00:02:22.580> up<00:02:23.090> there<00:02:23.420> enough<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:23.990> what<00:02:24.350> happens<00:02:24.709> is

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
this up there enough and what happens is

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.500 
this up there enough and what happens is
it<00:02:24.980> thinks<00:02:25.370> every<00:02:25.760> time<00:02:25.910> you<00:02:26.060> move<00:02:26.270> this

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
it thinks every time you move this

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.180 
it thinks every time you move this
joystick<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:27.110> kind<00:02:27.290> of<00:02:27.350> Wiggles<00:02:27.800> this<00:02:27.920> board

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
joystick it kind of Wiggles this board

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.030 
joystick it kind of Wiggles this board
well<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:29.240> thinks<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:29.740> you're<00:02:30.740> hitting<00:02:30.980> the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
well it thinks that you're hitting the

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.070 
well it thinks that you're hitting the
button<00:02:31.340> so<00:02:31.520> it's<00:02:31.700> making<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.360> button<00:02:32.600> go<00:02:32.720> and

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
button so it's making the button go and

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.240 
button so it's making the button go and
the<00:02:33.530> easy<00:02:33.770> fix<00:02:34.160> for<00:02:34.459> it<00:02:34.490> is<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:35.120> put<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:36.250> couple

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
the easy fix for it is to put a couple

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.330 
the easy fix for it is to put a couple
of<00:02:37.340> strips<00:02:37.610> of<00:02:37.760> tape<00:02:38.500> back<00:02:39.500> there<00:02:39.770> just<00:02:40.190> to

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
of strips of tape back there just to

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.170 
of strips of tape back there just to
thicken<00:02:40.550> it<00:02:40.820> up<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.330> I<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.140> use<00:02:42.350> black

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
thicken it up and I just use black

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.740 
thicken it up and I just use black
electrical<00:02:44.180> tape<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:45.650> just<00:02:45.680> cut<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:46.280> a

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
electrical tape you just cut you a

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.530 
electrical tape you just cut you a
couple<00:02:47.750> of<00:02:47.840> strips<00:02:48.489> or<00:02:49.489> even<00:02:49.850> just<00:02:50.000> one<00:02:50.209> strip

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
couple of strips or even just one strip

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.000 
couple of strips or even just one strip
and<00:02:50.720> roll<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:51.020> up<00:02:51.170> like<00:02:51.800> I've<00:02:51.950> done<00:02:52.130> here

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
and roll it up like I've done here

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.740 
and roll it up like I've done here
just<00:02:55.010> one<00:02:55.280> little<00:02:55.459> that's<00:02:56.060> probably<00:02:56.390> like<00:02:56.540> an

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
just one little that's probably like an

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.210 
just one little that's probably like an
inch<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.020> a<00:02:57.110> half<00:02:57.140> of<00:02:57.530> tape<00:02:57.739> and<00:02:57.980> then<00:02:58.100> it's

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
inch and a half of tape and then it's

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.130 
inch and a half of tape and then it's
just<00:02:58.370> rolled<00:02:58.580> up<00:02:58.730> if<00:02:59.300> you'll<00:02:59.420> take<00:02:59.660> that<00:02:59.930> and

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
just rolled up if you'll take that and

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
just rolled up if you'll take that and
you'll<00:03:00.440> set<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:00.950> back<00:03:01.160> there<00:03:02.950> it'll<00:03:03.950> give<00:03:04.130> it

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
you'll set that back there it'll give it

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.930 
you'll set that back there it'll give it
enough<00:03:04.580> thickness<00:03:04.850> that<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:05.959> will<00:03:06.110> force<00:03:06.940> the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
enough thickness that it will force the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.780 
enough thickness that it will force the
ribbon<00:03:08.360> forward<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.620> when<00:03:09.920> it<00:03:10.010> does<00:03:10.190> that<00:03:10.220> it

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
ribbon forward and when it does that it

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.960 
ribbon forward and when it does that it
gives<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.209> just<00:03:11.570> enough<00:03:12.549> contact<00:03:13.549> that<00:03:13.820> it

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
gives you just enough contact that it

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.130 
gives you just enough contact that it
won't<00:03:14.180> wiggle<00:03:15.130> wiggle<00:03:16.130> out<00:03:16.489> and<00:03:17.140> then

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
won't wiggle wiggle out and then

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.430 
won't wiggle wiggle out and then
basically<00:03:19.070> just<00:03:19.190> assemble<00:03:19.880> your<00:03:20.230> remote<00:03:21.230> back

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
basically just assemble your remote back

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.410 
basically just assemble your remote back
together<00:03:21.799> one<00:03:22.430> thing<00:03:22.670> when<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.120> put<00:03:23.299> this

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
together one thing when you put this

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.940 
together one thing when you put this
ribbon<00:03:23.630> back<00:03:23.870> on<00:03:24.049> you<00:03:24.590> want<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:24.769> make<00:03:24.830> sure

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
ribbon back on you want to make sure

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.680 
ribbon back on you want to make sure
that<00:03:25.190> you<00:03:25.370> line<00:03:25.580> these<00:03:25.730> holes<00:03:26.000> up<00:03:26.209> with<00:03:26.540> these

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
that you line these holes up with these

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.210 
that you line these holes up with these
two<00:03:26.900> studs<00:03:27.519> there's<00:03:28.519> two<00:03:28.700> studs<00:03:29.000> one<00:03:29.330> is<00:03:30.190> get<00:03:31.190> a

together if you clean these little

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.380 
together if you clean these little
connectors<00:03:58.100> where<00:03:58.820> it<00:03:58.910> connects<00:03:59.209> to<00:03:59.299> the

lot of hassle help clean up that

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.880 
lot of hassle help clean up that
connection<00:04:04.880> a<00:04:05.090> little<00:04:05.410> and<00:04:06.410> then<00:04:06.560> just<00:04:06.709> kind

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
connection a little and then just kind

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.460 
connection a little and then just kind
of<00:04:06.920> ease<00:04:07.100> it<00:04:07.250> all<00:04:07.370> back<00:04:07.549> together<00:04:07.760> and<00:04:08.470> then

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
of ease it all back together and then

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.550 
of ease it all back together and then
just<00:04:09.590> pretty<00:04:10.519> much<00:04:10.760> do<00:04:11.450> it<00:04:11.480> reverse<00:04:11.870> what<00:04:12.440> you

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
just pretty much do it reverse what you

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.380
