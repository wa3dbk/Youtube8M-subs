00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 know from all the boys and well found 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.109
 on my channel today I can also 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.790
 say welcome to my room that a 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.200
 spinning in disorder but we will pretend 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.670
 of nothing fortunately you cannot 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.650
 see the mess that is here or the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.630
 brothel that is there on my side then 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.260
 room that apparently in order but 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.000
 it is not 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.560
 I want to talk to you today about my 100 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.630
 multimedia in short as put in 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.970
 connection between them pc console 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.980
 a projector system cinemas all 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.140
 connected between the do's to notice that you can 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.849
 exploit simultaneously and without any 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.439
 encumbrance before starting I want to make you 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.540
 a small question has ever happened to you 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.010
 having to work in the dark backwaters behind 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.630
 to your TV to disconnect a 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.219
 hdmi high cable rather than a cable 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.110
 audio and will need to connect from 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.120
 television to another device in short 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.590
 I went to ravan behind the TV 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.200
 certainly yes something rather 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.420
 uncomfortable I have to say then why there is not 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.579
 try to create a multimedia center 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.989
 such that all the peripherals in 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.570
 your possession in this case the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.879
 projector spouses consul in 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.859
 carpet etc besides the computer and the monitors 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.780
 at my disposal we are all connected 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.510
 between us in such a way that with a 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.369
 simple gesture without going to get lost 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.510
 behind the TV but maybe never again 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.580
 find the right path 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.350
 in short, you can do it with a simple gesture 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.420
 that use them all at the same time 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.159
 the few words this my 100 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.930
 multimedia allows me to play on 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.090
 projector to one of those two screens 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.340
 drive behind me with the unics box 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.470
 one the playstation 3 or with the pc without 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.509
 do nothing you're sitting and quietly 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.250
 the power to peel from the perfect 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.140
 to the other directly with a click 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.270
 in short, you can imagine comfort and 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.220
 the practicality of everything seen in short 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.020
 that epson projector is treated 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.000
 only an HD output would never want 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.909
 say every time having to unhook maybe 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.350
 the HDMI cable from projected and connect it 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.850
 once the console you are in 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.250
 using the xbox live nation 3 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.009
 rather than the PC every time and it's one 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.270
 great break of you know the word 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.680
 that would follow this phase 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.720
 you can complete jobs if you want 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.130
 the crazy cool of this system is 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.020
 that I can also use 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.399
 peripherals that I normally use on 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.259
 pc also on console 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.450
 I mean it has no keyboard and mouse but 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.310
 but hayez and rather than at the cash desks o 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.890
 system or a cinema that I connected 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.189
 directly in the pci as cabbage 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.229
 do 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.770
 I read to do everything well 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.899
 one 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.879
 because if I have to explain it by gestures 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.290
 become a real crap I have it with 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.300
 I will explain to you how I have a little schemino 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.860
 connected together all these 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.560
 system and thanks to what 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.390
 everything starts from the pc because it is right at the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.700
 all these are connected 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.220
 console monitor projector peripherals 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.620
 the consoles are connected thanks to live 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.480
 gamer hd and the game bold jacket of the 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.760
 live that brand of is connected to the xbox 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.160
 live while broadcaster hd is connected 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.930
 to the playstation 3 regarding 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.239
 the monitor projectors instead are 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.579
 connected to the video card from the card 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.360
 video there are three outputs two of wight e 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.069
 a hdmi 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.400
 the two Rai TVs are connected to the monitors 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.290
 while the third is the hdmi and connected 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.700
 directly to the epson projector 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.230
 thanks to this system and above all the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.849
 integrated media cards or the 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.700
 possibility to receive directly 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.150
 console video and audio signal on the 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.980
 my pc 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.810
 in this way it is very simple to be able to 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.390
 understand that I will be able to use all the 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.980
 preferred or connected to the PC also in the 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.750
 when I use my console 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.700
 doing so at any time 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.530
 will decide to play on the monitor 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.940
 rather than on the projector 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.040
 as you have seen it is all very simple 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.510
 to take advantage of this system, it is enough 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.010
 connect everything practically to ours 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.540
 pc but there are two convenient 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.069
 the first having a card 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.810
 acquisition within our pc e 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.430
 it's money we have to buy one 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.579
 acquisition card that the son-in-law 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.060
 are 130 140 euros to be able to insert the 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.440
 our pc 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.819
 but this we say may not be a 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.470
 problem because if we were to register 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.090
 in short, gameplay would be an expense 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.799
 which we would have done anyway 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.389
 the second problem that this is always 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.980
 a 4 that from me I have to do so I have 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.109
 only so when to do two why 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.760
 are you can create confused le 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.500
 terrible confusions 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.630
 the second problem inherent to the 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.430
 fact that when we play on consoles 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.900
 which of xbox one and playstation 3 of 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.489
 we will have to have our pc turned on 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.769
 because you can imagine if the pc is 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.660
 off as a heck does not work 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.430
 it works and this could be a 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.109
 problem regarding it is not 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.730
 because I normally when I play the pc 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.200
 sky always on in the room if I'm up for 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.299
 to play do something and pc log on 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.730
 so something can make a video 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.470
 I can render I can reply to 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.970
 I'm working on messages anyway 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.530
 shots cicero always turned on therefore for 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.540
 what concerns me is not a problem for 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.950
 others certainly could say that I want 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.229
 just play xbox but i have to too 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.040
 we turn on the pc and pc and it is moved not 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.570
 it's close 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.560
 that's all, for me, about it 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.480
 very comfortable ie pc e 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.130
 close to each other and this system 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.690
 allows you to use them to the fullest 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.040
 also now I don't talk about it though 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.740
 even with my smartphone placed 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.930
 directly also transfer film or 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.410
 see in streaming directly on my 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.690
 mobile phone 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.460
 all the contents I grow or up 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.050
 console rather than on PC but of these 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.280
 things will be discussed in another video 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.139
 is dedicated to applications 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.090
 more pussies for android 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.740
 in conclusion guys this system is 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.570
 really cool about me 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.160
 really explained life a lot 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.870
 above all it is very convenient when 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.210
 I want to play on the console projector 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.400
 rather than from pc without having stanley 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.440
 to slouch behind the cables for then 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.000
 lose them don't go out I don't know you shit 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.340
 guys but if I have to put a cable 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.680
 without seeing the aux socket, that is, the entrance 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.750
 I'm there 20 minutes, I'm like that and it's also 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.150
 on the right side and then start ciraulo 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.370
 it's impossible to do it, I wonder who 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.400
 devil have the touch not to look 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.540
 the input is the input for threading the cable 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.760
 goes the tags 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.110
 nobody do I caria'm there 20 minutes 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.180
 if I have to do it if certain facts but every 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.710
 time I have to move and climb for 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.110
 see how the hell I put the 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.850
 hdmi cable on the vector project but now 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.229
 I no longer have these problems 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.270
 guys that's it for this video 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.400
 I hope you enjoyed it but gay that 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.229
 can anyone be inspired by
