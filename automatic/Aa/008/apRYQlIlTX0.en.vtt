like<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:12.730> reads<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:14.030> little<00:03:14.269> bit<00:03:14.390> red<00:03:14.630> from

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
like that it reads a little bit red from

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.140 
like that it reads a little bit red from
afar<00:03:15.260> but<00:03:15.890> i<00:03:15.950> like<00:03:16.190> that<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.459> actually<00:03:16.700> has

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150

without<00:03:39.290> being<00:03:39.950> read<00:03:40.250> or<00:03:40.519> you<00:03:41.450> know<00:03:41.570> to<00:03:41.630> mean

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
without being read or you know to mean

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.930 
without being read or you know to mean
some<00:03:42.110> other<00:03:42.200> dramatic<00:03:42.799> tone<00:03:43.010> but<00:03:43.280> I<00:03:43.489> really

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
some other dramatic tone but I really

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.240 
some other dramatic tone but I really
really<00:03:44.030> like<00:03:44.269> this<00:03:44.450> one<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:44.840> I<00:03:45.440> like<00:03:45.650> it<00:03:46.010> on<00:03:46.100> my

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
really like this one and I like it on my

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.600 
really like this one and I like it on my
skin<00:03:46.519> tone<00:03:46.760> so<00:03:47.030> my<00:03:47.180> guess<00:03:47.989> is<00:03:48.049> that<00:03:48.370> because<00:03:49.370> of

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
skin tone so my guess is that because of

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.460 
skin tone so my guess is that because of
the<00:03:49.640> orange<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.120> probably<00:03:50.540> tends<00:03:51.079> to<00:03:51.260> look<00:03:51.380> a

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
the orange it probably tends to look a

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.170 
the orange it probably tends to look a
little<00:03:51.620> better<00:03:51.799> on<00:03:51.950> people<00:03:52.280> with<00:03:52.549> more<00:03:52.760> olive

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
little better on people with more olive

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.640 
little better on people with more olive
complexion<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:53.900> that's<00:03:54.049> not<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.470> say<00:03:54.620> you

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650
