00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
there I hate Tim Burton's visual style

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.360 
there I hate Tim Burton's visual style
like<00:02:28.440> he's<00:02:29.440> using<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:29.800> blood<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.190> the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
like he's using the blood and the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.390 
like he's using the blood and the
trailer<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.090> then<00:02:31.209> he<00:02:31.870> uses<00:02:32.200> these<00:02:32.400> colorful

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
trailer and then he uses these colorful

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.699 
trailer and then he uses these colorful
images<00:02:33.910> that<00:02:34.180> just<00:02:34.420> they<00:02:34.750> don't<00:02:34.780> fit<00:02:35.470> in<00:02:35.590> the

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
images that just they don't fit in the

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.350 
images that just they don't fit in the
environment<00:02:36.010> that<00:02:36.310> he's<00:02:36.610> actually<00:02:36.820> using

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
environment that he's actually using

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.360 
environment that he's actually using
they<00:02:38.290> don't<00:02:38.440> fit<00:02:38.650> in<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:38.800> environment<00:02:39.070> that

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
they don't fit in the environment that

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.699 
they don't fit in the environment that
he's<00:02:39.519> using<00:02:39.790> so<00:02:40.209> it<00:02:40.420> just<00:02:40.630> it<00:02:40.810> seems<00:02:41.440> out<00:02:41.650> of

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
he's using so it just it seems out of

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.560 
he's using so it just it seems out of
place<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.519> doesn't<00:02:42.670> really<00:02:43.060> make<00:02:43.300> that<00:02:43.510> much

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
place and doesn't really make that much

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.770 
place and doesn't really make that much
