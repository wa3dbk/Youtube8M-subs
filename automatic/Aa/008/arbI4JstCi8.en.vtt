control some trap doors which out when
these<00:02:11.299> open<00:02:11.690> those<00:02:11.930> clothes<00:02:12.549> they<00:02:13.549> catch<00:02:13.940> the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
these open those clothes they catch the

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.880 
these open those clothes they catch the
sand<00:02:14.390> blocks<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:14.870> turn<00:02:14.989> them<00:02:15.170> into<00:02:15.230> items<00:02:15.650> and

sand blocks and turn them into items and
then<00:02:15.920> when<00:02:16.700> these<00:02:16.850> clothes<00:02:17.239> they<00:02:17.450> open<00:02:17.780> again

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
then when these clothes they open again

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.250 
then when these clothes they open again
and<00:02:18.170> drop<00:02:18.410> them<00:02:18.590> into<00:02:18.650> lava<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:20.840> won't<00:02:21.110> be

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
and drop them into lava so you won't be

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.050

be posting a link in the description for
because<00:03:21.260> on<00:03:21.440> it's<00:03:21.739> not<00:03:22.010> my<00:03:22.519> intellectual

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
because on it's not my intellectual

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.650 
because on it's not my intellectual
property<00:03:23.540> I<00:03:24.040> just<00:03:25.040> honestly<00:03:25.540> duplicated<00:03:26.540> it

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
property I just honestly duplicated it

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.360 
property I just honestly duplicated it
and<00:03:26.840> use<00:03:27.290> it<00:03:27.319> for<00:03:27.560> my<00:03:27.680> own<00:03:27.709> means<00:03:29.650> but<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:30.920> then

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
and use it for my own means but and then

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.240 
and use it for my own means but and then
also<00:03:32.150> from<00:03:32.750> that<00:03:33.170> signal<00:03:33.620> I've<00:03:33.769> just<00:03:33.950> got<00:03:34.099> a

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
also from that signal I've just got a

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.539 
also from that signal I've just got a
delay<00:03:34.640> to<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.540> reset<00:03:36.319> for<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.709> Jennifer<00:03:37.190> for

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
delay to the reset for the Jennifer for

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:43.599 
delay to the reset for the Jennifer for
the<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:38.720> wireless<00:03:40.750> just<00:03:41.750> a<00:03:42.190> good<00:03:43.190> few

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
the the wireless just a good few

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:49.990 
the the wireless just a good few
repeaters<00:03:44.090> on<00:03:44.930> full<00:03:45.380> I<00:03:45.590> think<00:03:45.889> I've<00:03:46.010> got<00:03:49.000> 359

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
repeaters on full I think I've got 359

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.490 
repeaters on full I think I've got 359
suitable<00:03:50.840> so<00:03:51.790> 36<00:03:52.790> sticks<00:03:53.139> she<00:03:54.139> gives<00:03:54.319> me<00:03:54.380> a

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
suitable so 36 sticks she gives me a

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.240 
suitable so 36 sticks she gives me a
four-block<00:03:55.280> I<00:03:55.459> wall<00:03:55.780> and<00:03:56.780> yeah<00:03:57.709> that's<00:03:57.859> pretty

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
four-block I wall and yeah that's pretty

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:07.770 
four-block I wall and yeah that's pretty
much<00:03:59.120> it<00:03:59.180> um<00:04:01.810> I<00:04:02.810> will

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.740 

just<00:04:08.410> actually<00:04:09.040> switch<00:04:09.220> this<00:04:09.400> on<00:04:09.600> pretty<00:04:10.600> much

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
just actually switch this on pretty much

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.170 
just actually switch this on pretty much
when<00:04:10.930> that<00:04:11.050> single<00:04:11.319> comes<00:04:11.760> you'll<00:04:12.760> pick<00:04:13.060> up

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
when that single comes you'll pick up

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.129 
when that single comes you'll pick up
the<00:04:13.270> boat<00:04:13.450> and<00:04:14.940> invert<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:16.060> signal<00:04:16.359> again<00:04:16.480> and

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
the boat and invert the signal again and

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.349 
the boat and invert the signal again and
turning<00:04:17.470> it<00:04:17.560> on<00:04:17.650> add<00:04:18.280> some<00:04:18.579> issues<00:04:18.910> before<00:04:19.329> I

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
turning it on add some issues before I

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.539 
turning it on add some issues before I
was<00:04:19.660> trying<00:04:20.019> to<00:04:20.169> send<00:04:20.950> a<00:04:21.010> positive<00:04:21.190> signal

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
was trying to send a positive signal

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.690 
was trying to send a positive signal
towards<00:04:21.910> this<00:04:22.090> way<00:04:22.150> but<00:04:23.050> whenever<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.700> torch

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
towards this way but whenever the torch

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.040 
towards this way but whenever the torch
would<00:04:24.940> be<00:04:25.060> spawned<00:04:25.360> the<00:04:25.570> boat<00:04:25.750> would<00:04:25.870> just

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
would be spawned the boat would just

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.480 
would be spawned the boat would just
drop<00:04:26.260> and<00:04:26.470> turn<00:04:26.680> it<00:04:26.800> back<00:04:26.830> on<00:04:28.080> well<00:04:29.080> that<00:04:29.490> the

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
drop and turn it back on well that the

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.270 
drop and turn it back on well that the
on<00:04:30.669> torch<00:04:31.030> on<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.300> floor<00:04:32.010> whenever<00:04:33.010> that

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
on torch on the floor whenever that

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.740 
on torch on the floor whenever that
would<00:04:33.370> be<00:04:33.460> spun<00:04:33.669> it<00:04:33.820> would<00:04:34.000> drop<00:04:34.389> the<00:04:34.450> boat<00:04:34.660> and

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
would be spun it would drop the boat and

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.440 
would be spun it would drop the boat and
turn<00:04:34.900> it<00:04:34.990> back<00:04:35.020> on<00:04:35.260> and<00:04:36.210> recycle<00:04:37.210> through

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
turn it back on and recycle through

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:44.060 
turn it back on and recycle through
giving<00:04:37.660> me<00:04:37.900> another<00:04:38.230> for<00:04:39.900> sand<00:04:40.900> blocks<00:04:41.430> so<00:04:42.430> I

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
giving me another for sand blocks so I

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.220 
giving me another for sand blocks so I
honestly<00:04:45.070> tried<00:04:45.450> too<00:04:46.450> many<00:04:46.810> complicated

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
honestly tried too many complicated

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.480 
honestly tried too many complicated
things<00:04:47.470> but<00:04:47.710> I<00:04:47.740> came<00:04:47.919> up<00:04:48.040> with<00:04:48.070> just<00:04:48.400> the

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
things but I came up with just the

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.340 
things but I came up with just the
simple<00:04:48.910> elegant<00:04:49.360> solution<00:04:49.720> of<00:04:49.840> inverting<00:04:50.260> the

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
simple elegant solution of inverting the

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.450 
simple elegant solution of inverting the
signal<00:04:50.910> works<00:04:51.910> out<00:04:52.120> very<00:04:52.150> nicely<00:04:53.340> well<00:04:54.340> yeah

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
signal works out very nicely well yeah

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.150 
signal works out very nicely well yeah
when<00:04:54.730> did<00:04:54.850> I<00:04:55.500> when<00:04:56.500> you<00:04:56.590> hit<00:04:56.710> the<00:04:56.770> button<00:04:56.890> down

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
when did I when you hit the button down

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.680 
when did I when you hit the button down
there<00:04:57.400> it<00:04:57.780> triggers<00:04:58.780> the<00:04:59.400> transmitter

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
there it triggers the transmitter

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.870 
there it triggers the transmitter
turning<00:05:01.690> this<00:05:01.780> on<00:05:01.960> and<00:05:02.430> then<00:05:03.430> that<00:05:03.640> just

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
turning this on and then that just

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.710 
turning this on and then that just
dipped<00:05:04.330> asus<00:05:04.690> and<00:05:05.340> give<00:05:06.340> me<00:05:06.460> those<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:06.880> then

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
dipped asus and give me those and then

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.460 
dipped asus and give me those and then
single<00:05:08.080> runs<00:05:08.260> through<00:05:08.530> after<00:05:09.370> 36<00:05:09.880> 6<00:05:10.090> and<00:05:10.330> 5<00:05:11.260> is

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
single runs through after 36 6 and 5 is

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.550 
single runs through after 36 6 and 5 is
an<00:05:11.530> arrow<00:05:12.000> turning<00:05:13.000> it<00:05:13.090> off<00:05:15.090> so<00:05:16.090> yeah<00:05:16.780> that's

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
an arrow turning it off so yeah that's

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.860 
an arrow turning it off so yeah that's
pretty<00:05:18.100> much<00:05:18.460> it<00:05:18.520> ah<00:05:21.270> this<00:05:22.270> is<00:05:22.419> actually<00:05:22.750> the

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
pretty much it ah this is actually the

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.480 
pretty much it ah this is actually the
first<00:05:22.900> thing<00:05:23.380> I<00:05:23.470> ever<00:05:23.500> worked<00:05:23.830> on<00:05:24.039> in<00:05:24.160> my<00:05:24.250> test

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
first thing I ever worked on in my test

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.290 
first thing I ever worked on in my test
world<00:05:25.470> back<00:05:26.470> before<00:05:26.890> retail<00:05:27.310> Jael<00:05:27.880> had

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
world back before retail Jael had

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.440 
world back before retail Jael had
another<00:05:28.720> San<00:05:28.990> generator<00:05:29.440> that<00:05:30.039> was<00:05:30.310> later<00:05:30.729> no

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
another San generator that was later no

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.940 
another San generator that was later no
more<00:05:31.840> walls<00:05:32.020> that<00:05:32.979> was<00:05:33.130> later<00:05:33.400> patched<00:05:33.729> out

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
more walls that was later patched out

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.860 
more walls that was later patched out
once<00:05:35.950> read<00:05:36.160> elit<00:05:36.460> so<00:05:37.270> that<00:05:37.479> was<00:05:37.600> kind<00:05:37.750> of<00:05:37.780> a

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
once read elit so that was kind of a

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.690 
once read elit so that was kind of a
disappointment<00:05:38.289> but<00:05:38.560> he<00:05:39.039> had<00:05:39.160> figured<00:05:39.460> this

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
disappointment but he had figured this

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.510 
disappointment but he had figured this
one<00:05:39.910> out<00:05:40.080> and<00:05:41.080> still<00:05:41.710> works<00:05:41.890> in<00:05:41.979> one<00:05:42.130> point<00:05:42.370> two

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
one out and still works in one point two

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.650 
one out and still works in one point two
point<00:05:42.700> five<00:05:43.200> so<00:05:44.200> as<00:05:44.850> I<00:05:45.850> figured<00:05:46.270> I'd<00:05:46.360> really

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
point five so as I figured I'd really

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.300 
point five so as I figured I'd really
jump<00:05:47.020> on<00:05:47.169> it<00:05:47.320> and<00:05:47.470> especially<00:05:47.830> with<00:05:48.220> the

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
jump on it and especially with the

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.510 
jump on it and especially with the
advent<00:05:48.580> of<00:05:48.760> wireless<00:05:49.000> redstone<00:05:50.250> it<00:05:51.250> works

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
advent of wireless redstone it works

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.940 
advent of wireless redstone it works
even<00:05:51.729> more<00:05:51.910> elegantly<00:05:52.330> and<00:05:52.740> also<00:05:53.740> with<00:05:53.860> the

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
even more elegantly and also with the

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.060 
even more elegantly and also with the
new<00:05:54.039> height<00:05:54.220> limit<00:05:54.550> you<00:05:54.820> can<00:05:54.970> put<00:05:55.150> it<00:05:55.270> up

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
new height limit you can put it up

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.800 
new height limit you can put it up
considerably<00:05:57.070> high<00:05:57.280> I<00:05:57.520> think<00:05:57.820> at<00:05:57.970> the<00:05:58.180> base<00:05:58.780> of

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
considerably high I think at the base of

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.230 
considerably high I think at the base of
the<00:06:02.490> house<00:06:03.490> generator<00:06:04.000> right<00:06:04.180> here<00:06:04.390> so<00:06:05.110> like

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
the house generator right here so like

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.520 
the house generator right here so like
137<00:06:07.240> 140<00:06:08.080> so<00:06:09.510> the<00:06:10.510> height<00:06:10.690> limit<00:06:10.960> really<00:06:11.200> helps

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
137 140 so the height limit really helps

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.120 
137 140 so the height limit really helps
and<00:06:11.820> the<00:06:12.820> wireless<00:06:13.030> redstone<00:06:13.419> really<00:06:13.810> helps

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
and the wireless redstone really helps

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:19.620 
and the wireless redstone really helps
making<00:06:15.130> this<00:06:15.659> just<00:06:16.659> a<00:06:16.810> beautiful<00:06:17.200> setup

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
making this just a beautiful setup

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.530 
making this just a beautiful setup
and<00:06:19.960> yeah<00:06:20.260> if<00:06:20.500> you<00:06:21.070> really<00:06:21.340> want<00:06:21.760> i<00:06:21.970> can<00:06:22.090> try

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
and yeah if you really want i can try

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.850 
and yeah if you really want i can try
tutorial<00:06:23.110> on<00:06:23.230> it<00:06:23.380> it<00:06:23.560> was<00:06:23.680> all<00:06:23.950> kind<00:06:23.980> of

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
tutorial on it it was all kind of

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.520 
tutorial on it it was all kind of
finagle<00:06:26.860> around<00:06:27.310> and<00:06:28.050> spread<00:06:29.050> them<00:06:29.170> all<00:06:29.230> kind

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.530 
finagle around and spread them all kind

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.910 
finagle around and spread them all kind
of<00:06:29.590> stuff<00:06:29.800> so<00:06:30.510> i<00:06:31.510> mean<00:06:32.230> i<00:06:32.320> can<00:06:32.470> give<00:06:32.560> it<00:06:32.650> a<00:06:32.710> shot

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:32.920 
of stuff so i mean i can give it a shot

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:39.410 
of stuff so i mean i can give it a shot
again<00:06:33.690> there's<00:06:34.690> a<00:06:34.870> tutorial<00:06:35.050> for<00:06:35.530> the

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:39.420 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.750 

wireless<00:06:40.420> receiver<00:06:40.990> that<00:06:41.800> I've<00:06:42.040> done<00:06:42.310> and<00:06:42.550> the

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:42.760 
wireless receiver that I've done and the

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.190 
wireless receiver that I've done and the
jl<00:06:44.520> 2759<00:06:45.520> i<00:06:45.760> think<00:06:46.060> it<00:06:46.150> is<00:06:46.180> i'm<00:06:46.810> not<00:06:46.960> sure<00:06:47.020> what

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.200 
jl 2759 i think it is i'm not sure what

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.250 
jl 2759 i think it is i'm not sure what
the<00:06:47.320> numbers<00:06:47.560> are<00:06:47.770> but<00:06:48.280> I<00:06:48.310> know<00:06:48.460> it's<00:06:48.670> jl

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.260 
the numbers are but I know it's jl

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.720 
the numbers are but I know it's jl
here's<00:06:50.260> the<00:06:50.290> tutorial<00:06:50.620> on<00:06:51.130> the<00:06:51.370> sand

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:51.730 
here's the tutorial on the sand

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.820 
here's the tutorial on the sand
generator<00:06:51.910> and<00:06:53.250> the<00:06:55.140> only<00:06:56.140> thing<00:06:56.260> is<00:06:56.410> I<00:06:56.770> know

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:56.830 
generator and the only thing is I know

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.320 
generator and the only thing is I know
it<00:06:57.040> would<00:06:57.130> say<00:06:57.480> only<00:06:58.480> two<00:06:58.810> by<00:06:58.960> two<00:06:59.020> floor<00:07:00.010> size

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.330 
it would say only two by two floor size

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.270 
it would say only two by two floor size
that<00:07:01.330> is<00:07:01.510> mainly<00:07:01.720> for<00:07:01.840> from<00:07:02.440> wireline<00:07:02.740> wiring

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 
that is mainly for from wireline wiring

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.730 
that is mainly for from wireline wiring
constraints<00:07:03.880> the<00:07:04.690> signal<00:07:05.110> that<00:07:05.260> comes<00:07:05.410> off<00:07:05.560> of

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
constraints the signal that comes off of

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.170 
constraints the signal that comes off of
the<00:07:06.430> pulse<00:07:06.790> over<00:07:07.090> here<00:07:08.760> can't<00:07:09.760> reach<00:07:09.970> far

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.180 
the pulse over here can't reach far

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.820 
the pulse over here can't reach far
enough<00:07:10.210> and<00:07:10.570> I<00:07:11.230> had<00:07:11.560> tried<00:07:11.830> doing<00:07:12.190> a<00:07:13.710> three<00:07:14.710> by

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:14.830 
enough and I had tried doing a three by

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.590 
enough and I had tried doing a three by
three<00:07:14.860> but<00:07:15.340> that<00:07:15.490> work<00:07:15.640> doing<00:07:15.790> work<00:07:15.880> either<00:07:16.090> if

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:16.600 
three but that work doing work either if

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.660 
three but that work doing work either if
you<00:07:16.720> throw<00:07:16.960> a<00:07:16.990> repeater<00:07:17.350> in<00:07:17.530> there<00:07:17.680> it<00:07:17.890> messes

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:18.670 
you throw a repeater in there it messes

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.580 
you throw a repeater in there it messes
a<00:07:18.820> pulse<00:07:19.210> and<00:07:19.480> does<00:07:19.780> not<00:07:19.990> duplicate<00:07:20.830> the<00:07:20.950> same

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:22.590 
a pulse and does not duplicate the same

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:27.960 
a pulse and does not duplicate the same
but<00:07:23.590> yeah<00:07:23.800> that's<00:07:24.640> pretty<00:07:24.970> much<00:07:25.090> it<00:07:26.820> thank<00:07:27.820> you
