00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 do you know what i have after that from that 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.470
 little 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.469
 what would you immediately that 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.639
 do you disturb the secret gardens of 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.809
 sittard 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.849
 you might not think so but 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.789
 there are 24 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.070
 the opening took place on Sunday 23 June 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.359
 initiator arrow touches bozelie and 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.800
 france and spain 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.689
 inspired the after examples of 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.250
 saw his secret gardens 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.900
 but these were self-made gardens 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.910
 while the garden and set waste for a long time 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.189
 exist and have their own history 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.630
 but he immediately his actually completely 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.219
 don't you him it are gardens like this 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.020
 that everyone knows or the people a lot 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.000
 know people but there is the stories 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.110
 behind and those stories that are often 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.460
 unknown 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.070
 and by linking those stories together 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.230
 you actually get paired up 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.890
 You can actually use the secret stories 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.480
 city 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.039
 the history of the city 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.870
 Another way to tell is that 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.730
 is the trick there disc in which a walk 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.469
 the gardens that actually already happens with 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.030
 good luck I must say 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.260
 and that will certainly be even more frequent from now on 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.879
 are going to happen 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.739
 today it was a festival where the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.940
 secret gardens we organize them 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.489
 some after the piece also on it again 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.080
 put some track on new walks 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.990
 there today to do some 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.150
 yes tired today it varies a lot 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.159
 poetry workshops 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.190
 singing like you behind me a little bit 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.260
 continue yes 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.920
 that of everything actually of everything glass 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.740
 lead art 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.180
 enter nicely together at theater lowland 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.710

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.920
 of all who is the project now 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.479
 actually means that is a double 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.890
 double intentions actually to 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.280
 start for the residents of the city 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.229
 self 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.700
 because that secret with being often 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.899
 secrets that the people themselves don't have 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.600

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.079
 allowing in the past 300 years 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.519
