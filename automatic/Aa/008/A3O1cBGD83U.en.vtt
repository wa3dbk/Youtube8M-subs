00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
first step is to drain the butter using

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.650 
first step is to drain the butter using
the<00:03:26.400> strainer<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:26.970> then<00:03:27.030> we're<00:03:27.209> gonna<00:03:27.329> sear

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
the strainer and then we're gonna sear

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.390 
the strainer and then we're gonna sear
off<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.019> venison<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.560> let<00:03:28.739> it<00:03:28.859> sit<00:03:29.130> for<00:03:29.160> about

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
off the venison and let it sit for about

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.729 
off the venison and let it sit for about
five<00:03:29.790> minutes<00:03:31.760> so<00:03:32.760> it's<00:03:32.910> strained<00:03:33.299> out<00:03:33.680> so<00:03:34.680> I'm

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
five minutes so it's strained out so I'm

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.470 
five minutes so it's strained out so I'm
gonna<00:03:34.950> put<00:03:35.130> this<00:03:35.250> strainer<00:03:35.579> away<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.299> then

reaction<00:04:08.430> where<00:04:08.579> you're<00:04:08.700> caramelizing

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
reaction where you're caramelizing

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.950 
reaction where you're caramelizing
protein<00:04:09.989> and<00:04:10.319> it<00:04:10.769> could<00:04:10.920> set<00:04:11.100> a<00:04:11.280> really

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
protein and it could set a really

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.010 
protein and it could set a really
texture<00:04:12.920> you<00:04:13.580> do<00:04:13.700> this<00:04:13.850> to<00:04:14.090> scallops<00:04:14.690> you

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
texture you do this to scallops you

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.560 
texture you do this to scallops you
could<00:04:15.650> do<00:04:15.800> this<00:04:15.980> to<00:04:16.460> basically<00:04:16.700> any<00:04:17.120> protein

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
could do this to basically any protein

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.010 
could do this to basically any protein
steak<00:04:18.050> chicken<00:04:19.010> as<00:04:19.370> well<00:04:19.660> so<00:04:20.660> let's<00:04:20.840> get

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
steak chicken as well so let's get

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.160 
steak chicken as well so let's get
started<00:04:21.470> so<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:23.060> can<00:04:23.270> tell<00:04:23.570> when<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:23.840> oil<00:04:23.870> is

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
started so you can tell when the oil is

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.110 
started so you can tell when the oil is
hot<00:04:24.320> enough<00:04:24.380> if<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:24.980> see<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.310> bubbles<00:04:25.700> as

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
hot enough if you see the bubbles as

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.780 
hot enough if you see the bubbles as
you're<00:04:27.110> putting<00:04:27.350> whether<00:04:28.130> it's<00:04:28.310> a<00:04:28.400> parsnip

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
you're putting whether it's a parsnip

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.080 
you're putting whether it's a parsnip
chip<00:04:29.120> or<00:04:29.510> a<00:04:29.870> french<00:04:30.290> fry<00:04:30.500> into<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.550> oil<00:04:31.730> I'm

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
chip or a french fry into the oil I'm

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.750 
chip or a french fry into the oil I'm
using<00:04:32.380> vegetable<00:04:33.380> oil<00:04:33.530> because<00:04:34.430> it<00:04:34.580> has<00:04:34.730> a

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
using vegetable oil because it has a

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.580 
using vegetable oil because it has a
very<00:04:35.150> low<00:04:35.390> smoking<00:04:35.870> point<00:04:36.050> so<00:04:36.260> it's<00:04:36.380> really

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
very low smoking point so it's really

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.940 
very low smoking point so it's really
easy<00:04:36.890> to<00:04:37.070> just<00:04:37.430> cook<00:04:37.700> through<00:04:38.500> so<00:04:39.500> what<00:04:39.800> we're
