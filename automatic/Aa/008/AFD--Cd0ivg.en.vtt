just let's just try it out I'm not a
great<00:03:54.570> control<00:03:55.570> user<00:03:55.900> but<00:03:56.230> practically<00:03:57.010> what

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
great control user but practically what

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.460 
great control user but practically what
it<00:03:57.340> does<00:03:57.519> it<00:03:57.850> keeps<00:03:58.060> you<00:03:58.359> those<00:03:58.690> targets<00:03:59.290> and

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
it does it keeps you those targets and

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.580 
it does it keeps you those targets and
you<00:03:59.640> simply<00:04:00.640> have<00:04:01.480> to<00:04:01.510> be<00:04:01.720> accurate<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:02.410> go

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
you simply have to be accurate and go

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.800 
you simply have to be accurate and go
and<00:04:02.739> click<00:04:02.950> them<00:04:03.130> you<00:04:03.400> can<00:04:03.549> even<00:04:03.790> go<00:04:04.120> down<00:04:04.359> here

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
and click them you can even go down here

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.500 
and click them you can even go down here
and<00:04:04.930> there<00:04:05.500> is<00:04:05.620> this<00:04:05.890> crosser<00:04:06.640> option<00:04:07.120> and<00:04:07.329> it

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
and there is this crosser option and it

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.780 
and there is this crosser option and it
will<00:04:07.540> transform<00:04:08.169> as<00:04:08.410> you<00:04:08.769> can<00:04:08.919> see<00:04:09.389> your<00:04:11.790> mouse

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
will transform as you can see your mouse

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.210 
will transform as you can see your mouse
pointer<00:04:13.120> in<00:04:13.540> a<00:04:13.600> crosshair<00:04:14.049> and<00:04:14.230> if<00:04:14.889> you<00:04:15.010> like

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
pointer in a crosshair and if you like

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.670 
pointer in a crosshair and if you like
it<00:04:15.250> I<00:04:15.639> personally<00:04:16.359> still<00:04:16.900> prefer<00:04:17.230> it<00:04:17.350> on<00:04:17.500> Mouse

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
it I personally still prefer it on Mouse

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.159 
it I personally still prefer it on Mouse
because<00:04:18.209> seems<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.329> little<00:04:19.630> bit<00:04:19.870> quicker<00:04:20.260> and

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
because seems a little bit quicker and

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.129 
because seems a little bit quicker and
well<00:04:23.169> that<00:04:23.380> that's<00:04:23.620> pretty<00:04:23.860> much<00:04:23.980> it<00:04:24.250> as<00:04:25.139> you

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
well that that's pretty much it as you

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.980 
well that that's pretty much it as you
can<00:04:26.290> see<00:04:26.590> it's<00:04:26.919> like<00:04:27.520> forces<00:04:28.240> you<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.389> aim<00:04:28.750> at

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
can see it's like forces you to aim at

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.260 
can see it's like forces you to aim at
the<00:04:29.080> targets<00:04:29.620> and<00:04:29.889> the<00:04:30.100> faster<00:04:30.460> you<00:04:30.639> are<00:04:30.669> the

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
the targets and the faster you are the

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.340 
the targets and the faster you are the
better<00:04:31.389> it<00:04:31.510> is<00:04:31.660> because<00:04:31.840> there<00:04:32.110> are<00:04:32.199> more

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
better it is because there are more

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.990 
better it is because there are more
targets<00:04:32.830> the<00:04:32.919> more<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:33.280> more<00:04:33.310> time<00:04:33.699> passes

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
targets the more and more time passes

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.450 
targets the more and more time passes
and<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.810> targets<00:04:35.169> become<00:04:35.440> more<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:35.949> more<00:04:36.190> and

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
and the targets become more and more and

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.969 
and the targets become more and more and
more<00:04:36.490> and<00:04:37.210> come<00:04:37.930> faster<00:04:38.440> to<00:04:38.590> appear<00:04:38.889> and

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
more and come faster to appear and

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.040 
more and come faster to appear and
disappear<00:04:39.070> so<00:04:39.699> that's<00:04:40.150> pretty<00:04:40.389> much<00:04:40.510> it<00:04:40.660> for

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
disappear so that's pretty much it for

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.930 
disappear so that's pretty much it for
