mantel attaches to the wall with angled
ledger<00:01:23.490> boards<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.869> find<00:01:25.109> the<00:01:25.200> proper<00:01:25.530> height

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
ledger boards to find the proper height

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.529 
ledger boards to find the proper height
for<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.070> ledgers<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:26.789> mark<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> finished

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.190 

we<00:01:48.939> started<00:01:49.329> with<00:01:49.540> an<00:01:49.659> old<00:01:49.810> wood-burning

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200
