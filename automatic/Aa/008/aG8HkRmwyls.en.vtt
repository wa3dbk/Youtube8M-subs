okay<00:00:02.340> this<00:00:02.700> is<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.149> new<00:00:03.360> ebb<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:03.840> flow<00:00:04.080> system

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
okay this is the new ebb and flow system

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.829 
okay this is the new ebb and flow system
that<00:00:04.980> i<00:00:05.009> designed<00:00:05.400> my<00:00:05.640> first<00:00:06.029> foray<00:00:06.390> into

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
that i designed my first foray into

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.990 
that i designed my first foray into
hydroponics<00:00:07.580> hopefully<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.610> can<00:00:08.730> get<00:00:08.849> the

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
hydroponics hopefully I can get the

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.970 
hydroponics hopefully I can get the
light<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.540> work<00:00:09.719> out<00:00:09.990> here<00:00:10.170> this<00:00:10.349> is<00:00:10.590> just<00:00:10.830> the

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
light to work out here this is just the

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.680 
light to work out here this is just the
growing<00:00:11.550> station<00:00:11.880> in<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.000> basement<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.570> the

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
growing station in the basement to the

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.440 
growing station in the basement to the
right<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.400> germination<00:00:14.400> tray<00:00:14.880> got<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.210> couple

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
right is germination tray got a couple

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.590 
right is germination tray got a couple
of<00:00:15.540> things<00:00:15.570> going<00:00:16.109> on<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.410> there<00:00:16.650> mm-hmm<00:00:17.600> and

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
of things going on in there mm-hmm and

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.480 
of things going on in there mm-hmm and
then<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.439> course<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.800> lights<00:00:20.010> above<00:00:20.279> but

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
then of course the lights above but

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.070 
then of course the lights above but
let's<00:00:20.670> talk<00:00:20.880> about<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.420> hydro<00:00:21.840> system<00:00:22.439> the

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
let's talk about the hydro system the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.720 
let's talk about the hydro system the
the<00:00:25.080> tray<00:00:25.320> on<00:00:25.439> top<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.980> actually<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.490> grow

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
the tray on top is actually the grow

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.330 
the tray on top is actually the grow
tray<00:00:27.289> and<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.560> where<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.830> plants<00:00:29.220> will

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
tray and it is where the plants will

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.910 
tray and it is where the plants will
actually<00:00:29.789> sit<00:00:30.210> okay<00:00:31.170> underneath<00:00:31.800> these

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
actually sit okay underneath these

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.520 
actually sit okay underneath these
neoprene<00:00:32.430> covers<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.180> actually<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.290> grow

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
neoprene covers is actually the grow

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.520 
neoprene covers is actually the grow
medium<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.399> some<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.880> them<00:00:36.030> such<00:00:36.930> as<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.290> one

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
medium and some of them such as this one

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.750 
medium and some of them such as this one
but<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:39.000> covers<00:00:39.360> prevent<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.379> light<00:00:40.760> from

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
but the covers prevent the light from

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.760 
but the covers prevent the light from
entering<00:00:42.149> down<00:00:42.390> into<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.410> they<00:00:43.469> have<00:00:43.620> an

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
entering down into and they have an

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.830 
entering down into and they have an
exposure<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.399> water<00:00:44.610> keep<00:00:45.180> an<00:00:45.300> algae<00:00:45.660> out

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
exposure to the water keep an algae out

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.830 
exposure to the water keep an algae out
if<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.890> look<00:00:47.070> at<00:00:47.309> when<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.120> lift<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.420> net<00:00:48.600> pots

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
if you look at when I lift the net pots

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.410 
if you look at when I lift the net pots
out<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.230> here<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.610> can<00:00:50.760> see<00:00:50.969> down<00:00:51.180> below

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
out of here if we can see down below

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.660 
out of here if we can see down below
what<00:00:51.870> we<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.620> basically<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.129> filled<00:00:53.430> rain

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
what we have is basically a filled rain

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.209 
what we have is basically a filled rain
that<00:00:53.879> will<00:00:53.969> fill<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.420> up<00:00:54.710> and<00:00:55.710> we'll<00:00:55.949> raise

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
that will fill this up and we'll raise

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.819 
that will fill this up and we'll raise
this<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.820> level<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.449> about<00:00:57.809> right<00:00:58.170> here<00:00:58.559> so

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
this to the level of about right here so

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.569 
this to the level of about right here so
really<00:00:59.010> inside<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.730> pots<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:01.440> level<00:01:02.370> that

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
really inside the pots the level that

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.280 
really inside the pots the level that
it'll<00:01:02.789> fill<00:01:02.969> two<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.449> about<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:04.019> line

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
it'll fill two is about this line

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.679 
it'll fill two is about this line
soaking<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> rocks<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.000> then<00:01:06.119> feeding<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
soaking the rocks and then feeding the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.600 
soaking the rocks and then feeding the
the<00:01:07.170> roots<00:01:07.380> course<00:01:07.710> plants<00:01:08.130> will<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.430> here

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
the roots course plants will be in here

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.270 
the roots course plants will be in here
growing<00:01:08.970> out<00:01:09.140> also<00:01:10.140> inside<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.740> reservoir

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
growing out also inside this reservoir

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.690 
growing out also inside this reservoir
or<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.760> tray<00:01:12.000> as<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.360> were<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:14.460> filled

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
or the tray as you were is the filled

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.940 
or the tray as you were is the filled
rain<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.390> once<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.869> gets<00:01:16.080> up<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.500> level<00:01:16.710> it

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
rain so once it gets up to that level it

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.320 
rain so once it gets up to that level it
will<00:01:17.009> automatically<00:01:17.460> start<00:01:17.759> draining<00:01:18.030> back

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
will automatically start draining back

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.820 
will automatically start draining back
into<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> reservoir<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.530> way<00:01:19.650> it'll

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
into the reservoir that way it'll

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.429 
into the reservoir that way it'll
prevent<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.400> cannot<00:01:20.790> overflow<00:01:21.360> it'll<00:01:22.200> stay<00:01:22.350> on

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
prevent it cannot overflow it'll stay on

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.850 
prevent it cannot overflow it'll stay on
for<00:01:22.590> about<00:01:22.680> 15<00:01:23.159> minutes<00:01:23.340> soaking<00:01:23.909> all<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.270> the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
for about 15 minutes soaking all of the

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.980 
for about 15 minutes soaking all of the
the<00:01:25.860> growing<00:01:26.220> media<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.390> then<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.689> will<00:01:27.780> drain

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the growing media and then it will drain

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.399 
the growing media and then it will drain
and<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.619> drains<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.979> sucks<00:01:29.280> oxygen<00:01:29.909> down<00:01:30.090> in

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
and as it drains it sucks oxygen down in

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.690 
and as it drains it sucks oxygen down in
okay<00:01:31.409> further<00:01:31.829> stimulating<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.430> plant

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
okay further stimulating the plant

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.950 
okay further stimulating the plant
growth<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.119> goes<00:01:33.270> back<00:01:33.450> into<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.750> reservoir

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
growth and goes back into the reservoir

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.109 
growth and goes back into the reservoir
so<00:01:34.500> take<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> look<00:01:35.100> at<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.460> reservoir<00:01:35.850> down

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
so take a look at the reservoir down

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.749 
so take a look at the reservoir down
below<00:01:36.450> what<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:36.720> got<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.049> another<00:01:37.320> about<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.100> 60

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
below what we got is another about a 60

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.050 
below what we got is another about a 60
court<00:01:39.530> sterilite<00:01:40.530> container<00:01:41.009> larger<00:01:41.909> than

court sterilite container larger than

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.330 
court sterilite container larger than
the<00:01:42.210> one<00:01:42.329> before<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.899> I'm<00:01:43.799> setting<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.130> up<00:01:44.220> to

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
the one before and I'm setting it up to

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.499 
the one before and I'm setting it up to
hold<00:01:44.460> about<00:01:44.640> nine<00:01:44.909> gallons<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.869> nutrients<00:01:47.509> and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
overflow drain that will drain back down

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.350 
overflow drain that will drain back down
from<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.950> from<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.340> tray<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
from the from the tray and this is the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.660 
from the from the tray and this is the
the<00:01:58.320> actual<00:01:58.500> pump<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.460> where<00:01:59.579> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
the actual pump so this is where the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.700 
the actual pump so this is where the
water<00:01:59.850> is<00:01:59.939> pumped<00:02:00.210> from<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.840> reservoir<00:02:01.320> with

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
water is pumped from the reservoir with

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.730 
water is pumped from the reservoir with
the<00:02:01.829> nutrient<00:02:02.189> solution<00:02:02.610> through<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.360> tube

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
the nutrient solution through this tube

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.490 
the nutrient solution through this tube
into<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.100> tray<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.610> that's<00:02:05.880> what<00:02:06.290> feeds<00:02:07.290> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
into the tray and that's what feeds the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.680 
into the tray and that's what feeds the
plants

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
plants

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.350 
plants
of<00:02:09.590> course<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:10.010> the<00:02:10.250> outlet<00:02:10.790> cord<00:02:11.090> for<00:02:11.330> the

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
of course the the outlet cord for the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.720 
of course the the outlet cord for the
pump<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:11.930> then<00:02:12.410> here<00:02:12.890> we<00:02:12.920> have<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.220> standard

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
pump and then here we have a standard

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.350 
pump and then here we have a standard
air<00:02:14.030> hose<00:02:14.830> which<00:02:15.830> is<00:02:16.010> running<00:02:16.340> from<00:02:16.700> this<00:02:17.120> air

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
air hose which is running from this air

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.190 
air hose which is running from this air
pump<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.990> a<00:02:18.770> standard<00:02:19.130> air<00:02:19.310> stone<00:02:19.730> so<00:02:20.690> inside

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
pump and a standard air stone so inside

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.780 
pump and a standard air stone so inside
I'm<00:02:21.680> not<00:02:21.830> sure<00:02:22.010> if<00:02:22.070> we'll<00:02:22.190> be<00:02:22.340> able<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.610> see

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
I'm not sure if we'll be able to see

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
I'm not sure if we'll be able to see
inside<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:24.260> lighting<00:02:25.240> yeah<00:02:26.240> looks<00:02:26.600> like<00:02:26.660> it

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
inside the lighting yeah looks like it

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.640 
inside the lighting yeah looks like it
there's<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.320> common<00:02:28.750> garden-variety<00:02:29.750> pond

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
there's a common garden-variety pond

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.220 
there's a common garden-variety pond
pump<00:02:31.070> which<00:02:31.430> is<00:02:31.580> going<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.820> push<00:02:32.090> that

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
pump which is going to push that

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.410 
pump which is going to push that
solution<00:02:33.230> up<00:02:33.680> into<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.370> into<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:34.910> tray<00:02:35.150> and

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
solution up into the into the tray and

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.880 
solution up into the into the tray and
then<00:02:35.690> of<00:02:35.780> course<00:02:35.960> you<00:02:36.110> can<00:02:36.260> see<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.530> air<00:02:36.650> pump

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
then of course you can see the air pump

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.050 
then of course you can see the air pump
with<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:38.110> air<00:02:39.110> stone<00:02:39.460> the<00:02:40.460> air<00:02:40.640> stone<00:02:40.880> is

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
with the air stone the air stone is

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.730 
with the air stone the air stone is
needed<00:02:41.390> for<00:02:41.600> is<00:02:41.780> that<00:02:41.900> pumps<00:02:42.230> continuous

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
needed for is that pumps continuous

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.180 
needed for is that pumps continuous
oxygen<00:02:43.310> into<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:44.000> system<00:02:44.950> keeping<00:02:45.950> keeping

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
oxygen into the system keeping keeping

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.670 
oxygen into the system keeping keeping
that<00:02:46.400> nutrient<00:02:47.090> solution<00:02:47.450> oxygen<00:02:47.750> oxygenated

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
that nutrient solution oxygen oxygenated

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.160 
that nutrient solution oxygen oxygenated
of<00:02:48.800> course<00:02:48.980> for<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.310> plant<00:02:49.520> roots<00:02:49.810> so<00:02:50.810> that<00:02:50.990> is

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
of course for the plant roots so that is

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.960 
of course for the plant roots so that is
our<00:02:51.350> system<00:02:51.910> as<00:02:52.910> it<00:02:52.970> exists<00:02:53.720> right<00:02:54.200> now<00:02:54.530> and

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
our system as it exists right now and

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.250 
our system as it exists right now and
you<00:02:55.970> can<00:02:56.060> see<00:02:56.240> the<00:02:56.360> space<00:02:56.540> I<00:02:56.750> built<00:02:56.990> in<00:02:57.170> the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
you can see the space I built in the

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.110 
you can see the space I built in the
shelving<00:02:57.680> I<00:02:57.830> do<00:02:57.890> intend<00:02:58.220> on<00:02:59.200> another<00:03:00.820> ebb<00:03:01.820> and

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
shelving I do intend on another ebb and

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.640 
shelving I do intend on another ebb and
flow<00:03:02.330> system<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:02.870> will<00:03:02.930> sit<00:03:03.140> right<00:03:03.290> next<00:03:03.470> to

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
flow system that will sit right next to

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.310 
flow system that will sit right next to
it<00:03:03.740> identically<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.700> then<00:03:05.330> further<00:03:05.570> on<00:03:05.840> will

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
it identically and then further on will

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.190 
it identically and then further on will
grow<00:03:06.470> a<00:03:06.500> little<00:03:06.650> bit<00:03:06.890> bigger<00:03:07.660> bigger<00:03:08.660> pots<00:03:08.960> for

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
grow a little bit bigger bigger pots for

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.050 
grow a little bit bigger bigger pots for
some<00:03:09.380> bigger<00:03:09.680> plants<00:03:10.010> this<00:03:10.370> system<00:03:10.880> right

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
some bigger plants this system right

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.030 
some bigger plants this system right
here<00:03:11.090> would<00:03:11.480> have<00:03:11.630> what<00:03:11.960> I<00:03:11.990> am<00:03:12.230> intending<00:03:12.800> on

here would have what I am intending on

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.880 
here would have what I am intending on
doing<00:03:13.100> with<00:03:13.459> it<00:03:13.520> with<00:03:13.790> these<00:03:13.940> size<00:03:14.410> of<00:03:15.410> pots

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
doing with it with these size of pots

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.300 
doing with it with these size of pots
and<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.570> grow<00:03:17.750> tray<00:03:18.160> we're<00:03:19.160> really

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
and the the grow tray we're really

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.870 
and the the grow tray we're really
looking<00:03:19.489> at<00:03:19.730> lettuce<00:03:20.200> cilantro<00:03:21.200> and<00:03:21.440> basil

looking at lettuce cilantro and basil

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.250 
looking at lettuce cilantro and basil
and<00:03:22.880> these<00:03:23.030> will<00:03:23.209> grow<00:03:23.360> exceptionally<00:03:24.020> quick

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
and these will grow exceptionally quick

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.380 
and these will grow exceptionally quick
exceptionally<00:03:25.100> strong<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.790> of<00:03:25.850> course<00:03:26.060> past

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
a bit and into the system I'll run

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.120
