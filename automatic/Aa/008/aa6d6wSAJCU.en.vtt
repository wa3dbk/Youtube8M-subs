 HOW TO MAKE A KITCHEN A good plan will allow you to make the most of your new kitchen. 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.480
 See what you need to think about when planning. 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.040
 The basis is that you can move easily between the cooking zone, 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.960
 refrigerator and sink. This space is called the working triangle. 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.120
 The shape of the kitchen is usually given by the shape of the room 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.720
 but this does not mean that your new kitchen must have the same shape as the previous one. 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.760
 You have several options: 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.600
 The kitchen in one row is suitable for smaller kitchens, too large for large kitchens. 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.200
 If you need more storage space, you can add an island 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.600
 which will also serve you as serving as a partition or reserve table. 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.040
 The L-shaped kitchen has the ideal working triangle 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.640
 and also enough storage space. 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.520
 Also the kitchen in U can hold a lot of storage space and work space. 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.680
 But it takes a lot of space. 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.880
 Use the opposite walls in the parallel kitchen to create two work surfaces. 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.280
 This layout does not require as much space and fits into spaces that have a door or window at the end. 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.480
 Leaving the hotplate on both sides of the hotplate will put you where to put the hot pots. 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.760
 If you have little space, keep as much space as possible between the sink and the hob. 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.520
 Also, leave the parallel kitchen enough room for two people to work at the same time. 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.600
 Leave at least 120 cm between the rows of cabinets so that you can easily open the cabinet doors on both sides. 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.480
 Place the top cabinets so that you can see the worktop well. 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.320
 Follow the instructions to select the correct height position for the hood 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.040
 according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.960
 If you place the oven at eye level, you will not have to bend and the children will not reach it. 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.960
 A loose worktop next to the oven will give you a place to store hot plates. 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.760
 Put utensils, pots and pans near the oven to keep them handy. 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.000
 Store glasses, cutlery and porcelain near the dishwasher 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.040
 - the dishes will be easier to clean. 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.640
 Leave room for fill between cabinet and wall 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.240
 thanks to which you can fully open the door. 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.080
 This is very important, especially if you have sliding wire baskets. 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.520
 What to avoid: when you place the oven and the dishwasher in the corner 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.440
 you block neighboring drawers and lockers. 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.200
 Placing the sink next to the wall will disrupt the natural flow of work. 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.320
 When you put the oven next to the wall, the wall will be excessively exposed to heat. 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.840
 The socket in the corner locks the adjacent cabinet 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.400
 you may damage its door or tabs. 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.760
 Do you think it's too much to remember? 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.680
 Try an online kitchen planner to help you with everything. 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.240

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.040

 but also the kitchen that will serve you greatly.
