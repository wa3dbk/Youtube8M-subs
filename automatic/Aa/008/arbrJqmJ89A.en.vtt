00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.210 
that for daddy and so I came up with
this<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.640> recipe<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:21.449> know<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:22.010> first<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.130> all

this a recipe you know and first of all

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.950 
this a recipe you know and first of all
what<00:00:23.369> I've<00:00:23.490> done<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.240> mixing<00:00:24.539> bowl<00:00:24.600> I've

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.359 
what I've done is in a mixing bowl I've
added<00:00:25.140> our<00:00:25.500> grated<00:00:26.160> carrots<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.050> sugar

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
added our grated carrots and sugar

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.009 
added our grated carrots and sugar
because<00:00:29.369> sugar<00:00:29.670> will<00:00:30.210> have<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.750> crystal

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
because sugar will have that crystal

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.540 
because sugar will have that crystal
format<00:00:31.560> if<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.890> mix<00:00:32.160> all<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.520> ingredients

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
little bit of milk because I felt the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.320 
little bit of milk because I felt the
batter<00:02:50.330> was<00:02:50.600> too<00:02:50.870> thick<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.830> was<00:02:52.010> not

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
having that cake batter consistency I

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.850 
having that cake batter consistency I
did<00:02:55.760> add<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.000> little<00:02:56.420> bit<00:02:56.720> of<00:02:56.810> milk<00:02:57.020> so<00:02:57.620> it's<00:02:57.739> up

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
to you you have to ingest an add a

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.640 
to you you have to ingest an add a
little<00:02:59.660> bit<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.870> milk<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.820> batter<00:03:02.030> and

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
little bit of milk to the batter and

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.199 
little bit of milk to the batter and
then<00:03:03.650> about<00:03:03.950> I'm<00:03:04.220> gonna<00:03:04.430> just<00:03:04.610> go<00:03:04.850> ahead<00:03:04.940> and

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
then about I'm gonna just go ahead and

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.410 
then about I'm gonna just go ahead and
transfer<00:03:05.690> this<00:03:06.489> matter<00:03:07.489> to<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.790> cups<00:03:08.420> and

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
transfer this matter to the cups and

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.479 
transfer this matter to the cups and
microwave<00:03:11.420> this<00:03:11.720> for<00:03:12.070> two<00:03:13.070> minutes

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
microwave this for two minutes

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.690 
microwave this for two minutes
my<00:03:14.330> microwave<00:03:15.110> heat<00:03:15.590> level<00:03:16.040> was<00:03:16.340> higher<00:03:16.670> I

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
my microwave heat level was higher I

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.930 
my microwave heat level was higher I
guess<00:03:17.269> it<00:03:17.780> baked<00:03:18.170> within<00:03:18.590> two<00:03:18.799> minutes<00:03:18.950> so<00:03:19.880> you

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
guess it baked within two minutes so you

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.509 
guess it baked within two minutes so you
need<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.299> see<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.830> setting<00:03:21.830> and<00:03:22.100> place<00:03:22.370> it

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
need to see the setting and place it

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.520 
need to see the setting and place it
accordingly<00:03:22.970> I<00:03:23.120> placed<00:03:23.540> it<00:03:23.720> eventually<00:03:24.019> for

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
accordingly I placed it eventually for

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.570 
accordingly I placed it eventually for
three<00:03:25.100> minutes

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
three minutes

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.210 
three minutes
but<00:03:26.030> then<00:03:26.180> in<00:03:26.299> two<00:03:26.540> minutes<00:03:26.810> mark<00:03:27.260> I<00:03:27.560> removed

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
but then in two minutes mark I removed

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.740 
but then in two minutes mark I removed
this<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:28.700> I<00:03:29.209> pricked<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:30.610> skewer<00:03:31.610> inside<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:32.630> I

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.810
