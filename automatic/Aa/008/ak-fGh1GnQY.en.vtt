that<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.110> would<00:00:55.289> recommend<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.890> yes<00:00:56.070> I'm<00:00:56.250> only

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
that I would recommend and yes I'm only

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.920 
that I would recommend and yes I'm only
showing<00:00:56.699> one<00:00:57.000> combat<00:00:57.329> style<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.719> time

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
showing one combat style this time

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.510 
showing one combat style this time
because<00:00:58.260> range<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.829> melee<00:00:59.070> are<00:00:59.219> not

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
because range and melee are not

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.250 
because range and melee are not
recommended<00:01:00.180> at<00:01:00.300> wyverns<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.989> reason

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
recommended at wyverns and the reason

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.450 
recommended at wyverns and the reason
for<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.590> because<00:01:01.859> they<00:01:01.980> are<00:01:02.010> very<00:01:02.250> weak

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
for that is because they are very weak

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.340 
for that is because they are very weak
to<00:01:02.489> mage<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:02.969> also<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.809> want<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.080> attack

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
to mage and also if you want to attack

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.050 
to mage and also if you want to attack
the<00:01:04.470> wyverns<00:01:04.799> without<00:01:05.100> using<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.580> shield<00:01:05.820> you

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the wyverns without using a shield you

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.630 
the wyverns without using a shield you
can<00:01:06.420> use<00:01:06.869> range<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:07.920> really<00:01:08.250> best<00:01:08.520> to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
can use range but it's really best to

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.429 
can use range but it's really best to
use<00:01:08.820> major<00:01:09.090> if<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.360> are<00:01:09.479> doing<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.350> you

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
use major if you are doing that so you

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.440 
use major if you are doing that so you
do<00:01:10.770> not<00:01:10.920> need<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.130> shield<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.670> kill<00:01:11.850> wyverns<00:01:12.270> if

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
do not need a shield to kill wyverns if

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.630 
do not need a shield to kill wyverns if
you<00:01:12.600> are<00:01:12.750> using<00:01:13.049> mage<00:01:13.409> because<00:01:13.650> what<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.460> can

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
you are using mage because what you can

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.249 
you are using mage because what you can
do<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.939> can<00:01:15.060> stand<00:01:15.420> at<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.630> far<00:01:15.869> distance

the<00:03:02.460> wyvern<00:03:02.730> bones<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:03.030> would<00:03:03.180> not<00:03:03.330> recommend

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
the wyvern bones I would not recommend

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.270 
the wyvern bones I would not recommend
it<00:03:03.840> because<00:03:03.990> they're<00:03:04.410> not<00:03:04.740> worth<00:03:04.980> very<00:03:05.010> much

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
it because they're not worth very much

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.340 
it because they're not worth very much
money<00:03:05.400> but<00:03:06.180> if<00:03:06.330> you<00:03:06.450> are<00:03:06.600> really<00:03:06.930> short<00:03:07.260> on

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
money but if you are really short on

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.110 
money but if you are really short on
cash<00:03:07.560> for<00:03:07.800> some<00:03:07.950> reason<00:03:08.250> probably<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.910> best

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
cash for some reason probably the best

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.750 
cash for some reason probably the best
way<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.330> thank<00:03:09.630> them<00:03:09.870> would<00:03:10.380> by<00:03:10.530> be<00:03:11.040> by<00:03:11.220> using<00:03:11.490> a

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
way to thank them would by be by using a

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.970 
way to thank them would by be by using a
tacos<00:03:12.270> o2<00:03:12.480> bank<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.050> then<00:03:13.260> run<00:03:13.440> back<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.860> it's

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
tacos o2 bank and then run back and it's

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.220 
tacos o2 bank and then run back and it's
not<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.460> far<00:03:14.730> of<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.910> run<00:03:15.090> but<00:03:15.270> again<00:03:15.600> you're

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
not that far of a run but again you're

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.470 
not that far of a run but again you're
really<00:03:16.500> better<00:03:17.070> off<00:03:17.340> if<00:03:17.550> you<00:03:17.670> decide<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.120> use<00:03:18.450> a

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
really better off if you decide to use a

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.690 
really better off if you decide to use a
bone<00:03:18.840> crusher<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.350> demon<00:03:19.620> horn<00:03:19.860> or<00:03:20.040> one<00:03:20.610> of

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
bone crusher and a demon horn or one of

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.970 
bone crusher and a demon horn or one of
the<00:03:20.790> lower<00:03:21.060> level<00:03:21.600> dungeoneering<00:03:22.350> necklaces

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
the lower level dungeoneering necklaces

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.470 
the lower level dungeoneering necklaces
to<00:03:23.190> restore<00:03:23.550> your<00:03:23.670> prayer<00:03:23.880> points<00:03:24.060> as<00:03:24.300> well<00:03:24.420> I

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
to restore your prayer points as well I

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.570 
to restore your prayer points as well I
know<00:03:24.570> there's<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.900> level<00:03:25.050> 61<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:26.100> restore<00:03:26.459> is

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
know there's a level 61 the restore is

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.400 
know there's a level 61 the restore is
100<00:03:26.910> pair<00:03:27.090> points<00:03:27.390> per<00:03:27.510> dragon<00:03:27.840> bunbury<00:03:28.110> debt

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
100 pair points per dragon bunbury debt

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.710 
100 pair points per dragon bunbury debt
can<00:03:28.740> work<00:03:29.010> out<00:03:29.250> fairly<00:03:29.610> nice<00:03:30.000> as<00:03:30.240> well

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
can work out fairly nice as well

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.990 
can work out fairly nice as well
so<00:03:31.110> how<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.410> wyvern<00:03:31.770> kills<00:03:32.070> go<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:32.640> really

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
so how the wyvern kills go is really

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.610 
so how the wyvern kills go is really
really<00:03:33.330> simple<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:33.959> I<00:03:34.020> do<00:03:34.080> see<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.410> lot<00:03:34.590> of

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
really simple and I do see a lot of

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.530 
really simple and I do see a lot of
people<00:03:34.920> using<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.490> elemental<00:03:36.000> shields<00:03:36.180> here

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
people using the elemental shields here

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.120 
people using the elemental shields here
or<00:03:36.720> dragon<00:03:37.110> fire<00:03:37.290> shields<00:03:37.650> here<00:03:37.800> and<00:03:37.980> they<00:03:38.100> are

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
or dragon fire shields here and they are

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.400 
or dragon fire shields here and they are
completely<00:03:38.760> not<00:03:38.940> needed<00:03:39.270> because<00:03:39.870> as<00:03:40.080> you<00:03:40.230> can

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
completely not needed because as you can

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.140 
completely not needed because as you can
see<00:03:40.590> if<00:03:40.740> you<00:03:40.860> stand<00:03:41.190> at<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.370> maximum<00:03:41.940> distance

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
see if you stand at the maximum distance

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.449 
see if you stand at the maximum distance
and<00:03:42.510> how<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:42.900> do<00:03:43.200> this<00:03:43.380> really<00:03:43.650> easily<00:03:43.800> is<00:03:44.280> you

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
and how you do this really easily is you

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.130 
and how you do this really easily is you
just<00:03:44.640> attack<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.030> wyvern<00:03:45.510> that's<00:03:45.720> slightly

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
just attack a wyvern that's slightly

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.170 
just attack a wyvern that's slightly
outside<00:03:46.320> of<00:03:46.709> your<00:03:46.830> range<00:03:47.100> or<00:03:47.340> just<00:03:47.820> run<00:03:48.060> away

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
outside of your range or just run away

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.030 
outside of your range or just run away
from<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.780> then<00:03:49.050> the<00:03:49.170> wyvern<00:03:49.470> will<00:03:49.620> not<00:03:49.860> be

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
from it and then the wyvern will not be

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.380 
from it and then the wyvern will not be
able<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.250> use<00:03:50.459> his<00:03:50.640> icy<00:03:50.820> breath<00:03:51.120> on<00:03:51.270> you

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
able to use his icy breath on you

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.090 
able to use his icy breath on you
because<00:03:51.660> he<00:03:51.780> can<00:03:51.930> only<00:03:52.140> use<00:03:52.410> that<00:03:52.440> from<00:03:52.860> close

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
because he can only use that from close

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.949 
because he can only use that from close
distances<00:03:53.820> and<00:03:54.000> then<00:03:54.390> you're<00:03:54.540> protected

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
distances and then you're protected

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.810 
distances and then you're protected
against<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.380> you<00:03:55.740> will<00:03:55.920> still<00:03:56.280> be<00:03:56.430> hit<00:03:56.610> by<00:03:56.760> the

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
against it you will still be hit by the

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.370 
against it you will still be hit by the
range<00:03:57.150> attacks<00:03:57.570> however<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.170> range

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
range attacks however and the range

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.590 
range attacks however and the range
attacks<00:03:58.709> can<00:03:59.010> hit<00:03:59.280> fairly<00:03:59.850> hard<00:04:00.090> so<00:04:00.510> that's

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
attacks can hit fairly hard so that's

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.630 
attacks can hit fairly hard so that's
one<00:04:00.870> reason<00:04:01.080> if<00:04:01.350> you<00:04:01.560> do<00:04:01.740> not<00:04:01.890> have<00:04:02.100> soul<00:04:02.370> split

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
one reason if you do not have soul split

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.760 
one reason if you do not have soul split
a<00:04:02.790> vampirism<00:04:03.420> aura<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:03.990> protect<00:04:04.380> from<00:04:04.530> range

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
a vampirism aura and protect from range

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.560 
a vampirism aura and protect from range
should<00:04:05.070> be<00:04:05.130> enough<00:04:05.610> to<00:04:05.760> heal<00:04:05.940> you<00:04:06.120> as<00:04:06.270> long<00:04:06.450> as

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
should be enough to heal you as long as

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.850 
should be enough to heal you as long as
you're<00:04:06.690> doing<00:04:06.720> a<00:04:07.020> decent<00:04:07.350> amount<00:04:07.500> of<00:04:07.560> damage

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
you're doing a decent amount of damage

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.710 
you're doing a decent amount of damage
to<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.040> wyverns<00:04:08.370> which<00:04:08.820> is<00:04:09.030> not<00:04:09.209> hard<00:04:09.510> because

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
to the wyverns which is not hard because

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.140 
to the wyverns which is not hard because
they<00:04:10.020> are<00:04:10.170> extremely<00:04:10.440> squishy<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.430> very<00:04:11.820> very

vulnerable<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:12.959> fire<00:04:13.260> spells<00:04:13.680> so<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:14.310> should

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
vulnerable to fire spells so you should

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.460 
vulnerable to fire spells so you should
just<00:04:14.520> absolutely<00:04:15.330> be<00:04:15.480> able<00:04:15.750> to<00:04:15.900> eat<00:04:16.140> them<00:04:16.350> up

the<00:04:16.890> reason<00:04:17.130> why<00:04:17.220> I'm<00:04:17.340> using<00:04:17.489> air<00:04:17.700> spells<00:04:17.970> is

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
the reason why I'm using air spells is

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.849 
the reason why I'm using air spells is
because<00:04:18.419> I<00:04:18.450> have<00:04:18.780> enough<00:04:19.049> accuracy<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.709> I<00:04:19.770> do

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
because I have enough accuracy that I do

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.680 
because I have enough accuracy that I do
not<00:04:20.070> have<00:04:20.130> to<00:04:20.400> worry<00:04:20.549> about<00:04:20.669> splashing<00:04:21.239> but<00:04:21.600> if

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
not have to worry about splashing but if

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.060 
not have to worry about splashing but if
you<00:04:21.780> are<00:04:21.930> using<00:04:22.140> a<00:04:22.350> really<00:04:22.560> low<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.830> your

you are using a really low to your
weapon<00:04:23.370> you<00:04:23.490> might<00:04:23.669> want<00:04:23.910> to<00:04:23.970> consider<00:04:24.330> using

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
weapon you might want to consider using

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.870 
weapon you might want to consider using
fire<00:04:24.960> spells<00:04:25.290> so<00:04:25.770> accuracy<00:04:26.190> is<00:04:26.340> not<00:04:26.669> an<00:04:26.790> issue

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
fire spells so accuracy is not an issue

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.230 
fire spells so accuracy is not an issue
