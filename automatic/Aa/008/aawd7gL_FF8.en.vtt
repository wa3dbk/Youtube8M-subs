00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.740 
the reason I didn't really fall in the
snow<00:05:40.740> is<00:05:41.070> because<00:05:41.400> we<00:05:41.760> have<00:05:41.970> freezing<00:05:42.420> rain<00:05:42.720> a

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
snow is because we have freezing rain a

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.100 
snow is because we have freezing rain a
few<00:05:43.020> days<00:05:43.170> ago<00:05:43.320> and<00:05:44.090> the<00:05:45.090> surface<00:05:45.540> of<00:05:45.930> the<00:05:46.050> snow
