00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.490 

the<00:00:06.580> experiment<00:00:07.090> was<00:00:07.270> the<00:00:07.690> first<00:00:08.110> time<00:00:08.260> he<00:00:08.380> was

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:08.500 
the experiment was the first time he was

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.140 
the experiment was the first time he was
pressing<00:00:08.830> the<00:00:08.860> lever<00:00:09.130> got<00:00:09.610> trained<00:00:09.880> to<00:00:09.970> press

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
pressing the lever got trained to press

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.250 
pressing the lever got trained to press
the<00:00:10.270> lever<00:00:10.420> and<00:00:10.570> got<00:00:10.720> food

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:11.260 
the lever and got food

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.619 
the lever and got food
then<00:00:11.590> they<00:00:11.710> started<00:00:12.010> flashing<00:00:12.460> a<00:00:12.520> light

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:12.629 
then they started flashing a light

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.539 
then they started flashing a light
before<00:00:13.629> the<00:00:13.809> lever<00:00:14.049> was<00:00:14.500> activated<00:00:15.129> which

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.549 
before the lever was activated which

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.910 
before the lever was activated which
then<00:00:15.790> turned<00:00:16.059> into<00:00:16.120> food<00:00:16.480> so<00:00:17.020> now<00:00:17.320> it's<00:00:17.560> two

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
then turned into food so now it's two

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.090 
then turned into food so now it's two
cues<00:00:18.280> light<00:00:18.660> lever<00:00:19.660> and<00:00:20.020> now<00:00:20.440> the<00:00:20.500> food<00:00:20.890> and

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.100 
cues light lever and now the food and

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.220 
cues light lever and now the food and
that<00:00:21.640> starts<00:00:22.000> training<00:00:22.330> the<00:00:22.570> rod<00:00:22.780> that

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
that starts training the rod that

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.690 
that starts training the rod that
understanding<00:00:23.800> they<00:00:23.890> doesn't<00:00:24.310> pressing<00:00:24.610> the

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 
understanding they doesn't pressing the

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.570 
understanding they doesn't pressing the
reliever<00:00:24.940> when<00:00:25.150> the<00:00:25.240> light<00:00:25.420> wasn't<00:00:25.630> flashing

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
reliever when the light wasn't flashing

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.980 
reliever when the light wasn't flashing
didn't<00:00:27.580> actually<00:00:27.700> lead<00:00:28.060> to<00:00:28.240> food<00:00:28.480> and<00:00:28.840> a

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
didn't actually lead to food and a

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.450 
didn't actually lead to food and a
pleasure<00:00:29.200> and<00:00:29.530> this<00:00:29.770> is<00:00:29.920> what<00:00:30.070> we<00:00:30.160> started

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
pleasure and this is what we started

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.479 
pleasure and this is what we started
calling<00:00:30.730> their<00:00:30.940> pleasure<00:00:31.240> maps<00:00:31.570> in<00:00:31.720> our<00:00:31.780> brain

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
calling their pleasure maps in our brain

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.369 
calling their pleasure maps in our brain
so<00:00:33.489> the<00:00:33.730> interesting<00:00:34.059> thing<00:00:34.300> which<00:00:35.200> we<00:00:35.350> have

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
so the interesting thing which we have

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.139 
so the interesting thing which we have
to<00:00:35.500> start<00:00:35.770> understanding<00:00:36.550> and<00:00:36.790> what<00:00:36.940> we're

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
to start understanding and what we're

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.540 
to start understanding and what we're
learning<00:00:37.390> a<00:00:37.629> lot<00:00:37.660> more<00:00:38.019> is<00:00:38.320> for<00:00:39.100> a<00:00:39.160> long<00:00:39.339> time

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
learning a lot more is for a long time

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.400 
learning a lot more is for a long time
we<00:00:39.760> believed<00:00:40.120> our<00:00:40.300> memory<00:00:40.719> was<00:00:40.899> to<00:00:41.019> remember

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
we believed our memory was to remember

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.130 
we believed our memory was to remember
the<00:00:41.469> past<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:42.820> actually<00:00:43.359> to<00:00:43.539> predict<00:00:43.960> the

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
the past it's actually to predict the

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.259 
the past it's actually to predict the
future<00:00:44.350> I<00:00:44.800> love<00:00:45.370> this<00:00:45.489> quote<00:00:45.699> by<00:00:45.850> Peter<00:00:46.059> Thiel

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
future I love this quote by Peter Thiel

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:48.090 
future I love this quote by Peter Thiel
you<00:00:46.480> know<00:00:46.600> we<00:00:46.839> wanted<00:00:47.230> flying<00:00:47.499> cars<00:00:47.769> and<00:00:47.890> all

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
you know we wanted flying cars and all

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.160 
you know we wanted flying cars and all
we<00:00:48.219> go<00:00:48.309> with<00:00:48.460> some<00:00:48.579> 40<00:00:48.909> characters<00:00:49.329> but<00:00:49.929> the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
we go with some 40 characters but the

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.819 
we go with some 40 characters but the
idea<00:00:50.620> behind<00:00:51.449> predicting<00:00:52.449> the<00:00:52.600> future<00:00:53.109> is<00:00:53.289> how

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
idea behind predicting the future is how

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.410 
idea behind predicting the future is how
the<00:00:53.890> motivational<00:00:54.609> system<00:00:54.909> actually<00:00:55.179> works

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
the motivational system actually works

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.540 
the motivational system actually works
because<00:00:56.050> what<00:00:56.379> is<00:00:56.499> that<00:00:56.649> rat<00:00:56.859> actually<00:00:57.010> doing

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
because what is that rat actually doing

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.729 
because what is that rat actually doing
when<00:00:57.699> he<00:00:57.760> presses<00:00:58.179> that<00:00:58.300> lever<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:59.109> light<00:00:59.350> the

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
when he presses that lever the light the

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.770 
when he presses that lever the light the
lever<00:01:00.010> and<00:01:00.370> then<00:01:00.609> getting<00:01:00.819> the<00:01:00.969> ward<00:01:01.300> its

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
lever and then getting the ward its

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.259 
lever and then getting the ward its
mapping<00:01:02.229> out<00:01:02.589> how<00:01:03.010> it<00:01:03.519> gets<00:01:03.879> to<00:01:04.120> these

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
mapping out how it gets to these

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.230 
mapping out how it gets to these
pleasures<00:01:05.260> so<00:01:05.979> food<00:01:06.310> is<00:01:06.520> pleasurable<00:01:06.820> to<00:01:07.090> them

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
pleasures so food is pleasurable to them

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.780 
pleasures so food is pleasurable to them
so<00:01:07.810> they<00:01:08.350> crates<00:01:08.860> what<00:01:09.159> it<00:01:09.250> creates<00:01:09.549> in<00:01:09.670> your

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
so they crates what it creates in your

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.179 
so they crates what it creates in your
brain<00:01:10.030> is<00:01:10.299> a<00:01:10.479> way<00:01:10.659> of<00:01:10.810> mapping<00:01:11.049> this<00:01:11.380> out<00:01:11.590> so

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
brain is a way of mapping this out so

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.090 
brain is a way of mapping this out so
they<00:01:12.310> did<00:01:12.460> experiments<00:01:13.090> with<00:01:13.920> monkeys<00:01:14.920> as

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
they did experiments with monkeys as

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.620 
they did experiments with monkeys as
well<00:01:15.250> and<00:01:15.610> this<00:01:15.759> starts<00:01:16.030> talking<00:01:16.390> a<00:01:16.450> little

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
well and this starts talking a little

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.090 
well and this starts talking a little
bit<00:01:16.780> about<00:01:17.079> what's<00:01:17.380> actually<00:01:17.530> happening<00:01:17.979> in

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
bit about what's actually happening in

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.600 
bit about what's actually happening in
the<00:01:18.159> brain

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
the brain

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.300 
the brain
so<00:01:18.880> between<00:01:19.079> dopamine<00:01:20.079> bursts<00:01:20.530> and<00:01:20.649> causes

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
so between dopamine bursts and causes

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.969 
so between dopamine bursts and causes
you<00:01:21.939> the<00:01:22.570> brain<00:01:22.840> actually<00:01:23.110> starts<00:01:23.469> guiding

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
you the brain actually starts guiding

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.950 
you the brain actually starts guiding
you<00:01:24.130> towards<00:01:24.729> what<00:01:24.880> is<00:01:24.909> rewarding<00:01:25.479> so<00:01:25.780> in<00:01:25.869> this

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
you towards what is rewarding so in this

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.590 
you towards what is rewarding so in this
experiment<00:01:26.380> you<00:01:26.829> know<00:01:27.159> they<00:01:27.520> train<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.270> the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
experiment you know they train the the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.240 
experiment you know they train the the
monkey<00:01:28.960> to<00:01:29.939> expect<00:01:30.939> a<00:01:31.090> reward<00:01:31.530> when<00:01:32.530> a<00:01:32.560> certain

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
monkey to expect a reward when a certain

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.310 
monkey to expect a reward when a certain
group<00:01:33.369> the<00:01:33.579> green<00:01:33.789> light<00:01:34.000> flashes<00:01:34.539> it<00:01:34.840> gets<00:01:35.109> a

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
group the green light flashes it gets a

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.770 
group the green light flashes it gets a
squirt<00:01:35.710> of<00:01:35.740> juice<00:01:35.890> so<00:01:36.340> you<00:01:36.820> start<00:01:37.149> seeing<00:01:37.450> the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
squirt of juice so you start seeing the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.840 
squirt of juice so you start seeing the
first<00:01:37.960> time<00:01:38.259> through<00:01:38.619> you<00:01:39.130> actually<00:01:39.460> see<00:01:39.640> the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
first time through you actually see the

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.609 
first time through you actually see the
dopamine<00:01:40.270> burst<00:01:40.600> was<00:01:40.810> when<00:01:40.990> get<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.229> actually

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
dopamine burst was when get to actually

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.380 
dopamine burst was when get to actually
got<00:01:41.859> the<00:01:41.979> reward<00:01:42.399> but<00:01:42.939> what's<00:01:43.149> actually

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
got the reward but what's actually

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.300 
got the reward but what's actually
starts<00:01:43.869> happening<00:01:44.289> off<00:01:44.469> it's<00:01:44.680> been<00:01:44.890> trained

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
starts happening off it's been trained

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.279 
starts happening off it's been trained
is<00:01:45.579> the<00:01:46.149> fact<00:01:46.329> that<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.570> dopamine<00:01:47.020> bursts

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
is the fact that the dopamine bursts

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.679 
is the fact that the dopamine bursts
happen<00:01:47.649> when<00:01:47.799> the<00:01:47.950> light<00:01:48.219> goes<00:01:48.490> so<00:01:49.270> your<00:01:49.390> brain

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
happen when the light goes so your brain

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.630 
happen when the light goes so your brain
is<00:01:49.750> basically<00:01:50.079> saying<00:01:50.619> I'm<00:01:50.950> anticipating

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
is basically saying I'm anticipating

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.490 
is basically saying I'm anticipating
that<00:01:52.210> I'm<00:01:52.390> going<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.659> get<00:01:52.780> a<00:01:52.810> reward<00:01:53.020> when<00:01:53.439> I

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
that I'm going to get a reward when I

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.370 
that I'm going to get a reward when I
see<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.770> green<00:01:54.039> light<00:01:54.250> so<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:55.600> it<00:01:55.869> gets<00:01:56.109> really

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
see a green light so it's it gets really

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.870 
see a green light so it's it gets really
interesting<00:01:56.500> when<00:01:57.070> you<00:01:57.159> have<00:01:57.310> this<00:01:57.460> idea<00:01:57.640> the

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
interesting when you have this idea the

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.639 
interesting when you have this idea the
blue<00:01:58.090> light<00:01:58.359> which<00:01:58.840> is<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.049> fifty<00:01:59.500> fifty

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
blue light which is a fifty fifty

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.550 
blue light which is a fifty fifty
percent<00:02:00.250> of<00:02:00.549> getting<00:02:00.909> juice<00:02:01.570> that<00:02:02.079> that

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
percent of getting juice that that

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.160 
percent of getting juice that that
anticipation<00:02:03.009> of<00:02:03.759> it<00:02:03.969> starts<00:02:04.570> building<00:02:04.810> so

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
anticipation of it starts building so

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.719 
anticipation of it starts building so
you<00:02:05.259> get<00:02:05.409> the<00:02:05.530> burst<00:02:05.770> of<00:02:05.890> dopamine<00:02:06.340> because<00:02:06.579> it

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
you get the burst of dopamine because it

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.100 
you get the burst of dopamine because it
thinks<00:02:07.030> it's<00:02:07.149> going<00:02:07.329> to<00:02:07.390> get<00:02:07.509> a<00:02:07.570> reward

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
thinks it's going to get a reward

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.070 
thinks it's going to get a reward
and<00:02:08.229> then<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:09.030> increasing<00:02:10.080> anticipation

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
and then the increasing anticipation

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.050 
and then the increasing anticipation
while<00:02:11.230> it's<00:02:11.410> in<00:02:11.530> that<00:02:11.650> waiting<00:02:11.890> mode<00:02:12.280> is<00:02:12.490> kind

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
while it's in that waiting mode is kind

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.759 
while it's in that waiting mode is kind
of<00:02:13.150> what<00:02:13.300> we's<00:02:13.450> game<00:02:14.230> designers<00:02:14.620> have<00:02:14.709> been

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
of what we's game designers have been

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:15.930 
of what we's game designers have been
using<00:02:15.040> this<00:02:15.220> for<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.400> long<00:02:15.550> time<00:02:15.580> it's

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
using this for a long time it's

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.729 
using this for a long time it's
unpredictable<00:02:16.390> rewards<00:02:16.989> variable<00:02:17.379> schedule

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
unpredictable rewards variable schedule

unpredictable rewards variable schedule
