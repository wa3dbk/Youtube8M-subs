my game starts to really go crazy and
starts<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.309> lag<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.760> me<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.210> no<00:00:55.079> no<00:00:55.289> I'm<00:00:55.379> gonna

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
starts the lag on me so no no I'm gonna

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.139 
starts the lag on me so no no I'm gonna
have<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.860> after<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.250> get<00:00:56.430> done<00:00:56.460> recording<00:00:56.879> this

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
have to after I get done recording this

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.779 
have to after I get done recording this
I'm<00:00:57.480> going<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:58.039> dismantle<00:00:59.039> these<00:00:59.129> carts<00:00:59.520> and

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
I'm going to dismantle these carts and

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.479 
I'm going to dismantle these carts and
probably<00:01:00.510> build<00:01:00.719> no<00:01:00.870> ones<00:01:01.129> that<00:01:02.129> don't<00:01:02.399> have

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
probably build no ones that don't have

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.850 
probably build no ones that don't have
chunk<00:01:02.879> loaders<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.329> them<00:01:03.470> and<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:04.680> how<00:01:04.710> that

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
chunk loaders in them and see how that

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.580 
chunk loaders in them and see how that
works<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.540> for<00:01:06.540> now<00:01:06.630> let's<00:01:06.840> get<00:01:06.960> going<00:01:07.260> here<00:01:07.439> I

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
minutes to an hour probably over that

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.080

creative side it really waste anything

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.060 
creative side it really waste anything
but<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.780> one<00:01:45.990> stopped<00:01:46.320> over<00:01:46.649> here<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:46.950> to

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
but I have one stopped over here just to

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.789 
but I have one stopped over here just to
show<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.549> interface<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.649> see<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:49.710> we

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
show you the interface on it see if we

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.710 
show you the interface on it see if we
can<00:01:49.920> find<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.399> without<00:01:50.549> lagging<00:01:51.030> out<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.509> us

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
can find it without lagging out on us

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.770 
can find it without lagging out on us
here<00:01:51.930> alright<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.299> basically<00:01:54.420> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
here alright so this is basically the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.810 
here alright so this is basically the
interface<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:56.159> know<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.430> got<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
interface of the you know it's got the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.660 
interface of the you know it's got the
the<00:01:57.540> woodcutter<00:01:57.990> here<00:01:58.259> with<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.219> fertilizer

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
the woodcutter here with the fertilizer

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.730 
the woodcutter here with the fertilizer
and<00:02:00.119> then<00:02:00.240> hydration<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.350> not<00:02:01.500> really

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
and then hydration this is not really

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.780 
and then hydration this is not really
necessary<00:02:02.540> for<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:04.280> for<00:02:05.280> what<00:02:05.430> we're<00:02:05.579> doing

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
necessary for the for what we're doing

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.760 
necessary for the for what we're doing
here<00:02:06.000> because<00:02:06.479> trees<00:02:06.899> just<00:02:07.110> don't<00:02:07.320> need<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.500> I

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
here because trees just don't need it I

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.290 
here because trees just don't need it I
didn't<00:02:08.399> even<00:02:08.489> think<00:02:08.640> about<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.910> when<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.149> was

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
didn't even think about it when I was

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.490 
didn't even think about it when I was
building<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.660> i<00:02:09.780> just<00:02:09.989> threw<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:10.379> there

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
building it i just threw it in there

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.120 
building it i just threw it in there
anyways

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
anyways

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.940 
anyways

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
but I also have the divine shield just

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.650 
but I also have the divine shield just
in<00:02:14.100> case<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.640> actually<00:02:14.880> have<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.210> on<00:02:15.300> peaceful

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
in case I actually have it on peaceful

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.630 
in case I actually have it on peaceful
right<00:02:15.840> now<00:02:15.990> but<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.530> just<00:02:16.590> want<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.370> make<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.490> a

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
right now but I just want to make it a

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.710 
right now but I just want to make it a
habit<00:02:17.820> that<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.210> I<00:02:18.420> put<00:02:19.410> these<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:20.720> especially

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
habit that I I put these in especially

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.510 
habit that I I put these in especially
when<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:21.870> have<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.650> know<00:02:22.770> an<00:02:22.890> expensive<00:02:23.340> car

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
when I have you know an expensive car

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.100 
when I have you know an expensive car
like<00:02:23.700> this<00:02:23.850> because<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.210> is<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.540> reinforced

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
like this because this is the reinforced

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.560 
like this because this is the reinforced
one<00:02:25.320> I<00:02:25.500> needed<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.250> be<00:02:26.370> able<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.640> get<00:02:26.790> the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
one I needed that to be able to get the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.140 
one I needed that to be able to get the
chunk<00:02:27.810> loader<00:02:27.990> in<00:02:28.460> but<00:02:29.460> being<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:29.940> don't

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
chunk loader in but being that I don't

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.520 
chunk loader in but being that I don't
have<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.390> chocolate<00:02:30.540> around<00:02:30.960> them<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.260> might

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
have the chocolate around them you might

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.860 
have the chocolate around them you might
might<00:02:32.010> just<00:02:32.190> be<00:02:32.310> able<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.520> do<00:02:32.790> without<00:02:33.510> that

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
might just be able to do without that

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.170 
might just be able to do without that
and<00:02:34.170> just<00:02:34.650> in<00:02:34.770> general<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:35.280> mean<00:02:35.610> my<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.030> know

if that don't worry about it or they're
not<00:02:48.300> going<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.570> affect<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:49.020> functionality<00:02:49.830> of

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
not going to affect the functionality of

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.100 
not going to affect the functionality of
it<00:02:50.340> as<00:02:51.000> long<00:02:51.150> as<00:02:51.240> you<00:02:51.330> got<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.480> aerial<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.990> up

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
it as long as you got the aerial it up

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.020 
it as long as you got the aerial it up
but<00:02:52.350> anyways<00:02:52.710> this<00:02:53.340> video<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.760> going<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:53.910> be

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
but anyways this video is going to be

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.360 
but anyways this video is going to be
your<00:02:54.180> main<00:02:54.300> expense<00:02:54.630> as<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.440> bones<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:56.100> if<00:02:56.280> you

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
your main expense as the bones so if you

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.900 
your main expense as the bones so if you
can<00:02:56.460> find<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:57.320> skeleton<00:02:58.320> spot<00:02:58.680> that's<00:02:59.670> going<00:02:59.820> to

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
can find a skeleton spot that's going to

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.060 
can find a skeleton spot that's going to
be<00:02:59.940> in<00:03:00.060> your<00:03:00.150> best<00:03:00.300> interest<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:00.930> that's<00:03:01.920> going

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
be in your best interest so that's going

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.770 
be in your best interest so that's going
to<00:03:02.130> be<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.580> biggest<00:03:02.880> trick<00:03:03.210> to<00:03:03.390> any<00:03:03.510> of<00:03:03.660> these

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
to be the biggest trick to any of these

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.770 
to be the biggest trick to any of these
the<00:03:04.020> farmer<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.410> this<00:03:04.800> one<00:03:05.030> just<00:03:06.030> be<00:03:06.390> able<00:03:06.540> to

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
the farmer and this one just be able to

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.170 
the farmer and this one just be able to
to<00:03:07.710> keep<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.070> self<00:03:08.370> sustaining<00:03:08.850> so<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.030> don't

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
to keep it self sustaining so you don't

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.400 
to keep it self sustaining so you don't
really<00:03:09.240> have<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.480> worry<00:03:09.540> about<00:03:09.810> it<00:03:10.080> other<00:03:10.260> you

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
really have to worry about it other you

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.800 
really have to worry about it other you
know<00:03:10.470> other<00:03:10.800> than<00:03:11.010> this<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.610> what<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.600> have

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
know other than this and what you have

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:13.910 
know other than this and what you have
to<00:03:12.900> worry<00:03:13.020> about<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.290> cold<00:03:13.440> but<00:03:13.740> you're<00:03:13.830> going

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
to worry about the cold but you're going

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.990 
to worry about the cold but you're going
to<00:03:13.980> be<00:03:14.070> out<00:03:14.100> getting<00:03:14.400> cold<00:03:14.640> for<00:03:14.790> anything

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
to be out getting cold for anything

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.760 
to be out getting cold for anything
anyways<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.750> then<00:03:15.930> on<00:03:16.050> top<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:16.590> can

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
anyways and then on top of it you can

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.530 
anyways and then on top of it you can
turn<00:03:16.950> this<00:03:17.220> charcoal<00:03:17.640> are<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.180> turn<00:03:18.360> this

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
turn this charcoal are you in turn this

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.380 
turn this charcoal are you in turn this
wood<00:03:18.750> into<00:03:19.020> charcoal<00:03:19.410> so<00:03:19.820> but<00:03:20.820> they're<00:03:21.240> pretty

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
wood into charcoal so but they're pretty

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.860 
wood into charcoal so but they're pretty
nicely<00:03:21.770> like<00:03:22.770> I<00:03:22.800> said<00:03:23.040> they're<00:03:23.220> almost

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
nicely like I said they're almost

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.520 
nicely like I said they're almost
self-sustaining<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:24.990> really<00:03:25.230> don't<00:03:25.380> have<00:03:25.470> to

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
self-sustaining you really don't have to

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.370 
self-sustaining you really don't have to
do<00:03:25.710> too<00:03:26.010> much<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.490> them<00:03:26.610> but<00:03:26.850> no<00:03:27.840> they<00:03:28.080> collect

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
do too much to them but no they collect

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.040 
do too much to them but no they collect
everything<00:03:29.120> 47<00:03:30.120> apples<00:03:30.420> that's<00:03:30.630> quite<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.840> bit

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
everything 47 apples that's quite a bit

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.830 
everything 47 apples that's quite a bit
so<00:03:31.440> you'll<00:03:31.740> always<00:03:31.800> have<00:03:32.100> a<00:03:32.160> food<00:03:32.700> supply<00:03:32.850> now

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
so you'll always have a food supply now

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.360 
so you'll always have a food supply now
i<00:03:33.900> know<00:03:34.020> there's<00:03:34.350> many<00:03:34.560> animals<00:03:35.040> in<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.250> world

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
i know there's many animals in the world

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.800 
i know there's many animals in the world
and<00:03:35.610> stakes<00:03:35.820> a<00:03:35.970> lot<00:03:36.090> better<00:03:36.300> but<00:03:36.570> you<00:03:36.780> know

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
and stakes a lot better but you know

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.360 
and stakes a lot better but you know
there<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.260> go<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:37.440> got<00:03:37.590> apples<00:03:37.980> for<00:03:38.130> golden

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
there you go you got apples for golden

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.670 
there you go you got apples for golden
apples<00:03:38.670> if<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.850> need<00:03:39.000> them<00:03:39.530> but<00:03:40.530> that's

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
apples if you need them but that's

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.270 
apples if you need them but that's
basically<00:03:40.860> it<00:03:41.220> for<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.610> interface<00:03:41.970> on<00:03:42.240> the

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
basically it for the interface on the

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.340 
basically it for the interface on the
the<00:03:44.280> tree<00:03:44.520> one<00:03:44.730> I'm<00:03:45.180> pretty<00:03:45.959> simple<00:03:46.230> pretty

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
the tree one I'm pretty simple pretty

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.690 
the tree one I'm pretty simple pretty
straightforward<00:03:46.500> this<00:03:47.070> is<00:03:47.220> how<00:03:47.310> you<00:03:47.370> turn<00:03:47.550> it

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
straightforward this is how you turn it

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.090 
straightforward this is how you turn it
off<00:03:47.820> same<00:03:48.150> as<00:03:48.180> before<00:03:48.600> and<00:03:49.320> pushes<00:03:49.709> halflings

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
off same as before and pushes halflings

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.620 
off same as before and pushes halflings
in<00:03:50.280> here<00:03:50.490> where<00:03:50.820> it<00:03:50.910> says<00:03:50.940> woodcutter<00:03:51.450> and

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
in here where it says woodcutter and

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.830 
in here where it says woodcutter and
it'll<00:03:52.500> place<00:03:52.680> them<00:03:52.860> down<00:03:53.010> every<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:54.360> can<00:03:54.510> see

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
it'll place them down every you can see

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.360 
it'll place them down every you can see
here<00:03:55.050> it<00:03:55.170> goes<00:03:55.290> every<00:03:55.590> two<00:03:55.770> blocks<00:03:56.040> it'll

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
here it goes every two blocks it'll

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.949 
here it goes every two blocks it'll
print<00:03:56.550> place<00:03:56.790> a<00:03:56.820> tree<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:58.370> they<00:03:59.370> grow

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
print place a tree and they grow

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.870 
print place a tree and they grow
whenever<00:04:00.959> they<00:04:01.200> want<00:04:01.410> really<00:04:01.770> I<00:04:01.800> mean<00:04:02.070> it<00:04:02.310> says

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
whenever they want really I mean it says

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.990 
whenever they want really I mean it says
it's<00:04:03.090> so<00:04:03.360> there<00:04:03.840> we<00:04:03.930> go<00:04:03.959> there's<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:04.770> leg<00:04:05.000> I'm

and I got this one doing potatoes and
you<00:05:02.180> can<00:05:02.300> see<00:05:02.419> it's<00:05:02.540> pretty<00:05:02.720> much<00:05:02.810> the<00:05:02.870> same

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
you can see it's pretty much the same

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.400 
you can see it's pretty much the same
thing<00:05:03.460> I<00:05:04.460> got<00:05:05.300> an<00:05:05.419> internal<00:05:05.690> storage<00:05:06.139> on<00:05:06.290> this

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
thing I got an internal storage on this

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.140 
thing I got an internal storage on this
one<00:05:06.620> an<00:05:06.800> attached<00:05:07.070> SI<00:05:07.520> have<00:05:07.639> that<00:05:07.790> i'm<00:05:07.910> pretty

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
one an attached SI have that i'm pretty

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.340 
one an attached SI have that i'm pretty
much<00:05:08.210> all<00:05:08.419> of<00:05:08.600> them<00:05:08.720> it<00:05:08.810> seems<00:05:09.020> to<00:05:09.139> be<00:05:09.229> the

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
much all of them it seems to be the

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.890 
much all of them it seems to be the
easiest<00:05:09.650> i<00:05:09.889> don't<00:05:10.040> use<00:05:10.220> you<00:05:10.340> the<00:05:10.430> most<00:05:10.900> well

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
easiest i don't use you the most well

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.170 
easiest i don't use you the most well
it's<00:05:12.020> for<00:05:12.139> what<00:05:12.260> you<00:05:12.380> need<00:05:12.910> but<00:05:13.910> yet<00:05:14.060> again

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
it's for what you need but yet again

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.760 
it's for what you need but yet again
this<00:05:14.450> was<00:05:14.630> this<00:05:14.780> one's<00:05:15.050> going<00:05:15.289> to<00:05:15.320> use<00:05:15.500> more

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
this was this one's going to use more

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.730 
this was this one's going to use more
bone<00:05:15.950> than<00:05:15.979> anything<00:05:16.639> so<00:05:17.150> i<00:05:17.450> would<00:05:18.350> focus<00:05:18.560> more

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
bone than anything so i would focus more

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.800 
bone than anything so i would focus more
on<00:05:18.950> your<00:05:19.220> bones<00:05:19.400> in<00:05:19.669> this<00:05:19.850> one<00:05:20.060> and<00:05:20.720> then

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
on your bones in this one and then

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.090 
on your bones in this one and then
you're<00:05:20.990> gonna<00:05:21.139> have<00:05:21.380> to<00:05:21.500> keep<00:05:21.650> track<00:05:21.860> of<00:05:21.919> your

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
you're gonna have to keep track of your

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.129 
you're gonna have to keep track of your
water<00:05:22.310> but<00:05:22.669> like<00:05:23.000> these<00:05:23.510> have<00:05:23.660> been<00:05:23.780> running

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
water but like these have been running

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:25.510 
water but like these have been running
for<00:05:24.380> these<00:05:24.800> have<00:05:25.010> been<00:05:25.130> probably<00:05:25.310> only

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
for these have been probably only

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.100 
for these have been probably only
running<00:05:25.760> for<00:05:25.940> about<00:05:26.030> 40<00:05:26.389> minutes<00:05:26.419> and<00:05:26.930> I've

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
running for about 40 minutes and I've

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.810 
running for about 40 minutes and I've
already<00:05:27.169> gone<00:05:27.440> through<00:05:27.500> there<00:05:28.490> was<00:05:28.580> a<00:05:28.639> full

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
already gone through there was a full

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.210 
already gone through there was a full
bucket<00:05:29.120> of<00:05:29.180> water<00:05:29.300> here<00:05:29.630> and<00:05:29.660> then<00:05:30.220> however

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
bucket of water here and then however

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.440 
bucket of water here and then however
much<00:05:31.370> I<00:05:31.580> don't<00:05:31.639> know<00:05:31.789> how<00:05:31.880> much<00:05:32.060> each<00:05:32.090> bucket

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
much I don't know how much each bucket

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.529 
much I don't know how much each bucket
gives<00:05:32.870> you<00:05:33.220> um<00:05:34.220> we<00:05:34.910> could<00:05:35.030> figure<00:05:35.180> try<00:05:35.419> and

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539 
gives you um we could figure try and

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:38.159 
gives you um we could figure try and
figure<00:05:35.660> that<00:05:35.870> out<00:05:35.900> right<00:05:36.139> now<00:05:36.729> where<00:05:37.729> we<00:05:37.849> get

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
figure that out right now where we get

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:48.570 
figure that out right now where we get
7441<00:05:40.660> okay<00:05:41.660> again<00:05:43.510> and<00:05:46.630> it's<00:05:47.630> not<00:05:47.780> taking<00:05:48.229> it

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
7441 okay again and it's not taking it

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.409 
7441 okay again and it's not taking it
it<00:05:49.580> must<00:05:49.849> not

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.939 

must<00:05:53.419> not<00:05:53.539> be<00:05:53.599> emptying<00:05:54.050> enough<00:05:54.319> i<00:05:54.529> guess<00:05:54.560> i

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
must not be emptying enough i guess i

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:56.439 
must not be emptying enough i guess i
don't<00:05:55.189> know<00:05:55.370> it<00:05:55.490> should<00:05:55.669> take<00:05:55.849> it<00:05:56.029> but<00:05:56.300> it's

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
don't know it should take it but it's

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:57.760 
don't know it should take it but it's
not<00:05:56.569> taking<00:05:56.779> it<00:05:57.050> i<00:05:57.139> don't<00:05:57.289> know<00:05:57.349> maybe<00:05:57.560> it's

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
not taking it i don't know maybe it's

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.709 
not taking it i don't know maybe it's
just<00:05:57.830> lagging<00:05:58.159> out<00:05:58.460> little<00:05:59.300> glitch<00:05:59.479> in<00:05:59.629> the

00:05:59.709 --> 00:05:59.719 
just lagging out little glitch in the

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:01.989 
just lagging out little glitch in the
system<00:05:59.870> but<00:06:00.340> you<00:06:01.340> know<00:06:01.430> a<00:06:01.460> little<00:06:01.610> farm<00:06:01.879> the

00:06:01.989 --> 00:06:01.999 
system but you know a little farm the

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:03.519 
system but you know a little farm the
potatoes<00:06:02.419> out<00:06:02.569> I'd<00:06:02.749> see<00:06:02.960> I<00:06:02.990> don't<00:06:03.169> understand

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:03.529 
potatoes out I'd see I don't understand

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:04.749 
potatoes out I'd see I don't understand
what<00:06:03.650> the<00:06:03.740> difference<00:06:04.039> is<00:06:04.159> here<00:06:04.370> why<00:06:04.550> am<00:06:04.580> I

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 
what the difference is here why am I

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.140 
what the difference is here why am I
even<00:06:04.789> plant<00:06:05.300> them<00:06:05.479> I<00:06:06.610> don't<00:06:07.610> know<00:06:07.699> but<00:06:08.029> either

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
even plant them I don't know but either

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.670 
even plant them I don't know but either
way<00:06:08.389> I<00:06:08.569> mean<00:06:08.779> if<00:06:08.900> you<00:06:08.960> can<00:06:09.080> get<00:06:09.199> the<00:06:09.289> seeds<00:06:09.529> to

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
way I mean if you can get the seeds to

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.409 
way I mean if you can get the seeds to
plant<00:06:09.800> potatoes<00:06:10.099> you<00:06:10.520> probably<00:06:10.999> put<00:06:11.120> them<00:06:11.300> in

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
plant potatoes you probably put them in

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:13.209 
plant potatoes you probably put them in
there<00:06:11.569> I<00:06:11.719> don't<00:06:12.590> know<00:06:12.680> exactly<00:06:13.039> how<00:06:13.189> that

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:13.219 
there I don't know exactly how that

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:17.230 
there I don't know exactly how that
works<00:06:14.889> I'm<00:06:15.889> really<00:06:16.129> planted<00:06:16.490> them<00:06:16.729> but<00:06:16.909> it'll

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
works I'm really planted them but it'll

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.170 
works I'm really planted them but it'll
work<00:06:17.270> with<00:06:17.509> potatoes<00:06:17.990> carrots<00:06:18.590> and<00:06:18.860> we<00:06:19.009> and<00:06:19.939> it

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
work with potatoes carrots and we and it

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.939 
work with potatoes carrots and we and it
does<00:06:20.330> everything<00:06:20.569> it<00:06:20.900> tells<00:06:21.289> the<00:06:21.439> soil<00:06:21.710> all

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:21.949 
does everything it tells the soil all

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:24.969 
does everything it tells the soil all
you<00:06:22.159> got<00:06:22.279> to<00:06:22.310> do<00:06:22.490> is<00:06:22.789> set<00:06:23.330> it<00:06:23.360> up<00:06:23.710> and<00:06:24.710> as<00:06:24.860> I<00:06:24.919> do

it as i have here you know i just chose

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.110 
it as i have here you know i just chose
six<00:06:29.870> because<00:06:30.259> there's<00:06:30.469> only<00:06:31.089> three<00:06:32.089> things

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
six because there's only three things

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.850 
six because there's only three things
that<00:06:32.389> I<00:06:32.449> could<00:06:32.629> plan<00:06:32.749> other<00:06:33.020> than<00:06:33.110> the

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
that I could plan other than the

that I could plan other than the
netherworld<00:06:34.339> I<00:06:34.430> should<00:06:34.610> have<00:06:34.699> bigger<00:06:34.849> than

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:35.029 
netherworld I should have bigger than

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:37.869 
netherworld I should have bigger than
any<00:06:35.120> one<00:06:35.210> of<00:06:35.360> those<00:06:35.599> but<00:06:35.990> i<00:06:36.139> didn't<00:06:36.469> but<00:06:37.339> if<00:06:37.699> you
