of Felco through these shears here that

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.069 
of Felco through these shears here that
makes<00:00:58.530> short<00:00:58.770> work<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.160> these<00:00:59.280> things<00:01:00.079> we're

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079

just going to chop it up and put them

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.910 
just going to chop it up and put them
into<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.840> big<00:01:04.229> big<00:01:05.270> stockpot

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
into a big big stockpot

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.620 
into a big big stockpot
I've<00:01:07.920> got<00:01:08.100> my<00:01:08.220> largest<00:01:08.490> stockpot<00:01:09.119> going<00:01:09.420> for

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
I've got my largest stockpot going for

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.960 
I've got my largest stockpot going for
this<00:01:09.720> process<00:01:15.890> now<00:01:16.890> I've<00:01:17.040> got<00:01:17.280> my<00:01:17.460> stock<00:01:17.759> pot

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
this process now I've got my stock pot

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.330 
this process now I've got my stock pot
filled<00:01:18.240> most<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.630> way<00:01:18.780> up<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.860> am<00:01:20.040> going

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
filled most of the way up and I am going

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.780 
filled most of the way up and I am going
to<00:01:20.960> fill<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:22.290> water<00:01:22.520> until<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.700> just

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
to fill it up with water until it's just

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.319 
to fill it up with water until it's just
over<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> top<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.720> cane

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:35.870 

then<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.479> are<00:01:30.600> gonna<00:01:30.689> start<00:01:30.990> boiling<00:01:34.369> okay

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
then we are gonna start boiling okay

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.630 
then we are gonna start boiling okay
I've<00:01:36.000> been<00:01:36.270> boiling<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.899> for<00:01:37.320> about<00:01:37.640> three

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
I've been boiling this for about three

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.639 
I've been boiling this for about three
hours<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.630> want<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.930> just<00:01:40.079> keep<00:01:40.259> going

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
hours and you want to just keep going

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.190 
hours and you want to just keep going
and<00:01:40.770> going<00:01:40.950> until<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.610> cane<00:01:41.850> itself<00:01:42.329> really

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
and going until the cane itself really

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.050 
and going until the cane itself really
doesn't<00:01:43.649> have<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.950> sweetness<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.759> and

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
doesn't have that sweetness to it and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.910 
doesn't have that sweetness to it and
the<00:01:45.600> sweetness<00:01:45.960> has<00:01:46.079> gone<00:01:46.320> out<00:01:46.530> into<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
the sweetness has gone out into the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.279 
the sweetness has gone out into the
water<00:01:47.100> instead<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.479> at<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.689> point<00:01:48.929> it's

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
water instead so at this point it's

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:50.990 
water instead so at this point it's
ready<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.740> strained<00:01:50.100> out<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.610> then<00:01:50.880> we'll

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
ready to be strained out and then we'll

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.980 
ready to be strained out and then we'll
do<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.149> final<00:01:51.360> boil<00:01:51.750> down<00:01:53.600> okay<00:01:54.600> i<00:01:54.630> spooned

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
do the final boil down okay i spooned

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.779 
do the final boil down okay i spooned
out<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.200> lot<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.590> chunks<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.429> now<00:01:56.640> I'm<00:01:56.759> just

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
out a lot of the chunks and now I'm just

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.609 
out a lot of the chunks and now I'm just
going<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.090> go<00:01:57.240> through<00:01:57.479> here<00:01:57.720> and<00:01:57.990> strain<00:01:58.500> it

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
going to go through here and strain it

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.980 
going to go through here and strain it
off<00:01:58.710> into<00:01:58.890> another<00:01:59.069> container<00:01:59.579> and<00:02:00.179> we<00:02:00.780> may

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
off into another container and we may

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.870 
off into another container and we may
have<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.349> use<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.770> secondary<00:02:02.220> container<00:02:02.459> to<00:02:02.759> do

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
have to use a secondary container to do

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.639 
have to use a secondary container to do
this<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.330> then<00:02:03.599> once<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.869> clean<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.200> big<00:02:04.439> pot

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
this and then once I clean this big pot

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.279 
this and then once I clean this big pot
out<00:02:04.860> I'll<00:02:05.330> pour<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.450> juice<00:02:06.599> back<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:07.049> here<00:02:07.200> and

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
out I'll pour the juice back in here and

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:08.719 
out I'll pour the juice back in here and
do<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.439> final<00:02:07.709> boil<00:02:08.099> down<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.459> this<00:02:08.549> big

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
do a final boil down in this big

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.609 
do a final boil down in this big
stockpot<00:02:09.000> or<00:02:09.959> maybe<00:02:10.110> I'll<00:02:10.229> just<00:02:10.380> do<00:02:10.470> in<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
stockpot or maybe I'll just do in the

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.910 
stockpot or maybe I'll just do in the
little<00:02:10.830> one

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.870
