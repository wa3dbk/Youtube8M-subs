00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.450
 what we want is that Colombians 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.750
 have access continuously to rates 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.640
 casualties who can travel obviously 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.080
 winning by guaranteeing them security and 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.490
 the punctuality that are two elements 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.140
 fundamental but let's say that within 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.570
 our values ​​there are two things that are 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.220
 very important and is to be irreverent and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.669
 be fun and what do I want to say with 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.800
 that we are not satisfied with the 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.210
 current status of the rates that 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.710
 we will continuously work with the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.390
 national government is to reduce them in 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.640
 continue paying the rates so that 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.160
 Colombians can access transportation 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.510
 air and that we are definitely going to 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.640
 do in a fun way the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.990
 Colombians we are happy people we are 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.220
 people that push us I like 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.440
 have fun and we hope that the 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.480
 flight experience of Colombians 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.630
 in viva colombia since they are mounted to 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.460
 plane since they have contact with 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.530
 people since it's something fun 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.329
 and exciting 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.219
 and many low cost have 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.650
 gone in which on the road changing the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.990
 model the model have met with 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.409
 many problems the idea is that I live 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.690
 colombia maintain a structure very very 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.250
 efficient and that that efficiency 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.440
 continuously being translated into 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.110
 lower transportation costs for 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.540
 passengers 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.630
 if we achieve 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.740
 we do not settle for the costs that 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.990
 there's operation today and 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.600
 we continuously lower them we will be 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.910
 continuously guaranteeing costs 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.960
 lower that translate into rates 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.900
 lower 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.310
 in an environment that is competitive with 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.820
 some competitors that are watching us 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.760
 and breathing in the neck that will 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.620
 Feeling uncomfortable with vivacolombia 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.430
 then keep the lowest cost is 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.040
 the biggest challenge we have 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.440
 it is not our focus, it is not not to point 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.090
 to a percentage of the cake but I think 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.150
 who did see Colombia do their homework well 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.220
 in a few years it will be one of the areas 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.510
 most important of colombia and will be 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.790
 transporting the largest number of 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.080
 passengers there are passengers for example that 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.160
 nowadays they do not offer any 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.590
 Statistical even in that of 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.140
 land transport what I mean is 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.970
 if you need the passenger travel a 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.220
 weekend you can not use the 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.709
 ground transportation because it does not reach 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.450
 reach your destination if it is 11 hours and 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.310
 If you use air transport, it 's very 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.440
 expensive then vivacolombia will be 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.970
 generating new passengers that today in 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.090
 day there are no statistics 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.950
 and of course we do not operate on connections or 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.470
 in our distribution centers 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.420
 flights are direct point to point very 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.670
 simple we do not connect suitcases nor 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.890
 passengers passengers always go to 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.460
 be flying from a point of a destination 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.840
 to a union destination and we're going to be 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.510
 connecting with rings that simplifies 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.640
 very much the operations prevents it from 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.840
 lose your luggage avoid having to 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.460
 we have to be investing in 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.940
 expensive connection systems 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.740
 passengers and suitcases then it is part 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.360
 of design the low cost of obtaining 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.230
 standardized operations and very 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.300
 simple 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.350
 we have partners who already know the medium 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.430
 of the low cost business they have had 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.830
 successful launches of arrhythmias 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.390
 low cost worldwide and that everything 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.900
 this contribution of knowledge since 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.900
 help a lot 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.829
 the initial investment exceeds in many 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:28.349
 million the 5,200 million that the 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:32.120
 civil aeronautics and it's a figure of eight 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.120
 digits in millions of dollars 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.700
 good 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.760
 of course 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.019
 looking at it 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.609
 the authority and the government in general 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.200
 They are very pleased with the init 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:06.459
 operations of a new airline 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.680
 community of colombia we believe that a greater 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.409
 offer with different models of 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.720
 business while managing standards 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.900
 quality and service will always 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.970
 be beneficial to the user then 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.810
 Welcome astro line and it's a sample 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:26.020
 that Colombia with its growth with 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.030
 its dynamism is generating confidence and 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.270
 is providing opportunities for 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.240
 investment and business growth 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.699
 that as vivacolombia they will contribute 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.849
 to the economic development of the country as a 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.770
 process that takes a long time has to 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:44.190
 have aircraft inspections have 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.110
 than having document certification 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:51.490
 they have to be in a whole series of 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.919
 elements but they were judicious 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.690
 diligence and obviously the 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.610
 aeronautics tried to accelerate all the 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.670
 processes so that it would fly in the minor 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:04.260
