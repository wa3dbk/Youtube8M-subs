00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.339
 Hello, I want to introduce you 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:11.120
 today a new recipe 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:14.420
 another recipe for the test myself I became 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.650
 use such a test relatively 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.890
 recently this year since the beginning of the season 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:26.210
 taking advantage he prepares so all the dough is not 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.000
 difficult i need this we need the usual 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.859
 wheat flour and here I have 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.539
 all together in one coffee grinder I pitches 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:41.839
 corn grits millet grits and seeds 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:48.399
 approximately all this in equal proportions 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:52.999
 and here's the highlight of this recipe is 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:58.609
 which is ordinary cocoa powder and so everything 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:01:01.749
 mix and add cocoa so special 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:07.700
 do not need much 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:15.799
 well, I'm about a teaspoon of tasks for now 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:20.320
 have here give flavor to dough so all this 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:28.219
 business was mixed 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:31.149
 before kneading here what else 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:40.240
 well what gives dough such 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:40.240
 brown color he does not stand out 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:54.500
 as when mixing the usual dough 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:57.880
 add water to the group a little bit first 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.880
 you can stir with a spoon 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:09.539
 then with my hands as I said in the past 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.450
 recipes if poured water can 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:17.390
 add any of the components 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.510
 if not refilled then fill up all 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:25.250
 correctable 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:33.720
 and so originally the batch was done now 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:43.580
 knead manually I'm here specifically for this 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:47.989
 the dough was very good at catching bream 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.209
 rather brider is still on the river 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:55.170
 traveled several times and and 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:58.550
 in the lake well pecked crucians in principle 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.550
 according to my observation 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:07.739
 what kind of flavor of course 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.920
 not at all serving works well but out 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:17.190
 those that I was on most water 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:24.350
 what show good results so 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:24.350
 that try maybe you will not regret 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.050
 Well, I kneaded the dough for a few minutes 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.710
 turned out on such a good soft 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.990
 pretty tight will hold well 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.620
 on a hook and as I said myself 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.790
 beginnings 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.330
 cover betrayed come up with then such here 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:50.160
 dark brown look and due to this she 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:53.260
 will not stand out much against the bottom and 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.890
 thereby scaring off less fish but 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:00.160
 cocoa and sunflower seeds do their work 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:04.390
 will attract fish smell I hope this video 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.860
 it will be useful and interesting to someone if 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.430

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.050
