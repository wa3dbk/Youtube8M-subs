00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 I had to find a way to stop killing myself. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 You made a serious mistake. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Not as serious as yours, I'm afraid. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Bane 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Let's not start with presentations right now. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Mr. Wayne. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Peace has cost you your strength. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Victory defeated you. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Theatricality and deceit. 

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:53.000
 Powerful factors for the uninitiated. 

00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:56.000
 But we are initiated, right Bruce? 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Members of the League of Shadows. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 And you betrayed us. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Yes, and you expel a band of psychopaths. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 I am, the League of Shadows. 

00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:22.000
 I am here to fulfill the destiny of Ra`s Al Ghu !. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 You fight like a young man. 

00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:39.000
 Never turning your back 

00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:41.000
 Admirable. 

00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:42.000
 But wrong. 

00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:50.000
 Oh, you think darkness is your ally. 

00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:54.000
 But you have hardly adopted the darkness. 

00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:57.000
 I was born in it. 

00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:00.000
 I was created in it. 

00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:04.000
 I did not see the light until I was a man. 

00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:06.000
 By then it was nothing but blinding! 

00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:11.000
 The shadows betray you. 

00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:14.000
 Because they belong to me. 

00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:23.000
 I will show you where I will make my home 

00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:25.000
 While I prepare to bring justice. 

00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:30.000
 Then I will break you. 

00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:41.000
 Your great arsenal. 

00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:43.000
 Strongly grateful 

00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:45.000
 We will need it 

00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:58.000
 Oh yes, I was wondering what would break first. 

00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:05.000
 Your spirit ... 

00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:10.000
 ... or your body.
