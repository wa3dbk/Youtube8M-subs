00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.890 
the flow is that same thing you saw whoa
I<00:04:14.350> think<00:04:15.220> our<00:04:15.370> run<00:04:15.610> game<00:04:15.640> or<00:04:16.450> guinness<00:04:16.660> would

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
I think our run game or guinness would

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.479 
I think our run game or guinness would
help<00:04:17.079> you<00:04:17.169> get<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.500> flow<00:04:17.709> anytime<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:18.370> can

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
help you get the flow anytime you can

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.430 
help you get the flow anytime you can
run<00:04:18.700> the<00:04:18.820> ball<00:04:18.850> and<00:04:19.389> force<00:04:19.810> it<00:04:19.870> in<00:04:20.049> a<00:04:20.139> single

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
run the ball and force it in a single

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.730 
run the ball and force it in a single
coverage<00:04:20.799> and<00:04:21.400> you<00:04:22.090> know<00:04:22.210> you<00:04:22.270> can<00:04:22.690> do<00:04:23.470> a<00:04:23.500> lot

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
coverage and you know you can do a lot

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.460 
coverage and you know you can do a lot
more<00:04:23.800> you<00:04:24.700> know<00:04:24.810> and<00:04:25.810> that's<00:04:25.990> I<00:04:26.139> think<00:04:26.169> it

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
more you know and that's I think it

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.290
