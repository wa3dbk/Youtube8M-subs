00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:08.570
 dee 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:12.780
 Finish expression of metallic color Let's see from now 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:16.740
 Even commercial ones have metallic colors such as blue and red 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:20.770
 Of course it is one way to express metallic using it 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:26.130
 This time I would like to see two ways a little 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:30.660
 In using a commercially available metallic colors First of all for the sake of comparison let's paint 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.650
 The airbrush contains a diluted paint of Emmeric Blue . 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.650
 I will spray 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.140
 If you find that the metal particles contained in it are a bit large and you notice that you notice a little 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.140
 think 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:51.780
 This time, metal color in terms of the underlying color 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.660
 I'd like to make you get lost 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.610
 White bright 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.500
 Base and spray metal color throughout 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:05.500
 To in 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:09.240
 It is the metal color that becomes the base itself It is called that color 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.880
 After all, even silver, for example, may differ depending on the manufacturer. 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.050
 Metal there even much little Oh 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.860
 When is was heat Tanpoi color 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.040
 Got a lot of color seen how 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.980
 I'm waiting 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.560
 It is finished when we use such things as the staff 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.220
 Because it also changes 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.220
 Who there 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.060
 Well have to experiment 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.830
 It says that your favorite color is 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.170
 Do not find 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:45.460
 It is from on this after the metal color of the underlying dry 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:49.780
 Whenever I use a fair airbrush that is lightened with clear blue lightly 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:54.240
 I am allowed to say, but without going over 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.240
 Wipe lightly to dry and repeat. 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.649
 Clear blue is getting faster and faster with the underlying members showing through 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.960
 Us can layer went 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.520
 A member of the painters when the light strikes 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.670
 0 reflected by the metallic 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.670
 Say 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.850
 Because just that clear color is thin after all 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.300
 Quite 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.090
 repetition 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.050
 I have to spend it 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.930
 Beautiful 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.040
 The color won't get on 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.719
 In that sense 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.719
 It takes time to get in the way 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.140
 The condition of the finish is 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.140
 I think it will be pretty beautiful 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:58.480
 It's like this 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.480
 The same lesson is repeated, saying that it does not blow , etc. 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.200
 It seems like this is a problem 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.430
 Meteric can express color 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:14.329
 The advantage of this approach is to 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.329
 Toka was a clear toilet by well 4 clear color to put on 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.860
 By placing a such a color 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.980
 The I mean mission of Metallica come out of the question 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.810
 As I said at the beginning, there are many metallic colors in the studio 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.560
 Hmm 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.200
 The 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:33.770
 Coming towards the overall color flights but 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.770
 It is not coming spread there that Tteyuu expressive power
