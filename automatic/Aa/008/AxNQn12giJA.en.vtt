 high red hat set the keyboard 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.389
 as he likes that is like the cloche of 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.480
 a reconnaissance aircraft and indeed the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.699
 computer biba oddly yes that when 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.500
 he first to press alt rightly 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.170
 anti ghosting system warns him that 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.330
 is doing something inhuman because 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.750
 the anti ghosting system says why 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:36.480
 if playing their own deal and they are not 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.440
 shooting from madonna guys at this not 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.300
 he was a friend 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.710
 no it was not a jam anna cina li 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.890
 recognize those who are not friends 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.690
 because they shoot you in Milan but being 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.309
 a be the run mode to this why 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.739
 we have not found other non-matches 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.239
 we wanted to make a blitz we tell you the 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.829
 truth the problem is that blitz for 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.079
 how beautiful nobody plays there 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.760
 because you ca n't buy it 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.160
 they all probably play at 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.120
 These camp mode and roses and camperos 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.559
 anti campanini camper in france if 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.750
 there are many alone in this map 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.060
 we want to count the only yes but get up again 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.520
 the head I think I die a lot even though 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.729
 don't lift your head here you die for it 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.530
 by inertia due to inertia by shooting the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.990
 ankles of people however you can do 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.250
 kills very well as kills 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.860
 yellow 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.780
 complimentoni strictly year they have 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:30.350
 did they did a range did yes we are 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.350
 to die 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.720
 they made a leg guys see 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.660
 who made this that is the strength la 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.729
 range but I say but instead of drawing 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.770
 the maps twice change all ste 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.650
 things but could not make the dogma but 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.440
 because it's an excuse but nobody is there 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.560
 with 25 kills as wrong I don't know 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.490
 if the lines of race and buy or the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.290
 really successful 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.310
 me because I was walking looking with 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.320
 me what is happening to ab and i am 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.080
 paying a fish is a certain one 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.940
 probability that we are working 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.890
 meanwhile, however, you want to die or die 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.410
 great nice to nice world said that 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.989
 everything works great died with a 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.080
 perfect look with love ok maybe 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:22.950
 we are back, that is, there is a box 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:25.530
 of I will go to see then beautiful that 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.360
 says a little half understood but are 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.570
 happening strange things, that is, less 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.810
 bad that we are registering because a 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.430
 below but I see very strange things 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.400
 there are people who have the gift of 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.299
 foresight i know if you noticed woman's 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:46.320
 carmelo 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:48.000
 ok and in the meantime and in the meantime that I 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.970
 too close to a wall but I'm not 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.640
 going in that direction 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.260
 this is also to like 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.890
 thrust in front for more 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.600
 races under poor I almost am 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.670
 sure that all this is due to 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.579
 lago because if it is due to cod 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.579
 within ayala gulag yes yes I hope 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:13.079
 me too that this is the river 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:20.190
 canon lag and titles from the cock will not be 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:22.230
 tolerated after the camp was the case was 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.090
 normal there were also bloggers later 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.540
 the campers 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.879
 damn the cock as they said if 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.890
 We are very careful, though 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.080
 be careful because this is a game 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.760
 particularly interesting especially 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.530
 you have to understand which are the walls that then 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.120
 override anything about me says no mi 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.040
 It seemed to be passed over we said 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.959
 also upstream but why then climb over 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.170
 walls higher than that but not 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.510
 the one is unpleasant and the PTC of the glasses 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.569
 something have improved the system of 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.370
 you can do it now 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.709
 own parkour 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.290
 let's see how they die in a grenade but 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.349
 for mother word of throws it to the grenade 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:05.280
 I saw the social song noticed 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:07.920
 stranger sees casket that runs runs in the 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:14.280
 same point anyway 1 11 is yours 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:17.070
 average is worrying listen tell me if it is 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.590
 normal this thing already known looks 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.870
 look sausage creating something 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.090
 strange because in my opinion one 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.320
 smart should not run into 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.850
 this way but ok 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.550
 and meanwhile, however, it happens to kill you 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.039
 they kill the camps like I don't really know 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.200
 how very annoying is the fact that in the 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.150
 menu you can't see how long you are 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.160
 ping really went to fucking dog 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.669
 this thing 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.289
 and meanwhile people do the moonwalk yes I do 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.940
 I would say we can close this one here 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.160
 game because I think it ends 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.530
 so that is how it started but you like it 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.870
 how I play when I touch the mouse is her 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.770
 what happens dead people took one 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.550
 carrying case 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:02.479
 but whoever is happening is blocking 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.479
 the game
