00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
inside of the fireplace and that will

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.910 
inside of the fireplace and that will
have<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.810> effect<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.229> eliminating<00:01:22.740> some<00:01:22.890> of

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the odors and then another thing that

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.280 
the odors and then another thing that
works<00:01:26.549> really<00:01:26.790> well<00:01:26.939> are<00:01:27.270> odor<00:01:27.720> neutralizing

works really well are odor neutralizing

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.249 
works really well are odor neutralizing
beads<00:01:28.770> or<00:01:29.009> gels<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:30.240> these<00:01:30.600> are<00:01:30.630> they

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
beads or gels so this these are they

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.830 
beads or gels so this these are they
look<00:01:31.530> like<00:01:31.710> little<00:01:32.400> fish<00:01:32.729> eggs<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.180> you're

look like little fish eggs and you're

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.940 
look like little fish eggs and you're
just<00:01:33.960> basically<00:01:34.259> going<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.470> open<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.890> up

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
just basically going to open that up

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.730 
just basically going to open that up
peel<00:01:35.579> back<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.939> top<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.420> set<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.470> right
