any sort of bits of flower that haven't
been<00:02:14.670> needed<00:02:15.060> in<00:02:15.209> just<00:02:16.170> have<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.500> little

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
bit there so this is the pasture board

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.720 
bit there so this is the pasture board
we'd<00:02:19.650> always<00:02:19.770> roll<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.250> out<00:02:20.459> we<00:02:20.580> wouldn't

we'd always roll it out we wouldn't
necessarily<00:02:21.080> make<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.290> pasture<00:02:22.709> on<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:22.950> but

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
necessarily make the pasture on it but

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.740 
necessarily make the pasture on it but
we<00:02:23.220> would<00:02:23.430> roll<00:02:23.700> everything<00:02:24.060> out<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.599> I<00:02:24.690> would

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
them too big so that's going to go in

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.509 
them too big so that's going to go in
the<00:02:40.739> fridge<00:02:40.950> for<00:02:41.250> about<00:02:41.430> 15-20<00:02:42.000> minutes<00:02:43.519> okay

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
a little bit of flour on your board and

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.110 
a little bit of flour on your board and
just<00:02:48.360> very<00:02:48.600> lightly<00:02:48.959> roll<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.800> out<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.910> what

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
just very lightly roll it out so what

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.430 
just very lightly roll it out so what
you've<00:02:51.239> got<00:02:51.269> with<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.569> machine<00:02:51.930> if<00:02:52.080> those<00:02:52.260> you

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
you've got with the machine if those you

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.350 
you've got with the machine if those you
haven't<00:02:52.620> used<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.130> you've<00:02:53.549> got<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.790> little<00:02:54.060> dial

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
haven't used it you've got a little dial

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.630 
haven't used it you've got a little dial
and<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.959> just<00:02:55.170> takes<00:02:55.380> it<00:02:55.650> down<00:02:55.890> thinner<00:02:56.489> and

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
and it just takes it down thinner and

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.430 
and it just takes it down thinner and
thinner<00:02:56.819> these<00:02:57.120> two<00:02:57.330> discs<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:58.140> move

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
thinner these two discs that move

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.289 
thinner these two discs that move
together<00:02:58.680> so<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.580> want<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.850> start<00:03:00.120> at<00:03:00.269> the

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
together so you want to start at the

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.890 
together so you want to start at the
widest<00:03:00.810> setting<00:03:01.850> so<00:03:02.850> just<00:03:03.209> make<00:03:03.360> sure<00:03:03.630> when

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
widest setting so just make sure when

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.630 
widest setting so just make sure when
you<00:03:04.019> roll<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.260> out<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.680> first<00:03:04.860> time<00:03:05.100> that<00:03:05.519> your

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
you roll it out the first time that your

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.490 
you roll it out the first time that your
pasta<00:03:06.090> can<00:03:06.239> fit<00:03:06.480> through<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.900> Machine<00:03:07.260> and

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
pasta can fit through the Machine and

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.870 
pasta can fit through the Machine and
like<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.680> say<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:07.950> can<00:03:08.100> be<00:03:08.130> a<00:03:08.250> bit<00:03:08.430> rough<00:03:08.459> you

like I say you can be a bit rough you
know<00:03:09.000> if<00:03:09.090> it's<00:03:09.209> needed<00:03:09.569> properly<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.200> pull<00:03:10.380> it

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
know if it's needed properly and pull it

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.320 
know if it's needed properly and pull it
out<00:03:10.709> don't<00:03:11.400> feel<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:11.790> have<00:03:11.819> to<00:03:12.030> be<00:03:12.120> so

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330

out don't feel you have to be so
delicate<00:03:12.600> with<00:03:13.049> it<00:03:13.819> okay<00:03:14.850> now<00:03:15.540> we're<00:03:15.720> gonna

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
delicate with it okay now we're gonna

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.390 
delicate with it okay now we're gonna
roll<00:03:16.049> this<00:03:16.110> out<00:03:16.440> like<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.769> roll<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.220> with<00:03:17.310> the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
roll this out like that roll it with the

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.190 
roll this out like that roll it with the
machine<00:03:17.790> but<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.180> mean<00:03:18.450> there<00:03:18.600> are<00:03:18.630> women<00:03:19.079> in

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
machine but I mean there are women in

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.050 
machine but I mean there are women in
Italy<00:03:19.590> who<00:03:19.799> have<00:03:19.980> these<00:03:20.160> massive<00:03:20.459> rolling

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
Italy who have these massive rolling

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.610 
Italy who have these massive rolling
pins<00:03:21.299> and<00:03:21.570> they<00:03:21.660> can<00:03:21.840> change

right<00:04:12.300> so<00:04:13.300> there's<00:04:13.990> two<00:04:14.200> ways<00:04:14.380> of<00:04:14.530> doing<00:04:14.710> it

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
right so there's two ways of doing it

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.090 
right so there's two ways of doing it
you<00:04:15.460> can<00:04:15.580> either<00:04:15.670> fold<00:04:16.030> like<00:04:16.330> so<00:04:16.950> don't<00:04:17.950> put

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
you can either fold like so don't put

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.830 
you can either fold like so don't put
too<00:04:18.250> much<00:04:18.280> flour<00:04:18.730> on<00:04:18.970> which<00:04:19.180> is<00:04:19.299> lightly<00:04:19.510> fold

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
too much flour on which is lightly fold

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.680 
too much flour on which is lightly fold
across<00:04:21.300> okay<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.600> then<00:04:22.780> you<00:04:22.900> just<00:04:23.140> cut<00:04:24.690> into

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
across okay and then you just cut into

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.870 
across okay and then you just cut into
little<00:04:25.840> I<00:04:26.260> don't<00:04:27.070> want<00:04:27.190> your<00:04:27.310> cool<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:27.550> little

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
little I don't want your cool and little

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.080 
little I don't want your cool and little
rectangular<00:04:28.480> shapes<00:04:28.780> and<00:04:29.410> then<00:04:29.740> of<00:04:30.010> course

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
rectangular shapes and then of course

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.640 
rectangular shapes and then of course
they<00:04:31.090> become<00:04:31.420> this<00:04:31.540> beautiful<00:04:31.810> Italian<00:04:32.470> telly

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
they become this beautiful Italian telly

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.870 
they become this beautiful Italian telly
and<00:04:32.800> you<00:04:32.860> can<00:04:32.980> leave<00:04:33.160> it<00:04:33.280> dry<00:04:33.490> a<00:04:33.520> little<00:04:33.700> bit

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
and you can leave it dry a little bit

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.130 
and you can leave it dry a little bit
but<00:04:34.630> we're<00:04:34.750> going<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:34.930> cook<00:04:35.110> it<00:04:35.170> fresh<00:04:38.940> and

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
but we're going to cook it fresh and

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.320 
but we're going to cook it fresh and
then<00:04:41.140> this<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:41.650> then<00:04:41.950> beautifully<00:04:42.640> straight

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
then this and then beautifully straight

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.850 
then this and then beautifully straight
another<00:04:43.660> thing<00:04:43.840> is<00:04:43.960> also<00:04:44.290> the<00:04:44.380> Mersenne<00:04:44.710> what

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
another thing is also the Mersenne what

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.310 
another thing is also the Mersenne what
we've<00:04:44.980> got<00:04:45.160> is<00:04:45.280> some<00:04:45.400> melted<00:04:45.580> butter<00:04:46.320> which
