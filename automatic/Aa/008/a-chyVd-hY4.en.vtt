position<00:00:40.079> sound<00:00:43.579> okay<00:00:44.579> let's<00:00:44.789> adjust<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.420> amp

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
position sound okay let's adjust the amp

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.090 
position sound okay let's adjust the amp
to<00:00:46.160> work<00:00:47.160> with<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.489> one<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:48.210> little<00:00:48.360> more<00:00:48.480> gain

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.880 

just<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.309> before<00:00:53.489> break<00:00:53.940> up<00:00:54.680> pretty<00:00:55.680> good

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
just like before break up pretty good

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
just like before break up pretty good
it's<00:00:56.460> more<00:00:56.670> treble

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
it's more treble

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.270 
it's more treble
not<00:00:58.420> too<00:00:58.630> much

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:12.620 

or<00:01:02.790> bass<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:04.940> little<00:01:05.940> bit<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.240> presence<00:01:11.600> maybe<00:01:12.600> a

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
or bass a little bit of presence maybe a

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.070 
or bass a little bit of presence maybe a
little<00:01:12.840> less<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:14.100> littlest<00:01:14.790> gain<00:01:15.000> okay<00:01:15.420> so

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
little less that littlest gain okay so

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.520 
little less that littlest gain okay so
now<00:01:16.560> I'm<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.370> add<00:01:17.760> a<00:01:18.270> compressor<00:01:18.960> after

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
now I'm going to add a compressor after

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.190 
now I'm going to add a compressor after
this<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:20.030> big<00:01:21.030> component<00:01:21.300> of<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.630> lot<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.869> 60s

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
this a big component of a lot of 60s

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.660 
this a big component of a lot of 60s
recordings<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.010> use<00:01:23.160> of<00:01:23.310> compression

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
recordings is the use of compression

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.730 
recordings is the use of compression
there's<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.240> great<00:01:24.540> tube<00:01:24.840> compressor<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.470> here

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
there's a great tube compressor in here

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.320 
there's a great tube compressor in here
that<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.310> get<00:01:26.490> us<00:01:26.610> really<00:01:26.820> close<00:01:27.180> to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
that is going to get us really close to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.249 
that is going to get us really close to
that<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.930> let's<00:01:28.530> put<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.220> tube<00:01:30.030> compressor

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.050 

to<00:01:34.259> squash<00:01:34.649> so<00:01:34.860> I'm<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> ease<00:01:35.280> up<00:01:35.490> by

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
to squash so I'm going to ease up by

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.410 
to squash so I'm going to ease up by
increasing<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.110> threshold<00:01:41.060> maybe<00:01:42.060> I'll<00:01:42.210> back

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
increasing the threshold maybe I'll back

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:50.750 
increasing the threshold maybe I'll back
off<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.690> gain<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> little<00:01:43.140> more

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.380 

nice<00:01:51.770> okay<00:01:52.770> one<00:01:53.550> more<00:01:53.730> thing<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:53.940> want<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.120> do<00:01:54.240> is

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
nice okay one more thing I want to do is

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.980 
nice okay one more thing I want to do is
add<00:01:54.510> a<00:01:54.570> reverb<00:01:54.950> so<00:01:55.950> let's<00:01:56.490> add<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:57.180> spring

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
add a reverb so let's add a spring

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.230 
add a reverb so let's add a spring
reverb<00:01:59.270> and<00:02:01.040> there's<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.130> reverb<00:02:02.820> in<00:02:03.000> here

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
reverb and there's a reverb in here

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.380 
reverb and there's a reverb in here
called<00:02:03.570> 63<00:02:04.230> spring<00:02:04.880> which<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:05.910> pretty<00:02:06.180> cool

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
called 63 spring which is pretty cool

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.290 
called 63 spring which is pretty cool
okay<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.170> want<00:02:07.440> to<00:02:07.560> add<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.340> little<00:02:08.760> bit<00:02:08.910> more<00:02:09.180> of

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
okay I want to add a little bit more of

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.970 
okay I want to add a little bit more of
this<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.600> I'm<00:02:09.690> gonna<00:02:09.780> increase<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.410> mix<00:02:12.980> okay

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
this so I'm gonna increase the mix okay

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.250 
this so I'm gonna increase the mix okay
let's<00:02:14.400> do<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.760> let's<00:02:15.390> do<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.600> test<00:02:15.840> here<00:02:16.080> I

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
let's do the let's do the test here I

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.840 
let's do the let's do the test here I
know<00:02:16.800> there's<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:16.980> lot<00:02:17.130> of<00:02:17.220> ways<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.490> play<00:02:17.670> this

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
know there's a lot of ways to play this

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.460 
know there's a lot of ways to play this
but<00:02:18.090> this<00:02:18.420> way<00:02:18.600> works<00:02:18.810> for<00:02:18.900> me<00:02:19.080> here's<00:02:19.320> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
but this way works for me here's the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.670 
but this way works for me here's the
hard<00:02:19.740> day's<00:02:19.920> night<00:02:19.950> chord

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.789 

I<00:02:23.840> think<00:02:24.840> we<00:02:24.930> need<00:02:25.049> a<00:02:25.079> little<00:02:25.409> more

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
I think we need a little more

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.580 
I think we need a little more
compression<00:02:26.450> so<00:02:27.450> I'm<00:02:27.540> going<00:02:27.689> to<00:02:27.750> reduce<00:02:28.140> the

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
compression so I'm going to reduce the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:36.250 
compression so I'm going to reduce the
threshold

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:03:04.500 

nice

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.679 

you

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.059 

here's<00:03:08.689> a<00:03:08.750> really<00:03:08.900> cool<00:03:09.110> one<00:03:09.260> too<00:03:09.470> I'm<00:03:09.739> gonna

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
here's a really cool one too I'm gonna

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.940 
here's a really cool one too I'm gonna
