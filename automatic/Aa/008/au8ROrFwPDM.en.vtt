hey guys it's me cubics and today we're
going<00:00:01.920> to<00:00:02.010> talk<00:00:02.159> about<00:00:02.190> the<00:00:02.429> YJ<00:00:02.760> guanlong<00:00:03.300> it's

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
going to talk about the YJ guanlong it's

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.300 
going to talk about the YJ guanlong it's
gotten<00:00:04.319> quite<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.500> bit<00:00:04.560> of<00:00:04.740> hype<00:00:04.890> due<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.190> its

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
gotten quite a bit of hype due to its

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.829 
gotten quite a bit of hype due to its
low<00:00:05.460> price<00:00:05.790> but<00:00:06.299> does<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.480> cube<00:00:06.690> actually

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
low price but does the cube actually

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.600 
low price but does the cube actually
work<00:00:07.170> getting<00:00:12.380> the<00:00:13.380> guanlong<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.950> listed<00:00:14.309> as<00:00:14.460> a

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
work getting the guanlong is listed as a

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.849 
work getting the guanlong is listed as a
57-millimeter<00:00:15.179> cube<00:00:15.839> but<00:00:16.170> it's<00:00:16.320> noticeably

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
57-millimeter cube but it's noticeably

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.769 
57-millimeter cube but it's noticeably
smaller<00:00:17.039> than<00:00:17.400> other<00:00:17.580> 57-millimeter<00:00:18.330> cubes

the size to be bothersome additionally
the<00:00:23.699> guanlong<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.210> among<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.539> lightest<00:00:24.930> cubes

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
the guanlong is among the lightest cubes

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.290 
the guanlong is among the lightest cubes
I've<00:00:25.320> used<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.890> personally<00:00:26.730> like<00:00:26.970> heavier

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
I've used I personally like heavier

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.240 
I've used I personally like heavier
cubes<00:00:27.660> but<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.230> guanlong<00:00:28.560> was<00:00:28.740> easy<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.099> get

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
cubes but the guanlong was easy to get

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.669 
cubes but the guanlong was easy to get
used<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.580> out<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.539> box<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.109> guanlong<00:00:31.439> had

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
used to out of the box the guanlong had

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.860 
used to out of the box the guanlong had
an<00:00:31.890> amazing<00:00:32.460> feel<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:33.390> was<00:00:33.510> smooth<00:00:33.719> and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
an amazing feel it was smooth and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.590 
an amazing feel it was smooth and
scratchy<00:00:34.170> with<00:00:34.559> really<00:00:35.130> nice<00:00:35.280> speed<00:00:35.700> but<00:00:36.420> cube

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
scratchy with really nice speed but cube

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.500 
scratchy with really nice speed but cube
is<00:00:36.719> now<00:00:36.809> broken<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.770> crunchy<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.280> loud

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
is now broken in and is crunchy and loud

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.850 
is now broken in and is crunchy and loud
however<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> speed<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.930> still<00:00:40.079> great<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.710> I

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
however the speed is still great and I

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.410 
however the speed is still great and I
haven't<00:00:41.129> had<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.399> leave<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.730> cube<00:00:41.910> at<00:00:42.000> all

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
haven't had to leave this cube at all

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.510 
haven't had to leave this cube at all
the<00:00:42.960> guanlong<00:00:43.320> really<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:43.980> pretty<00:00:44.340> good

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
the guanlong really is a pretty good

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.430 
the guanlong really is a pretty good
cube<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.390> only<00:00:45.660> major<00:00:45.809> downfall<00:00:46.410> I

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
cube the only major downfall I

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.170 
cube the only major downfall I
experienced<00:00:47.160> was<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.579> lack<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.760> corner

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
experienced was the lack of corner

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.630 
experienced was the lack of corner
cutting<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> same<00:00:49.410> face<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.430> corner

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
cutting for the same face the corner

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.520 
cutting for the same face the corner
cutting<00:00:50.879> struggled<00:00:51.300> at<00:00:51.360> 45<00:00:51.750> degrees<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.079> some

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
cutting struggled at 45 degrees on some

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.350 
cutting struggled at 45 degrees on some
sides<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.219> couldn't<00:00:53.760> do<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.940> at<00:00:54.030> all<00:00:54.180> on

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
sides and couldn't do it at all on

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.479 
sides and couldn't do it at all on
others<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.440> likely<00:00:55.680> due<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.129> crooked

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
others this is likely due to a crooked

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.069 
others this is likely due to a crooked
screw<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.239> swapping<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.750> court<00:00:57.960> would

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
screw so swapping the court would

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.290 
screw so swapping the court would
probably<00:00:58.440> fix<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.800> problem<00:00:59.070> the<00:01:00.030> reverse

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
probably fix this problem the reverse

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.970 
probably fix this problem the reverse
corner<00:01:00.510> cutting<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.930> also<00:01:01.379> lacking<00:01:01.649> only

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
corner cutting is also lacking only

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.280 
corner cutting is also lacking only
being<00:01:02.489> able<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.730> cut<00:01:02.940> half<00:01:03.120> QB<00:01:03.600> with<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> lot<00:01:04.140> of

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
being able to cut half QB with a lot of

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.320 
being able to cut half QB with a lot of
force<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:05.309> lack<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.580> corner<00:01:05.970> cutting<00:01:06.210> is

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
force this lack of corner cutting is

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.149 
force this lack of corner cutting is
unsurprising<00:01:06.990> once<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.350> pop<00:01:07.470> open<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.920> cube

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
unsurprising once we pop open the cube

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.609 
unsurprising once we pop open the cube
the<00:01:08.729> guanlong<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.330> essentially<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> chi<00:01:10.380> long

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
the guanlong is essentially a chi long

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.469 
the guanlong is essentially a chi long
with<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> same<00:01:11.189> blocky<00:01:11.460> pieces<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.150> tabular

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
with the same blocky pieces and tabular

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.899 
with the same blocky pieces and tabular
anti<00:01:12.810> popping<00:01:13.140> mechanism<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.340> anti<00:01:14.580> popping

anti popping mechanism the anti popping

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.910 
anti popping mechanism the anti popping
works<00:01:15.090> fine<00:01:15.509> but<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> blocky<00:01:16.380> cubes<00:01:16.830> made

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
works fine but the blocky cubes made

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.530 
works fine but the blocky cubes made
corner<00:01:17.340> cutting<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.670> bit<00:01:17.880> more<00:01:18.030> difficult

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
corner cutting a bit more difficult

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.140 
corner cutting a bit more difficult
so<00:01:19.350> overall<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.100> guanlong<00:01:20.460> seems<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.119> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
so overall the guanlong seems to be a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.510 
so overall the guanlong seems to be a
decent<00:01:21.299> cube<00:01:21.780> although<00:01:22.200> nothing<00:01:22.409> special<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
decent cube although nothing special the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.130 
decent cube although nothing special the
field<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.909> great<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.630> corner<00:01:24.840> cutting<00:01:25.020> is

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
field is great but the corner cutting is

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.830 
field is great but the corner cutting is
lackluster<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.979> somewhat<00:01:26.310> outdated<00:01:26.840> but

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
lackluster and somewhat outdated but

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.200 
lackluster and somewhat outdated but
then<00:01:28.439> there's<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> price<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.670> cube<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.060> only

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
then there's the price this cube is only

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.210 
then there's the price this cube is only
four<00:01:30.509> dollars<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.020> cubicle<00:01:31.350> at<00:01:31.500> us<00:01:31.829> making

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
four dollars on the cubicle at us making

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.980 
four dollars on the cubicle at us making
it<00:01:32.460> one<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.850> most<00:01:33.060> inexpensive<00:01:33.450> speed

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
it one of the most inexpensive speed
