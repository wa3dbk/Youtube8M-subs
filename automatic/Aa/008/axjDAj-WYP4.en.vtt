00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.710
 not 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.710
 Well 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.029
 hello here you wrote to me in the comments 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.950
 to one of the reviews that 20,000 price 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.630
 not at all anti-crisis despite 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.810
 that the flagship samsung for example is already 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.970
 50 60 thousand rubles, well then 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.890
 Today we consider simple as the first 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.870
 snowdrops and accessible to all as 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.380
 spring sun omega prime smartphones 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.540
 mini 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.540
 Asia and omega prime from a highscreen 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.570
 quality premium materials now 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.360
 roads we will enjoy simple things 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.550
 for example plastic panels 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.769
 you can change the colors in each set 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.710
 smartphone 4 interchangeable panels 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:04.589
 matte white and black glossy yellow 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.210
 and red remove the panel with prime with easy 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.280
 there is a special notch to 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.770
 pick up and im easily separated and 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.140
 also easy to dress, but dressing up 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.270
 manifestation with it is much more difficult 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.399
 no gaps panel tight 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.409
 grabs the body at some point i 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.960
 in general, he thought wickedly that he did not 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.570
 collapsible uniquely light gets this 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.509
 smartphone here is all the salt of interchangeable panels 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.369
 and you need to change them easily except 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.679
 that prime with lighter 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.720
 the weight difference is only 7 grams 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.119
 I noticed it before I looked 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.630
 In the characteristic of course the bath is not 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.220
 heavy but pms almost weightless 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.600
 location of buttons and connectors 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.460
 the same power button on the right 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.800
 edges are located correctly and there and there 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.860
 she gets a passport but why u 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.009
 smaller device button more behind 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.259
 flash cameras and field dynamics 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.289
 top and bottom of the screen are wide 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.209
 especially at pms top place though dance 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.209
 good color and brightness 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:05.220
 only acceptable at maximum wprime with 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.380
 screen scarecrow about the name of the dream 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.050
 it is determined by resolution and well 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.319
 noticeable on the watch in the whole screen 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.010
 prime with can be called the average exchange 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.770
 se 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.590
 below average at the bottom of smartphones 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.080
 identical touch buttons back menu and 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.970
 button calling list wallpaper apps 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.920
 on the construction site nominated 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.510
 characteristic of highscreen curtains on 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.599
 one of the screens is no less characteristic 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.640
 application settings panels and widgets 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.560
 It seems to me that in such bright and 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.300
 budget smartphones must necessarily 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.700
 be some cool though and not 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.410
 very functional chips i would 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.660
 I was looking for what you can order and 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.300
 still found a hyphen wallpaper under the color 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.540
 panel 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.390
 white black she okay yellow and red 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.940
 Well, on that, thanks to both devices 1 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.640
 gigabytes of RAM and only 8 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.670
 constant but at the same time 32 gigabytes in 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.860
 Quad-core smartphone facing cloud 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.750
 qualcomm processors with a clock speed 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.580
 1 2 gigahertz 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.010
 antutu test assigns more 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.960
 number of points mini fms in practice 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.270
 the difference between them is almost imperceptible 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.260
 The application does not open instantly in 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.840
 brake games 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.100
 I did not notice only the installation lasted 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.280
 longer than dragging the screen 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.290
 Hercules about him is another my review and here 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.780
 cameras in these smartphones then the real 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.730
 find for slopokov frame creation 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.730
 lasts a long few seconds 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.870
 it's like a balance exercise you need 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.569
 keep your hands in one position not 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.760
 move and do not interfere with making a frame 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.859
 dark place for example under the table 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.359
 need to be at random because on the screen in general 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.790
 can't see anything until it works 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.430
 flash she image flashes a 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.859
 flowers and of course go to the pink and 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.109
 where in yellow green but on the whole nothing 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.299
 quite tolerant picture quality 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.420
 correspond to the stated 8 megapixels 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:03.150
 copes with the task of hdr recognize the queen 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.790
 And this is a selfie for 2 cumulative front 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.909
 omega prime camera 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.400
 with a battery capacity of 1780 milliampere 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:13.829
 hours in numbers not a trace 1600 milliampere 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.310
 hours listening to music 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:19.320
 they will work 18 hours 7 minutes and 17 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.269
 hours 40 minutes respectively in 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.550
 bundled besides smartphones and removable 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.490
 the panels still go headphones and not charging 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.770
 by the way they do not have indicators of such 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.229
 what some choppers have 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.669
 so the advantages of these models are low 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.680
 interchangeable panels 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.110
 small weight and compact dimensions 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.370
 camera performance screen of course 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.500
 not possessing stupid 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.650
 characteristics but such gadgets pause 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.960
 they want good for the youth climbed in 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.060
 as a second phone crisis late 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.970
 all if you compare the smartphone between 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.400
 wins prime with him a little 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.099
 less weight easier to replace interchangeable panels 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.320
 better screen and holds charge a little longer 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:02.789
 batteries 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:06.050
 real please help really 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:06.050
 I like likes and subscriptions
