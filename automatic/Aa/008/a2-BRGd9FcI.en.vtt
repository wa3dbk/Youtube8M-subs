then<00:01:50.910> it<00:01:51.000> comes<00:01:51.210> up<00:01:51.390> into<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.690> tee<00:01:51.960> right

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
then it comes up into this tee right

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.800 
then it comes up into this tee right
here<00:01:52.500> there's<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.770> bulb<00:01:52.980> out<00:01:53.160> there<00:01:53.810> right

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
here there's a bulb out there right

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.660 
here there's a bulb out there right
above<00:01:55.050> this<00:01:55.230> this<00:01:55.710> would<00:01:56.010> there's<00:01:56.400> a<00:01:56.460> ball

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
above this this would there's a ball

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.280 
above this this would there's a ball
valve<00:01:56.700> there<00:01:57.150> and<00:01:57.450> there's<00:01:57.780> one<00:01:57.840> there<00:01:57.960> and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
valve there and there's one there and

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.860 
valve there and there's one there and
then<00:01:58.410> it<00:01:58.530> tees<00:01:58.740> off<00:01:59.300> and<00:02:00.300> then<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.540> comes<00:02:00.720> up

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
then it tees off and then it comes up

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.540 
then it tees off and then it comes up
here<00:02:01.080> I'll<00:02:01.170> show<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.410> what's<00:02:01.560> going<00:02:01.830> on<00:02:01.890> so

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
here I'll show you what's going on so

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.340 
here I'll show you what's going on so
the<00:02:02.670> pump<00:02:02.910> actually<00:02:03.210> pumps<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> water<00:02:03.870> up

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
the pump actually pumps the water up

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.830 
the pump actually pumps the water up
into<00:02:04.650> these<00:02:04.830> three<00:02:05.190> tanks<00:02:05.630> that's<00:02:06.630> where

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
into these three tanks that's where

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.450 
into these three tanks that's where
those<00:02:06.930> tees<00:02:07.230> are<00:02:07.530> each<00:02:07.710> like<00:02:07.980> say<00:02:08.190> each<00:02:08.310> one

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
those tees are each like say each one

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.340 
those tees are each like say each one
has<00:02:08.640> valves<00:02:08.940> but<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.510> it<00:02:09.630> wide<00:02:09.810> open<00:02:09.840> for

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
has valves but I have it wide open for

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.270 
has valves but I have it wide open for
right<00:02:10.470> now

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
right now

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.650 
right now
DIY<00:02:11.900> PVC<00:02:12.900> overflows<00:02:13.640> as<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.940> water<00:02:15.180> comes<00:02:15.510> in

DIY PVC overflows as that water comes in

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.290 
DIY PVC overflows as that water comes in

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
here that DIY PVC overflow actually

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.100 
here that DIY PVC overflow actually
flows<00:02:18.570> down<00:02:19.940> down<00:02:20.940> into<00:02:21.180> these<00:02:21.420> tanks<00:02:21.930> right

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
flows down down into these tanks right

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.600 
flows down down into these tanks right
here<00:02:23.210> right<00:02:24.210> here<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.930> then<00:02:25.320> right<00:02:26.160> here<00:02:26.190> this

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
here right here and then right here this

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.340 
here right here and then right here this
isn't<00:02:26.790> all<00:02:27.000> done<00:02:27.270> I'm<00:02:27.480> just<00:02:27.510> running<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.170> for

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
isn't all done I'm just running it for

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.190 
isn't all done I'm just running it for
right<00:02:28.500> now<00:02:28.530> then<00:02:29.400> once<00:02:29.700> again<00:02:29.790> same<00:02:30.540> principle

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
right now then once again same principle

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.820 
right now then once again same principle
DIY<00:02:31.920> PVC<00:02:32.580> overflows<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.540> those<00:02:34.230> flow<00:02:34.590> down

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
DIY PVC overflows and those flow down

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.190 
DIY PVC overflows and those flow down
into<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:36.150> sump<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.630> then<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.900> whole<00:02:37.050> process

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
into the sump and then the whole process

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.070 
into the sump and then the whole process
starts<00:02:37.560> over<00:02:38.160> again<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:39.150> everything<00:02:39.690> is

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
starts over again so everything is

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.960 
starts over again so everything is
working<00:02:40.590> right<00:02:40.830> now<00:02:41.160> I'm<00:02:41.400> not<00:02:41.550> seeing<00:02:41.790> any

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
working right now I'm not seeing any

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.290 
working right now I'm not seeing any

but<00:02:45.989> I'm<00:02:46.230> not<00:02:46.470> gonna<00:02:46.650> run<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.100> tank<00:02:47.340> while<00:02:47.820> I'm

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
but I'm not gonna run the tank while I'm

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.479 
but I'm not gonna run the tank while I'm
sleeping<00:02:48.450> just<00:02:48.480> yet<00:02:49.130> I'll<00:02:50.130> probably<00:02:50.310> wait

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
sleeping just yet I'll probably wait

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.370 
sleeping just yet I'll probably wait
till<00:02:50.520> I<00:02:50.670> get<00:02:50.790> home<00:02:50.850> from<00:02:51.030> work<00:02:51.180> let<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.900> run<00:02:52.080> for

you know good six seven hours come down

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.090 
you know good six seven hours come down
here<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.260> make<00:02:55.380> sure<00:02:55.500> everything's<00:02:55.890> running

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
here and make sure everything's running

here and make sure everything's running
the<00:02:56.310> way<00:02:56.400> it's<00:02:56.550> supposed<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.209> but<00:02:58.019> that's

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
the way it's supposed to but that's

the way it's supposed to but that's
that's<00:02:58.620> what<00:02:58.800> we<00:02:58.860> got<00:02:59.040> going<00:02:59.310> on<00:02:59.370> right<00:02:59.640> now<00:02:59.670> as

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
that's what we got going on right now as

soon as this is bulletproof and I know
for<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.640> know<00:03:02.760> there's<00:03:03.570> an<00:03:03.720> unlikely<00:03:04.350> chance

for you know there's an unlikely chance

have them sit you know this is probably
sixty<00:03:12.870> plus<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:14.160> know<00:03:14.250> this<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.519> like

sixty plus and you know this is like

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.100 
sixty plus and you know this is like
fifty<00:03:15.120> cuz<00:03:15.300> they're<00:03:15.420> not<00:03:15.450> all<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.750> way<00:03:15.870> up

most another twenty five in there so you

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.590 
most another twenty five in there so you

I'll start working on this I have most
