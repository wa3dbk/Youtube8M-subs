00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
side will get a spacer block a concrete

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.550 
side will get a spacer block a concrete
washer<00:01:21.280> and<00:01:21.460> nut<00:01:24.420> have<00:01:25.420> been<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.690> last<00:01:25.840> faster

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
washer and nut have been the last faster

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.320 
washer and nut have been the last faster
going<00:01:26.800> towards<00:01:27.039> the<00:01:27.130> front<00:01:27.280> will<00:01:27.970> be<00:01:28.090> a<00:01:28.119> one

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
going towards the front will be a one

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.880 
going towards the front will be a one
and<00:01:28.420> a<00:01:28.479> half<00:01:28.509> inch<00:01:28.930> long<00:01:29.110> bolts<00:01:29.530> this<00:01:29.649> would<00:01:29.800> be

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
and a half inch long bolts this would be

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.940 
and a half inch long bolts this would be
shorter<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:30.460> then<00:01:30.970> to<00:01:31.210> count<00:01:31.450> washer<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.410> a

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
shorter and then to count washer and a

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.859 
shorter and then to count washer and a
nut<00:01:32.979> now<00:01:33.759> that<00:01:34.030> we<00:01:34.149> know<00:01:34.270> how<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.450> hardware

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
nut now that we know how the hardware

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.779 
nut now that we know how the hardware
will<00:01:35.259> fit<00:01:35.470> together<00:01:35.590> we'll<00:01:36.100> go<00:01:36.250> ahead<00:01:36.369> and<00:01:36.520> put

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
will fit together we'll go ahead and put

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:38.460 
will fit together we'll go ahead and put
the<00:01:36.880> hitch<00:01:37.060> onto<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.509> truck<00:01:37.780> it's<00:01:38.229> a<00:01:38.320> good

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
the hitch onto the truck it's a good

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.840 
the hitch onto the truck it's a good
idea<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.770> get<00:01:38.860> an<00:01:38.950> extra<00:01:39.009> set<00:01:39.250> of<00:01:39.310> hands<00:01:39.610> help

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
idea to get an extra set of hands help

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.190 
idea to get an extra set of hands help
hold<00:01:40.090> up<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.240> hitch<00:01:42.690> we<00:01:43.690> use<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.960> frame
