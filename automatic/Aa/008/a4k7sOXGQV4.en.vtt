00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.120 

okay<00:02:58.760> I'm<00:02:59.000> going<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.210> put<00:02:59.420> a<00:02:59.450> tenon<00:03:00.440> out<00:03:00.770> up

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
okay I'm going to put a tenon out up

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.590 
okay I'm going to put a tenon out up
here<00:03:01.240> so<00:03:02.240> that<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.840> lid<00:03:03.110> can<00:03:03.380> can<00:03:03.940> fit<00:03:04.940> sort<00:03:05.450> of

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
here so that the lid can can fit sort of

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.740 
here so that the lid can can fit sort of
fit<00:03:05.720> together<00:03:05.930> like<00:03:05.990> a<00:03:06.140> box<00:03:06.470> actually<00:03:07.060> I<00:03:08.060> don't

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
fit together like a box actually I don't

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.040 
fit together like a box actually I don't
know<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:08.840> figure<00:03:09.140> that's<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:10.540> best<00:03:11.540> way<00:03:11.720> to<00:03:11.750> do

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
know I figure that's the best way to do

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.600 
know I figure that's the best way to do
it<00:03:12.200> so<00:03:12.230> it'll<00:03:12.590> seed<00:03:12.950> in<00:03:13.100> there<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:13.400> you<00:03:13.460> can

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
it so it'll seed in there and you can

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.700 
it so it'll seed in there and you can
just<00:03:13.640> glue<00:03:14.030> it<00:03:14.060> together<00:03:14.300> I<00:03:14.810> don't<00:03:15.470> know

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
just glue it together I don't know

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:40.350 
just glue it together I don't know
though<00:03:16.300> well<00:03:17.300> find<00:03:18.200> out

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360

like<00:05:02.089> at<00:05:02.179> the<00:05:02.269> box<00:05:02.539> I<00:05:02.839> guess<00:05:03.369> let's<00:05:04.369> try<00:05:04.609> that

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.159 

just<00:05:09.229> go<00:05:09.379> ahead<00:05:09.439> and<00:05:09.589> turn<00:05:10.159> laid<00:05:10.459> back<00:05:10.639> down

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
just go ahead and turn laid back down

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:44.470 
just go ahead and turn laid back down
stand<00:05:12.169> it<00:05:12.319> up

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:44.480 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.429 

just<00:05:45.110> go<00:05:45.740> ahead<00:05:45.830> and

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:47.439 
just go ahead and

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:54.130 
just go ahead and
stand<00:05:48.099> it<00:05:48.279> up

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.340 

well<00:05:54.740> pull<00:05:55.580> it<00:05:55.700> off<00:05:55.820> lathe<00:05:56.120> and<00:05:56.390> then<00:05:56.570> do<00:05:57.170> the

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.350 
well pull it off lathe and then do the

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:04.570 
well pull it off lathe and then do the
top<00:06:02.680> all<00:06:03.680> right<00:06:03.800> there<00:06:04.130> we<00:06:04.220> go

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
top all right there we go

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.830 
top all right there we go
let's<00:06:05.360> clean<00:06:05.660> off<00:06:05.810> that<00:06:05.950> wax<00:06:06.950> around<00:06:07.250> there

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
let's clean off that wax around there

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.060 
let's clean off that wax around there
we're<00:06:08.840> going<00:06:08.930> to<00:06:09.020> have<00:06:09.140> to<00:06:09.290> sand<00:06:09.740> that<00:06:09.830> up<00:06:09.980> a

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
we're going to have to sand that up a

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.170 
we're going to have to sand that up a
little<00:06:10.250> bit<00:06:10.430> by<00:06:10.580> hand<00:06:10.940> -<00:06:11.240> -<00:06:12.760> so<00:06:13.760> the<00:06:13.820> glow<00:06:14.060> will

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
little bit by hand - - so the glow will

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.790 
little bit by hand - - so the glow will
stick<00:06:14.420> to<00:06:14.600> them<00:06:14.720> but<00:06:15.230> there<00:06:15.380> we<00:06:15.470> go<00:06:15.590> that's

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
stick to them but there we go that's

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.740 
stick to them but there we go that's
basically<00:06:16.310> what<00:06:16.640> I<00:06:16.670> did<00:06:16.910> as<00:06:17.120> I<00:06:17.300> drill<00:06:17.600> the<00:06:17.660> hole

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
basically what I did as I drill the hole

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.090 
basically what I did as I drill the hole
down<00:06:17.900> the<00:06:18.080> center<00:06:18.320> I<00:06:18.500> think<00:06:18.710> I<00:06:18.770> need<00:06:18.920> to<00:06:18.950> go<00:06:19.070> a

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
down the center I think I need to go a

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.560 
down the center I think I need to go a
little<00:06:19.280> bit<00:06:19.490> deeper<00:06:19.640> we're<00:06:20.300> just<00:06:20.420> going<00:06:20.540> to

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
little bit deeper we're just going to

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
little bit deeper we're just going to
come<00:06:20.720> in<00:06:20.810> from<00:06:20.960> the<00:06:21.050> side<00:06:21.200> and<00:06:21.350> we're<00:06:21.440> going<00:06:21.530> to

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
come in from the side and we're going to

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.590 
come in from the side and we're going to
make<00:06:21.770> a<00:06:21.800> think<00:06:22.670> I<00:06:22.850> think<00:06:23.060> I<00:06:23.120> have<00:06:23.210> a<00:06:23.240> piece<00:06:23.450> of

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 
make a think I think I have a piece of

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.640 
make a think I think I have a piece of
walnut<00:06:23.810> over<00:06:24.110> there<00:06:24.230> we'll<00:06:24.350> put<00:06:24.380> a<00:06:24.530> little

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
walnut over there we'll put a little

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:34.290 
walnut over there we'll put a little
walnut<00:06:24.860> top<00:06:25.220> on<00:06:25.430> it

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300
