00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
season 2 and season 3 and then again in

season<00:04:23.570> 3<00:04:24.080> and<00:04:24.110> season<00:04:24.680> four<00:04:24.710> so<00:04:25.250> we<00:04:25.279> sort<00:04:25.580> of

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
season 3 and season four so we sort of

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.440 
season 3 and season four so we sort of
had<00:04:25.820> a<00:04:25.849> midseason<00:04:26.300> to<00:04:26.659> change

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
had a midseason to change

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.420 
had a midseason to change
and<00:04:27.540> then<00:04:27.810> a<00:04:27.840> season<00:04:28.230> 32<00:04:28.440> season<00:04:28.860> for<00:04:29.100> change

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
and then a season 32 season for change

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.550 
and then a season 32 season for change
where<00:04:30.030> we<00:04:30.180> introduce<00:04:30.540> jungle<00:04:30.990> and<00:04:31.200> we've<00:04:31.410> been

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
where we introduce jungle and we've been

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.440 
where we introduce jungle and we've been
there<00:04:31.710> every<00:04:31.920> sense<00:04:32.160> a<00:04:32.430> lot<00:04:32.880> of<00:04:32.970> you<00:04:33.030> guys<00:04:33.090> want

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
there every sense a lot of you guys want

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.910 
there every sense a lot of you guys want
us<00:04:33.480> to<00:04:33.570> go<00:04:33.720> back<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.080> original<00:04:34.170> island<00:04:34.800> I'm

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
us to go back to the original island I'm

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.410 
us to go back to the original island I'm
sure<00:04:35.190> we'll<00:04:35.400> do<00:04:35.550> that<00:04:35.670> at<00:04:35.820> some<00:04:36.030> point<00:04:36.060> but

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
sure we'll do that at some point but

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.840 
sure we'll do that at some point but
that<00:04:36.540> will<00:04:36.630> probably<00:04:36.750> be<00:04:37.230> either<00:04:37.610> closer<00:04:38.610> to

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
that will probably be either closer to

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.580 
that will probably be either closer to
the<00:04:38.940> very<00:04:39.150> end<00:04:39.330> of<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.570> show<00:04:39.780> which<00:04:40.110> we<00:04:40.350> don't

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
the very end of the show which we don't

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.470 
the very end of the show which we don't
anticipate<00:04:40.830> happening<00:04:41.310> anytime<00:04:41.670> soon<00:04:41.850> or

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
anticipate happening anytime soon or

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.720 
anticipate happening anytime soon or
perhaps<00:04:43.320> as<00:04:43.650> an<00:04:43.800> illusion<00:04:44.190> or<00:04:44.310> something<00:04:44.610> in

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
perhaps as an illusion or something in

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.880 
perhaps as an illusion or something in
between<00:04:44.820> could<00:04:45.330> be<00:04:45.420> a<00:04:45.450> trick<00:04:45.720> from<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.620> old
