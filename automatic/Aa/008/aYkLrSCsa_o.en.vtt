jenson button to get the pass now this

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.440 
jenson button to get the pass now this
is<00:01:36.299> an<00:01:36.689> illegal<00:01:36.960> move<00:01:37.369> but<00:01:38.369> uh<00:01:38.400> we're<00:01:39.299> gonna

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
is an illegal move but uh we're gonna

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.390 
is an illegal move but uh we're gonna
have<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.689> wait<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:39.990> see<00:01:40.079> if<00:01:40.400> stewards

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
have to wait and see if stewards

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.840 
have to wait and see if stewards
actually<00:01:42.030> decide<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:43.320> give<00:01:43.470> him<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.680> penalty<00:01:44.070> my

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
actually decide to give him a penalty my

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.760 
actually decide to give him a penalty my
opinion<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.420> think<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.930> was<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> penalty<00:01:46.500> and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
opinion I think it was the penalty and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.990 
opinion I think it was the penalty and
I'm<00:01:46.920> pretty<00:01:47.159> sure<00:01:47.250> they<00:01:47.520> will<00:01:47.610> give<00:01:47.790> him<00:01:47.909> a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
I'm pretty sure they will give him a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.700 
I'm pretty sure they will give him a
penalty<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.540> if<00:01:49.200> they<00:01:49.320> do<00:01:49.439> give<00:01:49.560> him<00:01:49.649> a

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
penalty and if they do give him a

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.219 
penalty and if they do give him a
penalty<00:01:50.479> apparently<00:01:51.479> it's<00:01:51.659> more<00:01:51.899> likely<00:01:52.079> for

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
penalty apparently it's more likely for

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.410 
penalty apparently it's more likely for
him<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.740> get<00:01:53.009> sick<00:01:53.310> for<00:01:53.640> seventh<00:01:53.970> place<00:01:54.000> so

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
him to get sick for seventh place so

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.530 
him to get sick for seventh place so
