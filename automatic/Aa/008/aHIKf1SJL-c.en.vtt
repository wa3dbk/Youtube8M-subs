something<00:00:17.520> basically<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.300> act<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.690> taking

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
something basically is the act of taking

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.050 
something basically is the act of taking
a<00:00:19.230> portion<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.920> sample<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.430> one<00:00:20.760> sound

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
a portion of a sample of one sound

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.029 
a portion of a sample of one sound
recording<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.689> reusing<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.680> as<00:00:22.859> an

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
recording and reusing it as an

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.830 
recording and reusing it as an
instrument<00:00:23.460> or<00:00:23.640> element<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.210> new<00:00:24.359> recording

instrument or element of a new recording
this<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.619> typically<00:00:26.039> done<00:00:26.130> with<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> sampler

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
this is typically done with a sampler

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.150 
this is typically done with a sampler
which<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.720> be<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> piece<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.260> hardware<00:00:28.740> or<00:00:29.099> a

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
which can be a piece of hardware or a

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.880 
which can be a piece of hardware or a
computer<00:00:29.670> program<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> digital<00:00:30.510> computer

computer program on a digital computer
in<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.610> old<00:00:32.759> days<00:00:33.090> sampling<00:00:33.840> was<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.050> little

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
in the old days sampling was a little

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.500 
in the old days sampling was a little
tricky<00:00:34.739> process<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.700> now<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.329> many

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
tricky process but now it's so many

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.160 
tricky process but now it's so many
powerful<00:00:36.870> tools<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.950> quite<00:00:38.309> easy<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.760> fast<00:00:39.170> so

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
powerful tools is quite easy and fast so

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.700 
powerful tools is quite easy and fast so
let's<00:00:40.379> begin
