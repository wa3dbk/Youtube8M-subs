00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:55.250 

critics<00:00:50.510> in<00:00:51.510> fact<00:00:52.610> so<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.760> basically<00:00:54.260> changed

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260

the voice of Siri into that dialect and

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.599 
the voice of Siri into that dialect and
it<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.350> sounded<00:00:58.800> exactly<00:00:59.039> like<00:00:59.430> that

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
it just sounded exactly like that

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.389

dialect<00:01:00.300> does<00:01:00.620> so<00:01:01.620> if<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.829> change<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.370> a

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
dialect does so if I change it to a

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:11.359 
dialect does so if I change it to a
different<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:03.090> for<00:01:03.449> example<00:01:03.930> Korean<00:01:10.220> what<00:01:11.220> is

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the weather like in New York okay so

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.359 
the weather like in New York okay so
that<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.420> how<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.960> sounds<00:01:25.170> when<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
that is how it sounds when it is in the

that is how it sounds when it is in the
Korean<00:01:26.820> voice<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.740> basically<00:01:29.130> what
