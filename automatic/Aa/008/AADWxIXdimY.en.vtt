00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
to it which shimmers no nice and it's

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.430 
to it which shimmers no nice and it's
it's<00:00:45.030> rounded<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:45.809> actually<00:00:46.230> quite<00:00:46.350> a

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
it's rounded it's actually quite a

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.510 
little bit so it's a little bit more
ergonomic<00:00:48.690> we'd<00:00:48.899> say<00:00:49.110> but<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:49.559> wider<00:00:50.190> and
