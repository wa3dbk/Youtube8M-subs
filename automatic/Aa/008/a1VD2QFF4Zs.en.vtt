00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
open and you'll be cutting it straight

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.010 
open and you'll be cutting it straight
across<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.879> can<00:02:11.910> adjust<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.569> exactly

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
across and you can adjust it to exactly

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.700 
across and you can adjust it to exactly
how<00:02:13.230> long

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
how long

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.500 
how long
you<00:02:13.860> want<00:02:14.070> it<00:02:14.160> now<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.090> what<00:02:15.270> is<00:02:15.390> this

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
you want it now so what is this

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.450 
you want it now so what is this
innovative<00:02:16.080> technology<00:02:16.440> I've<00:02:17.010> been<00:02:17.160> talking

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
innovative technology I've been talking

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.000 
innovative technology I've been talking
about<00:02:17.550> this<00:02:17.730> micro<00:02:18.210> adjust<00:02:18.570> technology

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
about this micro adjust technology

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.100 
about this micro adjust technology
basically<00:02:20.010> if<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.610> look<00:02:20.760> at<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.060> back<00:02:21.390> the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
basically if you look at the back the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.020 
basically if you look at the back the
belt<00:02:22.320> you're<00:02:23.010> going<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.220> notice<00:02:23.550> there<00:02:23.910> were

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
belt you're going to notice there were

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.790 
belt you're going to notice there were
no<00:02:24.270> or<00:02:24.510> L<00:02:24.900> look<00:02:25.020> at<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.110> front<00:02:25.410> there<00:02:25.620> are<00:02:25.650> no

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
no or L look at the front there are no

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.910 
no or L look at the front there are no
holes<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.370> that's<00:02:27.270> because<00:02:27.750> they've<00:02:28.590> got

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
holes and that's because they've got

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.170 
holes and that's because they've got
these<00:02:29.400> little<00:02:29.460> catches<00:02:30.420> right<00:02:31.230> here<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:32.180> so

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
these little catches right here and so

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.160 
these little catches right here and so
as<00:02:33.800> I<00:02:34.800> thread<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.700> belt<00:02:36.000> through<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.990> can

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
as I thread the belt through you can

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:45.670 
as I thread the belt through you can
just<00:02:37.200> hear<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:42.530> basically<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:44.190> caught<00:02:44.490> and

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
just hear it basically it is caught and

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.440 
just hear it basically it is caught and
so<00:02:46.680> we've<00:02:46.890> really<00:02:46.920> got<00:02:47.640> something<00:02:47.670> that

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
so we've really got something that

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.680 
so we've really got something that
adjusts<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.700> basically<00:02:50.700> every<00:02:51.180> quarter<00:02:51.570> of

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
adjusts that basically every quarter of

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.060 
adjusts that basically every quarter of
an<00:02:51.810> inch<00:02:51.960> so<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.710> can<00:02:53.250> get<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.580> much<00:02:54.120> more

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
an inch so you can get a much more

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.000 
an inch so you can get a much more
exacting<00:02:56.070> fit<00:02:56.810> what<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:57.840> also<00:02:58.140> like<00:02:58.470> about<00:02:58.500> this

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
exacting fit what I also like about this

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.930 
exacting fit what I also like about this
is<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.570> makes<00:03:00.810> sure<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:01.800> you<00:03:02.460> wear<00:03:02.700> the

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
is that it makes sure that you wear the

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.180 
is that it makes sure that you wear the
belt<00:03:03.120> at<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.660> right<00:03:03.840> length<00:03:04.140> so<00:03:04.440> it<00:03:04.770> won't<00:03:05.010> let

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
belt at the right length so it won't let

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.480 
belt at the right length so it won't let
it<00:03:05.250> catch<00:03:05.700> until<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.870> looks<00:03:07.110> like<00:03:07.290> about<00:03:07.490> close

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
it catch until it looks like about close

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.640 
it catch until it looks like about close
to<00:03:08.640> three<00:03:08.910> inches<00:03:09.270> which<00:03:09.720> which<00:03:10.020> should<00:03:10.500> be

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
to three inches which which should be

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.560 
to three inches which which should be
about<00:03:10.830> right<00:03:11.070> on<00:03:11.250> most<00:03:11.640> men's<00:03:11.910> trousers<00:03:12.420> and

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
about right on most men's trousers and

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.470 
about right on most men's trousers and
there<00:03:13.110> is<00:03:13.430> looks<00:03:14.430> like<00:03:14.490> a<00:03:14.580> pretty<00:03:15.060> extensive

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
there is looks like a pretty extensive

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.660 
there is looks like a pretty extensive
range<00:03:16.260> here<00:03:16.560> I'll<00:03:16.740> have<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.250> measure<00:03:17.520> that

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
range here I'll have to measure that

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.220 
range here I'll have to measure that
again<00:03:18.090> but<00:03:18.510> we're<00:03:18.660> out<00:03:18.720> of<00:03:18.750> thought<00:03:18.960> my<00:03:19.110> head

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
again but we're out of thought my head

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.990 
again but we're out of thought my head
that<00:03:19.350> looks<00:03:19.500> like<00:03:19.590> around<00:03:19.770> eight<00:03:20.070> inches<00:03:20.550> that

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
that looks like around eight inches that

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.720 
that looks like around eight inches that
you'll<00:03:21.210> have<00:03:21.390> of<00:03:21.630> play<00:03:21.870> there<00:03:22.110> I<00:03:22.520> really<00:03:23.520> like

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
you'll have of play there I really like

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.390 
you'll have of play there I really like
the<00:03:23.970> system<00:03:24.420> innocence<00:03:25.350> they've<00:03:25.710> got<00:03:25.950> three

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
the system innocence they've got three

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.850 
the system innocence they've got three
buckles<00:03:26.850> and<00:03:27.030> they've<00:03:27.840> got<00:03:28.020> two<00:03:28.230> belt<00:03:28.500> straps

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
buckles and they've got two belt straps

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.410 
buckles and they've got two belt straps
so<00:03:29.430> if<00:03:29.490> you<00:03:29.550> think<00:03:29.730> about<00:03:29.910> it<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.180> have

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
so if you think about it you have

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.100 
so if you think about it you have
instead<00:03:31.170> of<00:03:31.350> just<00:03:32.160> two<00:03:32.610> belts<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:33.690> actually

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
instead of just two belts you actually

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.490 
instead of just two belts you actually
have<00:03:34.320> three<00:03:35.070> times<00:03:35.580> -<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.240> have<00:03:36.390> six<00:03:36.900> belt
