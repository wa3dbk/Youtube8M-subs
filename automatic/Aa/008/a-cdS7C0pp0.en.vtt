00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
really annoying so I pinned obviously a

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.860 
really annoying so I pinned obviously a
lot<00:03:45.310> of<00:03:45.340> my<00:03:45.580> eyelashes<00:03:46.060> out<00:03:46.210> with<00:03:46.450> that<00:03:46.630> I

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
lot of my eyelashes out with that I

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.360 
lot of my eyelashes out with that I
still<00:03:47.290> have<00:03:47.470> some<00:03:47.680> left<00:03:47.890> but<00:03:48.220> what<00:03:48.340> I

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
still have some left but what I

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.890 
still have some left but what I
obviously<00:03:48.700> still<00:03:48.910> have<00:03:49.180> loads<00:03:49.450> of<00:03:49.480> eyelashes

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
obviously still have loads of eyelashes

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.690 
obviously still have loads of eyelashes
but<00:03:50.110> it's<00:03:50.650> just<00:03:50.770> not<00:03:50.980> as<00:03:51.100> thick<00:03:51.310> as<00:03:51.490> it<00:03:51.610> usually

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
but it's just not as thick as it usually

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.230 
but it's just not as thick as it usually
was<00:03:52.030> so<00:03:52.680> they<00:03:53.680> will<00:03:53.830> grow<00:03:53.980> back<00:03:54.130> but<00:03:54.190> I've<00:03:55.000> been

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
was so they will grow back but I've been

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.750 
was so they will grow back but I've been
using<00:03:55.420> like<00:03:55.660> fake<00:03:55.960> eyelashes<00:03:56.590> as<00:03:56.710> well<00:03:56.740> from<00:03:57.400> I

using like fake eyelashes as well from I
did<00:03:58.660> it<00:03:58.750> as<00:03:58.870> well<00:03:58.990> because<00:03:59.290> I'm<00:03:59.410> just<00:03:59.620> I<00:03:59.920> just

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
did it as well because I'm just I just

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.730 
did it as well because I'm just I just
don't<00:04:01.030> like<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.330> look<00:04:01.480> of<00:04:01.660> not<00:04:02.230> having<00:04:02.620> not

I thought I would try this because my

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.670 
I thought I would try this because my
friend<00:05:08.620> uses<00:05:08.979> this<00:05:09.129> Ian<00:05:09.969> and<00:05:10.210> I<00:05:10.629> kind<00:05:11.589> of

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
like a pureed and I didn't have like a

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.309 
like a pureed and I didn't have like a
just<00:06:20.139> a<00:06:20.259> period<00:06:20.919> with<00:06:21.129> no<00:06:21.159> orange<00:06:21.789> e<00:06:22.000> or<00:06:22.319> any

just a period with no orange e or any
other<00:06:23.529> color<00:06:23.860> undertones<00:06:24.520> so<00:06:24.879> I<00:06:25.120> just<00:06:26.050> thought

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
other color undertones so I just thought

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:27.159 
other color undertones so I just thought
it<00:06:26.319> was<00:06:26.379> time<00:06:26.589> to<00:06:26.620> get

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169 
it was time to get

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:28.570 
it was time to get
but<00:06:27.409> I<00:06:27.439> didn't<00:06:27.680> want<00:06:27.830> to<00:06:27.860> get<00:06:28.009> a<00:06:28.069> mic<00:06:28.310> one

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
but I didn't want to get a mic one

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.089 
but I didn't want to get a mic one
because<00:06:28.969> they're<00:06:29.749> more<00:06:29.990> expensive<00:06:30.259> I<00:06:30.740> think

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:31.099 
because they're more expensive I think

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.459 
because they're more expensive I think
this<00:06:31.249> is<00:06:31.400> except<00:06:31.759> and<00:06:31.939> partner<00:06:32.240> something

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:32.469 
this is except and partner something
