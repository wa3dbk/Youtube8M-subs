00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.030 
we know of except the way that it fights
it's<00:00:33.000> gonna<00:00:33.120> fight<00:00:33.390> exactly<00:00:34.290> how<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.590> does<00:00:34.800> on

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
it's gonna fight exactly how it does on

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.700 
it's gonna fight exactly how it does on
consoles<00:00:35.790> they<00:00:36.390> also<00:00:36.570> are<00:00:36.809> adding<00:00:37.140> cages

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
consoles they also are adding cages

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.459 
consoles they also are adding cages
around<00:00:38.340> those<00:00:38.700> ender<00:00:39.210> crystal<00:00:39.629> things<00:00:39.870> and

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
around those ender crystal things and

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.290 
around those ender crystal things and
you'll<00:00:40.649> be<00:00:40.710> able<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.309> crap<00:00:41.610> those<00:00:41.879> up<00:00:42.149> and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
you'll be able to crap those up and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.840 
you'll be able to crap those up and
rebirth<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.739> end<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.070> Dragon<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.610> think

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
rebirth the end of Dragon so I think

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.369 
rebirth the end of Dragon so I think
that's<00:00:45.000> really<00:00:45.180> cool<00:00:45.420> too<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.930> don't<00:00:46.140> think

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
that's really cool too I don't think

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.479 
that's really cool too I don't think
they'll<00:00:46.500> change<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.920> course<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.250> way<00:00:47.370> it

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
they'll change of course the way it

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.760 
they'll change of course the way it
looks<00:00:47.700> or<00:00:47.820> what<00:00:47.969> not<00:00:48.120> but<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:49.050> they<00:00:49.410> made<00:00:49.649> it

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
looks or what not but like they made it

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.860 
looks or what not but like they made it
to<00:00:49.920> where<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:51.000> actually<00:00:51.600> has

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
to where it's like the in actually has

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.410 
to where it's like the in actually has
somewhat<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.770> purpose<00:00:53.610> which<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.180> really

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
somewhat of a purpose which I really

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.540 
somewhat of a purpose which I really
think<00:00:54.600> that's<00:00:54.750> awesome<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.379> it's<00:00:56.219> only<00:00:56.370> gonna

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
think that's awesome and it's only gonna

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.970 
think that's awesome and it's only gonna
make<00:00:56.640> minecraft<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:58.199> much<00:00:58.469> more<00:00:58.770> better

make minecraft that much more better

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.799 
make minecraft that much more better
it's<00:00:59.250> like<00:00:59.370> going<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> end<00:01:00.030> what's<00:01:00.600> never

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
it's like going to the end what's never

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.410 
it's like going to the end what's never
really<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.530> know<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.829> end<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.760> I'm<00:01:02.969> glad<00:01:03.329> that

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
features that's coming too as well like

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.649

they've<00:01:07.590> added<00:01:07.979> new<00:01:08.159> mobs<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.240> also<00:01:09.390> get

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
they've added new mobs you can also get

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.539 
they've added new mobs you can also get
fruit<00:01:09.990> as<00:01:10.170> well<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.890> what<00:01:11.130> you're<00:01:11.250> looking<00:01:11.460> at

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
fruit as well and what you're looking at

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.240 
fruit as well and what you're looking at
now<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:12.030> something<00:01:12.540> called<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.110> end<00:01:13.530> gateway

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
now is something called the end gateway

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.580 
now is something called the end gateway
so<00:01:15.150> they<00:01:15.240> thought<00:01:15.630> about<00:01:15.780> naming<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.380> in

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
so they thought about naming it in

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.560 
so they thought about naming it in
portal<00:01:17.009> portal<00:01:17.310> but<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.090> going<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.420> be

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
portal portal but this is going to be

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.570 
portal portal but this is going to be
the<00:01:19.350> end<00:01:19.650> gateway

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the end gateway

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.770 
the end gateway
I<00:01:20.610> don't<00:01:20.909> know<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.030> think<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.600> gonna

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
I don't know I think this is gonna

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.719 
I don't know I think this is gonna
either<00:01:21.990> unlock<00:01:22.530> something<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.250> unlock<00:01:23.700> a

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
either unlock something so you unlock a

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.030 
either unlock something so you unlock a
whole<00:01:24.119> new<00:01:24.360> city<00:01:24.630> after<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.619> defeat<00:01:25.799> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
whole new city after you defeat the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.890 
whole new city after you defeat the
Ender<00:01:26.310> Dragon<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.030> makes<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.450> more<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.750> a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
Ender Dragon so that makes it more of a

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.499 
Ender Dragon so that makes it more of a
of<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.380> story<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.640> defeat<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.150> dragon

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
of a story like you defeat in the dragon

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.420 
of a story like you defeat in the dragon
and<00:01:30.659> then<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.170> unlock<00:01:31.560> something<00:01:31.890> with

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
and then you unlock something with

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.130 
and then you unlock something with
different<00:01:33.000> islands<00:01:33.540> like<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> city<00:01:33.960> different

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
