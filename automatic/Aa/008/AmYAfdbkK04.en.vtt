you see the side view here the jump

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.439 
you see the side view here the jump
rings<00:03:38.680> will<00:03:38.889> kind<00:03:39.129> of<00:03:39.250> move<00:03:39.790> around<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.329> little

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:40.449 
rings will kind of move around a little

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.449 
rings will kind of move around a little
bit<00:03:40.599> and<00:03:41.019> if<00:03:41.470> you<00:03:41.530> want<00:03:41.829> them<00:03:41.919> to<00:03:42.010> kind<00:03:42.220> of<00:03:42.310> all

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
face the same way you just press them

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.080 
face the same way you just press them
down<00:03:44.139> but<00:03:44.739> as<00:03:44.889> long<00:03:45.129> as<00:03:45.160> they're<00:03:45.489> in<00:03:45.760> that

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
down but as long as they're in that

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.409 
down but as long as they're in that
Center<00:03:46.569> notch<00:03:46.810> right<00:03:47.199> there<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:49.209> can<00:03:49.389> see

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
Center notch right there you can see

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.710 
Center notch right there you can see
where<00:03:49.690> that<00:03:49.780> is<00:03:50.250> they'll<00:03:51.250> line<00:03:51.549> up<00:03:51.579> just<00:03:52.540> right

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
where that is they'll line up just right

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.119 
where that is they'll line up just right
so<00:03:53.169> you<00:03:53.230> want<00:03:53.440> to<00:03:53.500> make<00:03:53.590> sure<00:03:53.620> that<00:03:53.829> they<00:03:53.980> don't

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
so you want to make sure that they don't

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.420 
so you want to make sure that they don't
fall<00:03:54.400> down<00:03:54.459> inside<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.480> knot<00:03:55.660> there<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:57.340> I'll

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
fall down inside the knot there so I'll

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.539 
fall down inside the knot there so I'll
just<00:03:57.579> kind<00:03:57.849> of<00:03:58.470> make<00:03:59.470> them<00:03:59.650> go<00:03:59.829> down<00:04:00.040> there<00:04:00.340> and

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
just kind of make them go down there and

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.589 
just kind of make them go down there and
do<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:01.599> same<00:04:01.810> on<00:04:01.989> the<00:04:02.079> other<00:04:02.109> side<00:04:02.650> just<00:04:03.599> sort

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
do the same on the other side just sort

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.830 
do the same on the other side just sort
of<00:04:04.949> make<00:04:05.949> them<00:04:06.159> face<00:04:06.400> down<00:04:06.659> and<00:04:07.659> that's

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
of make them face down and that's

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.449 
of make them face down and that's
exactly<00:04:08.139> what<00:04:08.500> I've<00:04:08.590> done<00:04:08.620> in<00:04:08.919> this<00:04:09.040> bracelet

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
exactly what I've done in this bracelet

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.670 
exactly what I've done in this bracelet
I've<00:04:09.669> just<00:04:09.849> sort<00:04:10.030> of<00:04:10.120> made<00:04:10.780> them<00:04:10.959> face<00:04:11.230> all<00:04:11.500> the

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
I've just sort of made them face all the

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.890 
I've just sort of made them face all the
all<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.280> same<00:04:12.489> way<00:04:12.699> you<00:04:13.389> can<00:04:13.540> see<00:04:13.690> some<00:04:13.870> of

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
all the same way you can see some of

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.899 
all the same way you can see some of
them<00:04:14.079> got<00:04:14.230> flipped<00:04:14.560> but<00:04:15.370> I<00:04:15.400> just<00:04:15.609> think<00:04:15.729> it

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
them got flipped but I just think it

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.699 
them got flipped but I just think it
gives<00:04:16.150> it<00:04:16.269> a<00:04:16.359> nice<00:04:16.539> streamline<00:04:17.349> look<00:04:17.560> if

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
gives it a nice streamline look if

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.580 
gives it a nice streamline look if
they're<00:04:17.859> all<00:04:17.979> facing<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:18.789> same<00:04:19.030> direction<00:04:19.590> so

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
they're all facing the same direction so

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.909 
they're all facing the same direction so
let<00:04:20.739> me<00:04:20.859> do<00:04:21.010> one<00:04:21.220> more<00:04:21.250> just<00:04:21.729> show<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:22.120> and

just
helps<00:04:32.889> to<00:04:32.980> prevent<00:04:33.730> any<00:04:34.300> fraying<00:04:34.630> from<00:04:34.960> the

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
helps to prevent any fraying from the

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.820 
helps to prevent any fraying from the
end<00:04:35.350> of<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.560> cords<00:04:35.860> there<00:04:36.070> so<00:04:37.030> slide<00:04:37.270> one<00:04:37.480> down
