00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
about two quarters is you can switch

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.890 
about two quarters is you can switch
them<00:01:14.250> up<00:01:14.340> if<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.610> start<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.909> wear<00:01:15.060> down<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
them up if you start to wear down the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.990 
them up if you start to wear down the
grooves<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.830> one<00:01:17.009> side<00:01:17.250> or<00:01:17.520> whatever<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.850> can

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
grooves on one side or whatever you can

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.940 
grooves on one side or whatever you can
move<00:01:18.150> them<00:01:18.240> around<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.540> little<00:01:18.600> bit<00:01:18.840> but<00:01:19.799> how

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
move them around a little bit but how

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:28.970 
move them around a little bit but how
you<00:01:20.009> do<00:01:20.159> it

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.590 

just<00:01:29.980> sounds<00:01:30.310> like<00:01:30.340> that<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:30.970> just<00:01:31.180> you<00:01:31.570> know

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
just sounds like that and just you know

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.210 
just sounds like that and just you know
take<00:01:31.840> a<00:01:31.900> break<00:01:31.990> every<00:01:32.290> few<00:01:32.530> seconds<00:01:32.920> and<00:01:33.130> they

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
take a break every few seconds and they

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.770 
take a break every few seconds and they
just<00:01:33.400> pause<00:01:33.610> for<00:01:33.640> a<00:01:33.910> minute<00:01:34.120> because<00:01:34.510> that

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
just pause for a minute because that

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.380 
just pause for a minute because that
squirrel<00:01:35.250> reposition<00:01:36.250> a<00:01:36.340> nut<00:01:36.550> and<00:01:36.730> start<00:01:37.270> over

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
squirrel reposition a nut and start over

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.240 
squirrel reposition a nut and start over
again

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.070 

that's<00:01:42.250> ascus<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.970> I<00:01:46.030> generally<00:01:46.360> do<00:01:46.540> that<00:01:46.570> for

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
that's ascus and I generally do that for

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.380 
that's ascus and I generally do that for
you<00:01:47.830> know<00:01:47.920> 30<00:01:48.160> seconds<00:01:48.670> to<00:01:48.760> a<00:01:48.790> minute<00:01:48.880> or<00:01:49.240> so

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
you know 30 seconds to a minute or so

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.610 
you know 30 seconds to a minute or so
and<00:01:49.420> then<00:01:49.660> pause<00:01:49.900> for<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.170> few<00:01:50.200> minutes<00:01:50.560> and

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
and then pause for a few minutes and

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.650 
and then pause for a few minutes and
kind<00:01:50.800> of<00:01:50.860> look<00:01:50.980> around<00:01:51.280> and<00:01:51.610> but<00:01:52.360> don't<00:01:52.480> see

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
kind of look around and but don't see

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:02.100 
kind of look around and but don't see
anything<00:01:53.020> just<00:01:53.260> start<00:01:53.680> up<00:01:53.800> again<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.930> just

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
anything just start up again so just

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.250 
anything just start up again so just
like<00:02:02.260> that<00:02:02.970> now<00:02:03.970> they'll<00:02:04.540> turn<00:02:04.780> them<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.080> that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
like that now they'll turn them to that

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.730 
like that now they'll turn them to that
you<00:02:05.770> can<00:02:05.920> use<00:02:06.160> a<00:02:06.460> couple<00:02:07.030> of<00:02:07.090> pennies<00:02:07.560> now<00:02:08.560> they

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
you can use a couple of pennies now they

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.169 
you can use a couple of pennies now they
have<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:08.920> be<00:02:09.010> the<00:02:09.100> old-style<00:02:09.399> penny<00:02:09.760> with<00:02:09.970> the

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
have to be the old-style penny with the

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.390 
have to be the old-style penny with the
I<00:02:10.869> think<00:02:11.410> that's<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.680> Lincoln<00:02:11.950> Memorial<00:02:12.340> on

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
I think that's the Lincoln Memorial on

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.910 
I think that's the Lincoln Memorial on
the<00:02:12.490> back<00:02:12.670> not<00:02:13.180> really<00:02:13.630> sure<00:02:13.960> but<00:02:14.170> whatever

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
the back not really sure but whatever

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.940 
the back not really sure but whatever
that<00:02:15.070> is<00:02:15.750> but<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:19.630> doesn't<00:02:19.780> okay<00:02:20.230> but

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
that is but it doesn't okay but

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.920 
that is but it doesn't okay but
basically<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.340> just<00:02:21.370> take<00:02:21.810> where<00:02:22.810> the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
basically you just take where the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.660 
basically you just take where the
building<00:02:23.230> on<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.410> back<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.190> then<00:02:24.490> just

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
building on the back is and then just

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.850 
building on the back is and then just
the<00:02:24.790> edge<00:02:24.910> of<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.209> other<00:02:25.300> penny<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.900> just<00:02:26.680> rub

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
the edge of the other penny and just rub

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.530 
the edge of the other penny and just rub
it<00:02:26.890> across<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:28.060> think<00:02:28.390> this<00:02:28.510> actually

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
it across it and I think this actually

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.900 
it across it and I think this actually
sounds<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.140> little<00:02:29.230> bit<00:02:29.440> more<00:02:29.770> like<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.610> squirrel

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
sounds a little bit more like a squirrel

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.910 
sounds a little bit more like a squirrel
cutting<00:02:31.209> nuts<00:02:31.450> but<00:02:32.440> it's<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.680> little<00:02:32.830> bit

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
cutting nuts but it's a little bit

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.740 
cutting nuts but it's a little bit
harder<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.250> follow<00:02:33.459> all<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.060> pennies<00:02:34.600> when

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
harder to follow all of the pennies when

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.479 
harder to follow all of the pennies when
the<00:02:34.870> weather<00:02:35.170> is<00:02:35.290> cold<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:35.709> fingers<00:02:35.980> are<00:02:36.100> numb

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
the weather is cold and fingers are numb

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.120 
the weather is cold and fingers are numb
but<00:02:36.670> either<00:02:37.510> way<00:02:37.630> but<00:02:38.380> here's<00:02:38.739> what<00:02:38.860> this<00:02:38.980> one

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
but either way but here's what this one

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:46.970 
but either way but here's what this one
sounds<00:02:39.340> like

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:56.250 

so<00:02:47.980> just<00:02:48.189> like<00:02:48.310> that<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:55.150> that's<00:02:55.840> it

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
so just like that and that's it

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.440 
so just like that and that's it
just<00:02:56.469> do<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.620> for<00:02:56.769> a<00:02:56.950> few<00:02:57.129> minutes<00:02:57.249> or<00:02:57.760> 30

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
just do that for a few minutes or 30

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.789 
just do that for a few minutes or 30
seconds<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:58.930> minute<00:02:59.019> and<00:02:59.319> they've<00:02:59.560> even<00:02:59.680> a

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
seconds to a minute and they've even a

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.390 
seconds to a minute and they've even a
little<00:03:00.010> longer<00:03:00.219> and<00:03:00.810> just<00:03:02.189> kind<00:03:03.189> of<00:03:03.219> wait<00:03:03.340> and

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
little longer and just kind of wait and

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.129 
little longer and just kind of wait and
see<00:03:03.700> you'll<00:03:04.000> generally<00:03:04.450> see<00:03:04.599> them<00:03:04.810> coming<00:03:04.989> out

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
see you'll generally see them coming out

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.319 
see you'll generally see them coming out
and<00:03:05.319> looking<00:03:05.650> around<00:03:05.739> a<00:03:06.340> little<00:03:07.060> bit<00:03:07.150> curious

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
and looking around a little bit curious

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.520 
and looking around a little bit curious
anyway<00:03:07.840> if<00:03:08.260> nothing<00:03:08.680> else<00:03:09.000> but<00:03:10.349> in<00:03:11.349> my

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
anyway if nothing else but in my

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.860 
anyway if nothing else but in my
experience<00:03:12.060> this<00:03:13.060> generally<00:03:13.480> works<00:03:13.659> pretty

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
experience this generally works pretty

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.530 
experience this generally works pretty
well<00:03:13.989> so<00:03:14.639> next<00:03:15.639> time<00:03:15.819> you're<00:03:15.969> out<00:03:15.999> give<00:03:16.359> them<00:03:16.389> a

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
well so next time you're out give them a

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.629 
well so next time you're out give them a
try<00:03:16.749> I<00:03:17.049> mean<00:03:17.230> can't<00:03:17.650> hurt<00:03:17.859> and<00:03:18.099> they<00:03:18.489> don't

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
try I mean can't hurt and they don't

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.090 
try I mean can't hurt and they don't
call<00:03:18.790> so<00:03:18.939> much
