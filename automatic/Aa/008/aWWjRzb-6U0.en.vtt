for<00:01:07.399> gainer<00:01:07.670> to<00:01:07.820> get<00:01:07.970> off<00:01:08.119> you<00:01:08.840> know<00:01:08.960> I'd<00:01:09.170> also

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
for gainer to get off you know I'd also

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.440 
for gainer to get off you know I'd also
like<00:01:09.619> to<00:01:09.679> point<00:01:09.950> out<00:01:10.100> even<00:01:10.580> though<00:01:10.729> Corrales

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
like to point out even though Corrales

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.719 
like to point out even though Corrales
is<00:01:11.660> the<00:01:11.869> taller<00:01:12.200> of<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.500> two<00:01:12.619> if<00:01:13.220> you<00:01:13.399> notice

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
is the taller of the two if you notice

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.790 
is the taller of the two if you notice
he<00:01:14.000> keeps<00:01:14.270> his<00:01:14.420> hands<00:01:14.660> very<00:01:14.780> close<00:01:15.320> unlike

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
he keeps his hands very close unlike

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.560 
he keeps his hands very close unlike
most<00:01:16.009> tall<00:01:16.280> guys<00:01:16.490> very<00:01:16.700> close<00:01:17.000> which<00:01:17.539> means

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
most tall guys very close which means

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.690 
most tall guys very close which means
he's<00:01:17.990> gonna<00:01:18.170> be<00:01:18.320> more<00:01:18.500> effective<00:01:19.009> in<00:01:19.429> closer

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
he's gonna be more effective in closer

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.639 
he's gonna be more effective in closer
range<00:01:20.060> even<00:01:20.600> though<00:01:20.720> he's<00:01:20.869> taller<00:01:21.140> because<00:01:21.500> he

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
range even though he's taller because he

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.080 
range even though he's taller because he
fights<00:01:21.920> with<00:01:22.340> his<00:01:22.460> hands<00:01:22.640> in<00:01:22.789> a<00:01:22.850> position

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
fights with his hands in a position

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.910 
fights with his hands in a position
where<00:01:23.390> he<00:01:23.450> can<00:01:23.570> punch<00:01:23.840> very<00:01:24.050> effective<00:01:24.800> by

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
where he can punch very effective by

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.160 
where he can punch very effective by
just<00:01:25.220> twisting<00:01:26.060> his<00:01:26.179> body<00:01:26.210> with<00:01:26.659> punches<00:01:26.990> and

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
just twisting his body with punches and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.050 
just twisting his body with punches and
he's<00:01:27.560> gonna<00:01:27.710> be<00:01:27.920> more<00:01:28.100> effective<00:01:28.580> going<00:01:28.909> down

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
he's gonna be more effective going down

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.279 
he's gonna be more effective going down
a<00:01:29.090> stretch<00:01:29.450> than<00:01:29.690> the<00:01:29.720> shorter<00:01:30.110> fighter

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
a stretch than the shorter fighter

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
I was just going to say Corrales is

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.270 
I was just going to say Corrales is
still<00:02:02.930> more<00:02:03.170> effective<00:02:03.650> you<00:02:03.800> can<00:02:03.950> see<00:02:04.100> in<00:02:04.250> that

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
yeah and as a place that was affected

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.640

that you don't see and that was the

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.410 
that you don't see and that was the
perfect<00:03:50.160> example<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.760> was<00:03:50.850> a<00:03:50.880> short<00:03:51.209> left

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
perfect example that was a short left

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.570

hook<00:03:51.510> over<00:03:52.019> gainers<00:03:52.680> shoulder<00:03:53.190> that<00:03:53.310> he<00:03:53.430> never

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
hook over gainers shoulder that he never

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.220 
hook over gainers shoulder that he never
even<00:03:53.700> saw<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.300> it<00:03:54.660> would<00:03:54.780> didn't<00:03:54.930> have<00:03:55.050> to<00:03:55.140> be

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
even saw and it would didn't have to be

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.710 
even saw and it would didn't have to be
that<00:03:55.380> hard<00:03:55.590> I<00:03:55.800> feel<00:03:56.550> that<00:03:56.790> if<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.300> referee<00:03:57.600> had

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
that hard I feel that if the referee had

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.300 
that hard I feel that if the referee had
permitted<00:03:58.019> to<00:03:58.230> fight<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.590> have<00:03:58.680> continued<00:03:59.130> the

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
permitted to fight to have continued the

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.370 
permitted to fight to have continued the
outcome<00:03:59.730> would<00:03:59.880> have<00:03:59.910> been<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.540> same<00:04:00.750> it's

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
outcome would have been the same it's

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.660 
outcome would have been the same it's
not<00:04:01.500> we're<00:04:01.650> along<00:04:01.860> along<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.370> way<00:04:02.489> I<00:04:02.519> don't

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
not we're along along the way I don't

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.890 
not we're along along the way I don't
think<00:04:02.910> he<00:04:02.970> would<00:04:03.090> have<00:04:03.150> made<00:04:03.300> it<00:04:03.450> much<00:04:03.720> more

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
think he would have made it much more

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.740 
think he would have made it much more
than<00:04:03.959> another

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.990 

so<00:04:07.380> you<00:04:07.440> see<00:04:07.710> the<00:04:07.860> two-fisted<00:04:08.460> talent<00:04:08.880> of
