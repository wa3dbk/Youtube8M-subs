button I gonna do is tap l2 if you hold

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.500 
button I gonna do is tap l2 if you hold
it<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.800> start<00:00:35.070> skating<00:00:35.309> backwards<00:00:35.489> but<00:00:36.420> if

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
it you start skating backwards but if

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.450 
it you start skating backwards but if
you're<00:00:36.660> skiing<00:00:36.870> along<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.380> tap<00:00:37.620> l2<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.309> do<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
you're skiing along you tap l2 you do a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.600 
you're skiing along you tap l2 you do a
spin<00:00:38.730> around<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.180> can<00:00:39.360> go<00:00:39.450> either<00:00:39.629> way<00:00:39.780> so

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
spin around you can go either way so

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.790 
spin around you can go either way so
yeah<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.090> leave<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.570> one<00:00:42.780> out<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.500> next

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
yeah so they leave that one out the next

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.319 
yeah so they leave that one out the next
one<00:00:44.040> are<00:00:44.129> probably<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.520> best<00:00:44.789> move<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.270> not

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
one are probably the best move it's not

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.479 
one are probably the best move it's not
really<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> deep<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.230> protective<00:00:46.770> puck<00:00:46.950> you

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
really a deep but protective puck you

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.790 
really a deep but protective puck you
just<00:00:47.640> hold<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.940> Exxon<00:00:48.450> ps4<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.260> equipment<00:00:49.739> on

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
just hold in Exxon ps4 the equipment on

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.220 
just hold in Exxon ps4 the equipment on
Xbox<00:00:50.280> one<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.820> you'll<00:00:51.449> protect<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.989> park

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
Xbox one and you'll protect the park

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.260 
Xbox one and you'll protect the park
whatever<00:00:52.469> way<00:00:52.770> you're<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.160> right<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.000> hold

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
whatever way you're going right so hold

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.139 
whatever way you're going right so hold
it<00:00:54.360> at<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.719> side<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.440> that's<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.550> best<00:00:56.820> way

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
it at the side and that's the best way

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.180 
it at the side and that's the best way
when<00:00:57.629> you're<00:00:57.780> down<00:00:57.989> low<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.649> defenders<00:00:59.070> were

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
when you're down low the defenders were

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.130 
when you're down low the defenders were
kind<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.489> bounce<00:00:59.670> off<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.840> remember

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
kind of bounce off you and remember

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.240 
kind of bounce off you and remember
there's<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> glitch<00:01:01.500> goal<00:01:01.739> right<00:01:01.890> there<00:01:01.920> with

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
there's a glitch goal right there with

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.520 
there's a glitch goal right there with
it<00:01:02.430> which<00:01:02.969> only<00:01:03.480> works<00:01:03.780> if<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.110> hit<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.320> net

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
it which only works if you hit the net

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.120 
it which only works if you hit the net
so<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.549> move<00:01:06.150> they<00:01:06.510> also<00:01:06.689> left<00:01:07.049> out<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.710> then

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
so that move they also left out and then

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.770 
so that move they also left out and then
the<00:01:08.280> one<00:01:08.460> where<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.790> bounce<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.270> off<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.659> edge

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the one where you bounce it off the edge

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.899 
the one where you bounce it off the edge
of<00:01:09.930> your<00:01:10.110> skate<00:01:10.320> like<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.770> that's<00:01:11.700> exactly

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
of your skate like that that's exactly

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.969 
of your skate like that that's exactly
what<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.840> can't<00:01:13.080> do<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.470> all<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> time

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.499 
what it is I can't do that all the time
I<00:01:14.250> don't<00:01:14.460> even<00:01:14.549> know<00:01:14.820> hundred<00:01:15.090> percent<00:01:15.390> know

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
I don't even know hundred percent know

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.060 
I don't even know hundred percent know
how<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:16.140> did<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:17.390> yeah<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:19.530> there<00:01:19.979> it

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
it when I'm turned back that way but

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.880
