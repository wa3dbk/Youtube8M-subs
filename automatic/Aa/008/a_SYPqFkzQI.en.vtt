00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
i think of Rachel Dratch I think of

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.170 
i think of Rachel Dratch I think of
either<00:04:37.390> like<00:04:37.690> debbie<00:04:38.050> downer<00:04:38.380> on<00:04:38.710> SNL<00:04:39.190> or<00:04:39.490> when

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
either like debbie downer on SNL or when

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.150 
either like debbie downer on SNL or when
she<00:04:40.300> plays<00:04:40.540> harry<00:04:40.810> potter<00:04:41.110> on<00:04:41.380> SNL<00:04:41.830> and<00:04:41.860> if<00:04:42.070> i

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
she plays harry potter on SNL and if i

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.130

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
to hear that because I feel like it's a

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.680 
to hear that because I feel like it's a
lot<00:05:29.890> harder<00:05:30.100> to<00:05:30.400> find<00:05:30.580> a<00:05:30.820> great<00:05:31.090> audio<00:05:31.450> book

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
because not only does the book have to

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.610 
because not only does the book have to
be<00:05:33.850> good<00:05:34.060> but<00:05:34.090> the<00:05:34.270> narrator<00:05:34.750> also<00:05:35.170> has<00:05:35.350> to<00:05:35.500> be

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
be good but the narrator also has to be

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.070 
be good but the narrator also has to be
good<00:05:35.800> so<00:05:36.040> if<00:05:36.100> you<00:05:36.220> have<00:05:36.430> any<00:05:36.850> good<00:05:37.330> audio<00:05:37.900> book
