00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.480
 hello, I'm Christ, the way is welcome 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.400
 on the road to Haiti a dedicated program 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.619
 to the art of photography 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.830
 Today's episode I'm going to talk about chili 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.529
 number 30 this is the work of heather wells 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.930
 tom North American photographer who won 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.540
 recognition in the first half of the 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.290
 20th century with so much work 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:39.800
 conceptual photographs sought 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.570
 sensuality of the objects of the world 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.840
 the first number 30 summarizes this 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.090
 motivation to observe photography 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.690
 we can see outlines and the idea 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.050
 sensuality we usually see and 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.780
 photographs that depict the human 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.969
 to produce this photograph is 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.739
 weston and just needed a sweet pepper 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:06.590
 a suitable brass hopper and students 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.380
 the sum of these factors with much 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.150
 experimentation has come the result 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.760
 he wished me the potential that 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:20.300
 I would decide to talk about chili 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.910
 number 30, that is precisely why you 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.180
 can actually navigate a little bit 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.960
 more to know more pictures of 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.410
 elton and see the composition work 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.100
 his 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.440
 your photos search the style of 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.510
 composition based on organic lines 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.260
 I intend to talk about this in the future 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.640
 episode has a lot to do with design and 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.410
 I also want to address more about the 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.100
 style already said this in episodes 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:51.500
 past but the motivation to devote the 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.220
 episode will have the pepper number 30 is 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.250
 in the idea of experimentation many times 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.440
 we observe something that draws attention 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.550
 or we want to lose in photography with a 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.290
 idea established but not 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.590
 we invest the time we need or the 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.560
 attempts to find the 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.070
 image that we want to value 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.430
 potential of what we have seen in something that 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:23.270
 has not yet been transformed into a photograph 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:27.080
 I in honor of this episode produce 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:30.620
 a series called chilli number 50 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.310
 after all, it's not helton 's number 30 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.250
 mention of the 30 attempts that were 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:41.390
 necessary for it to achieve 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.130
 the desired result with 50 attempts 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.800
 I arrived, I think, even more than 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.100
 an interesting photo 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:52.640
 the chili that I chose the market to 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:56.360
 idea of trying to be more valuable 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.239
 than mistakes is important 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.920
 we often have the instinct of what 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.720
 we want but the image is not in fact 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.820
 embodied in our mind but tells 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:13.239
 a first photo 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:17.690
 there I can talk about the value of the attempt 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:20.030
 and I'm even when I present 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.570
 the work number 30 pepper make mention 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.690
 its light work in a job 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.160
 especially in the work of 1936 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.360
 the main message that left the 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.299
 following is hard to beat sensuality 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.020
 of the chili pepper number 30 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.240
 agrees 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.820
 It's good, the suggestion is then met. 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.010
 more elton fold I intend to make one 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.650
 I have so many wishes too. 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.810
 both so many ideas in the head 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.450
 in fact many faults for programs 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.550
 even if you are following only 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.530
 on youtube I suggest you subscribe to 6 on 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.960
 beginning of the art path because I have 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.630
 sent weekly tips more than two 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.190
 including articles and even now 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.210
 a point that is practiced the art of 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.070
 photography 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:09.500
 the few flights producing the programs 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.300
 the fact that what comes in the 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.400
 all ideas that do not stop 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.090
 see there are many photographers worth the 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.790
 worth knowing - my email contact clothes 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.260
 haiti hair using next week 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.260
 Thank you very much and see you
