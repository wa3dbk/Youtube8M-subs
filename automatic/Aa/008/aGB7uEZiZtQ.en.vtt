00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
and can't do just go ahead and select it

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.580 
and can't do just go ahead and select it
again<00:03:25.150> from<00:03:25.390> this<00:03:25.600> list<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:25.989> we'll<00:03:26.110> remove<00:03:26.380> it

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.780 
again from this list and we'll remove it
and<00:03:26.920> then<00:03:27.100> you<00:03:27.160> can<00:03:27.310> go<00:03:27.459> ahead<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:27.610> select

doeren's<00:03:28.269> ring<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:29.470> will<00:03:29.560> actually<00:03:29.709> add

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
doeren's ring and it will actually add

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.920 
doeren's ring and it will actually add
it<00:03:30.930> that's<00:03:31.930> basically<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:33.540> I'm<00:03:34.540> going<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:34.840> do

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
it that's basically it I'm going to do

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.199 
it that's basically it I'm going to do
is<00:03:35.019> hit<00:03:35.200> save<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:35.530> then<00:03:35.920> this<00:03:36.340> is<00:03:36.549> probably

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
is hit save and then this is probably

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.880 
is hit save and then this is probably
one<00:03:37.870> of<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.019> main<00:03:38.200> reasons<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:38.620> I<00:03:38.739> actually

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
one of the main reasons that I actually

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.620 
one of the main reasons that I actually
added<00:03:39.340> this<00:03:39.430> video<00:03:39.790> is<00:03:39.880> because<00:03:40.120> the

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
added this video is because the

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.080 
added this video is because the
explanation<00:03:41.290> for<00:03:41.500> this<00:03:43.260> what<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.290> hope<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.700> do

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
explanation for this what I hope to do

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.750 
explanation for this what I hope to do
is<00:03:46.540> potentially<00:03:47.500> add<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.709> default<00:03:48.040> where<00:03:48.640> this

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
is potentially add a default where this

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.910 
is potentially add a default where this
is<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.060> default<00:03:49.359> fuller<00:03:49.690> because<00:03:50.380> I<00:03:50.829> just

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
is the default fuller because I just

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.870 
is the default fuller because I just
want<00:03:51.160> to<00:03:51.190> make<00:03:51.310> sure<00:03:51.370> that<00:03:51.519> I'm<00:03:51.730> actually

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
want to make sure that I'm actually

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.360 
want to make sure that I'm actually
getting<00:03:52.239> correct<00:03:52.780> installed<00:03:53.769> for<00:03:54.010> where<00:03:54.190> you

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
getting correct installed for where you

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.660 
getting correct installed for where you
have<00:03:54.609> legends<00:03:55.390> so<00:03:55.950> you<00:03:56.950> don't<00:03:57.220> want<00:03:57.430> this

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
have legends so you don't want this

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.670 
have legends so you don't want this
folder<00:03:58.090> selected<00:03:58.780> what<00:03:59.019> you<00:03:59.109> want<00:03:59.320> to<00:03:59.380> select
