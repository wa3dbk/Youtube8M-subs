is<00:01:56.280> an<00:01:56.399> added<00:01:56.790> sugar<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.270> I'm<00:01:57.390> talking<00:01:57.600> about

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
is an added sugar that I'm talking about

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.719 
is an added sugar that I'm talking about
but<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.350> wouldn't<00:01:58.590> taste<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:59.100> an<00:01:59.340> orange

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
but it wouldn't taste like an orange

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.510 
but it wouldn't taste like an orange
it's<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.719> has<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.229> flavor<00:02:01.439> removed<00:02:02.130> once

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
it's that it has the flavor removed once

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.850 
it's that it has the flavor removed once
it's<00:02:02.790> stripped<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.780> oxygen<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.469> what's

it's stripped of the oxygen and what's

it's stripped of the oxygen and what's
in<00:02:05.159> flavor<00:02:05.610> packs<00:02:06.030> what<00:02:06.360> are<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.600> chemicals

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
in flavor packs what are the chemicals

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.410 
in flavor packs what are the chemicals

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
but what the flavor companies do is they

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.490 
but what the flavor companies do is they

about the taste of a freshly squeezed

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.069 
about the taste of a freshly squeezed
orange<00:02:49.160> so<00:02:49.640> it<00:02:49.670> has<00:02:49.940> levels<00:02:50.450> in<00:02:50.840> higher

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
orange so it has levels in higher

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.170 
orange so it has levels in higher

there in the juice ethyl butyrate does
not<00:02:55.640> say<00:02:55.849> that's<00:02:57.250> it<00:02:58.250> just<00:02:58.670> add<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.540> flavor

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
not say that's it just add a flavor

not say that's it just add a flavor
enhancer<00:03:00.170> it<00:03:00.799> comes<00:03:01.250> from<00:03:01.670> that<00:03:01.849> from<00:03:02.420> orange

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
enhancer it comes from that from orange

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.380 
enhancer it comes from that from orange
essence<00:03:03.200> so<00:03:03.859> it's<00:03:04.129> one<00:03:04.400> of<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:04.670> chemicals<00:03:05.180> one

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
very complex flavor orange is a very

very complex flavor orange is a very
complex<00:03:10.250> I'm<00:03:10.549> sure<00:03:10.940> part<00:03:11.269> of<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.510> mythology

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
complex I'm sure part of the mythology

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.319 
complex I'm sure part of the mythology
of<00:03:12.109> marketing<00:03:12.739> is<00:03:12.890> this<00:03:13.069> impression<00:03:13.790> that

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
of marketing is this impression that

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.509 
of marketing is this impression that

when you when you're drinking your
orange<00:03:16.790> juice<00:03:16.849> it's<00:03:17.660> not<00:03:17.959> long<00:03:18.349> from<00:03:18.829> that

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
orange juice it's not long from that

orange juice it's not long from that
orange<00:03:19.609> grove<00:03:20.120> well<00:03:20.630> you<00:03:20.780> have<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.109> straw

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
orange grove well you have the straw

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.409 
orange grove well you have the straw
puncture<00:03:21.980> it<00:03:22.040> into<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.489> orange<00:03:22.819> that's<00:03:23.060> let

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
puncture it into the orange that's let

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.050 
puncture it into the orange that's let
you<00:03:23.840> know<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.169> image<00:03:24.769> that<00:03:25.069> is<00:03:25.310> implanted<00:03:25.730> on

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
you know the image that is implanted on

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.300 
you know the image that is implanted on
all<00:03:26.269> our<00:03:26.450> minds<00:03:26.840> when<00:03:27.019> we<00:03:27.049> drink<00:03:27.950> orange<00:03:28.160> juice

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
all our minds when we drink orange juice

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.229 
all our minds when we drink orange juice
so<00:03:28.730> typically<00:03:29.209> how<00:03:29.599> long<00:03:30.590> is<00:03:31.099> it<00:03:31.340> between<00:03:32.030> the

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
so typically how long is it between the

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.030 
so typically how long is it between the
time<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:32.629> orange<00:03:32.989> is<00:03:33.109> picked<00:03:33.349> in<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.500> orchard

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
and the time it winds up in our fridge

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.050 
and the time it winds up in our fridge

or on the kitchen table well that's a
good<00:03:38.209> question

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
good question

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.960 
good question
we<00:03:39.169> don't<00:03:39.379> think<00:03:39.620> of<00:03:39.889> orange<00:03:40.310> juice<00:03:40.370> having<00:03:40.879> a

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
we don't think of orange juice having a

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.659 
we don't think of orange juice having a
season<00:03:41.450> because<00:03:41.780> we<00:03:41.930> get<00:03:42.079> it<00:03:42.260> 365<00:03:43.220> days<00:03:43.459> of<00:03:43.609> the

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:43.669 
season because we get it 365 days of the

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:45.909 
season because we get it 365 days of the
year<00:03:43.760> but<00:03:44.120> that<00:03:44.150> question<00:03:44.569> depends<00:03:45.470> on<00:03:45.680> when

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:45.919 
year but that question depends on when

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.470 
year but that question depends on when
