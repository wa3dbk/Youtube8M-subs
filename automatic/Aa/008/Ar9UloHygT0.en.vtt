this<00:02:24.630> is<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.350> ultimate<00:02:25.470> class<00:02:26.239> Falstaff<00:02:27.239> I

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
this is it the ultimate class Falstaff I

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.750 
this is it the ultimate class Falstaff I
choose<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.040> Machine<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.430> with<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.610> heaviest

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
choose the Machine and with the heaviest

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.820 
choose the Machine and with the heaviest
I<00:02:30.060> rate<00:02:30.300> but<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.959> wasn't<00:02:31.350> pretty<00:02:31.440> much<00:02:31.650> enough

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
I rate but it wasn't pretty much enough

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.710 
I rate but it wasn't pretty much enough
so<00:02:32.100> I<00:02:32.130> also<00:02:32.580> chose<00:02:32.850> double<00:02:33.209> tap<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.420> make<00:02:33.630> it

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
so I also chose double tap to make it

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.320 
so I also chose double tap to make it
even<00:02:33.810> faster<00:02:34.160> at<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.400> point<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:36.000> might<00:02:36.150> be

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
even faster at this point you might be

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.240 
even faster at this point you might be
asking<00:02:36.660> oh<00:02:36.900> why<00:02:37.290> doesn't<00:02:37.530> this<00:02:37.739> make<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.010> too

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
asking oh why doesn't this make it too

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.370 
asking oh why doesn't this make it too

this class for using it in a very
specific<00:03:15.750> tactics<00:03:16.380> which<00:03:16.740> I<00:03:16.860> call<00:03:17.070> the

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
specific tactics which I call the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.000 
specific tactics which I call the

extreme wall of death it's actually very

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.920 
extreme wall of death it's actually very
simple<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.580> do<00:03:20.700> but<00:03:20.880> perhaps<00:03:21.390> any<00:03:21.720> things

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930
