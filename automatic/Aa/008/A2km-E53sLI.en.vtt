this<00:00:29.869> is<00:00:30.080> a<00:00:30.470> a<00:00:30.890> molecule<00:00:31.840> whose<00:00:32.840> target<00:00:33.410> is<00:00:33.560> an

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
this is a a molecule whose target is an

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.000 
this is a a molecule whose target is an
adhesion<00:00:35.000> molecule<00:00:35.660> which<00:00:36.079> is<00:00:36.230> expressed<00:00:36.800> in

adhesion molecule which is expressed in

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.900 
adhesion molecule which is expressed in

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
the blood vessels in the intestine of

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.410 
the blood vessels in the intestine of
human<00:00:40.910> beings<00:00:41.300> and<00:00:41.510> so<00:00:42.130> what<00:00:43.130> happens<00:00:43.579> is<00:00:43.850> this

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
human beings and so what happens is this

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.990 
human beings and so what happens is this
adhesion<00:00:44.750> molecule<00:00:45.590> called<00:00:45.980> mad<00:00:46.340> cam<00:00:46.640> 1

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
adhesion molecule called mad cam 1

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.900 
adhesion molecule called mad cam 1
serves<00:00:47.840> as<00:00:48.110> a<00:00:48.140> zip<00:00:48.500> code<00:00:48.829> for<00:00:49.250> lymphocytes

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
serves as a zip code for lymphocytes

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.120 
serves as a zip code for lymphocytes
that<00:00:50.090> are<00:00:50.329> trying<00:00:50.690> to<00:00:50.870> get<00:00:51.050> to<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.380> gut<00:00:51.620> to

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
that are trying to get to the gut to

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.130 
that are trying to get to the gut to
cause<00:00:52.340> inflammation<00:00:52.820> and<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.480> idea<00:00:53.840> is<00:00:53.899> if

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
cause inflammation and the idea is if

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.190 
cause inflammation and the idea is if
you<00:00:54.260> block<00:00:54.680> mad<00:00:55.010> cam<00:00:55.370> 1<00:00:55.730> then<00:00:56.360> you<00:00:56.570> block<00:00:56.930> the

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
you block mad cam 1 then you block the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.260 
you block mad cam 1 then you block the
ability<00:00:57.649> of<00:00:57.680> the<00:00:57.890> lymphocytes<00:00:58.489> to<00:00:58.730> migrate

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
ability of the lymphocytes to migrate

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.020 
ability of the lymphocytes to migrate
out<00:00:59.540> of<00:00:59.719> the<00:00:59.840> blood<00:01:00.079> vessels<00:01:00.620> in<00:01:00.829> the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
out of the blood vessels in the

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.239 
out of the blood vessels in the
intestine<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.180> cause<00:01:02.780> inflammation<00:01:03.320> and<00:01:03.890> so

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:04.249 
intestine and cause inflammation and so

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:06.309 
intestine and cause inflammation and so
by<00:01:04.489> blocking<00:01:04.850> that<00:01:05.179> you<00:01:05.420> reduce<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:05.869> amount

00:01:06.309 --> 00:01:06.319 
by blocking that you reduce the amount

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:08.080 
by blocking that you reduce the amount
of<00:01:06.469> inflammation<00:01:06.770> that<00:01:07.249> occurs<00:01:07.310> in<00:01:07.609> the<00:01:07.880> gut

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
of inflammation that occurs in the gut

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.059 
of inflammation that occurs in the gut
and<00:01:08.329> the<00:01:08.840> nice<00:01:09.049> thing<00:01:09.079> about<00:01:09.380> this<00:01:09.709> is<00:01:09.770> that

00:01:10.059 --> 00:01:10.069 
and the nice thing about this is that

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.819 
and the nice thing about this is that
it's<00:01:10.490> relatively<00:01:11.149> gut<00:01:11.630> specific<00:01:12.469> so<00:01:12.709> the

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829 
it's relatively gut specific so the

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:15.940 
it's relatively gut specific so the
target<00:01:13.310> molecule<00:01:13.819> mad<00:01:14.149> cam<00:01:14.450> 1<00:01:14.749> is<00:01:14.990> really<00:01:15.740> only

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
target molecule mad cam 1 is really only

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.690 
target molecule mad cam 1 is really only
expressed<00:01:16.729> in<00:01:16.999> the<00:01:17.450> gut<00:01:17.689> and<00:01:18.039> the<00:01:19.039> lining<00:01:19.520> of

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
expressed in the gut and the lining of

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.999 
expressed in the gut and the lining of
certain<00:01:20.060> other<00:01:20.319> organs<00:01:21.319> like<00:01:21.529> the<00:01:21.590> upper

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
certain other organs like the upper

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.899 
certain other organs like the upper
respiratory<00:01:22.189> tract<00:01:23.060> but<00:01:23.600> it<00:01:23.719> doesn't<00:01:24.049> have<00:01:24.259> a

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
respiratory tract but it doesn't have a

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.050 
respiratory tract but it doesn't have a
system-wide<00:01:26.529> expression<00:01:27.529> and<00:01:27.740> so<00:01:28.399> the

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
system-wide expression and so the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.209 
system-wide expression and so the
thought<00:01:29.599> here<00:01:30.020> is<00:01:30.049> that<00:01:30.289> this<00:01:30.529> drug<00:01:30.889> may<00:01:30.920> be

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
thought here is that this drug may be

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:34.139 
thought here is that this drug may be
more<00:01:31.670> gut<00:01:32.539> specific<00:01:33.289> if<00:01:33.439> you<00:01:33.619> will<00:01:33.829> and

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
more gut specific if you will and

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.959 
more gut specific if you will and
potentially<00:01:35.149> have<00:01:35.329> fewer<00:01:36.399> serious<00:01:37.399> adverse

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969 
potentially have fewer serious adverse

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.929 
potentially have fewer serious adverse
side<00:01:38.659> effects<00:01:38.990> anyway<00:01:39.950> this<00:01:40.130> drug<00:01:40.459> was<00:01:40.579> under

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
side effects anyway this drug was under

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.879 
side effects anyway this drug was under
review<00:01:41.270> by<00:01:41.329> the<00:01:41.509> FDA<00:01:41.959> so<00:01:42.109> they've<00:01:42.499> done<00:01:42.709> all

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:42.889 
review by the FDA so they've done all

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:44.709 
review by the FDA so they've done all
their<00:01:43.039> phase<00:01:43.279> 3<00:01:43.609> trials<00:01:44.060> they<00:01:44.240> submitted

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
their phase 3 trials they submitted

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:46.989 
their phase 3 trials they submitted
their<00:01:44.840> application<00:01:45.469> of<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.649> FDA<00:01:46.009> and<00:01:46.369> then<00:01:46.880> in

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:46.999 
their application of the FDA and then in

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:50.080 
their application of the FDA and then in
December<00:01:47.859> there<00:01:48.859> was<00:01:49.009> actually<00:01:49.429> an<00:01:49.520> advisory

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
December there was actually an advisory

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.149 
December there was actually an advisory
committee<00:01:50.569> that<00:01:50.929> was<00:01:51.049> convened<00:01:51.499> by<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.709> FDA

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
committee that was convened by the FDA

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.909 
committee that was convened by the FDA
to<00:01:52.849> review<00:01:53.240> all<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.689> data<00:01:53.959> and<00:01:54.259> recommend

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:54.919 
to review all the data and recommend

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:56.919 
to review all the data and recommend
whether<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.429> drug<00:01:55.729> should<00:01:55.939> be<00:01:56.299> approved<00:01:56.719> for

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
whether the drug should be approved for

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:58.510 
whether the drug should be approved for
all<00:01:57.079> sort<00:01:57.289> of<00:01:57.349> colitis<00:01:57.679> and<00:01:58.009> Crohn's<00:01:58.399> disease

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:02.419 
and the particular safety issue that

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:04.659 
and the particular safety issue that
they<00:02:02.569> wanted<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.989> review<00:02:03.439> was<00:02:04.039> whether<00:02:04.340> or<00:02:04.459> not

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:04.669 
they wanted to review was whether or not

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:07.569

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
is somewhat related may as well but as I

is somewhat related may as well but as I
said<00:02:47.290> it<00:02:47.440> was<00:02:47.590> gut<00:02:47.890> specific<00:02:48.580> it<00:02:48.760> doesn't

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
said it was gut specific it doesn't

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.520 
said it was gut specific it doesn't
appear<00:02:49.420> to<00:02:49.450> affect<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:50.050> blood-brain<00:02:50.500> barrier

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
appear to affect the blood-brain barrier

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
kind of encouraging now initially we

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.090 
kind of encouraging now initially we
thought<00:03:18.340> that<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:19.590> what<00:03:20.590> they<00:03:20.739> call<00:03:20.950> the

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
thought that the what they call the

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.979 
thought that the what they call the

FDA has to make a decision we thought

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.000 
FDA has to make a decision we thought
that<00:03:25.720> that<00:03:25.840> was<00:03:26.019> going<00:03:26.230> to<00:03:26.350> be<00:03:26.440> in<00:03:26.799> late

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
that that was going to be in late

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.030 
that that was going to be in late
februari<00:03:27.670> for<00:03:28.000> ulcerative<00:03:28.329> colitis<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:29.170> in

februari for ulcerative colitis and in

februari for ulcerative colitis and in
June<00:03:31.000> for<00:03:31.420> Crohn's<00:03:31.720> disease<00:03:32.280> turns<00:03:33.280> out<00:03:33.519> that

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
June for Crohn's disease turns out that

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.509 
June for Crohn's disease turns out that
the<00:03:34.000> manufacturer<00:03:34.959> of<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.230> drug<00:03:35.519> submitted

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
the manufacturer of the drug submitted

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.060 
the manufacturer of the drug submitted
additional<00:03:37.060> data<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.630> FDA<00:03:38.109> and<00:03:38.590> so<00:03:38.829> the

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
additional data to the FDA and so the

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.430 
additional data to the FDA and so the
padutha<00:03:39.459> date<00:03:39.820> has<00:03:40.090> been<00:03:40.120> moved<00:03:40.329> back<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:41.200> late

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
padutha date has been moved back to late

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.770 
padutha date has been moved back to late
May<00:03:41.829> for<00:03:42.489> ulcerative<00:03:42.790> colitis<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.630> it

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
May for ulcerative colitis and it

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.810 
May for ulcerative colitis and it
remains<00:03:44.140> in<00:03:44.440> mid-june<00:03:45.070> for<00:03:45.430> Crohn's<00:03:45.700> disease

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
remains in mid-june for Crohn's disease

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.930 
remains in mid-june for Crohn's disease
so<00:03:46.390> conceivably<00:03:47.260> if<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.250> drug<00:03:48.489> does<00:03:48.730> get

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
so conceivably if the drug does get

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.610 
so conceivably if the drug does get
approved<00:03:49.359> it<00:03:49.540> would<00:03:49.930> be<00:03:50.049> commercially

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
approved it would be commercially

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.229 
approved it would be commercially
available<00:03:50.739> for<00:03:51.459> patients<00:03:51.730> with<00:03:52.090> inflammatory

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.979 
available for patients with inflammatory
bowel<00:03:52.989> disease<00:03:53.400> in<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.579> second<00:03:55.000> half<00:03:55.209> of<00:03:55.480> this

bowel disease in the second half of this

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.259 
bowel disease in the second half of this
year<00:03:56.049> and<00:03:56.440> so<00:03:56.829> it'll<00:03:57.549> be<00:03:57.670> great<00:03:57.940> to<00:03:58.150> have

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
year and so it'll be great to have

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.759 
year and so it'll be great to have

another drug with a different mechanism

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.789 
another drug with a different mechanism
of<00:04:00.280> action<00:04:00.489> and<00:04:01.140> potentially<00:04:02.140> a<00:04:02.320> better
