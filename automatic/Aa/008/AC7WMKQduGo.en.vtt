00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.110 
make that happen in Ventura
I<00:02:21.580> looked<00:02:22.240> into<00:02:22.390> buying<00:02:22.600> land<00:02:23.160> but<00:02:24.160> everything

I looked into buying land but everything

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.810 
I looked into buying land but everything
that<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.360> found<00:02:26.220> pretty<00:02:27.220> much<00:02:27.400> made<00:02:27.670> it

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
that I found pretty much made it

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.320 
that I found pretty much made it
impossible<00:02:28.030> between<00:02:29.459> building<00:02:30.459> codes<00:02:30.850> making

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
impossible between building codes making

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.250 
impossible between building codes making
just<00:02:32.320> being<00:02:32.530> too<00:02:32.650> restrictive<00:02:32.800> zoning<00:02:34.260> you

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
just being too restrictive zoning you

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.900 
just being too restrictive zoning you
can't<00:02:35.500> just<00:02:35.770> buy<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.010> piece<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.310> land<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.670> put<00:02:36.880> a

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
can't just buy a piece of land and put a

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.310 
can't just buy a piece of land and put a
tiny<00:02:37.270> little<00:02:37.420> house<00:02:37.570> on<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:37.900> there's<00:02:38.110> so<00:02:38.230> many

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
tiny little house on it there's so many

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.430 
tiny little house on it there's so many
rules<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:39.600> ordinances<00:02:40.600> that<00:02:40.870> prevent<00:02:41.290> that

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
rules and ordinances that prevent that

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.960 
rules and ordinances that prevent that
so<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:43.180> will<00:02:43.420> happen<00:02:43.830> in<00:02:44.830> about<00:02:45.220> ten<00:02:45.520> years<00:02:45.550> and

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
so it will happen in about ten years and

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.370 
so it will happen in about ten years and
my<00:02:46.060> kids<00:02:46.300> are<00:02:46.390> done<00:02:46.540> with<00:02:46.690> school<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.110> then<00:02:47.320> I

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
my kids are done with school and then I

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.420 
my kids are done with school and then I
can<00:02:47.560> move<00:02:47.680> out<00:02:47.860> of<00:02:47.890> this<00:02:47.950> area

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
but until then my alternative the best

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.280 
but until then my alternative the best
option<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.260> I<00:02:53.350> found<00:02:53.620> is<00:02:54.480> my<00:02:55.480> travel<00:02:55.959> trailer
