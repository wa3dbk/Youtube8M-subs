try to show it here with a little bit of

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.900 
try to show it here with a little bit of
light<00:00:09.000> reflecting<00:00:09.540> on<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.690> it's<00:00:10.679> pretty<00:00:10.830> clean

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
light reflecting on it it's pretty clean

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.209 
light reflecting on it it's pretty clean
there's<00:00:12.750> like<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:12.990> piece<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.290> hair<00:00:13.710> underneath

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
there's like a piece of hair underneath

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.019 
there's like a piece of hair underneath
here<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:15.230> some<00:00:16.230> specks<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:17.010> dirt<00:00:17.250> floating

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029

here and some specks of dirt floating
around<00:00:18.119> in<00:00:18.449> here<00:00:18.920> as<00:00:19.920> well<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.490> definitely

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
around in here as well so it definitely

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.200 
around in here as well so it definitely
does<00:00:21.300> need<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.570> be<00:00:21.840> cleaned<00:00:22.820> but<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> face<00:00:24.180> is

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
does need to be cleaned but the face is

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.070 
does need to be cleaned but the face is
actually<00:00:24.869> pretty<00:00:25.140> nice<00:00:26.449> it<00:00:27.449> doesn't<00:00:27.810> have

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
actually pretty nice it doesn't have

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.380 
actually pretty nice it doesn't have
like<00:00:28.410> there's<00:00:28.830> big<00:00:29.070> cracks<00:00:29.519> or<00:00:29.910> anything<00:00:30.119> in

it so I'm gonna show you the back now -

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.119 
it so I'm gonna show you the back now -
it<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.280> working<00:00:39.290> there's<00:00:40.290> some<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.860> glass

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
it is working there's some the glass

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.840 
it is working there's some the glass
around<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.579> edges<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> little<00:00:42.120> beat-up<00:00:42.629> and

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
around the edges a little beat-up and

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.069 
around the edges a little beat-up and
I'm<00:00:44.850> not<00:00:45.059> sure<00:00:45.270> if<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.510> ever<00:00:45.719> would<00:00:45.960> have

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
I'm not sure if this ever would have

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:58.260 
I'm not sure if this ever would have
come<00:00:46.320> with<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> case<00:00:46.800> or<00:00:47.309> not

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.990 

trying<00:00:58.990> to<00:00:59.080> show<00:00:59.290> it<00:00:59.380> to<00:00:59.470> you<00:00:59.560> in<00:00:59.650> detail<00:01:00.000> that

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
trying to show it to you in detail that

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.090 
trying to show it to you in detail that
probably<00:01:01.330> did<00:01:01.570> have<00:01:01.780> a<00:01:01.810> case<00:01:02.140> because<00:01:02.380> I

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
probably did have a case because I

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.330 
probably did have a case because I
noticed<00:01:03.790> some<00:01:03.940> nail<00:01:04.380> like<00:01:05.380> right<00:01:05.590> by<00:01:05.740> my<00:01:05.920> my

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
noticed some nail like right by my my

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.100 
noticed some nail like right by my my
thumb<00:01:06.640> right<00:01:06.880> now<00:01:07.030> there's<00:01:07.300> a<00:01:07.360> like<00:01:07.780> a<00:01:07.810> little

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
thumb right now there's a like a little

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.980 
thumb right now there's a like a little
nail<00:01:08.290> sticking<00:01:08.800> up<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:13.060> there's<00:01:13.450> a<00:01:13.510> few<00:01:13.780> more

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
nail sticking up and there's a few more

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.740 
nail sticking up and there's a few more
along<00:01:14.260> the<00:01:14.470> edge<00:01:15.150> here<00:01:16.150> that<00:01:16.180> implies<00:01:16.720> that

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
along the edge here that implies that

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.900 
along the edge here that implies that
this<00:01:17.290> would<00:01:17.470> have<00:01:17.590> been<00:01:17.770> had<00:01:18.310> something<00:01:18.730> else

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
this would have been had something else

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.280 
this would have been had something else
on<00:01:19.510> it<00:01:19.570> so<00:01:20.550> perhaps<00:01:21.550> like<00:01:22.300> a<00:01:22.330> hunter<00:01:22.750> case<00:01:23.020> or

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
on it so perhaps like a hunter case or

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:39.020 
on it so perhaps like a hunter case or
something

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.420 

there's<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.450> small<00:01:39.840> dent<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.470> right<00:01:40.770> here<00:01:41.250> by

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
there's a small dent like right here by

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.910 
there's a small dent like right here by
my<00:01:41.460> finger<00:01:43.850> did<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.940> want<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.180> point<00:01:45.990> out<00:01:46.140> some

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
my finger did I want to point out some

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
my finger did I want to point out some
scratches<00:01:47.960> overall<00:01:48.960> there's<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.190> line<00:01:50.520> here

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
scratches overall there's this line here

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.359 
scratches overall there's this line here
I'm<00:01:51.030> not<00:01:51.119> sure<00:01:51.180> if<00:01:51.450> that's<00:01:52.009> supposed<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.310> be

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
I'm not sure if that's supposed to be

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.230 
I'm not sure if that's supposed to be
like<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.880> or<00:01:54.090> not<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> back<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:56.369> there's

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
like that or not on the back and there's

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.969 
like that or not on the back and there's
another<00:01:57.540> mark<00:01:57.900> right<00:01:58.140> here<00:01:58.350> which<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
another mark right here which is the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.520 
another mark right here which is the
hinge<00:01:59.280> actually<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:02.990> let<00:02:03.990> me<00:02:04.110> there's<00:02:04.470> a

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530

just trying to focus in a close range
here<00:02:59.010> and<00:03:08.540> there's<00:03:09.540> another<00:03:19.430> so<00:03:20.430> Swiss<00:03:20.940> on<00:03:21.269> it
