hippo<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.620> very<00:00:13.920> tough<00:00:14.190> because<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.670> special

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
hippo is very tough because the special

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.090 
hippo is very tough because the special
ability<00:00:15.299> allows<00:00:15.330> her<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.690> absorb<00:00:16.199> damage<00:00:16.379> so

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
ability allows her to absorb damage so

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.710 
ability allows her to absorb damage so
my<00:00:17.310> raccoon<00:00:17.580> even<00:00:18.060> though<00:00:18.119> he<00:00:18.210> has<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.480> attack

my raccoon even though he has to attack

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.349 
my raccoon even though he has to attack
only<00:00:19.109> hit<00:00:19.230> him<00:00:19.260> from<00:00:19.439> one<00:00:20.090> because<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.210> have

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
only hit him from one because you have

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.849 
only hit him from one because you have
to<00:00:21.449> beat<00:00:21.660> hippo<00:00:21.990> during<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.350> map<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.769> have

to beat hippo during this map you have

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.109 
to beat hippo during this map you have
to<00:00:22.949> focus<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:23.369> attacking<00:00:23.580> him<00:00:23.880> or<00:00:23.970> he<00:00:24.029> will

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
to focus on attacking him or he will

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.300 
to focus on attacking him or he will
definitely<00:00:24.240> lose<00:00:24.859> notice<00:00:25.859> how<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:25.980> let<00:00:26.189> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
definitely lose notice how I let the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.950 
definitely lose notice how I let the
bear<00:00:26.490> get<00:00:26.699> hit<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.359> he'd<00:00:27.539> have<00:00:27.720> three

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
bear get hit so that he'd have three

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.250 
bear get hit so that he'd have three
attack<00:00:28.199> instead<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.590> two<00:00:29.179> and<00:00:30.179> also<00:00:30.990> at<00:00:31.109> this

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
attack instead of two and also at this

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.720 
attack instead of two and also at this
point<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.529> have<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.769> attack<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.250> hippo<00:00:32.520> areas

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
point I have to attack the hippo areas

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.639 
point I have to attack the hippo areas
before<00:00:32.940> I'm<00:00:33.120> going<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.480> lose<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.960> map<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.410> AI

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
before I'm going to lose the map the AI

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.010 
before I'm going to lose the map the AI
is<00:00:34.829> smart<00:00:35.190> enough<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.520> block<00:00:35.730> him<00:00:38.809> now<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.870> take

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
is smart enough to block him now to take

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.810 
is smart enough to block him now to take
the<00:00:40.170> Hedgehog<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.739> decided<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.190> put<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.550> bear

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the Hedgehog I decided to put a bear

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.270 
the Hedgehog I decided to put a bear
next<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.420> him<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.200> bear<00:00:43.649> gets<00:00:44.040> hit<00:00:44.250> first

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
next to him and so bear gets hit first

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.670 
next to him and so bear gets hit first
and<00:00:44.940> then<00:00:45.539> his<00:00:45.690> attack<00:00:45.930> us<00:00:46.079> up<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.260> three<00:00:46.500> and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
and then his attack us up to three and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.990 
and then his attack us up to three and
then<00:00:46.739> he<00:00:46.860> takes<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.190> Hedgehog<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:47.760> because

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
then he takes the Hedgehog but because

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.819 
then he takes the Hedgehog but because
the<00:00:48.090> Hedgehog<00:00:48.390> only<00:00:48.719> has<00:00:48.870> three<00:00:49.110> hits<00:00:51.739> at<00:00:52.739> this

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
the Hedgehog only has three hits at this

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.889 
the Hedgehog only has three hits at this
point<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.129> decided<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.610> use<00:00:53.640> beaver<00:00:54.480> because

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
point I decided to use beaver because

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.650 
point I decided to use beaver because
beaver<00:00:55.320> gives<00:00:55.680> my<00:00:56.100> adjacent<00:00:56.879> units<00:00:57.120> one<00:00:57.360> extra

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
beaver gives my adjacent units one extra

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.180 
beaver gives my adjacent units one extra
hit<00:00:57.809> point<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.379> just<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.680> make<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.829> little<00:00:59.100> bit

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
hit point so just to make a little bit

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.799 
hit point so just to make a little bit
stronger<00:00:59.430> and<00:01:00.239> make<00:01:00.359> sure<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.690> enemy

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
stronger and make sure that the enemy

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.869 
stronger and make sure that the enemy
can't<00:01:01.170> take<00:01:01.350> them<00:01:01.530> he<00:01:01.980> decided<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.430> use<00:01:02.579> be<00:01:02.789> in

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
can't take them he decided to use be in

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.969 
can't take them he decided to use be in
the<00:01:02.969> two<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.510> stuck<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.229> leopard<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
the two so I stuck a leopard in the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.950 
the two so I stuck a leopard in the
middle<00:01:05.250> because<00:01:05.850> leopard<00:01:06.299> can<00:01:06.420> attack<00:01:06.720> before

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
middle because leopard can attack before

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.570 
middle because leopard can attack before
anybody<00:01:07.439> else<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:07.860> he<00:01:07.950> was<00:01:08.040> able<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.369> take

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
anybody else so he was able to take

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.170 
anybody else so he was able to take
beaver<00:01:08.970> before<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.330> get<00:01:09.450> hurt<00:01:10.850> now<00:01:11.850> over<00:01:12.150> on

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
beaver before you get hurt now over on

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.060 
beaver before you get hurt now over on
this<00:01:12.360> side<00:01:12.420> they<00:01:12.810> put<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.049> mouse<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.770> decided

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
this side they put a mouse so I decided

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.530 
this side they put a mouse so I decided
to<00:01:14.159> put<00:01:14.310> another<00:01:14.490> leopard<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.030> take<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
to put another leopard and take the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.280 
to put another leopard and take the
record<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.650> middle<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:18.180> then<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> enemy

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
record in the middle and then the enemy

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.100 
record in the middle and then the enemy
decides<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.740> put<00:01:19.890> another<00:01:20.250> Mouse<00:01:20.869> below<00:01:21.869> the

decides to put another Mouse below the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.410 
decides to put another Mouse below the
first<00:01:22.380> Mouse<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.799> putting<00:01:23.640> two<00:01:23.759> mice<00:01:23.939> next<00:01:24.330> to

first Mouse and putting two mice next to
each<00:01:24.509> other<00:01:24.600> makes<00:01:25.259> them<00:01:25.500> stronger<00:01:25.939> just<00:01:26.939> one

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
each other makes them stronger just one

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.870 
each other makes them stronger just one
