00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.390
 peculiar mechanism that is called the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.560
 selection 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.440
 it's something like a reality show for 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.159
 choose the next princess of ilea and 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.130
 good to enter this reality show 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.520
 As in every contest, you have to fill a 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.610
 form and with certain characteristics 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:11.480
 one girl enters for each province or 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.180
 state of this country that in total are 35 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.440
 those that aspire to conquer the heart 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:21.890
 of the prince is actually very rare 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.340
 Once there is a selection contest 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.340
 because not all children are male and 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.760
 because they also do not have children as well as 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.140
 if they were rabbits then there's no 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.190
 selection every year is rare and 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.470
 precisely at this moment in which 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.920
 the story unfolds 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.930
 is a handsome boy male prince to 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.560
 to choose 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.400
 your next wife 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.989
 this prince is mattson always and good 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.870
 this is where our 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:59.200
 protagonist who is america and she does not 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.989
 he wants to fill out the file because he has 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.400
 to her boyfriend because it is very 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:09.550
 ugly this way of choosing a wife and 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.860
 those things and but well there are several things 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.840
 that they conspire so that america arrives 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.700
 at the end your form go away take the 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.280
 picture and those things and then she is 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.100
 fully confident that it is not going to 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.840
 stay and that when their parents see 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.610
 that she did not stay, they're going to let her get married and 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.180
 will be able to marry her boyfriend and they will 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.580
 be happy forever but well 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.980
 it turns out that a few days before giving 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.549
 the results she ends with her boyfriend 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:43.049
 and it's very sad for her to be part of 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:48.190
 the 35 women who will enter the palace 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:50.950
 to win the heart of Mason or the 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.650
 crown or both 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.390
 but she does not know what to do 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.090
 he knows neither what he wants and does not know 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.310
 if you want to fight for this and well there 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.489
 the story begins and then 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:08.630
 the book I think it's very clear to me 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:11.180
 I liked it a lot, but I liked it 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.959
 more than anything for the love story that 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.579
 It was what caught my attention and good 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.230
 I really like the relationship they have 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:23.840
 mattson and america I think it's a 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:27.410
 very honest very honest direct relationship 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.840
 yes and it's what I like a lot about them 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.120
 two plus it's like what 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.090
 interesting to see how this develops 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.500
 reality show of princess and it is something 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.479
 that is not too far from our 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.669
 reality has already happened that people 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:44.690
 through a reality show choose your 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:47.780
 couple then another of the things that from 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.780
 I really liked were the covers are 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:54.110
 beautiful of the third book is beautiful not 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:57.050
 I like it because it does not go so deep into 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.660
 the dystopian world is more focused on 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.740
 the love story I feel that this 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.550
 subtract points to the story because it does not 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.530
 it attracts everything 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.390
 and I did not like that I feel that the 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.710
 story was somewhat predictable 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:15.110
 then I already knew where the 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:19.130
 thing and good at the end of the book I do not 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.870
 it surprised nothing what happened and then that 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.040
 is what I basically did not like about 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.690
 first book I finished reading this book 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:30.950
 super fast is very small has 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:32.810
 things of 236 pages then super 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.390
 fast I finished reading this book and 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:40.490
 obviously I started with the second one that is 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:42.230
 the elite and well I'm not going to talk about 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.630
 this book only these reviews of the 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.730
 selection but the elite I liked more 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.650
 because if you get a little more into the 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.780
 dystopian world and I feel that it could be 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.360
 more interesting the elite than the 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.690
 selection however we continue again 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.160
 engrossed in the love story 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.900
 I can tell you I liked it 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.840
 a lot if you like stories 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.990
 romantic and those things these books are 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.610
 for you but the truth I'm not very 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.650
