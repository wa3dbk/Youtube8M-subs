00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello everyone and welcome to a 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.730
 new video of battlefield 3 and today you 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.280
 I bring a game with my 240,000 a 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.389
 weapon that goes very well with the kind of 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.980
 support me at least I love it and that 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.710
 it has a strange configuration 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.119
 and that many people will be surprised 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.060
 here is at least how it works 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.830
 correctly and good also the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.890
 support class I'm going to use 4 and such 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.859
 but good what the mediator is and 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.100
 how I use it and when I go to the top is 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.880
 so I take it and move towards the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.460
 enemies all the time 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.250
 and it has a little trick and that is that 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.070
 I have a hilt and you will see that he is crazy 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.470
 How is it not going to put a hilt? 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.650
 I explain and when you put a hilt 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.720
 this machine gun moves less but 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.250
 the bullets to me at least I do not get 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.500
 hit marquez is a very strange thing 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.980
 you have a guy like 20 meters away 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.650
 shooting and you do not get the brand is very 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.170
 weird I do not know if someone else will happen but 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.830
 to me is to take the hilt from him 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.210
 type and I will perfect one 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.800
 time to be able to see throughout the video that 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.290
 Well I have a couple of months that killed me 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.800
 towards enough and then came the 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.180
 flash suppressor that helps you to 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.050
 bullets scatter a little less and 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.730
 have a little more precision and it's 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.330
 it's just perfect 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.700
 and I with a flashlight, look at the laser, 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.350
 I usually like to wear more as I have 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.210
 said with the flash suppressor 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.080
 but I 'm not doing well either and after looking 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.270
 the one that comes standard is a crap and 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.000
 the holographic can not be aimed at 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.740
 her so the SLR is simply 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.789
 cool cool and has a little kick 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.700
 you can aim well let's go that's 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.450
 perfect 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.220
 then how are you seeing and so using the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.760
 kind of to cover positions and such 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.890
 because I'm not very butt I 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.600
 defending what is position and such and 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.649
 if you lie down if you put type of you're 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.649
 god be 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.660
 you put your type anywhere 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:23.080
 and the word to the position point is 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:27.730
 perfect good here you see that poses a 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.580
 bomb and left a c4 in the m then there is 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.200
 the c4 is planted and remember that 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.090
 you are playing support we have to 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.530
 throwing ammunition at people and if you guys 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.990
 playing jumping 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.260
 I recommend using this 4 a bit 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.780
 attractive and throw it there in what is the 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.910
 bomb and if you see that there will be closer to 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.400
 remove it you exploit it you get away from the 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.590
 pump and 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.989
 when an enemy arrives and exploits it 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.750
 that's the best you can do if 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.780
 you want to defend what the bombs are and 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.290
 such as I see that many people do not use it 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.599
 I do not know why if you took four guys 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.720
 the plants in the pump and if you have 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.720
 occasion to use it as you use it good 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.660
 the moore law you can also take it in 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.400
 this class but I think they are more and you 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.840
 you are going to put a house and you are going to make a 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.610
 little tactical game but good in 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.860
 maps so wide where there are vehicles 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.830
 it is clear that you have to carry c4 yes or yes 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.860
 and how are you going to see in the video 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.349
 then I'm going to take this 4 and kill 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.670
 a lot look at me operator as you see 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:41.290
 it's just perfect you have to good 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.819
 to be shooting is worth as you see what 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.970
 is the joystick that the mouse a droplet 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.069
 back and all the bullets go in 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.049
 those who made the mark you have to 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.380
 how to control the weapon is worth it because it has 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.150
 a lot of backing up but bad to 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.010
 carry a handle but when you lower it 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.900
 a droplet to what I am today stick is 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.849
 simply fabulous the best 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.459
 machine guns is also going very well from 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.590
 Hip though I know that's longer 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.390
 type of operation but there are several 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.019
 enemies because it is already the hip I think 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.140
 that would go very well 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:14.620
 well here we have a little game with 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.079
 c4 you see there is always there 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.549
 it exploded and I always get a pair 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.810
 of casualties out there 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.300
 yes 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.400
 then we have what is the c4 that what 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.669
 you see here 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.880
 and good I always good always not but 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.810
 if I am in inferior conditions 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.090
 because for example I am playing 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.460
 until games without any partner 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.639
 my clan then I have to use all 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.500
 the tricks that I can and as you can see 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.000
 here planted what is the bomb there 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.250
 there was an enemy killed him while I place 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.740
 I do everything at once and left a c4 in the 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.810
 pump is very important that c4 since I 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.949
 will allow me to just meet 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.600
 what is that bomb although there is a 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.720
 ally there but as I can not talk to 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.130
 he simply I leave the c4 there and 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.600
 when I see that they are getting closer you see that 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.140
 he exploded 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.510
 and so all the time or I'm in charge there 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.970
 a double low and I get to exploit the 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.600
 pump that in the end is the important thing and a 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:18.120
 man only manages to explode a bomb 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:20.370
 and it's perfect and then you can make a 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.650
 little fire of suppression towards 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.539
 zones where there is an enemy and already 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.009
 it is but always with care because 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:31.430
 visit the back 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:36.080
 they come uncle and he steals the sheet 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:37.810
 but well I also recommend using the 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.960
 vehicles as you are seeing here that is 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:44.330
 the and truck and such is simply 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:49.820
 perfect what can be bundled with these 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:51.710
 vehicles and then when a country 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.690
 advancing and such 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.570
 you have to be very clear that when 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.190
 go to aim with the machine gun 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:01.040
 you have to shoot a little bit at 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.770
 bursts when you dispose bone I do not know if 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.500
 you see that he never fired more than 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.879
 it did not shoot like ten bullets or 15 and 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.350
 up there there is unemployment and I shoot again 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:11.930
 again 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.010
 Maybe it's fine and it's not appreciated 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.280
 because you just have to play with one 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:18.500
 firing bursts and then already if you place 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:28.120
 the kind of you're ugly if you shoot there 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:30.910
 and in a row and staff is cool 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:36.130
 friend I like the least but neither do I 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:38.800
 comes to convince me or be the PNG or 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:42.070
 smallness as you want to see me the 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.080
 I call smallness the freckle pp that is not for 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:48.160
 me the best of the game and I'll see you a 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.900
 video soon you have to demonstrate 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.389
 the machine gun that I like the most 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:55.030
 since it is although they are pretty good 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:58.540
 I do not get to convince there are times that you 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:02.530
 leaves pulled and although it says it ends very well 

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:04.160
 and such a long way is like you do not have 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:07.139
 power 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.060
 so nothing I go saying goodbye 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:13.250
 you are seeing here how we won the 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:16.380
 quite easy game and already we m 64 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:19.169
 100 I started the job since cpc I think not 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.919
 I have said it and nothing I hope that this 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:22.770
 video 

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:25.229
 have helped people and see if I can 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:27.630
 bring more videos like that showing which ones 

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:30.380
 are my settings with weapons and 

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:32.000
 little things that to me at least 

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:36.650
 It would be that someone had told me 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.110
 because he did not feel more until he did not 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:43.330
 place type of flash suppressor and it 's 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:47.710
 Look, it's a little weird 

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:50.470
 well without hesitation I go and I hope that 

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:53.280
 you liked the video that is soon 

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.280
 goodbye
