hi in this session I'm gonna show you
how<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.500> create<00:00:01.890> a<00:00:02.100> silhouette<00:00:02.700> let's<00:00:03.570> say<00:00:03.659> for

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
how to create a silhouette let's say for

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.000 
how to create a silhouette let's say for
example<00:00:03.899> you<00:00:04.560> have<00:00:04.799> an<00:00:05.040> image<00:00:05.839> and<00:00:06.839> you<00:00:07.710> wanted

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
example you have an image and you wanted

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.680 
example you have an image and you wanted
to<00:00:08.099> create<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.340> silhouette<00:00:08.670> out<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:09.000> it<00:00:09.120> and

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
to create a silhouette out of it and

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.930 
to create a silhouette out of it and
later<00:00:10.170> on<00:00:10.260> maybe<00:00:10.530> in<00:00:10.830> your<00:00:10.980> presentation<00:00:11.670> you

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
later on maybe in your presentation you

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.209 
later on maybe in your presentation you
wanted<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.719> give<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:13.110> some<00:00:13.320> animation<00:00:13.860> effects

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
wanted to give it some animation effects

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.420 
wanted to give it some animation effects
where<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.269> silhouette<00:00:15.839> would<00:00:16.410> fade<00:00:16.980> out<00:00:17.160> and

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
where the silhouette would fade out and

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.370 
where the silhouette would fade out and
then<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.699> would<00:00:17.820> have<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.060> ROO<00:00:18.180> image<00:00:18.449> let<00:00:19.289> me

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
then you would have the ROO image let me

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.710 
then you would have the ROO image let me

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
make a copy of this image because I want

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.260 
make a copy of this image because I want
to<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.530> effect<00:02:01.920> where<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.399> comes<00:02:02.969> it

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
to do this effect where it comes it

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.230 
to do this effect where it comes it
fades<00:02:03.869> into<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:05.040> black<00:02:05.280> silhouette<00:02:06.000> fades

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
fades into the black silhouette fades

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
fades into the black silhouette fades
into

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
into

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.860 
into
the<00:02:07.410> image<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:09.150> I'm<00:02:09.330> gonna<00:02:09.420> go<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:09.720> make<00:02:09.840> a

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:09.870 
the image so I'm gonna go and make a

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.400 
the image so I'm gonna go and make a
copy<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.290> this<00:02:10.440> control<00:02:11.360> copy<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.810> then<00:02:13.110> just

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
copy of this control copy and then just

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.720 
copy of this control copy and then just
paste<00:02:14.780> so<00:02:15.780> now<00:02:15.930> I've<00:02:16.020> got<00:02:16.200> another<00:02:16.380> one<00:02:16.560> here

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
paste so now I've got another one here

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.300 
paste so now I've got another one here
and<00:02:17.730> I'm<00:02:18.180> going<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.360> use<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.570> one<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:19.410> make<00:02:20.280> a

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
and I'm going to use this one to make a

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.570 
and I'm going to use this one to make a
silhouette<00:02:20.780> so<00:02:21.780> let's<00:02:22.020> right<00:02:22.260> click<00:02:22.290> go<00:02:22.860> to

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
silhouette so let's right click go to

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.270 
silhouette so let's right click go to
format<00:02:23.730> picture<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:25.020> now<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.320> is<00:02:25.500> basically

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
format picture and now this is basically

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.040 
format picture and now this is basically
just<00:02:26.580> playing<00:02:26.910> with<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.360> brightness<00:02:27.840> and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
just playing with the brightness and

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.960 
just playing with the brightness and
contrast<00:02:28.460> so<00:02:29.460> I'm<00:02:29.550> gonna<00:02:29.670> bring<00:02:29.820> the

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
contrast so I'm gonna bring the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.830 
contrast so I'm gonna bring the
brightness<00:02:30.720> down<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:32.420> actually<00:02:33.420> there's

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
brightness down and actually there's

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.180 
brightness down and actually there's
nothing<00:02:34.260> much<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.590> need<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.830> do<00:02:34.950> with<00:02:35.100> the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
nothing much I need to do with the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.060 
nothing much I need to do with the
contrast<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.000> that's<00:02:36.750> good<00:02:37.050> there<00:02:37.260> now<00:02:37.770> one

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
contrast so that's good there now one

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.940 
contrast so that's good there now one
thing<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.310> we<00:02:38.550> want<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.820> do<00:02:39.590> sometimes<00:02:40.590> when

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
thing that we want to do sometimes when

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.720 
thing that we want to do sometimes when
you<00:02:41.220> are<00:02:41.690> you<00:02:42.690> have<00:02:42.840> too<00:02:43.110> much<00:02:43.260> white<00:02:43.640> let<00:02:44.640> me

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
you are you have too much white let me

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.540 
you are you have too much white let me
go<00:02:44.880> back<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.870> go<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.170> this<00:02:46.380> example<00:02:46.860> if<00:02:47.010> we

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
go back and go to this example if we

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.920 
go back and go to this example if we
wanted<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.090> go<00:02:48.360> ahead<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.930> use<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.890> other

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
wanted to go ahead and use the other

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.180 
wanted to go ahead and use the other
example<00:02:51.930> of<00:02:51.960> what<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.140> told<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.590> let<00:02:52.890> me<00:02:52.950> go<00:02:53.070> and

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
example of what I told you let me go and

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.990 
example of what I told you let me go and
copy<00:02:53.370> this<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:55.170> put<00:02:55.320> it<00:02:55.410> over<00:02:55.530> here<00:02:56.000> ctrl-c

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
copy this and put it over here ctrl-c

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.570 
copy this and put it over here ctrl-c
and<00:02:57.030> ctrl-v<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.810> paste<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:59.040> wanted<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.310> use

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
and ctrl-v to paste and I wanted to use

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.630 
and ctrl-v to paste and I wanted to use
the<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:01.230> transept<00:03:02.010> transparent<00:03:02.490> color

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
the the transept transparent color

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.720 
the the transept transparent color
feature<00:03:02.880> here<00:03:03.240> to<00:03:03.840> do<00:03:03.990> it<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.320> I<00:03:04.860> would<00:03:05.580> need

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
feature here to do it and I would need

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.270 
feature here to do it and I would need
to<00:03:05.880> kind<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.240> play<00:03:06.510> around<00:03:06.630> with<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.740> contrast

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
to kind of play around with the contrast

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.780 
to kind of play around with the contrast
before<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:08.760> can<00:03:09.260> make<00:03:10.260> sure<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.740> I've<00:03:11.310> gotten

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
before I can make sure that I've gotten

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.020 
before I can make sure that I've gotten
all<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.620> areas<00:03:13.620> in<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:13.860> picture<00:03:14.220> available

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
all the areas in the picture available

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.300 
all the areas in the picture available
for<00:03:15.510> me<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:15.840> create<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.230> silhouette<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:17.070> let<00:03:17.250> me

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
for me to create a silhouette so let me

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.040 
for me to create a silhouette so let me
go<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.610> undo<00:03:17.880> that<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:18.540> what<00:03:18.660> it<00:03:18.780> means<00:03:18.810> that

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
go and undo that so what it means that

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.660 
go and undo that so what it means that
when<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.320> right<00:03:19.560> click<00:03:19.590> here<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.220> go<00:03:20.310> format

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
when I right click here and go format

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.430 
when I right click here and go format
picture<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.270> got<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.020> play<00:03:22.110> with<00:03:22.200> the

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
picture I got to play with the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.080 
picture I got to play with the
brightness<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.190> contrast<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.760> little<00:03:23.970> bit

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
brightness and contrast a little bit

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.060 
brightness and contrast a little bit
make<00:03:24.330> maybe<00:03:24.780> make<00:03:24.989> this<00:03:25.140> a<00:03:25.200> little<00:03:25.320> bit<00:03:25.560> darker

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
make maybe make this a little bit darker

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.000 
make maybe make this a little bit darker
and<00:03:26.810> contrast<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:28.020> out<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.170> little<00:03:28.410> bit<00:03:28.530> more<00:03:28.830> so

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
and contrast it out a little bit more so

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.620 
and contrast it out a little bit more so
you<00:03:29.070> see<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.370> whites<00:03:29.580> there's<00:03:30.180> not<00:03:30.330> a<00:03:30.360> lot<00:03:30.600> of

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
you see the whites there's not a lot of

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.170 
you see the whites there's not a lot of
there<00:03:31.110> may<00:03:31.230> not<00:03:31.380> be<00:03:31.440> some<00:03:31.560> shadows<00:03:32.100> there<00:03:32.310> and

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
there may not be some shadows there and

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.760 
there may not be some shadows there and
I'm<00:03:33.270> gonna<00:03:33.450> go<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:33.660> click<00:03:33.870> this<00:03:34.050> and<00:03:34.320> go<00:03:34.440> under

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
I'm gonna go and click this and go under

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.170 
I'm gonna go and click this and go under
color<00:03:35.100> set<00:03:36.090> transparent<00:03:36.390> color

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
color set transparent color

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.000 
color set transparent color
you<00:03:38.689> can<00:03:38.840> see<00:03:39.049> that<00:03:39.290> you<00:03:39.530> know<00:03:39.620> there's<00:03:39.799> still

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
you can see that you know there's still

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.160 
you can see that you know there's still
probably<00:03:40.310> some<00:03:40.519> shadows<00:03:40.939> here<00:03:41.209> and<00:03:41.959> go<00:03:42.079> ahead

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
probably some shadows here and go ahead

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.729 
probably some shadows here and go ahead
and<00:03:42.290> do<00:03:42.379> that

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
and do that

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.140 
and do that
so<00:03:43.040> there's<00:03:43.219> a<00:03:43.280> lot<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.459> playing<00:03:43.730> around<00:03:43.939> that

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
so there's a lot of playing around that

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.670 
so there's a lot of playing around that
you<00:03:44.239> need<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.510> do<00:03:44.629> if<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:44.870> go<00:03:45.049> through<00:03:45.349> the<00:03:45.469> and

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
you need to do if you go through the and

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.149 
you need to do if you go through the and
try<00:03:46.099> to<00:03:46.159> do<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:46.670> make<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:48.159> background

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
try to do it and make the background

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.030 
try to do it and make the background
transparent<00:03:50.140> what<00:03:51.140> this<00:03:51.290> option<00:03:51.500> is<00:03:51.829> that<00:03:51.859> you

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
transparent what this option is that you

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.949 
transparent what this option is that you
tune<00:03:52.310> instead<00:03:53.030> of<00:03:53.120> just<00:03:53.269> using<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:53.689> remove

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
tune instead of just using the remove

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.099 
tune instead of just using the remove
background<00:03:54.620> command<00:03:55.599> so<00:03:56.599> you<00:03:56.689> need<00:03:56.870> to<00:03:56.989> kind

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
background command so you need to kind

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.509 
background command so you need to kind
of<00:03:57.230> play<00:03:57.409> around<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.829> contrast<00:03:58.340> and

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
of play around the contrast and

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.089 
of play around the contrast and
brightness<00:03:58.579> to<00:03:59.090> do<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.329> but<00:04:00.230> luckily<00:04:00.500> we<00:04:00.859> have

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
brightness to do it but luckily we have

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:02.649 
brightness to do it but luckily we have
a<00:04:01.129> remove<00:04:01.549> background<00:04:01.760> command<00:04:02.090> we<00:04:02.510> don't

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
a remove background command we don't

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.929 
a remove background command we don't
need<00:04:02.750> to<00:04:02.870> play<00:04:03.019> around<00:04:03.200> with<00:04:03.409> it<00:04:03.560> too<00:04:03.769> much<00:04:03.980> I'm

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:04.939 
need to play around with it too much I'm

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:06.429 
need to play around with it too much I'm
gonna<00:04:05.090> go<00:04:05.150> ahead<00:04:05.209> and<00:04:05.299> delete<00:04:05.420> this<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:06.290> now

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:06.439 
gonna go ahead and delete this and now

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:09.179 
gonna go ahead and delete this and now
we<00:04:06.500> have<00:04:06.920> a<00:04:07.159> silhouette<00:04:07.790> so<00:04:08.629> what<00:04:08.750> I<00:04:08.780> can<00:04:08.959> do

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:09.189 
we have a silhouette so what I can do

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:12.190 
we have a silhouette so what I can do
with<00:04:10.189> the<00:04:10.280> silhouette<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:10.970> I<00:04:11.840> want<00:04:12.019> to<00:04:12.079> bring

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
with the silhouette and I want to bring

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.610 
with the silhouette and I want to bring
it<00:04:12.319> on<00:04:12.470> top<00:04:12.739> of<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.250> other<00:04:13.400> picture<00:04:14.379> let's<00:04:15.379> see

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
it on top of the other picture let's see

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.860 
it on top of the other picture let's see
and<00:04:15.889> that<00:04:16.130> kind<00:04:16.459> of<00:04:16.549> fits<00:04:16.789> actually<00:04:17.449> pretty

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
and that kind of fits actually pretty

and that kind of fits actually pretty
well<00:04:18.079> I<00:04:18.489> mean<00:04:19.489> go<00:04:19.609> ahead<00:04:19.729> and<00:04:19.849> increase<00:04:20.269> the

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
well I mean go ahead and increase the

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.040 
well I mean go ahead and increase the
size<00:04:20.660> so<00:04:20.870> we<00:04:20.930> can<00:04:21.079> see<00:04:21.259> it<00:04:22.570> so<00:04:23.570> it<00:04:23.660> fits<00:04:23.780> pretty

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
do is we want to make an animation of

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.629 
do is we want to make an animation of
this<00:04:27.620> image<00:04:28.030> I<00:04:29.500> go<00:04:30.500> under<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:30.740> animations<00:04:31.370> tab

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
here I wanted to make it fade so by

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.219 
here I wanted to make it fade so by
default<00:04:39.860> it's<00:04:40.460> gonna<00:04:40.639> take<00:04:41.180> about<00:04:41.780> half<00:04:42.110> a

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
default it's gonna take about half a

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:43.779 
default it's gonna take about half a
second<00:04:42.590> to<00:04:42.650> do<00:04:42.770> it<00:04:42.860> let<00:04:43.070> me<00:04:43.099> increase<00:04:43.550> that<00:04:43.729> to

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
second to do it let me increase that to

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.140 
second to do it let me increase that to
um<00:04:44.270> one<00:04:44.930> second<00:04:45.440> and<00:04:45.979> so<00:04:46.159> if<00:04:46.280> I<00:04:46.370> preview<00:04:46.760> and<00:04:47.090> I

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
um one second and so if I preview and I

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.600 
um one second and so if I preview and I
play<00:04:47.360> this<00:04:47.599> you<00:04:48.380> can<00:04:48.530> see<00:04:48.889> that<00:04:49.130> it's<00:04:49.280> fading<00:04:49.580> a

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
play this you can see that it's fading a

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.649 
play this you can see that it's fading a
