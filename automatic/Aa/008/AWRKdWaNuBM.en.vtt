we want to provide a library of sounds
that<00:00:22.140> people<00:00:22.380> are<00:00:22.470> going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.650> be<00:00:22.710> able<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:23.010> get

over<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.630> years<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:37.050> been<00:00:37.140> building<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.680> back

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
over the years have been building a back

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.270 
over the years have been building a back
catalogue<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.640> sounds<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.420> remixes<00:00:40.020> from

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
air-drawn dagger from the vulva you know

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.840 
air-drawn dagger from the vulva you know
every<00:00:43.290> time<00:00:43.469> we<00:00:43.530> work<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:43.980> anything<00:00:44.219> really<00:00:44.610> in

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
every time we work on anything really in

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.310 
every time we work on anything really in
that<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.120> there's<00:00:45.390> there's<00:00:45.690> always<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:46.050> few

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
that and there's there's always a few

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.779 
that and there's there's always a few
fold<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.800> sounds<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.340> don't<00:00:47.520> end<00:00:47.640> up

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
fold of sounds that we don't end up

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.180 
fold of sounds that we don't end up
using<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.930> I've<00:00:49.020> had<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> lot<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.469> time<00:00:49.950> and

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
using that I've had a lot of time and

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.610 
using that I've had a lot of time and
love<00:00:50.340> put<00:00:50.550> into<00:00:50.879> making<00:00:51.030> them<00:00:51.480> when<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.500> was

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
love put into making them when I was

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.139 
love put into making them when I was
approached<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.039> do<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> sound<00:00:53.489> library<00:00:53.969> it

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
approached to do the sound library it

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.180 
approached to do the sound library it
was<00:00:54.270> an<00:00:54.480> opportunity<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.320> make<00:00:55.500> some<00:00:55.920> sort<00:00:56.100> of

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
was an opportunity to make some sort of

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:29.910 
was an opportunity to make some sort of
use<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.520> all<00:00:56.789> those<00:00:57.000> sounds

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.800 

you<00:01:30.520> really<00:01:30.820> could<00:01:31.030> make<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.270> record<00:01:31.570> from

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
you really could make a record from

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.240 
you really could make a record from
start<00:01:32.140> to<00:01:32.290> bottom<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:32.620> can<00:01:32.800> make<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.040> beats

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
start to bottom you can make the beats

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.680 
start to bottom you can make the beats
and<00:01:33.430> there<00:01:33.640> you<00:01:33.729> can<00:01:33.850> do<00:01:33.940> everything<00:01:34.240> within

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
and there you can do everything within

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.870 
and there you can do everything within
that<00:01:34.810> instrument<00:01:35.440> there's<00:01:35.979> a<00:01:36.070> starting<00:01:36.490> set

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
that instrument there's a starting set

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.770 
that instrument there's a starting set
for<00:01:37.210> a<00:01:37.240> producer<00:01:37.840> it's<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.350> parallel<00:01:39.780> this

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
for a producer it's a parallel this

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.020 
for a producer it's a parallel this
definitely<00:01:41.229> traditional<00:01:41.800> I<00:01:42.040> kind<00:01:42.760> of<00:01:42.790> wish<00:01:42.970> I

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
definitely traditional I kind of wish I

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.960 
definitely traditional I kind of wish I
could<00:01:43.210> keep<00:01:43.330> it<00:01:43.510> for<00:01:43.630> myself<00:01:43.750> but<00:01:44.290> I<00:01:44.820> signed<00:01:45.820> up

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
could keep it for myself but I signed up

00:01:45.970 --> 00:02:26.500 
could keep it for myself but I signed up
on<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.180> contract

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510
