very nice fan and these are little

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.340 
very nice fan and these are little
things<00:01:58.940> again<00:01:59.450> that<00:01:59.750> many<00:01:59.930> people<00:02:00.229> don't

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
things again that many people don't

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.750 
things again that many people don't
realize<00:02:00.470> when<00:02:00.799> they<00:02:00.920> buy<00:02:01.040> a<00:02:01.070> power<00:02:01.340> supply<00:02:01.520> the

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
realize when they buy a power supply the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.370 
realize when they buy a power supply the
fan<00:02:02.060> eventually<00:02:02.510> starts<00:02:02.720> rattling<00:02:03.140> or<00:02:03.320> it

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
fan eventually starts rattling or it

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.350 
fan eventually starts rattling or it
wears<00:02:03.560> out<00:02:03.799> the<00:02:04.280> bearings<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:04.909> then<00:02:05.210> no

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
wears out the bearings and then no

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.480 
wears out the bearings and then no
longer<00:02:05.690> really<00:02:05.900> works<00:02:06.170> very<00:02:06.680> well<00:02:06.770> or<00:02:07.130> becomes

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
longer really works very well or becomes

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.359 
longer really works very well or becomes
loud<00:02:07.729> this<00:02:08.239> one<00:02:08.479> will<00:02:08.720> not<00:02:08.750> very<00:02:09.409> nice<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:09.920> of

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
loud this one will not very nice and of

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.360 
loud this one will not very nice and of
course<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.970> packaging<00:02:11.569> excellent<00:02:12.200> as<00:02:12.370> they

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
course the packaging excellent as they

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.399 
course the packaging excellent as they
should<00:02:13.430> because<00:02:13.939> this<00:02:14.209> is<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.390> high-end<00:02:14.900> power

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:15.409 
should because this is a high-end power

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:17.320 
should because this is a high-end power
supply<00:02:15.830> it's<00:02:16.040> packaged<00:02:16.459> very<00:02:16.700> nicely<00:02:16.909> there

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
supply it's packaged very nicely there

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.199 
supply it's packaged very nicely there
as<00:02:17.540> you<00:02:18.019> can<00:02:18.170> see<00:02:18.439> first<00:02:19.040> off<00:02:19.310> underneath<00:02:20.000> the

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
as you can see first off underneath the

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.800 
as you can see first off underneath the
little<00:02:20.450> bag<00:02:20.870> there<00:02:21.260> we<00:02:21.709> have<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.810> modular

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
little bag there we have the modular

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.750 
little bag there we have the modular
cables<00:02:24.260> now<00:02:24.410> this<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:25.040> hybrid

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
cables now this is a hybrid

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.449 
cables now this is a hybrid
modular<00:02:26.330> power<00:02:26.780> supply<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.439> most<00:02:28.129> of<00:02:28.370> the

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
modular power supply so most of the

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.330 
modular power supply so most of the
cables<00:02:29.120> are<00:02:29.269> modular<00:02:29.750> but<00:02:30.349> some<00:02:30.620> essentials

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
cables are modular but some essentials

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.059 
cables are modular but some essentials
are<00:02:31.610> already<00:02:31.939> plugged<00:02:32.239> in<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.599> of<00:02:33.379> course<00:02:33.650> it

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
are already plugged in and of course it

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.470

and<00:04:04.370> labeled<00:04:04.760> nicely<00:04:05.209> so<00:04:05.389> you<00:04:05.449> can't<00:04:05.750> really

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
and labeled nicely so you can't really

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.170

go<00:04:06.079> wrong<00:04:06.109> like<00:04:06.500> I<00:04:06.560> said<00:04:06.919> and<00:04:07.129> it<00:04:07.609> is<00:04:07.730> of<00:04:07.940> thick

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
go wrong like I said and it is of thick

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.319 
go wrong like I said and it is of thick
quality<00:04:08.690> construction<00:04:09.169> and<00:04:09.819> that's<00:04:10.819> pretty

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
quality construction and that's pretty

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.780 
quality construction and that's pretty
much<00:04:11.510> it<00:04:11.829> one<00:04:12.829> last<00:04:13.069> thing<00:04:13.280> of<00:04:13.430> course<00:04:13.639> that's

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
much it one last thing of course that's

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.970

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
for that as well so we're talking about

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.660 
for that as well so we're talking about
on<00:05:23.540> different<00:05:24.110> loads<00:05:24.380> it's<00:05:24.770> going<00:05:25.100> to<00:05:25.160> peak<00:05:25.430> at

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670 
on different loads it's going to peak at

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.040 
on different loads it's going to peak at
around<00:05:26.320> 200-250<00:05:27.320> it<00:05:27.650> reaches<00:05:27.980> that<00:05:28.130> 91<00:05:28.900> 90<00:05:29.900> to

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
around 200-250 it reaches that 91 90 to

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.200 
around 200-250 it reaches that 91 90 to
91<00:05:30.320> degree<00:05:30.860> mark<00:05:31.100> and<00:05:31.340> then<00:05:31.640> it<00:05:31.790> kind<00:05:32.150> of

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
91 degree mark and then it kind of

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.420 
91 degree mark and then it kind of
levels<00:05:32.450> off<00:05:32.840> depending<00:05:33.200> on<00:05:33.530> the<00:05:33.920> load<00:05:34.130> and

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
levels off depending on the load and

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.360 
levels off depending on the load and
there<00:05:35.060> it<00:05:35.180> is<00:05:35.240> it's<00:05:35.600> a<00:05:35.750> beauty<00:05:36.140> I'll<00:05:36.320> post<00:05:37.160> the
