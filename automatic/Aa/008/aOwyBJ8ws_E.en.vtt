indicated one of the main problems that

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.630 
indicated one of the main problems that
I<00:00:22.410> see<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.920> city<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.430> there's<00:00:23.580> no

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
I see in the city is that there's no

I see in the city is that there's no
unity<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.779> regardless<00:00:25.289> right<00:00:26.099> which<00:00:26.789> is

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
unity in regardless right which is

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.980 
unity in regardless right which is
across<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.810> board<00:00:28.170> we<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.529> ethnic<00:00:29.990> Conclave

across the board we have ethnic Conclave

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.709 
across the board we have ethnic Conclave
on<00:00:31.619> plays<00:00:32.040> they<00:00:32.399> refuse<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.149> work<00:00:33.329> with<00:00:33.540> one

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
on plays they refuse to work with one

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.410 
on plays they refuse to work with one
another<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.649> have<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.890> hierarchical<00:00:35.820> system<00:00:36.270> in

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
another we have a hierarchical system in

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.240 
another we have a hierarchical system in
terms<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.930> our<00:00:37.170> government<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.770> people<00:00:38.010> not

feeling<00:00:38.670> connected<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.020> why<00:00:40.200> should

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
feeling connected to it so why should

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.319 
feeling connected to it so why should
they<00:00:40.530> use<00:00:40.559> data<00:00:41.129> also<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.850> know<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.180> there's

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
they use data also we know that there's

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.330 
they use data also we know that there's
a<00:00:42.420> history<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.840> data<00:00:43.170> being<00:00:43.410> used<00:00:43.530> against

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
a history of data being used against

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.369 
a history of data being used against
people<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.149> let's<00:00:45.360> be<00:00:45.480> honest<00:00:45.870> about<00:00:46.020> that

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
people so let's be honest about that

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.700 
people so let's be honest about that
data<00:00:46.890> can<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.370> double-edged<00:00:48.329> sword<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.260> all

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
data can be a double-edged sword so all

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.459 
data can be a double-edged sword so all
those<00:00:50.100> issues<00:00:50.550> need<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:51.000> discussed<00:00:51.600> this

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
those issues need to be discussed this

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.619 
those issues need to be discussed this
has<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.039> be<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> one-on-one<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:54.149> we<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.449> have<00:00:54.600> a

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
has to be a one-on-one so we can have a

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.080 
has to be a one-on-one so we can have a
common<00:00:55.110> language<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.430> important

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
common language that it is important

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.380 
common language that it is important
that<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.230> being<00:00:58.530> used<00:00:58.670> that<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.879> going<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.239> get

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
that is being used that is going to get

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.290 
that is being used that is going to get
you<00:01:00.570> grant<00:01:00.899> money<00:01:01.140> data<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.250> get<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.969> better

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
you grant money data to get you a better

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.719 
you grant money data to get you a better
understanding<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.350> how<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.680> focus<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.519> a

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
understanding of how to focus in on a

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.850 
understanding of how to focus in on a
root<00:01:06.000> problem<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.290> are<00:01:07.439> dealing<00:01:07.680> with

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
root problem that you are dealing with

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.580 
root problem that you are dealing with
as<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> coalition<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.570> know<00:01:09.869> not<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.380> put

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
as a coalition so you know not to put

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.469 
as a coalition so you know not to put
your<00:01:10.770> resources<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.520> way<00:01:11.729> but<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.119> put<00:01:12.299> them

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
your resources this way but to put them

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.570 
your resources this way but to put them
this<00:01:12.630> way<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.140> then<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.680> think<00:01:14.040> your<00:01:14.220> new<00:01:14.369> york
