00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.190
 orecchiette because only the prawns e 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.960
 squid will flood the taste of fish 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.360
 not fresh mergoscia they had taken 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.640
 dal dal mare and put in the pan but it is not 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.590
 this was the case, we turned out 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.270
 we put oil under the ages 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.619

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.390

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.369
 turn out to be what we mean 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.390
 done in the fish stock but as 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.399
 had added until cooked 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.229
 obviously the shrimp and squid but not 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.869
 count no more than two minutes 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.000
 how many look how beautiful they look 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.729
 still fleshy when you see prawns 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.800
 dehydrated and small dry 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.450
 montini that were well caught then 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.230
 flat will not result then on the palate 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.380
 nice here as you see there are still 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.730
 of turnip greens inside that now 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.670
 we're going to compose our plate 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:25.140
 we put our orecchiette with 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.140
 shrimp this way 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.050
 as you can see 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.900
 look that creates this minute there is 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:43.769
 given by the piece that results 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.349
 of the orecchiette that come 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.780
 cooked in the world of risotto for this 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:52.560
 is called are called results 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:59.400
 that the squid were cut to 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:01.440
 julienne high end and there does not go one 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.819
 three minute cycle culture since 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.730
 we have a creamy part we go to 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:11.280
 then recall with the skipped plates 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:14.250
 pan-fried crispy in this way 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.000
 we also put some above we give the 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.410
 crispiness even for diners 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.450
 will be able to see that there are also the 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:28.170
 we put almonds and pine nuts in the text 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:29.730
 also some on this side here is 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.440
 then to finish as we have one 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.599
 we leave a lot, but we did it 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.940
 confit of cherry tomatoes conflict does 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.709
 say a French term that is used 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.269
 when crops will be cooked 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.880
 prolonged serves to preserve the 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.370
 product therefore a culture is made 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.560
 with a ventilated oven for about an hour 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.299
 and a half 140 degrees 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.769
 the tomatoes are immersed in water 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.720
 bills are deprived of them 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:58.919
 leather cut and seasoned with salt oil 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.900
 pepper thyme and oregano and then reached theme 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:03.030
 reached two tablespoons of sugar per 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.829
 about half a kilo of tomatoes come 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.810
 made cook for an hour and a half that 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.099
 we will get this kind of result 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.380
 I assure you they are cherry tomatoes 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:15.780
 really sweeties that will go to 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:17.489
 contrast well with the bitter taste of 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:24.450
 turnip top 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:31.770
 and that's why I wanted to put i 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:34.250
 tomatoes conflict not even color 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.250
 to the plate 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:52.480
 determine we will put our cameron 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:54.660
 and deprived of the inner casing one 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.020
 little bottle of raw oil 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.020
 in this way 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.360
 and this the dish is finished 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.420

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.270
