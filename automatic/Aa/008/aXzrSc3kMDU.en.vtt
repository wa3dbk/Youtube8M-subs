00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello youtube with you larin in an hour i 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.930
 I leave to the far northern edge I'm leaving 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.929
 by train because i'm not very successful 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.670
 and I decided to clarify a few facts on 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.530
 to the trains since i still don't ride 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.240
 so often here and there among them 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.449
 a couple of interesting and with them I am you now 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.070
 will introduce you to 1804 a native of England 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.930
 Richard used to invent the first belt 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.210
 locomotive carriage 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.430
 there, too, I was nothing but smiles on 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.830
 faces the audience he did not call him 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.279
 just hesitated to sit down was that 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.530
 in the train of richard instead of sticks there were two 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.940
 chair first passenger third class 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.860
 in Russian trains accounted for 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.719
 travel under the benches the whole thing in 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.590
 the fact that the cars of the front of the 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.840
 traveled 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.850
 roofless and passengers nothing 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.629
 it remained to do both in bad weather 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.399
 hide under their seats and portray 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.289
 offended well, you know, like smooth 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.780
 bolder road go to australia 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.579
 500 kilometers across a desert plain and neither 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.109
 one turn of course such a road 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.149
 settled on the pages of the book of records 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.550
 Guinness in Russia such a road is not 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.260
 possible in principle because it is direct 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.299
 this is the shortest distance between two 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.640
 points and if the distance is 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.890
 the shortest means there will be less roads 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.140
 it means that fools are hard to be 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.210
 less but this is an avalanche 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.220
 this is the name of the station 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.770

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.900
 distance both to Vladivostok and 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.000
 same distant Moscow and therefore if 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.189
 you are sick of your half then you know 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.780

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.479
