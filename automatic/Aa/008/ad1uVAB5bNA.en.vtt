putting<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.530> hard<00:00:40.739> drive<00:00:40.980> into<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.430> freezer<00:00:41.790> is

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
putting a hard drive into a freezer is

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:42.950 
putting a hard drive into a freezer is
such<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> bad<00:00:42.540> idea

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
such a bad idea

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.229 
such a bad idea
so<00:00:43.290> why<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.530> putting<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.129> hard<00:00:44.309> drive<00:00:44.520> into<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
so why is putting a hard drive into the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.690 
so why is putting a hard drive into the
freezer<00:00:45.539> such<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> bad<00:00:46.260> idea<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.520> best

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
freezer such a bad idea and the best

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.600 
freezer such a bad idea and the best
analogy<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.360> give<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.770> warm<00:00:50.250> summer<00:00:50.520> day

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
analogy I can give is a warm summer day

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.380 
analogy I can give is a warm summer day
taking<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.480> glass<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.110> ice<00:00:52.440> water<00:00:52.739> out<00:00:53.010> into<00:00:53.390> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
taking a glass of ice water out into the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.779 
taking a glass of ice water out into the
outdoors<00:00:54.539> where<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.199> hot<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.590> humid<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.129> it

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
outdoors where it's hot and humid and it

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.549 
outdoors where it's hot and humid and it
starts<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.329> sweat<00:00:57.629> well<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> same<00:00:58.289> thing

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
starts to sweat well the same thing

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.860 
starts to sweat well the same thing
happens<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.129> hard<00:00:59.340> drive<00:00:59.520> as<00:01:00.149> soon<00:01:00.539> as<00:01:00.719> you

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
happens in a hard drive as soon as you

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.630 
happens in a hard drive as soon as you
take<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.260> out<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> freezer<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.489> can

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
take it out of the freezer and you can

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.130 
take it out of the freezer and you can
see<00:01:02.850> we've<00:01:03.030> had<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.390> out<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> freezer

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
see we've had this out of the freezer

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.530 
see we've had this out of the freezer
for<00:01:04.530> literally<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.250> couple<00:01:05.540> minutes

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
for literally just a couple minutes

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.840 
for literally just a couple minutes
maybe<00:01:06.960> not<00:01:07.170> even<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.470> long<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.430> drive<00:01:08.670> has

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
maybe not even that long the drive has

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.580 
maybe not even that long the drive has
already<00:01:09.180> started<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.600> sweat<00:01:10.020> as<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.260> comes

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
already started to sweat as it comes

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.010 
already started to sweat as it comes
back<00:01:10.830> up<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.070> room<00:01:11.400> temperature<00:01:11.840> what<00:01:12.840> that

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
back up to room temperature what that

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.020 
back up to room temperature what that
means<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.530> inside<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.070> drive<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.490> exact<00:01:14.790> same

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
means is inside the drive the exact same

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.179 
means is inside the drive the exact same
thing<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.420> happening<00:01:15.600> water<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.619> condensing

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
thing is happening water is condensing

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.460 
thing is happening water is condensing
onto<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.670> very<00:01:18.000> delicate<00:01:18.210> platter<00:01:18.720> surfaces

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
onto the very delicate platter surfaces

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.640 
onto the very delicate platter surfaces
as<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.759> spin<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:22.170> heads<00:01:22.380> actually

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
as you spin this up the heads actually

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.609 
as you spin this up the heads actually
will<00:01:23.040> drag<00:01:23.460> through<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.720> water<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.350> can

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
will drag through that water and can

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.590 
will drag through that water and can
actually<00:01:25.950> do<00:01:26.100> significant<00:01:26.759> damage<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340

and I'm going to pop open this Drive and
most<00:01:41.380> likely<00:01:41.619> what<00:01:41.920> we're<00:01:42.070> going<00:01:42.250> to<00:01:42.310> see<00:01:42.610> is

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
most likely what we're going to see is

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.999 
most likely what we're going to see is
that<00:01:42.820> water<00:01:43.360> has<00:01:43.600> probably<00:01:44.140> already<00:01:44.320> started

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
that water has probably already started

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:57.219 
that water has probably already started
to<00:01:45.130> condense<00:01:45.460> on<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.909> inside<00:01:46.360> of<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:47.439> platter

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.169 

you<00:01:58.229> can<00:01:58.380> see<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.859> there's<00:01:59.070> already<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.729> lot

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
you can see that there's already a lot

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.160 
you can see that there's already a lot
of<00:02:00.240> water<00:02:00.890> forming<00:02:01.890> on<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.729> drive<00:02:03.170> so

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
of water forming on this this drive so

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.020 
of water forming on this this drive so
as<00:02:04.289> you<00:02:04.439> can<00:02:04.590> see<00:02:04.890> on<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.159> platter<00:02:05.429> surface

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
as you can see on the platter surface

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.719 
as you can see on the platter surface
here<00:02:06.359> you<00:02:06.810> can<00:02:06.990> see<00:02:07.229> condensation<00:02:07.740> already

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
here you can see condensation already

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.449 
here you can see condensation already
starting<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.420> form<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.470> what<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.860> means<00:02:11.129> is

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
starting to form and what that means is

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.720 
starting to form and what that means is
when<00:02:12.300> we<00:02:12.330> power<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.840> drive<00:02:13.170> back<00:02:13.470> up<00:02:13.769> if<00:02:14.519> we

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
when we power this drive back up if we

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.210 
when we power this drive back up if we
power<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.239> drive<00:02:15.480> back<00:02:15.810> up<00:02:16.049> these<00:02:16.890> heads

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
power this drive back up these heads

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.229 
power this drive back up these heads
right<00:02:17.430> here<00:02:18.500> which<00:02:19.500> five<00:02:19.769> very<00:02:20.280> very<00:02:20.640> close<00:02:21.030> to

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
right here which five very very close to

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.420 
right here which five very very close to

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
that's on this hard drive I'm going to

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.589 
that's on this hard drive I'm going to
do<00:02:34.980> now<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.370> actually<00:02:35.730> put<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.000> cover<00:02:36.180> back<00:02:36.269> on

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
do now is actually put the cover back on

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.930 
do now is actually put the cover back on
the<00:02:36.630> drive<00:02:37.019> and<00:02:37.470> run<00:02:38.010> this<00:02:38.190> drive<00:02:38.519> in<00:02:38.790> this

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
the drive and run this drive in this

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.390 
the drive and run this drive in this
condition<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:39.780> we<00:02:39.959> can<00:02:40.110> show<00:02:40.349> you<00:02:40.400> what

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
condition so that we can show you what

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.880 
condition so that we can show you what
happens

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.140 

I'm<00:02:49.890> just<00:02:50.070> going<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.250> briefly<00:02:50.610> power<00:02:50.940> this

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
I'm just going to briefly power this

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.350 
I'm just going to briefly power this
drive<00:02:51.540> up<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.190> shut<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.340> back<00:02:53.490> down<00:02:53.790> take<00:02:54.210> the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
drive up and shut it back down take the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.000 
drive up and shut it back down take the
cover<00:02:54.570> back<00:02:54.870> off<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.350> we'll<00:02:55.500> actually<00:02:55.710> be

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
cover back off and we'll actually be

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.250 
cover back off and we'll actually be
able<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.250> see<00:02:56.550> most<00:02:57.210> likely<00:02:57.600> some<00:02:57.810> rings<00:02:58.110> that

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
able to see most likely some rings that

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.350 
able to see most likely some rings that
formed<00:02:58.860> on<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.160> platter<00:02:59.430> surface<00:02:59.940> as<00:03:00.150> those

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
formed on that platter surface as those

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.470 
formed on that platter surface as those
heads<00:03:00.600> drag<00:03:00.930> through<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.350> water<00:03:02.300> just<00:03:03.300> got

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
heads drag through the water just got

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.480

done running power to this hard drive

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.670 
done running power to this hard drive
just<00:03:05.520> briefly<00:03:06.240> literally<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.810> couple<00:03:07.050> seconds

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
just briefly literally a couple seconds

and as you can see all the rings that

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.310 
and as you can see all the rings that
have<00:03:11.790> formed<00:03:12.150> as<00:03:12.390> those<00:03:12.600> heads<00:03:12.900> dragged
