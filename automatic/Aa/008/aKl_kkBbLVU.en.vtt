00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.759
 today we are going to know the positions of 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.970
 the notes on the violin but before 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.549
 that you have to know some basic things 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:15.089
 as in the left hand we always go 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.520
 to call the finger one of the two of 23 and 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.580
 of 24 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.860
 after that, what we are going to do is 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.440
 know the ropes 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.080
 to the air that are of the violin that means 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.390
 that those are not pressed with the bow 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.430
 then the first string is played 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.030
 it would be my 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.880
 the second speak the third network and the 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.950
 fourth sun 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.800
 well the gesture that we are going to make is 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.930
 on a graph that some people 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.570
 I already tell you they have four 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.360
 Band-aids or the four fingers 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.390
 let's do the first exercise that goes 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:56.170
 rope in my finger that one would be 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:01.930
 string rope to the air would be my finger one 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:04.620
 F sharp left two and sun of 3 and 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.620
 of 24 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:29.399
 on the second string that would be on air 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:35.990
 the finger ones and of 22 sharp but 3 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:35.990
 that would be re and of 24 that would be me 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:58.400
 on the rope of the third string that 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:05.740
 would be to the air the note of r of 21 nor of 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.740
 the two has held 03 sun of 24 the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.009
 and 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.110
 on the fourth string would air the 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:34.780
 sunny note the one finger would be to speak the 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.780
 finger two would be like that of 32 and 24 king 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.060
 or
