00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
and hair is gonna fall out and I sealed

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.969 
and hair is gonna fall out and I sealed
the<00:01:21.090> web's<00:01:21.600> which<00:01:22.110> means<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.560> pretty<00:01:22.799> much<00:01:22.890> put

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the web's which means I pretty much put

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.580 
the web's which means I pretty much put
a<00:01:23.220> West<00:01:23.549> ceiling<00:01:24.000> on<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.240> which<00:01:24.869> stops<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.560> from
