let's<00:02:10.370> go<00:02:10.520> upstairs<00:02:10.640> here<00:02:23.230> once<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.350> was

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
let's go upstairs here once I was

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.260 
let's go upstairs here once I was
upstairs<00:02:24.770> I<00:02:25.250> found<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.700> air-conditioning

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
upstairs I found the air-conditioning

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.240 
upstairs I found the air-conditioning
unit<00:02:26.600> and<00:02:27.080> in<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.800> bottom<00:02:28.100> of<00:02:28.160> the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
unit and in the bottom of the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.550 
unit and in the bottom of the
air-conditioning<00:02:28.820> unit<00:02:29.150> down<00:02:30.110> here<00:02:30.380> you'll

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
air-conditioning unit down here you'll

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.860 
air-conditioning unit down here you'll
notice<00:02:30.740> this<00:02:31.640> is<00:02:31.850> what's<00:02:32.060> called<00:02:32.240> a<00:02:32.390> catch<00:02:32.570> pan

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
notice this is what's called a catch pan

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.290 
notice this is what's called a catch pan
so<00:02:33.200> if<00:02:33.260> your<00:02:33.410> main<00:02:34.250> drain<00:02:34.520> line<00:02:34.760> ever<00:02:34.940> clogs

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
so if your main drain line ever clogs

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.630 
so if your main drain line ever clogs
this<00:02:35.570> will<00:02:35.750> start<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.050> fill<00:02:36.260> up<00:02:36.470> in<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:37.460> bottom

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
this will start to fill up in the bottom

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.290 
this will start to fill up in the bottom
of<00:02:37.880> this<00:02:37.940> wood<00:02:38.180> piece<00:02:38.420> in<00:02:38.630> here<00:02:38.840> it's<00:02:39.680> soaked

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
of this wood piece in here it's soaked

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.360 
of this wood piece in here it's soaked
so<00:02:41.300> you<00:02:41.360> can<00:02:41.600> tell<00:02:41.810> at<00:02:42.320> some<00:02:42.620> point<00:02:42.890> which<00:02:43.340> is

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
so you can tell at some point which is

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.620 
so you can tell at some point which is
hard<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.700> tell<00:02:43.880> during<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.180> home<00:02:44.300> inspection

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
hard to tell during a home inspection

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.730 
hard to tell during a home inspection
