00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
excitement until I get hands-on but

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.259 
excitement until I get hands-on but
let's<00:00:22.439> start<00:00:22.650> by<00:00:22.800> running<00:00:23.100> through<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.910> spec

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
let's start by running through the spec

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.439 
let's start by running through the spec
list<00:00:24.539> we've<00:00:25.050> got<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.230> 42<00:00:25.590> megapixel<00:00:26.340> BSI<00:00:26.789> sensor

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
list we've got a 42 megapixel BSI sensor

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.160 
list we've got a 42 megapixel BSI sensor
BSI<00:00:27.990> means<00:00:28.830> backside<00:00:29.580> illuminated<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:31.019> is

BSI means backside illuminated this is

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.350 
BSI means backside illuminated this is
the<00:00:31.289> first<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.980> full-frame<00:00:32.489> sensor<00:00:32.940> most

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
the first in a full-frame sensor most

the first in a full-frame sensor most
recently<00:00:33.690> Samsung<00:00:34.260> used<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.649> technology<00:00:35.010> in

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
recently Samsung used this technology in

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.060 
recently Samsung used this technology in
their<00:00:35.430> n<00:00:35.610> x<00:00:35.790> 1<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.149> x<00:00:36.360> 500<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.590> translates

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
their n x 1 and x 500 and it translates

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.799 
their n x 1 and x 500 and it translates
into<00:00:38.250> some<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.670> best<00:00:38.910> high<00:00:39.210> iso

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
into some of the best high iso

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
performance from any crop sensor so this

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.240 
performance from any crop sensor so this
technology<00:00:43.260> paired<00:00:43.559> with<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> full-frame

technology paired with a full-frame

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.830 
technology paired with a full-frame
sensor<00:00:44.700> should<00:00:44.879> yield<00:00:45.090> some<00:00:45.329> excellent

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
sensor should yield some excellent

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.319 
sensor should yield some excellent
results<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.440> sony<00:00:47.160> has<00:00:47.280> bumped<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.820> expanded

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329
