wanted to know ahead of time that I had

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.049 
wanted to know ahead of time that I had
a<00:00:09.809> few<00:00:10.200> blind<00:00:10.410> fires<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.580> kind<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:11.849> freaked

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
a few blind fires and I kind of freaked

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.459 
a few blind fires and I kind of freaked
the<00:00:12.179> fuck<00:00:12.210> out<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:12.719> get<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> boner<00:00:13.139> and

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
the fuck out and I get a boner and

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.320 
the fuck out and I get a boner and
that's<00:00:14.250> because<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.610> believe<00:00:14.940> they're<00:00:15.089> kind<00:00:15.240> of

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
that's because I believe they're kind of

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.510 
that's because I believe they're kind of
rare<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.570> uh<00:00:15.870> call<00:00:16.650> duty<00:00:16.830> ghosts<00:00:17.070> because<00:00:17.220> the

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
rare and uh call duty ghosts because the

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.000 
rare and uh call duty ghosts because the
sniper<00:00:17.820> doesn't<00:00:18.119> even<00:00:18.539> have<00:00:18.869> crosshairs<00:00:19.680> like

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
sniper doesn't even have crosshairs like

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.519 
sniper doesn't even have crosshairs like
there<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.580> no<00:00:20.609> crosshairs<00:00:21.300> on<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.570> sniper<00:00:21.810> so

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
there is no crosshairs on the sniper so

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.170 
there is no crosshairs on the sniper so
it's<00:00:22.650> pretty<00:00:22.800> rare<00:00:23.100> i<00:00:23.130> guess<00:00:23.460> for<00:00:23.640> me<00:00:23.820> because

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
it's pretty rare i guess for me because

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.970 
it's pretty rare i guess for me because
the<00:00:24.300> shot<00:00:24.510> means<00:00:24.750> can<00:00:24.960> go<00:00:25.080> anywhere<00:00:25.470> anytime

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
the shot means can go anywhere anytime

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.279 
the shot means can go anywhere anytime
