00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 to where the gods of swimming as well as them 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.649
 they called 2009 here took place the 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.870
 world-wide we are welcome to paolo celli 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.679
 third day of competition this is the third 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.230
 the final 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.089
 yesterday the free combined this morning 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.770
 in short, this company does not extract this morning 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.990
 in the summer the finals of the duo you have 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.150
 seen little fake that you wanted to see 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.800
 and now let's follow the third e 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.630
 for the last final the teams' final 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.189
 very interesting final 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.349
 according to the rules for a year to this 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.810
 part of the Italian championship no longer 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.450
 only the best of the first 12 but the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.930
 best 14 have been left out in a few 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.899
 because then of the 23 companies 19 have 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.450
 writing the teams then I do first 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.300
 to tell you who does not participate who I am 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.370
 future club sports association 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.010
 the bike is synchro made and ancient walls 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.710
 vicenza and the protest 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.149
 then who arrived for thirteenth e 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.280
 fourteenth as in this case 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.199
 sport management has arrived with the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.969
 thirteenth score are drawn e 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.260
 they go down to the pool first and then there 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.570
 they are still the two groups of merit 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.280
 composed of 6 teams each at 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.840
 second merit group with those 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.110
 classified in the week I decided 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.450
 in opposition we will see them between the second 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.290
 and the ninth go down in the tub and then the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.979
 best you are 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.780
 obviously at the bottom of the competition 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:23.270
 sport management and we said Lombardy 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.270
 a collection of songs 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.330
 there will be nothing of aretha franklin 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.690
 welcome to the jungle of guns 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.910
 so if you do not stop me now the queens and are 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.910
 you gonna be my jazz girl 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.150
 certainly we saw this right away 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.070
 spectacular opening in the first tank 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.260
 a series of pushes are inserted there 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.060
 we will see one 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.530
 type of frequent will have to 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.960
 resubmit from many of the teams 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.900
 just to collect immediately 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:57.290
 the jury's attention with bags 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.680
 explosive and risky four minutes of 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.680
 routine 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.940
 a team without this young man 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.649
 it falls into the water has been decidedly 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.649
 young only has a series 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.630
 others are 2 boys category lo lo 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.160
 we have never seen a phenomenon a bit 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.160
 widespread in recent years 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.970
 greater number of lines they take 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.970
 part in the Italian championships 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.980
 index as you have said several times of the 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.989
 big longetti longevity of the 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.890
 synchronous for this sport 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.890
 hard 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.610
 and that satisfies with difficulty because I am 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.550
 they are different sacrifices to which they are 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.800
 subjected families and athletes to 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.370
 first, however, thanks to the advent 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.620
 in 2011 to its military gold flames 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.290
 first immediately after a navy 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.270
 there was a breath of oxygen but true 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.910
 own injection 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.170
 trust at home has damaged mine 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.500
 this is also the reason why one is 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.010
 arrived then to make finals to 14 saw 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.620
 that flames gold and navy had 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.269
 enlisted 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.819
 best syncettes were practically 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.650
 the national team then to give way and 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:29.030
 breath to the companies in short 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.790
 then gratify by landing in the final 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.790
 no more to 12 but two more to 14 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.800
 here we are called queen 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.990
 civil party 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.750
 the choreography where guys succeed a 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.240
 little to recover a bit of energy but 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.310
 however also be able to demonstrate theirs 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.290
 ability to rotate on rhythms on melodies 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.410
 different above all at different rhythms 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:01.860
 so we see a slower movement 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:04.319
 generally wider, less snappy for 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.510
 then resume from the pressing rhythm that 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.780
 will then take us to the end of 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.780
 routine 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.380
 10 so early that one of the 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.380
 girls in the ball 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.770
 with us we remind you that in the program 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:29.479
 free there is no sequence defined states 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.580
 items to execute 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:34.719
 which instead in the technical programs of 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.719
 only two team 

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:52.020
 work 44 that alternation is one that there 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:52.020
 he asked for swallows 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.320
 at the request of veroli 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.150
 the accounts are well this Verona routine 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.130
 quite suspicious superstitious 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.640
 in centering the final the coach 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:28.310
 train us away and win krakow year 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.550
 until the end feared he could not have 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.260
 access to the final so they must be there 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.560
 framed right now 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:39.830
 then as you were saying tomorrow satisfied 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:42.770
 this is the first push a single senior 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.630
 that land dawn and then you have done the 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.030
 of the girls category right those 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.110
 ranging from 13 to 15 years old as one 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:53.640
 tina lanzavecchia mortar the friend 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:57.490
 in burned purple molina 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:06:01.160
 yes no it was marta longone than of 97 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:04.250
 but he says bortolussi and then ceri ceriani 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.080
 valeria burned grenia ceriani e 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.950
 giulio seniga instead of being of the 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:13.400
 junior category 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:15.880
 then as said thirteenth with 70 38 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.230
 and 33 and see there is a very light 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.910
 set back by a couple of decimals of 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.890
 point with the five judges 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.620
 of the execution evaluating them 21 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:30.110
 July and 5th of impression 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:32.060
 which they value 29 and 466 weighs 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.410
 at 40 percent the evaluation of 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.410
 five judges of artistic impression
