00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.289
 What is ah 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:42.039
 If you look at the first row

 The lecture was coming second oil 56 7 has a hexagonal Night Before any Mei 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.270
 It was making. 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:52.880
 character 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:55.970
 So I made five six hexagons in 1 2 3 4 . 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.600
 What did you do first after you created it? 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:02.750
 Here comes 1 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.290

 4 4 2 Dassa After making the hexagon the sixth time 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.560
 I felt eight eyes. 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:32.700
 He made six kings on each day and then put them on top. 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:38.610
 Now I've made it in the yo-party matjjang horses hunch that the second ah 23 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:41.430
 5 6 6 After making the six rivers , then on top of it 3 3 bands 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.060
 I felt like I had two bands in it. 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:49.140
 I had three 1 2 3 bands. 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.950
 The important thing here what I did. Now that fit the insulation here 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.240
 When 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:02:03.509
 I told you that you have to fit in this loop that connects here. 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:09.509
 I'll try not it is party tents daseo in one, two, three. 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:15.239
 I feel six , then at the middle 1 2 3 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:16.530
 I woke up three bands like this. Now, in the next lecture. 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.990
 character 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.750
 The hexagon was made the same 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:28.900
 Then he made a hexagonal 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:32.980
 I had a feeling that I had four. 1 2 3 4 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:36.430
 I repeat that. Yes. I have to listen to him. 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:41.020
 I'll give you one day. 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:45.400
 2 3 4 5 6 Making six hunches. 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:52.180
 From the center 1 2 3 4 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:03:00.580
 That's what you put in. 4 This is the last time you learned it. 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:05.950
 1 2 3 4 5 6 then sheathed band raised insert sequentially chair 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:09.580
 One or two of my 5 6 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:19.360
 I had six men. Where was the last one ? 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:21.670
 I'll do it again . One, two, three, four, five, six. 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.770
 I make a six-river shape with land. 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:30.640
 Then 1 2 3 4 5 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:33.760
 For'll wake inserted in the last six 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.880
 I did activities to make this 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.880
 character 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:45.280
 Let's do some activities once in a season. 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.430
 First, I made a sixth sense. 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.430
 One 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.950
 2 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.790
 Kitty 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.900
 2 Examples 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:07.430
 2 5 6 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:12.860
 I always said that ping is important in this part of the gathering . 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.850
 Here you create the 6 following a hunch that I wear some water, some going over it in 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.260
 It's important. 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:20.980
 At first I put two pieces together. 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:26.740
 Here's 1 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:32.880
 It was two pieces, not two pieces next. 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.880
 1 2 3 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:40.810
 line 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:43.990
 I'm going to wear a world party He then sandwiched four 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.130
 Watch 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.690
 One 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:54.200
 1 ah 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.200
 2 3 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:02.340
 It gave into the four bands thus 4 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:05.820
 It has served to wake me the next band 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:09.810
 And then we've got six banding activities. 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:12.840
 Take a good look at it. 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.900
 I told you it was the last plan . 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:20.639
 Now awaken from here'm gonna emergency 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:25.199
 Now I do not have any broken only way from here postcard is inserted, I awoke here 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.400
 I'm here to stay here. It's confusing which one it is. 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.760
 You better go back. 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:33.300
 I believe that clockwise direction is a rebounding amount. 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.640
 I 'll turn it counterclockwise. 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.000
 animal 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.000
 3 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.660
 4 cases 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.930
 Jasub 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.749
 Finally 4 of these 6 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:57.279
 I had a band. 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:58.809
 4 This woke the six bands did make me a flower-shaped application tips 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:04.479
 I told you one . 

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:09.159
 Yeogieda a fan touches them six different colors on a white spit ah 1 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:13.360
 This simyeon roll so-shaped insert in the arm 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:19.360
 I told you I was being fooled by another pretty figure. 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:20.769
 Sericulture this thing's gonna yeogida application is so fitting and yet what do 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.939
 Anything 

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:29.110
 Yeogieda that one did squeeze fit one of the band now, 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:32.350
 I might wake up one of the above. 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:36.250
 It still looks different. 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:39.640
 Now I hope that others more different language so if doegoyo 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:44.380
 If you wanna wake up this way again. 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:49.210
 If you wake up this way, there's another good thing. 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:50.620
 These things are different depending on how much I am smoking 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:56.590
 You can. 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:07:01.330
 Like I hate it here so that the rest of stiff end I lost one straight 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:04.090
 If you want to stay there all the time and you will hang this here Article 3 e fans 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:07.420
 You can walk all the way here , not just walk here . 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:13.540
 It will plug straight section did yaeman 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:15.850
 4 to be connected to what is important and what do you start? Shall Always 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:20.770
 I told you the order was important. 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:25.960
 When Can I come back, do not forget to order the end haejusimyeon 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:30.640
 I told you that the purple band on the top two is the first one . 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:32.710
 Hey I'll be the first to fall, followed by falls while purging the outside in 

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:37.450
 Now remember nasijyo 

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:41.740
 So let 's get his fifth 5th 6th one 

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:43.419
 Trace the seventh lecture once a time that can only look back 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.020
 I took it. 

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:46.020
 Thank you
