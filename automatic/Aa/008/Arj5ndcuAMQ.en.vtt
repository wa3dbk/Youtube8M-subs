everything<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.669> set<00:00:32.910> into<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.270> six<00:00:34.050> unit<00:00:34.620> rack

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340

case<00:00:35.670> made<00:00:36.000> by<00:00:36.030> roadrunner<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:37.649> prior<00:00:37.950> to

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
case made by roadrunner you prior to

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.430 
case made by roadrunner you prior to
them<00:00:38.280> they<00:00:38.489> make<00:00:38.760> guitar<00:00:39.450> cases<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> lot<00:00:40.320> of

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
them they make guitar cases and a lot of

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.530 
them they make guitar cases and a lot of
other<00:00:40.530> things<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.850> I've<00:00:42.000> always<00:00:42.149> been<00:00:42.360> pretty

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
other things so I've always been pretty

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.590 
other things so I've always been pretty
happy<00:00:42.750> with<00:00:43.020> their<00:00:43.230> equipment<00:00:44.300> and<00:00:45.300> it's<00:00:45.480> a

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
happy with their equipment and it's a

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.229 
happy with their equipment and it's a
six<00:00:45.899> rack<00:00:46.200> unit<00:00:46.649> which<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.129> good<00:00:47.789> for<00:00:48.030> me

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
six rack unit which is good for me

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.479 
six rack unit which is good for me
mainly<00:00:48.600> because<00:00:48.780> anything<00:00:49.559> taller<00:00:49.890> than<00:00:50.160> six

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
mainly because anything taller than six

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.000 
mainly because anything taller than six
units<00:00:50.879> won't<00:00:51.360> fit<00:00:51.809> into<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.469> trunk<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.829> my<00:00:52.860> car

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
units won't fit into the trunk of my car

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.200 
units won't fit into the trunk of my car
so<00:00:53.660> as<00:00:54.660> far<00:00:55.199> as<00:00:55.350> everything<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:56.820> top

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
so as far as everything in it on top

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.869 
so as far as everything in it on top
we've<00:00:57.930> got<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.260> Furman<00:00:59.129> power<00:00:59.309> conditioner

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
we've got the Furman power conditioner

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.240 
we've got the Furman power conditioner
I'm<00:01:00.090> using<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.079> EM<00:01:01.320> ATX

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
I'm using the EM ATX

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.549 
I'm using the EM ATX
and<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.239> far<00:01:03.510> from<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.960> top<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.379> line

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
and it's far from the top of the line

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.910 
and it's far from the top of the line
but<00:01:05.250> not<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.270> most<00:01:06.420> basic<00:01:06.840> either<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.619> this

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
but not the most basic either so this

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.980 
but not the most basic either so this
one<00:01:08.450> has<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:10.610> display<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> front<00:01:12.150> kind<00:01:12.869> of

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
one has the display in the front kind of

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.270 
one has the display in the front kind of
helps<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.229> keep<00:01:13.380> an<00:01:13.530> eye<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.650> what<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> power

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
helps you keep an eye on what the power

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.700 
helps you keep an eye on what the power
is<00:01:14.490> doing<00:01:14.820> also<00:01:15.210> has<00:01:15.900> I'm<00:01:16.290> getting<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.590> little

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
is doing also has I'm getting a little

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.219 
is doing also has I'm getting a little
closer<00:01:16.920> here<00:01:17.130> these<00:01:18.060> are<00:01:18.210> actually<00:01:18.450> lights<00:01:18.720> so

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
closer here these are actually lights so

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.920 
closer here these are actually lights so
when<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.470> pull<00:01:19.619> these<00:01:19.710> out<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.549> know<00:01:20.900> can<00:01:21.900> be

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
when you pull these out you know can be

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.520 
when you pull these out you know can be
useful<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.380> obvious<00:01:22.890> reasons<00:01:23.689> also<00:01:24.689> has<00:01:24.930> an

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
useful for obvious reasons also has an

rack G made by ISP Technologies and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.170 
rack G made by ISP Technologies and
that's<00:01:39.659> just<00:01:39.960> my<00:01:40.140> noise<00:01:40.530> reduction<00:01:40.829> system<00:01:41.579> so

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
that's just my noise reduction system so

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.149 
that's just my noise reduction system so
I<00:01:42.479> was<00:01:42.630> using<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:43.140> actually<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.799> was<00:01:43.920> using<00:01:44.040> a

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
I was using a actually I was using a

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.730 
I was using a actually I was using a
decimator<00:01:44.640> paddle<00:01:45.060> prior<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.960> not

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
decimator paddle prior to this and not

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.560 
decimator paddle prior to this and not
to<00:01:46.860> say<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> pedal<00:01:47.460> was<00:01:47.759> bad<00:01:48.030> but<00:01:48.390> this

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
to say that the pedal was bad but this

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.719 
to say that the pedal was bad but this
definitely<00:01:49.020> takes<00:01:49.350> things<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.130> whole<00:01:50.310> new

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
definitely takes things to a whole new

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.330 
definitely takes things to a whole new
level<00:01:51.290> and<00:01:52.290> plus<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.829> was<00:01:52.950> trying<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.220> keep

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
level and plus I was trying to keep

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.410 
level and plus I was trying to keep
everything<00:01:53.640> contained<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:56.369> rack<00:01:56.610> anyway

you know your feedback and your hisses

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.530 
you know your feedback and your hisses
from<00:02:25.320> your<00:02:25.500> pickups<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.190> stuff<00:02:26.700> like<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:27.000> so

itself so yeah so I've been actually
very<00:02:41.400> very<00:02:41.910> happy<00:02:42.180> with<00:02:42.210> that

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
very very happy with that

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.270 
very very happy with that
um<00:02:43.190> moving<00:02:44.190> down<00:02:44.580> is<00:02:44.990> my<00:02:45.990> wireless<00:02:46.560> now<00:02:47.010> that's

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
um moving down is my wireless now that's

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.790 
um moving down is my wireless now that's
the<00:02:47.520> line<00:02:49.550> 6g<00:02:50.550> 90<00:02:51.090> relay<00:02:51.480> which<00:02:52.020> is<00:02:52.200> their<00:02:52.440> top

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
the line 6g 90 relay which is their top

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.390 
the line 6g 90 relay which is their top
of<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.980> line<00:02:53.480> wireless<00:02:54.480> system<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:56.310> know

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
of the line wireless system and you know

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.940 
of the line wireless system and you know
truth<00:02:56.670> be<00:02:56.700> told<00:02:56.820> you<00:02:57.180> can<00:02:57.360> get<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.660> same

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
truth be told you can get the same

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.290 
truth be told you can get the same
functionality<00:02:58.950> for<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.580> little<00:03:00.030> bit<00:03:00.120> less

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
functionality for a little bit less

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.990 
functionality for a little bit less
money<00:03:00.570> in<00:03:00.750> fact<00:03:00.900> they're<00:03:01.190> g50<00:03:02.190> pretty<00:03:02.820> much

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
money in fact they're g50 pretty much

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.290 
money in fact they're g50 pretty much
operates<00:03:03.690> identically<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.950> this<00:03:05.300> the

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
operates identically to this the

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.730 
operates identically to this the
difference<00:03:06.630> is<00:03:06.810> it's<00:03:06.990> kind<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.320> designed<00:03:07.590> for

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
difference is it's kind of designed for

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.320 
difference is it's kind of designed for
a<00:03:07.800> pedal<00:03:08.100> board<00:03:08.220> setup<00:03:08.550> as<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:09.030> where<00:03:09.150> this<00:03:09.270> is

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
a pedal board setup as to where this is

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.510 
a pedal board setup as to where this is
rack<00:03:09.660> mountable<00:03:10.080> so<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.680> again<00:03:10.830> that's<00:03:11.220> what

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
rack mountable so and again that's what

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.160 
rack mountable so and again that's what
I<00:03:11.550> was<00:03:11.760> going<00:03:11.970> for<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.330> everything<00:03:12.900> tucked

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
I was going for is everything tucked

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.370 
I was going for is everything tucked
into<00:03:13.350> one<00:03:13.560> place<00:03:13.830> so<00:03:14.600> as<00:03:15.600> far<00:03:15.810> as<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.080> features

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
into one place so as far as the features

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.710 
into one place so as far as the features
of<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.560> well<00:03:17.430> its<00:03:17.640> digital<00:03:18.030> which<00:03:18.390> is<00:03:18.540> good

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
of that well its digital which is good

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.240 
of that well its digital which is good
so<00:03:18.900> you're<00:03:19.019> never<00:03:19.200> going<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.380> have<00:03:19.530> issues

so you're never going to have issues
with<00:03:20.400> interference<00:03:21.110> twelve<00:03:22.110> channels<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:23.220> say

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
with interference twelve channels so say

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.430 
with interference twelve channels so say
your<00:03:23.970> other<00:03:24.090> guitar<00:03:24.480> player<00:03:24.750> or<00:03:25.019> bass<00:03:25.170> player

your other guitar player or bass player
is<00:03:25.650> using<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:26.010> same<00:03:26.220> set<00:03:26.489> up<00:03:26.640> you<00:03:26.790> guys<00:03:26.910> can

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
is using the same set up you guys can

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.430 
is using the same set up you guys can
differentiate<00:03:27.630> channels<00:03:29.390> it's<00:03:30.390> good<00:03:30.780> for<00:03:30.989> 300

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
differentiate channels it's good for 300

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.640 
differentiate channels it's good for 300
feet<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:32.130> they<00:03:32.340> say<00:03:32.720> I<00:03:33.720> don't<00:03:34.170> know<00:03:34.320> about<00:03:34.410> that

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.620 
feet so they say I don't know about that
maybe<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.220> is<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:36.300> know<00:03:36.959> that<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.620> can<00:03:38.330> walk<00:03:39.330> like

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630

there<00:03:46.110> however<00:03:47.100> going<00:03:47.970> outside<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:49.530> signal

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
there however going outside the signal

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.160 
there however going outside the signal
does<00:03:50.489> not<00:03:50.519> pass<00:03:50.940> through<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.360> concrete<00:03:51.930> walls

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
does not pass through the concrete walls

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.120 
does not pass through the concrete walls
of<00:03:52.380> my<00:03:52.530> basement<00:03:52.769> very<00:03:53.160> well<00:03:53.370> so<00:03:54.500> but<00:03:55.500> I<00:03:55.739> mean

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
of my basement very well so but I mean

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.009 
of my basement very well so but I mean
what<00:03:56.459> we<00:03:56.519> expect<00:03:56.820> so<00:03:58.400> apart<00:03:59.400> from<00:03:59.489> that<00:03:59.670> is<00:04:00.540> it

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
what we expect so apart from that is it

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.160 
what we expect so apart from that is it

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
operates at 2.4 gigahertz which is

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.330 
operates at 2.4 gigahertz which is
important<00:04:04.680> because<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:07.470> older<00:04:07.860> wireless

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
important because the older wireless

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.150 
important because the older wireless
systems<00:04:08.850> are<00:04:09.150> now<00:04:09.450> infringing<00:04:10.260> on<00:04:10.470> bandwidth

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
systems are now infringing on bandwidth

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.699 
systems are now infringing on bandwidth
that's<00:04:11.489> been<00:04:11.760> basically<00:04:12.360> sold<00:04:12.660> to<00:04:13.110> like<00:04:13.470> cell

things<00:04:15.500> of<00:04:15.650> that<00:04:15.769> nature<00:04:15.830> so<00:04:16.600> basically<00:04:17.600> you<00:04:18.380> I

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
things of that nature so basically you I

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.110 
things of that nature so basically you I
mean<00:04:18.829> potentially<00:04:19.579> you<00:04:19.699> could<00:04:19.850> run<00:04:20.000> into

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
mean potentially you could run into

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.420 
mean potentially you could run into
legal<00:04:20.510> issues<00:04:20.870> if<00:04:21.199> you're<00:04:21.470> you<00:04:21.979> know<00:04:22.010> cross

legal issues if you're you know cross

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.310 
legal issues if you're you know cross

world<00:04:30.350> at<00:04:30.770> this<00:04:30.889> point<00:04:31.190> so<00:04:31.520> it's<00:04:31.820> it's<00:04:32.060> a

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
world at this point so it's it's a

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.280 
world at this point so it's it's a
pretty<00:04:32.180> good<00:04:32.510> system<00:04:32.690> and<00:04:34.270> yeah<00:04:35.270> you<00:04:35.990> know<00:04:36.110> the

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
pretty good system and yeah you know the

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.170 
pretty good system and yeah you know the
line<00:04:36.470> six<00:04:36.770> has<00:04:36.949> been<00:04:36.979> actually<00:04:37.639> really<00:04:38.000> good

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
line six has been actually really good

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.790 
line six has been actually really good
so<00:04:38.419> far<00:04:38.449> so<00:04:40.419> below<00:04:41.419> that<00:04:41.449> is<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:42.320> power<00:04:42.470> of

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
so far so below that is the power of

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.520 
so far so below that is the power of
everything<00:04:43.310> I<00:04:44.240> know<00:04:44.900> it<00:04:45.110> kind<00:04:45.199> of<00:04:45.290> looks<00:04:45.470> like

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
everything I know it kind of looks like

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.120 
everything I know it kind of looks like
some<00:04:45.770> weird<00:04:46.010> Mesa<00:04:46.699> power<00:04:47.660> amp<00:04:47.960> but<00:04:48.830> really

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
some weird Mesa power amp but really

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.090 
some weird Mesa power amp but really
what<00:04:49.280> it<00:04:49.370> is<00:04:49.400> is<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:50.300> mini<00:04:50.690> rectifier<00:04:51.260> I<00:04:51.560> just

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
what it is is the mini rectifier I just

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.430 
what it is is the mini rectifier I just
have<00:04:52.250> that<00:04:52.520> custom<00:04:53.090> mounted<00:04:53.449> into<00:04:54.139> the<00:04:54.889> rack

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
have that custom mounted into the rack

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.050 
have that custom mounted into the rack
if<00:04:57.440> you<00:04:57.680> have<00:04:57.800> questions<00:04:58.280> on<00:04:58.400> how<00:04:58.430> I<00:04:58.550> did<00:04:58.760> that

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
if you have questions on how I did that

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.020 
if you have questions on how I did that
feel<00:04:59.900> free<00:05:00.080> to<00:05:00.110> ask<00:05:00.350> but<00:05:01.130> it<00:05:01.460> actually<00:05:01.789> takes

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
feel free to ask but it actually takes

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.060 
feel free to ask but it actually takes
up<00:05:02.240> exactly<00:05:02.419> three<00:05:03.110> rack<00:05:03.320> spaces<00:05:03.680> the<00:05:03.979> way

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
up exactly three rack spaces the way

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.029 
up exactly three rack spaces the way
I've<00:05:04.190> got<00:05:04.340> it<00:05:04.460> set<00:05:04.639> in<00:05:04.760> there<00:05:04.940> so<00:05:05.889> it's<00:05:06.889> been

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
I've got it set in there so it's been

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.700 
I've got it set in there so it's been
very<00:05:07.070> handy<00:05:07.580> it's<00:05:07.760> 25<00:05:08.210> watts<00:05:08.510> so<00:05:09.139> it's<00:05:09.530> not

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
very handy it's 25 watts so it's not

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.830 
very handy it's 25 watts so it's not
some<00:05:10.010> massive<00:05:10.490> powerhouse<00:05:11.180> but<00:05:11.539> the<00:05:11.690> nice

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
some massive powerhouse but the nice

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.010 
some massive powerhouse but the nice
thing<00:05:11.870> is<00:05:12.199> you<00:05:12.229> can<00:05:12.470> turn<00:05:12.590> it<00:05:12.770> up<00:05:12.919> and<00:05:13.190> and<00:05:14.020> get

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
thing is you can turn it up and and get

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.689 
thing is you can turn it up and and get
the<00:05:15.199> tone<00:05:15.380> that<00:05:15.410> you<00:05:15.620> want<00:05:15.919> without<00:05:16.100> you<00:05:16.610> know

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
the tone that you want without you know

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:20.860 
the tone that you want without you know
breaking<00:05:17.300> windows<00:05:17.830> and<00:05:18.830> as<00:05:19.760> far<00:05:20.360> as<00:05:20.419> power

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
breaking windows and as far as power

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.230 
breaking windows and as far as power
goes<00:05:21.099> yeah<00:05:22.099> it's<00:05:22.400> definitely<00:05:22.820> powerful

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
goes yeah it's definitely powerful

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.320 
goes yeah it's definitely powerful
enough<00:05:23.690> for<00:05:24.039> any<00:05:25.039> situation<00:05:25.760> that<00:05:25.789> I've<00:05:26.000> come

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
enough for any situation that I've come

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.060 
enough for any situation that I've come
in<00:05:26.450> contact<00:05:27.380> with<00:05:27.710> so<00:05:28.130> um<00:05:29.470> besides<00:05:30.470> that<00:05:30.830> we

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
in contact with so um besides that we

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.730 
in contact with so um besides that we

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
run a 212 Mesa cabinet it's the

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.400 
run a 212 Mesa cabinet it's the
rectifier<00:05:34.190> cabinet<00:05:34.960> sonically<00:05:35.960> the<00:05:36.200> same

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
rectifier cabinet sonically the same

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.670 
rectifier cabinet sonically the same
dimensions<00:05:36.979> as<00:05:37.190> the<00:05:37.250> 412<00:05:38.380> vintage<00:05:39.380> 30

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
dimensions as the 412 vintage 30

dimensions as the 412 vintage 30
selection<00:05:40.310> speakers<00:05:41.200> again<00:05:42.200> it's<00:05:42.590> just<00:05:42.770> half

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
selection speakers again it's just half

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.670 
selection speakers again it's just half
the<00:05:43.550> size<00:05:43.910> and<00:05:44.360> therefore<00:05:44.780> about<00:05:45.260> half<00:05:45.500> the

opposed to forth well doesn't so um when
I<00:05:53.599> do<00:05:53.720> mic<00:05:54.020> things<00:05:54.349> I'm<00:05:54.590> rather<00:05:54.770> than<00:05:54.950> sm57<00:05:55.810> by

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
I do mic things I'm rather than sm57 by

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.610 
I do mic things I'm rather than sm57 by
sure<00:05:57.080> and<00:05:57.910> then<00:05:58.910> the<00:05:59.660> only<00:05:59.780> pedal<00:06:00.139> that<00:06:00.289> I<00:06:00.349> use

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
sure and then the only pedal that I use

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.980 
sure and then the only pedal that I use
at<00:06:00.800> this<00:06:00.919> point<00:06:01.190> is<00:06:01.430> I'm<00:06:01.849> using<00:06:02.000> the<00:06:02.360> tube

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
at this point is I'm using the tube

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.730 
at this point is I'm using the tube
screamer<00:06:03.169> 808<00:06:04.240> which<00:06:05.240> is<00:06:05.539> made<00:06:05.930> by<00:06:05.960> Ibanez

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
screamer 808 which is made by Ibanez

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.240 
screamer 808 which is made by Ibanez
actually<00:06:07.160> technically<00:06:07.580> it's<00:06:07.669> made<00:06:07.789> by<00:06:07.940> max<00:06:08.270> on

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
actually technically it's made by max on

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.029 
actually technically it's made by max on
the<00:06:10.250> same<00:06:10.490> as<00:06:10.669> the<00:06:10.820> max<00:06:11.120> on<00:06:11.330> OD<00:06:11.660> 808<00:06:12.110> and<00:06:12.349> then

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 
the same as the max on OD 808 and then

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.370 
the same as the max on OD 808 and then
back<00:06:13.490> there<00:06:13.789> is<00:06:13.970> my<00:06:14.000> channel<00:06:14.449> changer<00:06:14.930> and<00:06:15.139> the
