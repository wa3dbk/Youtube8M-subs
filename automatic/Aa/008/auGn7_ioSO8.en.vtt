00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
years and I so it's a hangar find it is

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.160 
years and I so it's a hangar find it is
all<00:02:08.610> right<00:02:08.759> how<00:02:08.850> many<00:02:09.030> miles<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.810> has<00:02:09.989> about

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
all right how many miles this has about

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.690 
all right how many miles this has about
83<00:02:10.920> on<00:02:11.070> it<00:02:11.220> right<00:02:11.340> now

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
83 on it right now

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.430 
83 on it right now
all<00:02:11.880> right<00:02:12.030> that's<00:02:12.239> still<00:02:12.510> 83<00:02:13.170> thousand

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
all right that's still 83 thousand

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.710 
all right that's still 83 thousand
pretty<00:02:13.590> incredible<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.640> tell<00:02:15.060> me<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.660> know

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
pretty incredible and tell me you know

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.180 
pretty incredible and tell me you know
the<00:02:15.840> difference<00:02:16.110> between<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.680> one<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:16.950> the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
the difference between this one and the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.520 
the difference between this one and the
American<00:02:17.520> spectrum<00:02:18.090> that's<00:02:18.239> next<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.630> us<00:02:18.750> well

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
American spectrum that's next to us well

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.740 
American spectrum that's next to us well
with<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.010> European<00:02:20.520> spec<00:02:20.790> they<00:02:21.420> call<00:02:21.600> this

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
with the European spec they call this

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.080 
with the European spec they call this
the<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.290> dirty<00:02:22.530> motor<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:22.950> doesn't<00:02:23.280> have<00:02:23.520> the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
the the dirty motor it doesn't have the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.449 
the the dirty motor it doesn't have the
emission<00:02:24.870> control<00:02:25.230> standards<00:02:25.680> yep<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.190> it's<00:02:26.400> a

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
emission control standards yep so it's a

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.520 
emission control standards yep so it's a
little<00:02:26.640> higher<00:02:26.850> compression<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.989> little

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
little higher compression a little

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.340 
little higher compression a little
higher<00:02:28.980> output<00:02:29.310> about<00:02:29.970> 286<00:02:30.840> horsepower<00:02:30.989> at

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
higher output about 286 horsepower at

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:48.339 
higher output about 286 horsepower at
the<00:02:31.380> crank

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.839 

and<00:02:49.349> is<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:49.920> what<00:02:50.069> you<00:02:50.189> wanted<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.519> mean<00:02:50.670> you

and is that what you wanted I mean you

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.339 
and is that what you wanted I mean you
specifically<00:02:51.239> go<00:02:51.329> look<00:02:51.540> for<00:02:51.569> that<00:02:51.719> one<00:02:51.930> or<00:02:52.079> did

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
specifically go look for that one or did

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.690 
specifically go look for that one or did
this<00:02:52.500> one<00:02:52.680> just<00:02:52.859> kind<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:53.040> fall<00:02:53.219> in<00:02:53.310> your<00:02:53.430> lap<00:02:53.519> I

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
this one just kind of fall in your lap I

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.149 
this one just kind of fall in your lap I

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.980 
these cars so to me this was kind of the
pinnacle<00:04:56.800> of<00:04:57.160> the<00:04:57.370> e<00:04:57.580> 20<00:04:58.090> for<00:04:58.240> six<00:04:58.510> years<00:04:58.720> and

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
pinnacle of the e 20 for six years and

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.470 
pinnacle of the e 20 for six years and
how<00:04:59.710> many<00:04:59.770> horsepower<00:05:00.100> or<00:05:00.670> you<00:05:00.790> know<00:05:01.090> that<00:05:01.330> one

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
how many horsepower or you know that one

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.540 
how many horsepower or you know that one
over<00:05:01.690> there<00:05:01.810> has<00:05:01.950> 560<00:05:02.950> how<00:05:03.100> about<00:05:03.250> this<00:05:03.340> one

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
over there has 560 how about this one

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.730 
over there has 560 how about this one
yeah<00:05:03.880> maybe<00:05:04.150> half<00:05:04.420> of<00:05:04.510> that<00:05:04.630> so<00:05:04.870> the<00:05:05.110> factory

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
yeah maybe half of that so the factory

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.690 
yeah maybe half of that so the factory
rated<00:05:06.070> 256<00:05:07.030> horsepower<00:05:07.150> it's<00:05:07.870> an<00:05:08.050> inline<00:05:08.700> 624

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
rated 256 horsepower it's an inline 624

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.630 
rated 256 horsepower it's an inline 624
valve<00:05:09.970> that<00:05:10.330> in<00:05:10.750> its<00:05:11.020> day<00:05:11.260> was<00:05:11.560> considered<00:05:12.070> an

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
valve that in its day was considered an

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.490 
valve that in its day was considered an
overwhelming<00:05:13.300> amount<00:05:13.390> of<00:05:13.630> horsepower<00:05:13.900> not<00:05:14.320> so

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
overwhelming amount of horsepower not so

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:21.170 
overwhelming amount of horsepower not so
much<00:05:14.650> by<00:05:14.800> today's<00:05:15.100> standards

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
personality in the peel all right this

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.930 
personality in the peel all right this
is<00:06:23.750> an<00:06:23.870> identical<00:06:24.229> interior<00:06:24.919> to<00:06:25.550> the<00:06:25.639> German

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
how about speed wise this was obviously

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.570 
how about speed wise this was obviously

you know today when you compare it to a

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:47.500 
you know today when you compare it to a
car<00:06:45.500> with<00:06:45.669> 560<00:06:46.669> horsepower<00:06:46.699> doesn't<00:06:47.360> seem
