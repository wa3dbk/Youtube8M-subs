00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.570
 to have a shipyard in the wake 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.809
 effective secrets there a step 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.570
 necessarily by not planning 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.480
 just in our head but written with 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.849
 all the little irritating elements 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.490
 ie if lack of manpower 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.170
 the game plan I have the 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.650
 form and if there is a need for training 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.849
 Before the control must be maintained 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.430
 of machinery it is all done 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:37.040
 of progress January February March April 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.600
 in May we are already too late we are planning 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.070
 what we have as both because we 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.850
 names the spurs if the volume 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.739
 needs 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.070
 we do not order yards what does it matter 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.629
 close as energy that's a bit of a 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.239
 flyby in support who would like 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.300
 change his job site me what I him 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.239
 propose it's dallas the training that 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.649
 gave it with your readers and the 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.570
 management then my management advisor 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.840
 approached me would he be interested 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.229
 to approach construction planning peace 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.490
 of the school loïc okon followed for with 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.789
 ballack tons forage harvest 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.869
 quickly and well challenged us 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:16.640
 to look at our strengths and our 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.929
 weak points in that court well 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.450
 at the same time we can exchange with 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.700
 other producers in room we went 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.819
 overview that in our side the transport 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.080
 and peace we were extremely give to the 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.690
 transport level I had a 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.429
 Current training ball for the 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.289
 silage yards it turned me on that 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:34.640
 I had a problem of organization of 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.869
 site that I optimize your 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.220
 husband school 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.709
 the first thing I did for 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.929
 improve my yard if I improved 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:43.610
 my farm path I put the daub 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.860
 on two pairs to size today 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.289
 we are the name of a box on time 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.149
 the general idea inside the 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.440
 planning school site it's 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.849
 to maintain a rhythm of work 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.179
 constant all day during the 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:01.459
 milking it's a it's really the last 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.720
 which causes more problems in good 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.250
 cases it is not necessary that the machine does not 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.360
 is stopped at the time of the processes 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.489
 owners of the farm one is 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.349
 usually two times too high 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:12.530
 to replace the dinner hours of 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:15.170
 things like that in our case the 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.209
 the raids are are less problematic 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.680
 a little we have an employee and then I got my 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.420
 sister who is in charge higher level 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.200
 traitors since 80 I have the same 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.220
 team for four years then it makes 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.980
 so that the person 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.650
 although recognized his work and then the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.900
 person who made who knows 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.540
 Dogs twelve years with that 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.470
 had as problem it was the hand 2 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.660
 there is no skilled labor 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.520
 available so much then we need 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.739
 of a punctual labor 5th 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.300
 reorganize in gold auchan tiff it has us 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.730
 allowed to save this system is double 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.709
 an efficient harvesting yard is 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.170
 succeed with our faith in a 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.840
 best possible delay for the 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.880
 quality of the plant is the optimum one 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.239
 begins to approach in the morning towards eight 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.650
 nine o'clock youth info normally a 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.160
 twenty hectares which takes little 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.860
 nearly wrecked started at 8 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.819
 hours in the morning normally at 8 o'clock 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.890
 the evening 9 to the ground completely mow 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.959
 of the 160th are broke not now 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.570
 before it took almost said joe farley 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.120
 the first cut to be made of the day to 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.239
 2 years of experience in construction sites 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.850
 of a single agent realizes that if the end 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.739
 was just just 24 hours that's 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.959
 possible to make their wake of 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.030
 first shot a day often or 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.220
 have the reflex to say if the weather is nice 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.190
 I 'm going to have a nice harvest if he 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.910
 makes less moves finally the least beautiful 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.860
 but 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.830
 the challenge is to thwart this weather 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.840
 water makes it pass yards a 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.200
 day to 6 convention that was 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.550
 this year on precisely three days 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.550
 yes the quality of the fodder and danced 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.920
 on a humidity we are not bad anymore 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.380
 constant us the communication there is 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.270
 many people have to make sure 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.540
 is it by cell by 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.640
 sybille radio broadcasting false except not 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.280
 already already planned for not 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.680
 waste time if there is a 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.600
 problematic that occurs at the point where 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.390
 if it's planning level because 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.820
 that of a lot of related work or 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.919
 baked r when a poet anton manure 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.079
 like me I'm put it's in forfeit 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:26.570
 or I call my chair even I'm going 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:29.790
 the cash flow call today tomorrow 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.240
 in two days the songs klingnau you 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.669
 can come 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.130
 super tender with manures are 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.140
 stretches all of a sudden when you're doing 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.720
 first cut in a construction site 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.220
 the second beta school these loans for 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.050
 put everything at the same time 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.880
 site planning in that 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.180
 enjoy the first year come in this 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:53.070
 sad because we feel we are getting out of 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:56.580
 the comfort zone but now that 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.830
 does 12 years is like 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.460
 it's done alone or much less 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:05.009
 stressed these two focus holdings in 60 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.050
 years and need to film in 25 years that 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.629
 fo would do the best advice i 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.639
 could give to choose to go 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:13.139
 to the big change it's sure it's 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.300
 to talk to people who are 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.069
 competent who have already done it is 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.659
 to go and see a producer who actually 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:21.050
 where there is surely one in each of 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:21.050
 regions of québec
