looks really nice can you tell me about

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.320 
looks really nice can you tell me about
the<00:02:18.680> camera<00:02:19.220> technology<00:02:19.520> that<00:02:19.880> you<00:02:19.970> use<00:02:20.090> on

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
the camera technology that you use on

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.050 
the camera technology that you use on
the<00:02:20.600> experience<00:02:21.470> me<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.310> XPS<00:02:22.700> he<00:02:22.850> has<00:02:23.030> a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
the experience me so the XPS he has a

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.860 
the experience me so the XPS he has a
13-megapixel<00:02:23.540> camera<00:02:24.459> so<00:02:25.459> you<00:02:25.520> can<00:02:25.580> see<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:26.090> it

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
13-megapixel camera so you can see it it

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.160 
13-megapixel camera so you can see it it
offers<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.440> best<00:02:28.370> of<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:29.570> firm<00:02:29.750> on<00:02:30.050> the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
offers the best of the firm on the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.740 
offers the best of the firm on the
current<00:02:30.470> comment<00:02:31.280> technologies<00:02:31.640> right<00:02:32.150> so

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
current comment technologies right so

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.360 
current comment technologies right so
what<00:02:32.990> like<00:02:33.110> I'd<00:02:33.680> like<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:33.950> highlight<00:02:34.100> this<00:02:34.310> a

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
what like I'd like to highlight this a

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.210 
what like I'd like to highlight this a
superior<00:02:35.209> auto<00:02:35.450> mode<00:02:35.780> where<00:02:36.080> several<00:02:36.320> modes

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
superior auto mode where several modes

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.310 
superior auto mode where several modes
that<00:02:37.400> are<00:02:37.580> available<00:02:37.700> on<00:02:38.090> XP<00:02:38.390> SZ<00:02:38.660> so<00:02:39.050> it's<00:02:39.170> like

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
that are available on XP SZ so it's like

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.470 
that are available on XP SZ so it's like
a<00:02:39.350> digital<00:02:40.190> point<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.580> shoot<00:02:40.730> news<00:02:41.030> with<00:02:41.330> the

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
a digital point and shoot news with the

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.930 
a digital point and shoot news with the
most<00:02:41.510> superior<00:02:42.380> auto<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:43.280> will<00:02:43.489> simply<00:02:43.820> be

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
most superior auto it will simply be

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.930 
most superior auto it will simply be
able<00:02:44.239> to<00:02:44.360> detect<00:02:44.959> what<00:02:45.800> sort<00:02:46.070> of<00:02:46.190> you<00:02:46.670> can<00:02:46.790> see

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
able to detect what sort of you can see

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.630 
able to detect what sort of you can see
a<00:02:46.970> small<00:02:47.180> icon<00:02:47.660> so<00:02:48.380> whether<00:02:48.590> it's<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:48.890> macro<00:02:49.370> if

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
a small icon so whether it's a macro if

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.690 
a small icon so whether it's a macro if
you're<00:02:49.850> moving<00:02:50.300> movement<00:02:51.170> so<00:02:51.680> if<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.400> want<00:02:52.580> to

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
you're moving movement so if you want to

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.600 
you're moving movement so if you want to
keep<00:02:52.850> digital<00:02:53.690> imaging<00:02:54.080> quite<00:02:54.680> simple<00:02:55.130> so

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
keep digital imaging quite simple so

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.990 
keep digital imaging quite simple so
return<00:02:55.940> on<00:02:56.290> superior<00:02:57.290> auto<00:02:57.790> there<00:02:58.790> are<00:02:58.880> other

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
return on superior auto there are other

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.570 
return on superior auto there are other
two<00:02:59.570> other<00:02:59.930> technologies<00:03:00.650> such<00:03:01.130> as<00:03:01.160> unlimited

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
two other technologies such as unlimited

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.860 
two other technologies such as unlimited
versa<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:04.790> experience<00:03:05.239> he<00:03:05.330> actually<00:03:05.510> you

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
versa so the experience he actually you

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.200 
versa so the experience he actually you
can<00:03:06.080> take

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.330 

there's<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.900> British<00:03:10.320> shot<00:03:10.560> first<00:03:10.860> shot<00:03:11.130> but

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
there's a British shot first shot but

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.750 
there's a British shot first shot but
it's<00:03:11.460> a<00:03:11.610> very<00:03:11.640> practical<00:03:13.400> seated<00:03:14.400> it<00:03:14.490> really

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
it's a very practical seated it really

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.840 
it's a very practical seated it really
unlimited<00:03:15.620> unlimited<00:03:16.620> so<00:03:17.130> I<00:03:17.190> can<00:03:17.340> hear<00:03:17.520> you

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850

went<00:03:18.210> up<00:03:18.330> to<00:03:18.480> about<00:03:18.750> 170<00:03:19.680> m<00:03:20.100> that's<00:03:20.790> all<00:03:20.940> I

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
went up to about 170 m that's all I

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.030 
went up to about 170 m that's all I
think<00:03:21.210> that<00:03:21.330> will<00:03:21.660> be<00:03:21.720> enough<00:03:21.810> for<00:03:22.230> her<00:03:22.410> for<00:03:22.980> a

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
think that will be enough for her for a

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.550 
think that will be enough for her for a

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
capacity can hold it you can use that

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.140 
capacity can hold it you can use that
British<00:03:28.080> up<00:03:28.230> for<00:03:28.710> unlimited<00:03:28.830> right<00:03:29.430> right<00:03:29.820> so

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
British up for unlimited right right so

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.240 
British up for unlimited right right so
this<00:03:30.540> is<00:03:30.720> a<00:03:30.750> very<00:03:30.930> promising<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.650> phone

the<00:04:06.750> device<00:04:07.140> right<00:04:07.590> basically<00:04:07.950> drop<00:04:08.940> it

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
the device right basically drop it

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.020 
the device right basically drop it
somewhere<00:04:09.320> where<00:04:10.320> it<00:04:10.410> gets<00:04:10.530> if<00:04:11.370> it<00:04:11.520> rains<00:04:11.730> or

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
somewhere where it gets if it rains or
