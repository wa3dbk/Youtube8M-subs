00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:12.379
 very good today the edge of a knot of the 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.020
 category of gauze knots and 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:18.500
 objective of this knot is to leave two glasses 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.070
 firm, non- sliding at the end of the 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.020
 rope so we can use it as 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.810
 harness to hoist someone in this case 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.630
 we would put our arms 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.070
 by the two glasses or paralyze us 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.960
 sustaining us in a way 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:38.120
 momentary since the rope is not what 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.309
 more apt to make a harness but we 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.210
 would serve to lower warn us to some 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.890
 Spanish site is the joy 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.180
 then as we would do we are going to double 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.540
 rope 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.840
 so that we stay like that a curve 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.770
 at the end and we're going to come back 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.980
 that we stay like this 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.180
 the curve below and the two extremes 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.089
 up together 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.080
 once we have this way we are going to 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.020
 throw us from the bottom up 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.900
 the two so that they follow us 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.930
 leaving our two loops up 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.470
 and the curve is below 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.680
 let's catch 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.050
 from our left and we are going to put it 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.440
 from bottom to top by our 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.200
 right 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.230
 in agreement already they cross us we have them 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.660
 here now the only thing we are going to do 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.260
 to finish this knot is to take a 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.720
 loop and bring us the and catch the rope 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.070
 this we have here and take the other 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.159
 loop 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.180
 bring it and catch the other rope so 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.180
 that when we stretch 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.040
 we are happy our Spain 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.440
 this is made for the tutorial and is a 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.860
 little bit at the moment 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.500
 we had to do it shovel 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.140
 how to use it we should do 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.020
 the two glasses of the ends pretty 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.830
 bigger here we have the guide ace 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.830
 Spanish
