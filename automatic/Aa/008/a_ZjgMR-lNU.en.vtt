00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.449
 splash song so a song to the splash 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.859
 and that we go through the whole tent 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.189
 That was the right money for everyone 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.630
 case so the people are totally open and 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.570
 funny on it and you know you can watch 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.280
 move freely and he has just great 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.930
 this is so what we have so so 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.320
 I have presented you very relaxed 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.430
 air then also borders here 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.100
 the people and the blue club and that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.070
 Magdeburg Herrmann I own now so 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.890
 I was so now so there are people 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.059
 of course, by turning upward and 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:59.879
 said they do not recognize me first 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:01:00.870
 because these three hours then became 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.339
 Let's go 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.710
 january or is that me now? 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.840
 otherwise I heard you had 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.159
 so far already that it already seven 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.259
 songs ready is a new album 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:21.060
 I want to sit now or now so 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.979
 I have 80 80 songs but I have 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.009
 broadcast coming 15 because are still a 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.829
 Classics and that's a very, very, very 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.540
 very strong album really promise 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.770
 I have a lot of effort 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.030
 I continued right after 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.770
 my album i have not killed me 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.060
 I did not boo in the picture 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.549
 or something I have right next 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.900
 I practiced my floss on 1 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.710
 So I just kept on rapping 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.899
 and then that's through one 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.640
 development sometimes because someone 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.560
 already gave a lot and my manager 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.040
 that's when we made the shots 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.540
 who also has common active 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.869
 very blatant and who was back at the start 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.790
 the really as possible they have a lot 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.900
 a lot of pressure and power and I hope that 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.450
 we are already like me 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.909
 Imagine me on that number 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.020
 in the place in his place can do 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.750
 in the charts just like me 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.090
 imagine it has of course always 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.310
 the single days that have been going on since 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.600
 23 years or so but it is if you 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.260
 so I have not been able to 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.180
 much expected champion 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.630
 I will deliver the best and then 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.120
 always existed yes and with the album for 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.250
 example, just because I have also aware 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.720
 that it went down sharply before that 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.430
 was left a few months ahead and 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.670
 then I listened to how many albums 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.260
 from artists and thought okay me 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.970
 some more times sometimes thought that me 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.130
 that is a lot more different 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.080
 That was not that was not the case 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.910
 So you heard with a lot of ground 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.050
 and honestly said it was good and stuff 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.510
 tropp course is with the German 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:51.720
 market out but the 1 0 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.220
 what it is it was what to pick so 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.900
 my opinion the head where I this 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.709
 Everyone has heard that I am there 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.500
 there is still a lot missing in most 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.340
 Albums you are listening to are already there 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.930
 goes a lot more 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.780
 I do not think that's easy 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.780
 only at 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.940
 the voice of how god made me 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.800
 so white has me should he has me 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.060
 I just do not know what was not one 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.470
 But little child I also one is 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.610
 also worked and what it is 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.970
 just so that I have now 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.450
 more music was made with 26 than with 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.870
 16 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.550
 and what is a mind just the 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.850
 Discipline and always that dream those 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:32.130
 In your head you have a twelve years with 12 to 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.630
 and so that 26 is standing and 16 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.280
 bushido see how they occurred 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.510
 the second so this this sheet metal time 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.130
 so for me it 's all about thought 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.200
 nevertheless that I know mine and if 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.620
 I now think so myself I am 19 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.790
 Clock yes in one and a half hours 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.489
 I am about myself on the splash 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.560
 then I think I think so 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.600
 nothing I just do I forget 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.930
 that it was a dream it was a time 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.630
 but you just have to go through it now 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.209
 and he 's serious about that 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.630
 discipline like a man is a job it 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.040
 is my work and become discipline 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.959
 and aggressiveness 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.910
 that means that you just stop for example 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.549
 sometimes 80 songs take on only 15 at a time 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.049
 you just need to get out there and if 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.160
 you have in appearance then you prepare 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.560
 then you need it 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.120
 but were constitutionally agreed were 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.320
 If it is then for example two months 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.789
 Hot again with sap for free for free 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.960
 will make this factory is a rapper 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.539
 the free does not bring in yet 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.820
 Germany NaturstÃ¤tten was nature stands 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:39.250

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.020
 reform everyone and I am very happy 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:52.740
 Much on that together 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:52.740
 stage or there is the yes exactly 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.250
 or was a great interview or can you 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.960
 I look at each one again 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.380
 case gives you that but I apologize 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.380
 me already 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.900
 what is going on here each separately 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.230

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.310
 on the gate itself not yet determined 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.530
 not considered at all 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:26.170
 the excuse I still do not know 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.400
 nice but that's it 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.200
 if such statements of rappers then 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.340
 you know that it is an excuse but 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.860
