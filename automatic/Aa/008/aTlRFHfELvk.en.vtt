00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
you need to do one entry equals one app

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.810 
you need to do one entry equals one app
so<00:00:33.150> all<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.360> do<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.840> be<00:00:34.230> enter<00:00:34.650> is<00:00:34.890> use<00:00:35.370> my<00:00:35.550> coat

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
so all you do to be enter is use my coat

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.330 
so all you do to be enter is use my coat
and<00:00:36.030> download<00:00:36.600> one<00:00:36.900> app<00:00:37.140> anyways<00:00:37.980> let's<00:00:38.010> get

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
and download one app anyways let's get

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.760 
and download one app anyways let's get
on<00:00:38.430> with<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.850> video<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.570> looks<00:00:39.750> like<00:00:39.870> drive
