this bike in particular one of the
things<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:48.000> tried<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.420> do<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.719> get<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
things that we I tried to do is get the

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.750 
things that we I tried to do is get the
get<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.840> bike<00:00:52.079> back<00:00:52.289> narrow<00:00:52.680> again<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
get the bike back narrow again in the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.750 
get the bike back narrow again in the
back<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.840> motor<00:00:55.020> looked

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
back so that the motor looked

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
back so that the motor looked
proportionately<00:00:56.760> bigger<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.390> know<00:00:57.480> looks

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
proportionately bigger you know looks

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.830 
proportionately bigger you know looks
big<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.230> frame<00:00:59.030> over<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.390> years<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.780> think

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
big in the frame over the years I think

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.520 
big in the frame over the years I think
soft<00:01:01.260> tails<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.710> grown<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.030> point<00:01:03.300> where

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
soft tails have grown to the point where

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.750 
soft tails have grown to the point where
everything<00:01:04.530> else<00:01:04.619> got<00:01:04.890> big<00:01:05.159> around<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.549> motor

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
everything else got big around the motor

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.420 
everything else got big around the motor
but<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.210> motor<00:01:06.600> stayed<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.049> same<00:01:07.080> size<00:01:07.500> with

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
but the motor stayed the same size with

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.670 
but the motor stayed the same size with
this<00:01:08.580> bike<00:01:08.820> I'm<00:01:09.000> trying<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.479> really<00:01:10.290> look<00:01:10.439> back

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
this bike I'm trying to really look back

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.820 
this bike I'm trying to really look back
at<00:01:10.920> historical<00:01:11.460> bikes<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.970> tie<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:13.710> know

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
at historical bikes and tie you know

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.620 
at historical bikes and tie you know
that<00:01:14.040> try<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.460> get<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.760> proportion<00:01:15.330> back

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
that try to get that proportion back

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.570 
that try to get that proportion back
dialed<00:01:16.140> into<00:01:16.290> where<00:01:16.530> they<00:01:16.650> were<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.460> know

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
dialed into where they were in you know

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.910 
dialed into where they were in you know
the<00:01:17.729> 40s<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.150> 50s<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.750> you'll<00:01:19.320> see<00:01:19.530> retro

the 40s and 50s and you'll see retro
cues<00:01:20.250> throughout<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.820> bike<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.890> tie<00:01:22.890> it

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
cues throughout the bike that tie it

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.300 
cues throughout the bike that tie it
back<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.549> era<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:24.750> one<00:01:25.020> was<00:01:25.860> being<00:01:26.100> this

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
back to that era for one was being this

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.440 
back to that era for one was being this
kind<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:27.320> handlebar<00:01:28.320> with<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.500> crossbar<00:01:29.450> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
kind of handlebar with a crossbar the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.810 
kind of handlebar with a crossbar the
early<00:01:30.720> harley's<00:01:31.110> they<00:01:31.320> were<00:01:31.380> called

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
early harley's they were called

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.859 
early harley's they were called
Hollywood<00:01:32.820> handlebars<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.659> was<00:01:33.780> an

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
Hollywood handlebars and that was an

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.450 
Hollywood handlebars and that was an
aftermarket<00:01:34.259> bar<00:01:34.619> I'm<00:01:34.829> not<00:01:35.009> really<00:01:35.130> too<00:01:35.430> sure

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
aftermarket bar I'm not really too sure

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.420 
aftermarket bar I'm not really too sure
on<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> whole<00:01:36.150> history<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:37.130> think<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.340> was

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
on the whole history but I think it was

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.490 
on the whole history but I think it was
a<00:01:38.490> bar<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.090> allowed<00:01:39.689> people<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.110> put

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
a bar that allowed people to put

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.770 
a bar that allowed people to put
accessories<00:01:41.250> attach<00:01:41.579> accessories<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.600> a

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
accessories attach accessories to it a

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.289 
accessories attach accessories to it a
lot<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.560> early<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.460> know<00:01:44.549> police<00:01:44.880> bikes

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
lot of the early you know police bikes

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.490 
lot of the early you know police bikes
and<00:01:45.570> stuff<00:01:45.689> like<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.990> they'd<00:01:46.170> attached

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
and stuff like that they'd attached

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.899 
and stuff like that they'd attached
lights<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.130> different<00:01:47.340> types<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.670> things

lights and different types of things

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.889 
lights and different types of things
like<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:49.369> crossbar<00:01:50.369> was<00:01:50.670> basically<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
like that crossbar was basically the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.679 
like that crossbar was basically the
same<00:01:52.140> diameter<00:01:52.560> as<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:53.040> bar<00:01:53.310> which<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.420> this

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
same diameter as this bar which on this

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.550 
same diameter as this bar which on this
one<00:01:54.950> was<00:01:55.950> inspired<00:01:56.100> by<00:01:56.610> more<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.570> dirt
