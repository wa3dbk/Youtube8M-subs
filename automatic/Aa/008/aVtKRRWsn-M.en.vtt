I'm not a hundred cent sure now but
either<00:04:48.850> way<00:04:49.090> I'm<00:04:49.360> not<00:04:49.509> exactly<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:50.259> one<00:04:50.410> for

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
either way I'm not exactly the one for

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.950 
either way I'm not exactly the one for
abortion<00:04:51.070> either<00:04:51.220> I<00:04:51.340> really<00:04:51.910> don't<00:04:52.090> like<00:04:52.690> the

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
abortion either I really don't like the

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.320 
abortion either I really don't like the
idea<00:04:53.110> of<00:04:53.350> abortion<00:04:53.560> but<00:04:53.949> that<00:04:54.789> is<00:04:55.000> another

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
idea of abortion but that is another

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.060 
idea of abortion but that is another
topic<00:04:55.720> and<00:04:56.110> I<00:04:56.199> don't<00:04:56.259> even<00:04:56.560> want<00:04:56.770> to<00:04:56.800> get<00:04:56.949> into

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
topic and I don't even want to get into

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.650 
topic and I don't even want to get into
that<00:04:57.250> because<00:04:57.370> that<00:04:57.580> is<00:04:57.669> a<00:04:57.699> debate<00:04:58.210> on<00:04:58.419> its<00:04:58.539> own

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
that because that is a debate on its own

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.860 
that because that is a debate on its own
but<00:04:59.500> the<00:04:59.889> point<00:05:00.100> here<00:05:00.190> is<00:05:00.600> they<00:05:01.600> shouldn't

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
but the point here is they shouldn't

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.340 
but the point here is they shouldn't
have<00:05:01.960> a<00:05:02.050> say

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
have a say

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.159 
have a say
his<00:05:02.740> parents<00:05:03.100> should<00:05:03.250> not<00:05:03.370> have<00:05:03.520> a<00:05:03.550> say<00:05:03.850> on<00:05:04.169> the

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
his parents should not have a say on the

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:06.870 
his parents should not have a say on the
whole<00:05:05.680> boarding<00:05:06.039> thing<00:05:06.220> honestly<00:05:06.370> the<00:05:06.669> only

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
whole boarding thing honestly the only

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.060 
whole boarding thing honestly the only
person<00:05:07.389> or<00:05:07.630> people<00:05:07.990> that<00:05:08.320> should<00:05:08.650> have<00:05:08.680> a<00:05:08.830> say

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
person or people that should have a say

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.990 
person or people that should have a say
on<00:05:09.310> this<00:05:09.550> is<00:05:09.729> you<00:05:10.360> and<00:05:10.660> your<00:05:11.560> husband<00:05:12.100> and<00:05:12.370> that

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
on this is you and your husband and that

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.610 
on this is you and your husband and that
is<00:05:13.330> that<00:05:13.630> it's<00:05:14.440> no<00:05:14.650> one<00:05:14.800> else's<00:05:15.100> business<00:05:15.370> and

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
is that it's no one else's business and

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.310 
is that it's no one else's business and
again<00:05:17.620> you<00:05:18.460> guys<00:05:18.669> are<00:05:18.729> adults<00:05:19.210> you're<00:05:20.139> not

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
again you guys are adults you're not

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.310 
again you guys are adults you're not
kids<00:05:20.680> they<00:05:21.550> don't<00:05:21.699> I<00:05:21.910> don't<00:05:21.970> think<00:05:22.199> they<00:05:23.199> have

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
kids they don't I don't think they have

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.100 
kids they don't I don't think they have
custody<00:05:23.889> over<00:05:24.130> you<00:05:24.220> anymore<00:05:24.490> since<00:05:25.360> you're<00:05:25.660> 19

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
custody over you anymore since you're 19

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.900 
custody over you anymore since you're 19
I<00:05:26.440> think<00:05:26.919> I<00:05:27.039> think<00:05:27.250> that's<00:05:27.370> how<00:05:27.460> that<00:05:27.490> works

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
I think I think that's how that works

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.990 
I think I think that's how that works
but<00:05:28.599> either<00:05:28.810> way<00:05:29.220> when<00:05:30.220> it<00:05:30.310> comes<00:05:30.340> down<00:05:30.610> to<00:05:30.669> it

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
but either way when it comes down to it

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.439 
but either way when it comes down to it
I<00:05:31.750> really<00:05:32.560> don't<00:05:32.740> think<00:05:32.830> you<00:05:33.370> should<00:05:33.580> let<00:05:33.789> his

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:34.449 
I really don't think you should let his

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:36.930
