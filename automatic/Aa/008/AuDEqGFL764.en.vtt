this is quite a linear map you have be

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.720 
this is quite a linear map you have be
as<00:00:33.180> always<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.230> reinmuth<00:00:34.680> into<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.010> map<00:00:35.190> and

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.889 

there's<00:00:38.730> various<00:00:39.000> ways<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.390> get<00:00:39.480> run<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.750> map

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
there's various ways to get run the map

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.540 
there's various ways to get run the map
you<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:40.140> go<00:00:40.320> around<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.649> outside<00:00:40.680> completely

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
you can go around the outside completely

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.040 
you can go around the outside completely
and<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.879> see<00:00:42.059> here<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.540> go<00:00:42.750> into<00:00:42.870> an

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
and you see here that I go into an

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.279 
and you see here that I go into an
elevator<00:00:43.290> which<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.980> can<00:00:44.219> use<00:00:44.629> I<00:00:45.629> think

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
elevator which you can use I think
