good<00:00:01.230> morning<00:00:01.620> folks<00:00:01.829> first<00:00:02.399> on<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.730> list

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
good morning folks first on the list

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.730 
good morning folks first on the list
today<00:00:03.060> is<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.330> satellite<00:00:03.750> anomaly<00:00:04.380> faintly

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
today is a satellite anomaly faintly

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.410 
today is a satellite anomaly faintly
entering<00:00:05.160> from<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.490> left<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:05.879> heading<00:00:06.210> right

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
entering from the left and heading right

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.049 
entering from the left and heading right
I<00:00:06.660> don't<00:00:07.290> recognize<00:00:07.770> this<00:00:07.980> anomaly<00:00:08.490> on<00:00:08.519> stereo

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
I don't recognize this anomaly on stereo

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.970 
I don't recognize this anomaly on stereo
a<00:00:09.120> core<00:00:09.599> two<00:00:09.780> but<00:00:09.990> there<00:00:10.139> are<00:00:10.290> some<00:00:10.530> things<00:00:10.740> we

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
a core two but there are some things we

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.610 
a core two but there are some things we
can<00:00:11.190> tell<00:00:11.429> first<00:00:11.849> earth<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.960> off<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.410> left

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
can tell first earth is off to the left

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.039 
can tell first earth is off to the left
so<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.160> not<00:00:14.429> coming<00:00:14.820> at<00:00:15.030> us<00:00:15.179> it's<00:00:15.839> not

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
so this is not coming at us it's not

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.900 
so this is not coming at us it's not
visible<00:00:16.350> via<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.859> naked<00:00:17.190> eye<00:00:17.310> or<00:00:17.340> binoculars

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
visible via the naked eye or binoculars

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.599 
visible via the naked eye or binoculars
it's<00:00:18.840> not<00:00:18.990> visible<00:00:19.529> on<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.710> other<00:00:20.010> stereo

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
it's not visible on the other stereo

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.150 
it's not visible on the other stereo
stereo<00:00:21.000> B<00:00:21.390> or<00:00:21.630> looking<00:00:22.050> from<00:00:22.289> Earth<00:00:22.500> with<00:00:22.740> Soho

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
stereo B or looking from Earth with Soho

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.519 
stereo B or looking from Earth with Soho
so<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.490> massive<00:00:23.970> size<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.480> likely<00:00:25.230> just<00:00:25.380> a

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
so the massive size is likely just a

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.470 
so the massive size is likely just a
perception<00:00:26.189> effect<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.760> something<00:00:27.119> traveling

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
perception effect of something traveling

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.419 
perception effect of something traveling
right<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.080> front<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.500> satellites<00:00:28.949> camera

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
right in front of the satellites camera

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.730 
right in front of the satellites camera
my<00:00:29.970> best<00:00:30.210> guess<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.689> it's<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.990> tiny<00:00:31.230> comet

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
my best guess is that it's a tiny comet

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.799 
my best guess is that it's a tiny comet
but<00:00:32.250> we<00:00:32.340> won't<00:00:32.550> have<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.759> wait<00:00:33.059> long<00:00:33.120> as<00:00:33.690> you

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
but we won't have to wait long as you

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:34.810 
but we won't have to wait long as you
can<00:00:33.960> see<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.290> difference<00:00:34.649> between

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
can see the difference between

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.979 
can see the difference between
pre-processed<00:00:35.820> images<00:00:36.300> which<00:00:36.540> are<00:00:36.630> always

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
pre-processed images which are always

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.200 
pre-processed images which are always
blurry<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:38.070> processed<00:00:38.550> ones<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.030> come

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
blurry and the processed ones that come

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.119 
blurry and the processed ones that come
later<00:00:39.450> we've<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.110> got<00:00:40.350> another<00:00:40.710> day<00:00:40.950> or<00:00:41.100> two

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
later we've just got another day or two

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.700 
later we've just got another day or two
to<00:00:41.370> wait<00:00:41.520> for<00:00:41.730> these<00:00:41.850> images<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.420> full<00:00:42.710> cracks

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
to wait for these images in full cracks

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.200
