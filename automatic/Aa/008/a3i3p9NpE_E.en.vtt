00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:22.110
 the poster that is living we have 50 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.520
 more and then at the exit we will distribute to 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.130
 see if it reaches all of you who are 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.890
 here the first novelty and very important 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.750
 we have made a new website we are 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.920
 still working on it but it's already 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.140
 operational you can enter it is about the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.760
 up between the PWG dotcom though 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.220
 we also maintain the great domain 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.320
 tribute is through the two mobile 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.739
 central we think it is one more web 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.660
 intuitive more beautiful to say it of 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.239
 some way and that you find better 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.370
 all the necessary information is 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.129
 operational from now on 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.050
 well, this is the fifth edition of the 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.620
 Grand Canal Peñalara 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.920
 we maintain the distance and the 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.920
 level 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.800
 the same seriousness navacerrada 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.800
 we advance half an hour the exit 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.650
 because I think there were many people who 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.090
 he asked us to advance more, not what 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.910
 we want to adapt because I believe that the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.920
 magic of the night is very important 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.430
 he liked everything quite and we do not want 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.800
 adapt it and go out at night to 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:34.450
 face malicious 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.340
 we keep all the 30 hours of the limit 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.380
 as you will have seen many apart from the 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.030
 three points that they give us that they give you for 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.530
 participate and finish to be able to 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.050
 enroll them 03 of no great this year 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.400
 they have chosen us as a chain 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.730
 qualifying for the western stage of 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.100
 USA 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.670
 for us it is quite important not 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:04.680
 I know if any of you 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.320
 venture but if you want the 2014 then 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.830
 you will know that if you finish it in less than 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:16.010
 22 hours to finish it less than 22 hours 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.010
 you can opt for the draw in the western 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.930
 and this is the route that looks like a 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.629
 maple leaf 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.269
 with departure in navacerrada the points of 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:29.469
 I always sing cochino san blas morcuera 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.609
 rascafría burst marked orange 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:34.790
 navacerrada fuenfría 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:36.709
 cerdá we have not varied we have not varied 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.450
 but even so, I'll explain where 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.260
 come on we have made a small variation 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:46.799
 that does not affect the mileage 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.799
 here you have the profile scares a little 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.330
 what is the variation then in the expected 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.820
 we get to both with but by the 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.460
 normal travel and instead of going up 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.910
 the highway and go to the hill the 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.460
 dehesilla 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.450
 let's attack directly to the great 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:07.769
 shit on the way up to the wilderness 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.230
 it's a much more vertical rise than 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.360
 shorter and once we get to the 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.150
 great canada will allow us more 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.340
 amplitude to be able to overtake and with 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.830
 spectacular night views of 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.080
 manzanares el real and soto del real 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.019
 I think we're going to win a lot because 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.819
 also the descent of the dehesilla by the 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.260
 night 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.959
 it's quite problematic because although 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.180
 we will mark it very well are the stones 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.340
 hidden under the stones of the 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.799
 grass is very closed everything and then 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.750
 this is more open and being at night 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.870
 will come to all the best the 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.879
 mileage is the same does not vary 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.310
 even it has done a little less than 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.500
 unevenness although all of level is gained from 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.739
 hit nothing else until I choose 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.739
 China 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:59.060
 in terms of news for the gtp we are going 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.950
 to include a classification by clubs and 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.300
 we are going to give a trophy to the first crossing of 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.050
 side 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.150
 adding the times of the three best 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.830
 indistinctly if they are men or women 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.880
 the top three of each grade crossing 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.190
 add up points for the classification 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.709
 by clubs we also have a stroke 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.239
 special to side crossing with greater 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.220
 number of de finisher 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.590
 another novelty that is also welcome 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.840
 in the survey that some pretty 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.330
 stuffed, we are going to put a 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.449
 liquid provisioning in the descent of 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.479
 Peñalara to the farm nothing else happens 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.830
 you throw aranjuez where you enter the 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.479
 forest track that we can access there 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.539
 with vehicle let's go to a 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:45.090
 liquid supplies 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:50.449
 and another novelty so that there is not 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.449
 controversial backpack 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:58.670
 because the regulation was a bit ambiguous 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:59.930
 and the people because although louis 79 million 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.690
 I was carrying mandatory material 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.760
 because he called me on the phone and he told me 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.260
 Please, please, check everything 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.450
 I did not have money because there were some 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.370
 suspicious that they thought we were 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.780
 favoring the 7 then like 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.270
 we want there to be equality for 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.820
 we are all going to demand backpack or kidney 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.530
 age where all things fit 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.770
 was allowed and if in any of these 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.770
 luxurious
