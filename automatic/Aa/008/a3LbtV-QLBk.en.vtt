chrysler PT cruiser this cars got a
couple<00:00:08.760> of<00:00:08.849> engine<00:00:09.120> codes<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:10.130> i'm<00:00:11.130> actually

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
couple of engine codes and i'm actually

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.570 
couple of engine codes and i'm actually
going<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.639> be<00:00:12.590> making<00:00:13.590> different<00:00:14.099> videos<00:00:14.370> for

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
going to be making different videos for

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.129 
going to be making different videos for
each<00:00:14.639> engine<00:00:14.849> code<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.509> know<00:00:15.630> regarding<00:00:15.990> how

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
each engine code you know regarding how

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.400 
each engine code you know regarding how
to<00:00:16.199> diagnose<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.800> repair<00:00:17.730> those<00:00:17.910> but<00:00:18.779> uh<00:00:18.810> this

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
to diagnose and repair those but uh this

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.200 
to diagnose and repair those but uh this
video<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.800> going<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.010> be<00:00:20.130> for<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:21.109> p0<00:00:22.109> v<00:00:22.410> 1:7

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
video is going to be for the p0 v 1:7

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.700 
video is going to be for the p0 v 1:7
engine<00:00:24.210> code<00:00:24.390> which<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> battery

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
engine code which is a battery

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.939 
engine code which is a battery
temperature<00:00:27.170> sensor<00:00:28.170> circuit<00:00:28.710> too<00:00:29.460> high<00:00:29.810> okay

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
temperature sensor circuit too high okay

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.720 
temperature sensor circuit too high okay
apparently<00:00:31.949> these<00:00:32.070> cars<00:00:32.369> come<00:00:32.579> with<00:00:32.610> a

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
apparently these cars come with a

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.840 
apparently these cars come with a
battery<00:00:33.030> temperature<00:00:33.390> sensor<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.850> we're

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
battery temperature sensor so we're

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.700 
battery temperature sensor so we're
gonna<00:00:36.000> i've<00:00:36.750> never<00:00:37.050> done<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.380> before<00:00:37.500> but

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
gonna i've never done this before but

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.350 
gonna i've never done this before but
we're<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.129> go<00:00:38.280> try<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.850> find<00:00:39.149> that

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
we're going to go try to find that

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.729 
we're going to go try to find that
sensor<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.820> try<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.879> fix<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.480> okay<00:00:43.379> here's<00:00:43.620> our

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
sensor and try to fix it okay here's our

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.560 
sensor and try to fix it okay here's our
look<00:00:43.980> at<00:00:44.100> our<00:00:44.190> code<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> scanner<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.329> on

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
look at our code on the scanner and on

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.029 
look at our code on the scanner and on
the<00:00:45.690> scanner<00:00:45.960> as<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.260> can<00:00:46.410> see<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:46.829> as<00:00:47.010> a

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the scanner as you can see it's as a

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.430 
the scanner as you can see it's as a
battery<00:00:47.789> temp<00:00:48.120> temperature<00:00:48.750> circuit<00:00:49.230> high

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
battery temp temperature circuit high

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.010 
battery temp temperature circuit high
okay<00:00:50.190> okay<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.390> order<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.660> get<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.840> our

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
okay okay so in order to get to our

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.229 
okay okay so in order to get to our
battery<00:00:52.500> temperature<00:00:52.739> sensor<00:00:53.370> we're<00:00:53.940> going

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
battery temperature sensor we're going

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.189 
battery temperature sensor we're going
to<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.760> get<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.910> our<00:00:56.940> battery<00:00:57.329> well

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
to have to get to our battery well

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.180 
to have to get to our battery well
actually<00:00:58.289> get<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> tray<00:00:59.100> first<00:01:00.469> but<00:01:01.469> uh<00:01:01.500> yeah

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
actually get to a tray first but uh yeah

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.529 
actually get to a tray first but uh yeah

battery<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:27.070> our<00:02:27.250> battery<00:02:27.940> tray<00:02:34.950> there<00:02:35.950> we<00:02:36.040> go

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
battery to our battery tray there we go

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.949 
battery to our battery tray there we go
it's<00:02:36.730> piece<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:38.590> we<00:02:38.680> just<00:02:38.860> lift<00:02:39.100> our<00:02:39.280> battery

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
it's piece and we just lift our battery

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.090 
it's piece and we just lift our battery
here<00:02:40.959> okay<00:02:43.260> again<00:02:44.260> there<00:02:44.470> it<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:44.709> has<00:02:44.950> your

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
here okay again there it is has your

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.890 
here okay again there it is has your
battery<00:02:45.400> temperature<00:02:45.610> sensor<00:02:46.239> you<00:02:46.810> know

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
battery temperature sensor you know

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.170 
battery temperature sensor you know
actually<00:02:47.320> this<00:02:47.470> is<00:02:47.739> a<00:02:48.120> looks<00:02:49.120> really<00:02:49.420> dirty<00:02:49.570> so

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
actually this is a looks really dirty so

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.210 
actually this is a looks really dirty so
and<00:02:52.180> in<00:02:52.840> order<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.200> take<00:02:53.320> this<00:02:53.530> up<00:02:53.739> you're

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
and in order to take this up you're

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.280 
and in order to take this up you're
going<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.550> have<00:02:54.850> to<00:02:55.090> press<00:02:55.360> on<00:02:55.510> this<00:02:55.660> black<00:02:55.989> tab

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
going to have to press on this black tab

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.340 
going to have to press on this black tab
down<00:02:56.530> here<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:57.070> then<00:02:57.310> pull<00:02:57.670> it<00:02:57.760> out<00:02:58.350> also

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
down here and then pull it out also

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.140 
down here and then pull it out also
don't<00:02:59.709> let<00:02:59.830> this<00:03:00.010> fall<00:03:00.489> back<00:03:00.790> in<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.060> Hulk<00:03:01.239> is

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
don't let this fall back in the Hulk is

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.250 
don't let this fall back in the Hulk is
there<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.360> then<00:03:04.600> you<00:03:04.720> might<00:03:04.870> have<00:03:04.989> to<00:03:05.140> remove

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
there you then you might have to remove

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:12.030 
there you then you might have to remove
this<00:03:07.170> this<00:03:08.170> tray<00:03:08.470> but<00:03:09.220> anyway<00:03:10.829> this<00:03:11.829> thing

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
this this tray but anyway this thing

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.280 
this this tray but anyway this thing
looks<00:03:12.250> dirty<00:03:12.519> that<00:03:13.360> connector<00:03:13.840> looks<00:03:13.989> dirty

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
looks dirty that connector looks dirty

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.830 
looks dirty that connector looks dirty
so<00:03:14.709> I'm<00:03:14.860> going<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.100> I'm<00:03:16.090> actually<00:03:16.480> going<00:03:16.780> to

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
so I'm going to I'm actually going to

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.770 
so I'm going to I'm actually going to
first<00:03:17.110> clean<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.590> then<00:03:17.980> go<00:03:18.130> for<00:03:18.340> a<00:03:18.370> test<00:03:18.610> drive

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
first clean it then go for a test drive

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.430 
first clean it then go for a test drive
especially<00:03:19.780> since<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:22.630> code<00:03:22.900> comes<00:03:23.260> back

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
especially since the the code comes back

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.190 
especially since the the code comes back
as<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.620> pending<00:03:24.040> code<00:03:24.220> like<00:03:24.519> real<00:03:24.730> quick<00:03:24.910> so<00:03:25.810> you

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
as a pending code like real quick so you

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.380 
as a pending code like real quick so you
know<00:03:26.890> you<00:03:26.950> can<00:03:27.130> always<00:03:27.280> try<00:03:27.670> cleaning<00:03:28.180> it

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
know you can always try cleaning it

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.860 
know you can always try cleaning it
first<00:03:28.860> then<00:03:29.860> resetting<00:03:30.730> your<00:03:30.910> computer<00:03:31.510> then

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
first then resetting your computer then

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.199 
first then resetting your computer then
go<00:03:32.019> for<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.230> test<00:03:32.440> drive<00:03:32.530> see<00:03:33.060> well<00:03:34.060> actually

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
go for a test drive see well actually

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.580 
go for a test drive see well actually
it's<00:03:34.420> a<00:03:34.450> good<00:03:34.570> idea<00:03:34.630> to<00:03:34.870> first<00:03:35.019> measure<00:03:35.320> how

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
it's a good idea to first measure how

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.350 
it's a good idea to first measure how
how<00:03:35.920> long<00:03:36.130> it<00:03:36.250> takes<00:03:36.459> for<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.820> code<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.180> come

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
how long it takes for the code to come

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.300 
how long it takes for the code to come
back<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:37.780> you<00:03:37.840> reset<00:03:38.230> it<00:03:38.320> one<00:03:38.739> time<00:03:38.950> and<00:03:39.220> then

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
back so you reset it one time and then

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.160 
back so you reset it one time and then
wait<00:03:39.519> how<00:03:39.670> long<00:03:39.700> comes<00:03:40.120> back<00:03:40.329> and<00:03:40.870> then<00:03:41.019> may

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
wait how long comes back and then may

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.170 
wait how long comes back and then may
you<00:03:41.230> clean<00:03:41.650> this<00:03:41.799> and<00:03:42.040> put<00:03:42.160> it<00:03:42.250> back<00:03:42.370> then<00:03:42.640> then

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
you clean this and put it back then then

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.340 
you clean this and put it back then then
you<00:03:43.299> know<00:03:43.420> how<00:03:43.600> long<00:03:43.720> you<00:03:43.810> have<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:44.019> drive<00:03:44.230> it

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
you know how long you have to drive it

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.170 
you know how long you have to drive it
for<00:03:44.380> it<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.709> see<00:03:44.860> if<00:03:44.950> it<00:03:45.070> worked<00:03:45.310> if<00:03:45.519> it<00:03:45.700> was<00:03:45.880> the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
for it to see if it worked if it was the

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.319 
for it to see if it worked if it was the
fix<00:03:46.390> or<00:03:46.540> not<00:03:46.690> but<00:03:46.989> uh<00:03:47.760> mine<00:03:48.760> comes<00:03:49.030> back<00:03:49.180> right

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
fix or not but uh mine comes back right

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.360 
fix or not but uh mine comes back right
away<00:03:49.600> which<00:03:50.140> makes<00:03:50.350> me<00:03:50.500> believe<00:03:50.829> actually

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
away which makes me believe actually

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.069 
away which makes me believe actually
there<00:03:51.459> might<00:03:51.610> be<00:03:51.640> if<00:03:52.120> this<00:03:52.329> is<00:03:52.450> not<00:03:52.600> bad<00:03:52.780> it's

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
there might be if this is not bad it's

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.310 
there might be if this is not bad it's
just<00:03:53.140> the<00:03:53.410> connection<00:03:53.860> problem<00:03:55.049> so<00:03:56.049> I'm<00:03:56.140> going

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
just the connection problem so I'm going

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.560 
just the connection problem so I'm going
to<00:03:56.410> clean<00:03:56.950> this<00:03:57.100> thoroughly<00:03:57.340> never<00:03:58.180> install

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
to clean this thoroughly never install

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.479 
to clean this thoroughly never install
it<00:03:58.690> go<00:03:58.840> for<00:03:59.079> turn<00:03:59.230> it<00:03:59.410> on<00:03:59.530> and<00:03:59.769> go<00:03:59.980> for<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.220> small

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
it go for turn it on and go for a small

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.130 
it go for turn it on and go for a small
quick<00:04:00.910> test<00:04:01.180> drive<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:01.600> if<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.840> comes<00:04:01.989> back

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
quick test drive and if it comes back

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.380 
quick test drive and if it comes back
don't<00:04:03.130> just<00:04:03.310> replace<00:04:03.549> it<00:04:03.640> if<00:04:03.910> not<00:04:04.090> then

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
don't just replace it if not then

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.509 
don't just replace it if not then
obviously<00:04:04.660> fix<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.350> problem<00:04:05.680> that's<00:04:06.340> what

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
obviously fix the problem that's what

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.839 
obviously fix the problem that's what
you<00:04:06.670> would<00:04:06.850> need<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.090> do<00:04:07.239> so<00:04:08.430> so<00:04:09.430> I'm<00:04:09.610> not<00:04:09.700> going

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
you would need to do so so I'm not going

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.130 
you would need to do so so I'm not going
to<00:04:09.910> do<00:04:10.030> that<00:04:10.180> put<00:04:10.420> all<00:04:10.450> putting<00:04:10.870> it<00:04:11.019> back

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
to do that put all putting it back

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.030 
to do that put all putting it back
together<00:04:11.290> it's<00:04:11.560> pretty<00:04:11.739> straightforward

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
together it's pretty straightforward

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.309 
together it's pretty straightforward
pretty<00:04:12.580> self-explanatory<00:04:13.000> so<00:04:13.569> yeah

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
pretty self-explanatory so yeah
