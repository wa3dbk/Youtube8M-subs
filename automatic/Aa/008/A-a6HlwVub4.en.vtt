00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.550
 hello I'm simon dine muscle maker 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.250
 This video shows the cross lift 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.509
 by 48 explosive training a thing 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.639
 Immediately you will really 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.020
 be depressed when cross lifting there must 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.760
 you massively down with the weights 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.230
 go because it is about an exercise at 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.510
 which one you train as normal 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.000
 can certainly move big weight 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.900
 in 48 explosive training you can do it 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.340
 Forgotten forget 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.570
 let's look only times not so 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.300
 with me when and how that with me 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.610
 look it shows me where I 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.649
 quite frankly and honestly say at the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.719
 exercise I find it very difficult to 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.190
 to find maximum voltage range and 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.010
 just to train in this area 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.879
 that means, first of all, of course 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.710
 standard five repetitions the 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.809
 from the sound repetitions then not four 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.280
 short where I myself where I have a lot 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.539
 after feeling must go and if I have 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.829
 finally talk also cleared the 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.510
 view is not quite that yet 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.550
 optimal area to have found 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.770
 at least in the last few sentences 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.760
 The so ever how it goes and today 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.320
 of course, then again the three 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.559
 repetitions before the movement radius 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.110
 is so important, of course, just the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.119
 today without access today without 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.689
 weight topic is today without any 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.890
 equipment 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.700
 Actually, I could get the shoes now 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.530
 take off the vapors down in the 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.560
 but it will be me 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.479
 now for practical reasons do not do that 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.520
 that is the whole thing now 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.700
 here at 48 explosive 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.450
 technical equipment constantly about 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:33.270
 hip width foley trade slightly 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.950
 outside the feet straighten cross 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.670
 air I grab the whole time today 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.670
 pulled up 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.440
 to catch your breath for just a moment 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.240
 although the weight is not much though 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.280
 my training technique of mine 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.010
 conception is not perfect yet 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.800
 not a day like me this exercise 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.790
 really different 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.230
 just exhausted like that on me 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.470
 The cycle is easy 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:48.470
 Remember tick is a circulatory exercise 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.700
 cycle just right 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.190
 you'll just notice with the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.490
 weight you do not have to go down 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.170
 different 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.870
 the light here already great on the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.040
 cut on it but burden the air 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.110
 a lot more intense I need 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.220
 now a breather 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.840
 See you in the next video many 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.840
 greetings from your simon
