00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
oh come on we don't have time for that

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:30.109 
oh come on we don't have time for that
nonsense<00:00:17.480> with<00:00:18.480> no<00:00:18.570> time<00:00:18.779> for<00:00:18.930> anything<00:00:29.119> are

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
nonsense with no time for anything are

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:38.209 
nonsense with no time for anything are
they<00:00:30.300> actually<00:00:33.020> yep<00:00:36.320> game<00:00:37.320> over<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.950> didn't

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
they actually yep game over that didn't

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:48.639 
they actually yep game over that didn't
work<00:00:38.250> okay<00:00:42.290> okay<00:00:43.290> then<00:00:44.040> let's<00:00:44.309> try<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.789> again

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.200 

this<00:00:49.649> time<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.190> getting<00:00:50.309> much<00:00:50.550> smaller<00:00:50.730> team

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
this time is getting much smaller team

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:03.410 
this time is getting much smaller team
here<00:01:01.219> those<00:01:02.219> guys<00:01:02.370> going<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.910> back<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.300> the

cave to collect a piece of or when you

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.980 
cave to collect a piece of or when you
already<00:01:07.740> have<00:01:07.890> 50<00:01:08.430> at<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.549> base<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:09.720> just

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
already have 50 at the base it just

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:25.870 
already have 50 at the base it just
doesn't<00:01:10.229> work<00:01:19.700> come<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:20.880> guys<00:01:20.909> keep<00:01:21.600> working

address angry or just blast at the hell
forget<00:01:31.860> safety<00:01:42.200> okay<00:01:43.200> here's<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.590> new<00:01:43.770> order<00:01:44.100> of

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
forget safety okay here's a new order of

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:58.220 
forget safety okay here's a new order of
business<00:01:44.399> either<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.030> run<00:01:45.329> away<00:01:45.450> or<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.960> draw

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.750 

my<00:01:59.230> copies<00:01:59.590> last<00:01:59.920> time<00:02:00.130> I<00:02:00.190> got<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.430> support

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
my copies last time I got the support

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.210 
my copies last time I got the support
station<00:02:01.060> up<00:02:01.300> with<00:02:01.420> like<00:02:01.690> half<00:02:02.500> hour<00:02:02.860> remaining

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
station up with like half hour remaining

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:13.200 
station up with like half hour remaining
so<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:06.150> really<00:02:07.150> do<00:02:07.300> think<00:02:07.570> it's<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:11.400> just<00:02:12.400> for

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
so I really do think it's the just for

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.650 
so I really do think it's the just for
all<00:02:13.270> just<00:02:13.540> too<00:02:14.050> many<00:02:14.200> robbers<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:16.450> more<00:02:16.630> you

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
all just too many robbers the more you

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.600 
all just too many robbers the more you
have<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.990> faster<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.590> air<00:02:17.710> runs<00:02:17.920> out<00:02:18.100> and<00:02:18.400> it

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
have the faster the air runs out and it

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.220 
have the faster the air runs out and it
does<00:02:18.820> so<00:02:18.850> quick<00:02:20.100> yeah<00:02:21.660> energy<00:02:22.660> crystal<00:02:23.080> has

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
does so quick yeah energy crystal has

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:30.570 
does so quick yeah energy crystal has
been<00:02:23.380> found<00:02:23.620> okay<00:02:27.180> okay<00:02:28.180> forget<00:02:28.750> safety<00:02:29.580> just

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
been found okay okay forget safety just

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.740 
been found okay okay forget safety just
bomb<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:32.680> spiders<00:02:33.190> going<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.430> kill<00:02:33.580> him

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.940 

no<00:02:37.750> but<00:02:38.020> unfortunately<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.530> didn't<00:02:38.709> kill<00:02:38.830> the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
no but unfortunately it didn't kill the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.310 
no but unfortunately it didn't kill the
spider<00:02:39.220> eater<00:02:42.240> words<00:02:43.240> cannot<00:02:43.600> describe<00:02:43.720> just

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
spider eater words cannot describe just

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.650 
spider eater words cannot describe just
how<00:02:44.380> dangerous<00:02:44.770> this<00:02:45.310> truly<00:02:45.580> is<00:02:45.700> but<00:02:49.800> ok<00:02:50.800> I

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
how dangerous this truly is but ok I

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.449 
how dangerous this truly is but ok I
need<00:02:52.660> 10<00:02:52.990> toes<00:02:53.140> after<00:02:53.290> crystals<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:54.010> need<00:02:54.340> to

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
need 10 toes after crystals I need to

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.600 
need 10 toes after crystals I need to
get<00:02:54.610> them<00:02:54.790> now<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.860> if<00:02:59.950> that<00:03:00.100> means<00:03:00.280> I<00:03:00.459> was

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
get them now and if that means I was

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.490 
get them now and if that means I was
born<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:01.180> out<00:03:01.330> of<00:03:01.360> his<00:03:01.540> place<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:01.989> bond

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
born the out of his place and bond

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.750 
born the out of his place and bond
the<00:03:02.860> out<00:03:02.980> of<00:03:03.010> it<00:03:03.130> I<00:03:03.220> shall<00:03:08.610> see<00:03:09.610> we're

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
the out of it I shall see we're

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:22.790 
the out of it I shall see we're
already<00:03:09.880> doing<00:03:10.120> much<00:03:10.570> better<00:03:15.750> building<00:03:16.750> their

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.030 

nests<00:03:23.800> is<00:03:23.950> evil<00:03:24.550> power<00:03:24.940> station<00:03:25.860> while<00:03:26.860> that

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
nests is evil power station while that

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:37.470 
nests is evil power station while that
guy<00:03:28.620> last<00:03:29.620> step<00:03:31.920> get<00:03:32.920> your<00:03:33.070> head<00:03:33.430> straight<00:03:36.480> ok

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
guy last step get your head straight ok

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.630 
guy last step get your head straight ok
we<00:03:37.870> already<00:03:38.080> have<00:03:38.170> to<00:03:38.260> power<00:03:38.440> station<00:03:38.980> up<00:03:39.130> just

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
we already have to power station up just

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.960 
we already have to power station up just
enough<00:03:39.970> for<00:03:40.300> the<00:03:40.980> energy<00:03:41.980> crystals<00:03:42.550> router<00:03:42.760> to

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
enough for the energy crystals router to

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.509 
enough for the energy crystals router to
build<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:46.560> support<00:03:47.560> state<00:03:47.890> I'm<00:03:48.400> gonna

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
build the support state I'm gonna

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:49.949 
build the support state I'm gonna
actually<00:03:48.760> put<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.120> support<00:03:49.480> station<00:03:49.660> down

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
actually put the support station down

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.479 
actually put the support station down
with<00:03:50.110> one<00:03:50.230> of<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:50.410> energy<00:03:50.650> crystals<00:03:51.160> but

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
with one of the energy crystals but

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.440 
with one of the energy crystals but
those<00:03:54.489> are<00:03:54.580> guys<00:03:54.670> can<00:03:54.850> already<00:03:54.970> put<00:03:55.239> down<00:03:55.420> all

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
those are guys can already put down all

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.949 
those are guys can already put down all
the<00:03:55.720> or<00:03:55.870> necessary<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:56.799> build<00:03:57.100> it<00:03:57.780> then<00:03:58.780> all<00:03:58.870> we

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
the or necessary to build it then all we

00:03:58.959 --> 00:03:59.970 
the or necessary to build it then all we
really<00:03:59.049> have<00:03:59.170> to<00:03:59.290> do<00:03:59.440> is<00:03:59.530> get<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.739> energy

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
really have to do is get the energy

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.510 
really have to do is get the energy
crystals<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.520> we'll<00:04:00.610> be<00:04:00.670> done

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
crystals and we'll be done

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.830 
crystals and we'll be done
and<00:04:03.520> incidentally<00:04:03.940> we<00:04:04.209> have<00:04:04.360> four<00:04:04.630> rock

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
and incidentally we have four rock

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.330 
and incidentally we have four rock
raiders<00:04:05.110> and<00:04:05.290> we<00:04:05.380> need<00:04:05.500> for<00:04:05.650> energy<00:04:05.770> crystals

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
raiders and we need for energy crystals

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.449 
raiders and we need for energy crystals
so<00:04:06.580> that's<00:04:06.970> going<00:04:07.240> to<00:04:07.300> be<00:04:08.760> okay<00:04:09.760> oh<00:04:11.250> yeah<00:04:12.250> we

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
so that's going to be okay oh yeah we

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:21.060 
so that's going to be okay oh yeah we
are<00:04:12.580> doing<00:04:12.730> much<00:04:13.270> better<00:04:19.410> but<00:04:20.410> you<00:04:20.620> always<00:04:20.919> do

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
are doing much better but you always do

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.570 
are doing much better but you always do
now<00:04:21.480> nice<00:04:22.480> stop<00:04:23.350> it<00:04:25.860> yes<00:04:26.860> just<00:04:27.160> home<00:04:27.310> to<00:04:27.460> no

need everyone here this is really the
difference<00:04:44.320> between<00:04:44.620> doing<00:04:44.980> the<00:04:45.250> mission<00:04:45.520> the

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
difference between doing the mission the

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.740 
difference between doing the mission the
right<00:04:45.910> way<00:04:46.150> and<00:04:46.419> the<00:04:46.510> wrong<00:04:46.960> way<00:04:47.350> I<00:04:48.720> have<00:04:49.720> a

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
right way and the wrong way I have a

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.630 
right way and the wrong way I have a
support<00:04:50.200> station<00:04:50.410> ready<00:04:50.710> to<00:04:50.830> be<00:04:50.890> built<00:04:51.160> at<00:04:51.580> a

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
these guys are not gonna pick up or

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.710 
these guys are not gonna pick up or
that's<00:05:08.440> gonna<00:05:08.620> see<00:05:08.830> time<00:05:09.220> I<00:05:12.479> have<00:05:13.479> all<00:05:13.630> the

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
that's gonna see time I have all the

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.630 
that's gonna see time I have all the
time<00:05:13.930> in<00:05:13.990> the<00:05:14.080> world<00:05:14.140> to<00:05:14.770> look<00:05:15.070> for<00:05:15.280> that<00:05:15.370> one

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
time in the world to look for that one

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.070 
time in the world to look for that one
look<00:05:16.330> for<00:05:16.840> energy<00:05:17.080> crystals<00:05:17.500> I<00:05:17.590> think<00:05:19.080> you

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
look for energy crystals I think you

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.600 
look for energy crystals I think you
should<00:05:20.289> we<00:05:20.350> join<00:05:20.500> listal<00:05:21.039> so<00:05:21.190> that<00:05:21.310> we<00:05:21.370> can<00:05:21.520> get

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
should we join listal so that we can get

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:39.270 
should we join listal so that we can get
a<00:05:21.669> basement<00:05:33.780> my<00:05:34.780> guys<00:05:34.990> keep<00:05:35.260> drilling<00:05:38.280> okay

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
a basement my guys keep drilling okay

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.420 
a basement my guys keep drilling okay
there<00:05:39.550> it<00:05:39.669> is<00:05:39.789> see<00:05:40.720> if<00:05:40.960> I<00:05:41.800> nun<00:05:41.979> jus<00:05:42.100> crystal

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
there it is see if I nun jus crystal

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.960 
there it is see if I nun jus crystal
they<00:05:42.550> automatically<00:05:43.150> take<00:05:43.390> it<00:05:43.510> back<00:05:43.600> to<00:05:43.720> base

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
they automatically take it back to base

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.100 
they automatically take it back to base
we<00:05:45.970> will<00:05:46.180> however<00:05:46.300> go<00:05:46.630> all<00:05:46.660> the<00:05:46.840> way<00:05:46.870> back<00:05:47.050> here

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
we will however go all the way back here

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.529 
we will however go all the way back here
to<00:05:47.470> just<00:05:47.650> you<00:05:48.340> know<00:05:49.110> fear<00:05:50.110> that<00:05:50.260> rubble<00:05:50.680> but<00:05:50.860> I

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
to just you know fear that rubble but I

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.180 
to just you know fear that rubble but I
guess<00:05:52.539> that's<00:05:52.780> sort<00:05:52.990> of<00:05:53.110> some<00:05:53.470> purpose

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
guess that's sort of some purpose

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.750 
guess that's sort of some purpose
because<00:05:54.370> it<00:05:55.169> does<00:05:56.169> allow<00:05:56.380> the<00:05:56.440> raw<00:05:56.740> run<00:05:57.220> faster

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
because it does allow the raw run faster

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.950 
because it does allow the raw run faster
so<00:05:58.180> oh<00:05:59.850> yeah<00:06:00.850> look<00:06:01.090> at<00:06:01.270> that<00:06:01.300> we're<00:06:01.660> gonna<00:06:01.780> be

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
so oh yeah look at that we're gonna be

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.950 
so oh yeah look at that we're gonna be
Oh<00:06:03.150> working<00:06:04.150> to<00:06:04.300> win<00:06:04.450> this<00:06:04.690> I<00:06:05.100> hope<00:06:06.900> is<00:06:07.900> that

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
Oh working to win this I hope is that

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.550 
Oh working to win this I hope is that
was<00:06:08.169> rather<00:06:08.320> fast

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
was rather fast

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:16.210
