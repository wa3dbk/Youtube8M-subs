of the finished knife and hope you enjoy
this<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.380> first<00:00:53.590> thing<00:00:53.650> to<00:00:53.860> do<00:00:53.980> is<00:00:54.010> make<00:00:54.310> a

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
this so the first thing to do is make a

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.910 
this so the first thing to do is make a
pattern<00:00:54.700> and<00:00:55.030> I<00:00:55.540> just<00:00:55.900> took<00:00:56.080> a<00:00:56.140> scrap<00:00:56.620> piece<00:00:56.650> of

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
pattern and I just took a scrap piece of

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.210 
pattern and I just took a scrap piece of
paper<00:00:57.070> here<00:00:57.370> and<00:00:57.580> folded<00:00:57.970> it<00:00:58.030> in<00:00:58.180> half<00:00:58.210> and

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
paper here and folded it in half and

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.470 
paper here and folded it in half and
there's<00:01:00.220> going<00:01:00.340> to<00:01:00.400> be<00:01:00.460> a<00:01:00.520> pouch<00:01:00.790> type<00:01:01.180> sheath

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
there's going to be a pouch type sheath

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.469 
there's going to be a pouch type sheath
and<00:01:01.920> because<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.040> ostrich<00:01:03.430> knee<00:01:03.640> is<00:01:03.970> a<00:01:04.030> little

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
and because the ostrich knee is a little

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.020 
and because the ostrich knee is a little
bit<00:01:04.780> thin<00:01:05.379> I'm<00:01:05.860> going<00:01:06.159> to<00:01:06.220> reinforce<00:01:06.759> it<00:01:06.939> with

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
bit thin I'm going to reinforce it with

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.300 
bit thin I'm going to reinforce it with
some<00:01:07.210> harness<00:01:07.570> leather<00:01:07.780> so<00:01:08.770> as<00:01:08.830> you<00:01:08.950> can<00:01:09.070> see

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
some harness leather so as you can see

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.240 
some harness leather so as you can see
it<00:01:09.880> turned<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.299> knife<00:01:10.710> making<00:01:11.710> sure<00:01:12.040> that

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
it turned the knife making sure that

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.980 
it turned the knife making sure that
it's<00:01:12.369> in<00:01:12.490> the<00:01:12.610> position<00:01:13.030> that<00:01:13.119> it'll<00:01:13.330> be<00:01:13.479> on<00:01:13.659> a

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
it's in the position that it'll be on a

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.630 
it's in the position that it'll be on a
belt<00:01:14.409> for<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.830> right-handed<00:01:15.310> person<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:17.640> draw

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
around the blade of the knife and get

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.969 
around the blade of the knife and get
that<00:01:21.600> set<00:01:22.600> kind<00:01:22.990> of<00:01:23.049> where<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.320> welt<00:01:23.530> is<00:01:23.770> going

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
that set kind of where the welt is going

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.999 
that set kind of where the welt is going
to<00:01:24.039> be<00:01:24.189> in<00:01:24.429> the<00:01:24.579> sheath<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.149> you<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:26.770> see<00:01:26.920> I've

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.219 
gonna fit in there and there's kind of a
stop<00:01:41.939> for<00:01:42.939> the<00:01:43.090> ferrule<00:01:43.509> when<00:01:43.719> it<00:01:43.780> hits<00:01:43.990> down

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
stop for the ferrule when it hits down

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:59.879 
stop for the ferrule when it hits down
inside<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:55.109> then<00:01:56.109> I<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:57.729> cut<00:01:58.030> it<00:01:58.149> out<00:01:58.889> trim

00:01:59.879 --> 00:01:59.889

ring around the outside of the lines and

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.629 
ring around the outside of the lines and
this<00:02:02.380> is<00:02:02.499> going<00:02:02.649> to<00:02:02.709> be<00:02:02.799> the<00:02:02.889> pattern<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.459> lay

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:03.639 
this is going to be the pattern to lay

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:06.270 
this is going to be the pattern to lay
down<00:02:03.670> on<00:02:04.090> top<00:02:04.119> of<00:02:04.389> the<00:02:04.569> leather<00:02:05.130> draw<00:02:06.130> around

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280

down on top of the leather draw around
and<00:02:07.649> have<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.800> perfect<00:02:09.039> outline<00:02:09.490> for<00:02:09.759> a

sheath

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.500 

so<00:02:26.620> I'm<00:02:26.680> gonna<00:02:26.800> write<00:02:27.010> front<00:02:27.490> on<00:02:27.850> this<00:02:28.210> side

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
so I'm gonna write front on this side

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.510 
so I'm gonna write front on this side
just<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.900> make<00:02:29.080> sure<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.320> don't<00:02:29.530> accidently<00:02:30.370> lay

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
just to make sure I don't accidently lay

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.970 
just to make sure I don't accidently lay
the<00:02:30.700> pattern<00:02:31.090> down<00:02:31.270> wrong<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:32.200> back<00:02:32.470> because

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
the pattern down wrong and back because

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.590 
the pattern down wrong and back because
believe<00:02:33.340> me<00:02:33.370> I've<00:02:33.760> made<00:02:34.150> lots<00:02:34.180> of<00:02:34.510> mistakes

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600

believe me I've made lots of mistakes
where<00:02:35.110> I<00:02:35.140> made<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:35.500> pattern<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.160> then

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
where I made a pattern and then

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.610 
where I made a pattern and then
accidentally<00:02:37.270> cut<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.840> leather<00:02:38.020> out<00:02:38.260> upside

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
accidentally cut the leather out upside

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.770 
accidentally cut the leather out upside
down<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.100> made<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.220> left-handed<00:02:39.820> chief<00:02:42.780> now

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
down and made a left-handed chief now

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.380 
down and made a left-handed chief now
I'm<00:02:43.840> going<00:02:43.990> to<00:02:44.050> trim<00:02:44.290> away<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:45.820> part<00:02:46.210> that's

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
I'm going to trim away the part that's

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.910 
I'm going to trim away the part that's
going<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.600> be<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.810> flap<00:02:47.110> on<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.440> front<00:02:47.740> of<00:02:47.830> the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
going to be the flap on the front of the

00:02:47.920 --> 00:03:00.960 
going to be the flap on the front of the
ninth<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.870> there<00:02:59.050> you<00:02:59.140> have<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.970> perfect

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
ninth and there you have it perfect

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.400 
ninth and there you have it perfect
pattern<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.570> we're<00:03:01.720> just<00:03:01.810> going<00:03:02.020> to<00:03:02.050> check<00:03:02.230> to

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
pattern and we're just going to check to

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.880 
pattern and we're just going to check to
make<00:03:02.440> sure<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.130> knife<00:03:03.310> fits<00:03:03.670> in<00:03:03.880> there

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
make sure that the knife fits in there

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:24.420 
make sure that the knife fits in there
and<00:03:06.000> it's<00:03:07.000> looking<00:03:07.360> good

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.120

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
so now I've cut out a piece of harness

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.060

leather<00:03:30.840> for<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.230> back<00:03:31.530> that's<00:03:31.860> going<00:03:32.010> to

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
leather for the back that's going to

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.650 
leather for the back that's going to
reinforce<00:03:32.610> this<00:03:32.820> sheath<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.330> I'm<00:03:33.450> just

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
reinforce this sheath and I'm just

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.590 
reinforce this sheath and I'm just
getting<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.020> wet<00:03:34.230> with<00:03:34.470> water<00:03:34.740> and<00:03:35.100> a<00:03:35.910> rag<00:03:36.180> to

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
getting it wet with water and a rag to

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.980 
getting it wet with water and a rag to
prepare<00:03:37.020> it<00:03:37.110> for<00:03:37.260> dying<00:03:38.570> let's<00:03:39.570> get<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:39.810> nice

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
prepare it for dying let's get it nice

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.900 
prepare it for dying let's get it nice
and<00:03:40.020> wet<00:03:40.320> that<00:03:40.770> way<00:03:40.890> doesn't<00:03:41.160> absorb<00:03:41.520> so<00:03:41.850> much

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
and wet that way doesn't absorb so much

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.710 
and wet that way doesn't absorb so much
died<00:03:45.770> so<00:03:46.770> now<00:03:46.890> I've<00:03:47.010> got<00:03:47.160> it<00:03:47.280> laid<00:03:47.460> out<00:03:47.670> on<00:03:47.850> this

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
died so now I've got it laid out on this

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.180 
died so now I've got it laid out on this
board<00:03:49.020> for<00:03:49.230> dyeing<00:03:49.410> we're<00:03:49.650> going<00:03:49.770> to<00:03:49.830> use<00:03:49.980> this

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
board for dyeing we're going to use this

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.060 
board for dyeing we're going to use this
die<00:03:50.460> which<00:03:50.730> is<00:03:50.910> five<00:03:51.900> innings<00:03:52.200> leather<00:03:52.440> dye<00:03:52.740> I

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
die which is five innings leather dye I

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.490 
die which is five innings leather dye I
like<00:03:54.000> this<00:03:54.120> is<00:03:54.300> an<00:03:54.450> aniline<00:03:54.810> dye<00:03:54.990> and<00:03:55.050> it<00:03:55.290> works

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
like this is an aniline dye and it works

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.770 
like this is an aniline dye and it works
really<00:03:55.800> well<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:57.180> I'll<00:03:57.240> just<00:03:57.300> use<00:03:57.570> a<00:03:57.600> little

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
really well so I'll just use a little

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.250 
really well so I'll just use a little
applicator<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.910> I'm<00:03:59.910> going<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.090> put<00:04:00.300> the<00:04:00.510> dye

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
applicator and I'm going to put the dye

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.260 
applicator and I'm going to put the dye
on<00:04:01.500> several<00:04:02.010> different<00:04:02.100> directions<00:04:02.820> just<00:04:03.120> to

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
on several different directions just to

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.360 
on several different directions just to
make<00:04:03.420> sure<00:04:03.450> that<00:04:03.990> we've<00:04:04.170> got<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:05.190> leather

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
make sure that we've got the leather

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.340 
make sure that we've got the leather
really<00:04:05.760> coated<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.330> again<00:04:06.750> this<00:04:06.870> is<00:04:07.050> going

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
really coated and again this is going

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.250 
really coated and again this is going
right<00:04:07.560> on<00:04:07.710> top<00:04:07.950> of<00:04:07.980> damp<00:04:08.430> leather<00:04:09.140> which<00:04:10.140> is

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
right on top of damp leather which is

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.160 
right on top of damp leather which is
not<00:04:10.440> going<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.680> affect<00:04:10.740> the<00:04:11.130> dye<00:04:11.310> at<00:04:11.550> all<00:04:12.140> so<00:04:13.140> I

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
not going to affect the dye at all so I

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.590 
not going to affect the dye at all so I
just<00:04:13.410> spread<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:14.400> on<00:04:14.610> liberally<00:04:15.120> let<00:04:15.390> the

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
just spread it on liberally let the

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:25.460 
just spread it on liberally let the
leather<00:04:16.080> start<00:04:16.410> soaking<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:16.920> in<00:04:24.320> I'll<00:04:25.320> just

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
leather start soaking it in I'll just

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.700 
leather start soaking it in I'll just
hit<00:04:25.590> it<00:04:25.650> from<00:04:26.660> several<00:04:27.660> different<00:04:27.750> angles<00:04:28.320> and

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
hit it from several different angles and

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.550 
hit it from several different angles and
just<00:04:29.070> get<00:04:29.190> it<00:04:29.280> good<00:04:29.430> and<00:04:29.490> saturated<00:04:30.390> so<00:04:31.260> there

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
just get it good and saturated so there

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.580 
just get it good and saturated so there
aren't<00:04:31.710> any<00:04:32.300> brush<00:04:33.300> marks<00:04:33.660> in<00:04:33.840> it<00:04:33.870> when<00:04:34.290> it

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
aren't any brush marks in it when it

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.980 
aren't any brush marks in it when it
dries<00:04:37.310> this<00:04:38.310> is<00:04:38.490> really<00:04:38.700> a<00:04:38.820> good<00:04:39.060> died<00:04:39.300> and

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
dries this is really a good died and

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.330 
dries this is really a good died and
this<00:04:40.110> highly<00:04:40.530> I've<00:04:40.650> used<00:04:40.800> some<00:04:40.980> other<00:04:41.130> dyes

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
this highly I've used some other dyes

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.070 
this highly I've used some other dyes
that<00:04:41.370> aren't<00:04:41.850> aren't<00:04:42.180> very<00:04:42.390> good<00:04:42.540> they<00:04:42.960> don't

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
that aren't aren't very good they don't

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.020 
that aren't aren't very good they don't
seem<00:04:43.620> to<00:04:43.650> die<00:04:43.860> to<00:04:43.919> leather<00:04:44.190> well<00:04:44.400> but<00:04:44.669> this

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
seem to die to leather well but this

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:54.180 
seem to die to leather well but this
stuff<00:04:45.240> is<00:04:45.360> amazing

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.300 

okay<00:04:55.190> so<00:04:55.280> get<00:04:55.580> that<00:04:55.760> from<00:04:55.940> several<00:04:56.300> angles<00:04:56.420> and

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
okay so get that from several angles and

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:05.519 
okay so get that from several angles and
just<00:04:58.310> going<00:04:58.460> to<00:04:58.520> let<00:04:58.670> this<00:04:58.820> dry

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:05.529 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:08.810 

you

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:32.570 

you

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.590 

so<00:05:33.580> now<00:05:33.730> I<00:05:35.040> cut<00:05:36.040> out<00:05:36.720> some<00:05:37.720> slots<00:05:38.020> for<00:05:38.490> the

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
so now I cut out some slots for the

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.630 
so now I cut out some slots for the
thread<00:05:40.600> and<00:05:40.870> just<00:05:41.350> mark<00:05:41.980> it<00:05:42.100> with<00:05:42.250> an<00:05:42.400> over

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
thread and just mark it with an over

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.190 
thread and just mark it with an over
stitch<00:05:42.880> wheel<00:05:44.040> looks<00:05:45.040> like<00:05:45.250> that<00:05:45.460> so<00:05:45.790> that<00:05:45.940> my

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
stitch wheel looks like that so that my

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.860 
stitch wheel looks like that so that my
stitches<00:05:47.200> are<00:05:47.350> nice<00:05:47.560> and<00:05:47.830> even<00:05:48.220> and<00:05:48.570> my<00:05:49.570> marks

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
stitches are nice and even and my marks

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.480 
stitches are nice and even and my marks
on<00:05:50.050> there<00:05:50.260> and<00:05:50.470> then<00:05:50.650> I'll<00:05:50.800> do<00:05:51.130> it<00:05:51.220> up<00:05:51.310> at<00:05:51.430> the

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
on there and then I'll do it up at the

00:05:51.490 --> 00:06:01.650 
on there and then I'll do it up at the
top<00:05:51.670> for<00:05:51.910> the<00:05:51.940> belt<00:05:52.180> loop<00:05:52.330> as<00:05:52.510> well<00:06:00.510> once<00:06:01.510> these

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
top for the belt loop as well once these

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.270 
top for the belt loop as well once these
are<00:06:01.720> finished<00:06:02.200> it'll<00:06:02.710> be<00:06:02.800> ready<00:06:02.950> for<00:06:03.190> the

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
are finished it'll be ready for the
