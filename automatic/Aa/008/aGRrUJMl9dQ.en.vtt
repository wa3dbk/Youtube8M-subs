tower<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.730> top<00:01:23.910> I<00:01:24.230> sort<00:01:25.230> of<00:01:25.260> did<00:01:25.440> this

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
tower on the top I sort of did this

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.200 
tower on the top I sort of did this
inefficiently<00:01:26.130> what<00:01:26.550> you<00:01:26.640> want<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.910> do<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.120> you

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
inefficiently what you want to do is you

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.120 
inefficiently what you want to do is you
want<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.420> spread<00:01:27.630> your<00:01:27.690> archers<00:01:28.140> out<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:28.530> you

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
want to spread your archers out as you

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.380 
want to spread your archers out as you
can<00:01:29.280> see<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.490> sort<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.880> clustered<00:01:30.240> mine

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
can see I sort of clustered mine

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.330 
can see I sort of clustered mine
together<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.930> they're<00:01:31.320> gonna<00:01:31.410> get<00:01:31.620> destroyed

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
together and they're gonna get destroyed

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.010 
together and they're gonna get destroyed
by<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.580> mortar<00:01:32.940> shot<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.360> just<00:01:33.570> one<00:01:33.780> or<00:01:33.900> two

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
by the mortar shot in just one or two

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.170 
by the mortar shot in just one or two
shots<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:35.070> try<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.310> spread<00:01:35.610> them<00:01:35.730> out<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
shots so try to spread them out so the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.980 
shots so try to spread them out so the
mortars<00:01:36.510> can't<00:01:36.720> take<00:01:36.870> them<00:01:37.020> all<00:01:37.110> out<00:01:37.260> at<00:01:37.380> once

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
mortars can't take them all out at once

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.620 
mortars can't take them all out at once
so<00:01:39.990> just<00:01:40.050> keep<00:01:40.320> dropping<00:01:40.680> them<00:01:40.710> and

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
so just keep dropping them and

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.220 
so just keep dropping them and
eventually<00:01:42.630> you'll<00:01:42.780> take<00:01:42.960> care<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.170> that

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
eventually you'll take care of that

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:52.400 
eventually you'll take care of that
Archer<00:01:43.530> tower<00:01:50.780> all<00:01:51.780> right<00:01:51.900> so<00:01:52.110> here's<00:01:52.320> the

Archer tower all right so here's the
grand<00:01:52.590> finale<00:01:52.740> what<00:01:53.310> we're<00:01:53.400> gonna<00:01:53.490> want<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.850> do

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
grand finale what we're gonna want to do

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.900 
grand finale what we're gonna want to do
is<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:54.990> want<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.320> destroy<00:01:56.100> walls<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.729> both

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
is we want to destroy walls on both

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.450 
is we want to destroy walls on both
sides<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.720> what<00:01:57.990> we're<00:01:58.170> gonna<00:01:58.229> do<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.860> actually

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
sides so what we're gonna do I actually

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.250 
sides so what we're gonna do I actually
tried<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.850> use<00:02:00.030> barbarians<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.810> distract<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
tried to use barbarians to distract the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.380 
tried to use barbarians to distract the
cannons<00:02:01.650> and<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:01.920> towers<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.550> turned<00:02:03.240> out

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
cannons and the towers that turned out

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.700 
cannons and the towers that turned out
to<00:02:03.420> be<00:02:03.540> inefficient<00:02:03.930> what's<00:02:04.470> a<00:02:04.560> better

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
to be inefficient what's a better

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.800 
to be inefficient what's a better
strategy<00:02:05.010> is<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.460> drop<00:02:05.760> one<00:02:06.060> giant<00:02:06.510> and<00:02:06.660> then

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
strategy is to drop one giant and then

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.510 
strategy is to drop one giant and then
drop<00:02:06.990> three<00:02:07.350> wall<00:02:07.560> breakers<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.070> destroy<00:02:08.369> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
drop three wall breakers to destroy the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.150 
drop three wall breakers to destroy the
wall<00:02:08.640> as<00:02:09.140> you<00:02:10.140> can<00:02:10.350> see<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.679> side<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.040> took

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
wall as you can see on this side it took

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.040 
wall as you can see on this side it took
me<00:02:11.280> five<00:02:11.459> wall<00:02:11.760> breakers<00:02:12.150> which<00:02:12.480> was<00:02:12.660> pretty

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
me five wall breakers which was pretty

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.350 
me five wall breakers which was pretty
inefficient<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:13.830> as<00:02:14.010> on<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.400> side<00:02:14.459> I'm<00:02:15.090> just

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
inefficient so as on this side I'm just

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.330 
inefficient so as on this side I'm just
going<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.510> use<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.690> giant<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.290> then<00:02:17.100> I'm<00:02:17.220> gonna

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
going to use a giant and then I'm gonna

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.240 
going to use a giant and then I'm gonna
drop<00:02:17.550> three<00:02:17.850> wall<00:02:18.000> breakers<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:19.040> as<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.160> can

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
drop three wall breakers and as you can

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.770 
drop three wall breakers and as you can
see<00:02:20.310> they're<00:02:20.610> unarmed<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.180> they<00:02:21.360> destroy<00:02:21.660> the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
see they're unarmed and they destroy the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.020 
see they're unarmed and they destroy the
wall<00:02:21.930> with<00:02:22.050> these<00:02:25.430> all<00:02:26.430> right<00:02:26.519> so<00:02:26.700> now<00:02:26.790> taking

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
wall with these all right so now taking

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.970 
wall with these all right so now taking
a<00:02:27.150> look<00:02:27.269> at<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.420> base<00:02:27.709> what<00:02:28.709> I'm<00:02:28.800> going<00:02:28.920> to

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
a look at the base what I'm going to

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.650 
a look at the base what I'm going to
want<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.190> do<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.760> strategy<00:02:30.239> is<00:02:30.390> going<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.600> be

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
want to do the strategy is going to be

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.930 
want to do the strategy is going to be
to<00:02:30.959> drop<00:02:31.140> Giants<00:02:31.650> as<00:02:31.830> well<00:02:32.340> as<00:02:32.430> some<00:02:32.580> archers

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
to drop Giants as well as some archers

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.970 
to drop Giants as well as some archers
you<00:02:33.360> can<00:02:33.480> actually<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:34.500> don't<00:02:34.590> really<00:02:34.860> need

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
you can actually you don't really need

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.680 
you can actually you don't really need
the<00:02:35.100> barbarians<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.940> could<00:02:36.060> use<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.540> could

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
the barbarians you could use you could

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.160 
the barbarians you could use you could
turn<00:02:36.810> those<00:02:37.019> into<00:02:37.170> Giants<00:02:37.560> if<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.739> want<00:02:39.170> but

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
turn those into Giants if you want but

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.479 
turn those into Giants if you want but
I'm<00:02:40.290> gonna<00:02:40.440> drop<00:02:40.620> about<00:02:40.920> seven<00:02:41.370> or<00:02:41.459> eight

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
I'm gonna drop about seven or eight

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.949 
I'm gonna drop about seven or eight
Giants<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.060> start<00:02:42.300> you<00:02:42.450> can<00:02:42.570> actually<00:02:42.690> drop

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
Giants to start you can actually drop

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.229 
Giants to start you can actually drop
them<00:02:43.140> all<00:02:43.320> if<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.590> want<00:02:44.000> but<00:02:45.000> I'm<00:02:45.090> going<00:02:45.180> to

them all if you want but I'm going to

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.270 
them all if you want but I'm going to
start<00:02:45.420> with<00:02:45.570> seven<00:02:45.810> or<00:02:45.900> eight<00:02:46.019> as<00:02:46.230> well<00:02:47.130> as<00:02:47.220> I'm

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280

start with seven or eight as well as I'm
going<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.459> drop<00:02:47.550> all<00:02:47.730> my<00:02:47.760> archers<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.330> all<00:02:48.390> my

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
going to drop all my archers and all my

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.410 
going to drop all my archers and all my
barbarians<00:02:52.760> all<00:02:53.760> right<00:02:53.880> so<00:02:54.030> now<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.300> they're

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
barbarians all right so now that they're

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.759 
barbarians all right so now that they're
moving<00:02:54.540> through<00:02:54.900> once<00:02:55.170> their<00:02:55.350> health<00:02:55.530> gets

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
moving through once their health gets

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.470 
moving through once their health gets
low<00:02:55.830> you<00:02:56.220> can<00:02:56.400> want<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.610> drop<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.820> healing<00:02:57.269> spell

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
low you can want to drop a healing spell

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.180 
low you can want to drop a healing spell
to<00:02:57.810> bring<00:02:57.959> their<00:02:58.110> health<00:02:58.290> back<00:02:58.440> up<00:02:58.650> if<00:02:59.010> you

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
to bring their health back up if you

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.350 
to bring their health back up if you
don't<00:02:59.340> do<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.489> fast<00:02:59.760> enough<00:02:59.940> they're<00:03:00.300> gonna

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
don't do it fast enough they're gonna

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.690 
don't do it fast enough they're gonna
die<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:01.019> you're<00:03:01.170> gonna<00:03:01.320> lose<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.680> level<00:03:01.950> so

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
die and you're gonna lose the level so

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.930 
die and you're gonna lose the level so
drop<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.030> when<00:03:03.180> they're<00:03:03.299> about<00:03:03.510> half<00:03:03.840> health

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
drop it when they're about half health

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.979 
drop it when they're about half health
so<00:03:05.940> they're<00:03:06.090> just<00:03:06.209> gonna<00:03:06.390> start<00:03:06.630> plowing

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
so they're just gonna start plowing

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.690 
so they're just gonna start plowing
through<00:03:07.220> archers<00:03:08.220> we'll<00:03:08.340> be<00:03:08.430> helping<00:03:08.549> them

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
through archers we'll be helping them

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.479 
through archers we'll be helping them
out<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:09.530> they're<00:03:10.530> gonna<00:03:10.620> go<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.340> other

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
out and they're gonna go to the other

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:12.800 
out and they're gonna go to the other
side<00:03:11.760> now<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:11.970> they're<00:03:12.330> gonna<00:03:12.420> get<00:03:12.570> hit<00:03:12.720> by

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
side now so they're gonna get hit by

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.120 
side now so they're gonna get hit by
some<00:03:12.989> bombs<00:03:13.200> they're<00:03:13.620> gonna<00:03:13.739> be<00:03:13.860> hit<00:03:13.980> by<00:03:14.070> the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
some bombs they're gonna be hit by the

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.160 
some bombs they're gonna be hit by the
wizard<00:03:14.489> tower<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:14.940> actually<00:03:15.600> drop<00:03:15.810> some<00:03:15.989> guys

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
wizard tower I actually drop some guys

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.870 
wizard tower I actually drop some guys
on<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.500> other<00:03:16.530> side<00:03:16.860> it<00:03:17.130> turns<00:03:17.340> out<00:03:17.489> not<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.850> be

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
on the other side it turns out not to be

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.820 
on the other side it turns out not to be
necessary<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.720> only<00:03:18.900> have<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.230> use<00:03:19.260> one<00:03:19.380> side

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
necessary you only have to use one side

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.440 
necessary you only have to use one side
so<00:03:20.280> don't<00:03:20.310> worry<00:03:20.549> about<00:03:20.730> what<00:03:21.000> I'm<00:03:21.090> doing<00:03:21.120> up

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
so don't worry about what I'm doing up

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.830 
so don't worry about what I'm doing up
there

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
there

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.100 
there
attack<00:03:22.200> all<00:03:22.380> on<00:03:22.799> one<00:03:22.980> side<00:03:23.420> so<00:03:24.420> now<00:03:24.570> my<00:03:24.750> Giants

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
attack all on one side so now my Giants
