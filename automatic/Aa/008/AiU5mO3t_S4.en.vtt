00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.119
 about one-and-a-half tablespoon of 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.549
 Nutella I put a little on the 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.710
 microwave to melt 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.899
 It's okay, liquid. I put 30 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.070
 seconds and now I'll put it on top 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.070

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.570
 they are ready 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.520

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.160
 addressing both not stay in shape but 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.870
