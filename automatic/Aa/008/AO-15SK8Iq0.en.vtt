00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.470 
spoke about I'll walk around the outside
kind<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.280> far<00:00:08.429> away<00:00:08.550> then<00:00:08.940> I'll<00:00:09.059> move<00:00:09.240> in<00:00:09.389> a

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
kind of far away then I'll move in a

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.020 
kind of far away then I'll move in a
little<00:00:09.630> closer<00:00:09.900> for<00:00:10.349> you<00:00:10.610> just<00:00:11.610> give<00:00:11.849> you<00:00:12.000> a

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
little closer for you just give you a

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.450 
little closer for you just give you a
view<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.480> it

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
view of it

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.260 
view of it
I<00:00:14.660> just<00:00:15.660> tried<00:00:16.550> panning<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.730> hull<00:00:18.029> and

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
I just tried panning the hull and

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.810 
I just tried panning the hull and
because<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.810> angle<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.230> hull<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:20.250> has

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
because of the angle of the hull it has

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.400 
because of the angle of the hull it has
trouble<00:00:21.210> focusing<00:00:21.390> because<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.960> doesn't<00:00:22.320> know

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
trouble focusing because it doesn't know

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.250 
trouble focusing because it doesn't know
what<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.650> focus<00:00:22.859> on<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:24.210> I'm<00:00:24.660> not<00:00:24.930> probably

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
what to focus on so I'm not probably

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.839 
what to focus on so I'm not probably
going<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.680> be<00:00:25.800> able<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.010> show<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.310> much<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.670> the

going to be able to show you much of the

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.839 
going to be able to show you much of the
hull<00:00:27.029> up<00:00:27.240> really<00:00:27.630> close

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.880 

I<00:00:53.149> always<00:00:54.149> store<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.930> barn<00:00:55.230> here's<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
I always store it in a barn here's the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.200 
I always store it in a barn here's the
swim<00:00:56.550> ladder<00:00:56.840> swim<00:00:57.840> ladder<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.350> retractable

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
swim ladder swim ladder is retractable

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.340 
swim ladder swim ladder is retractable
and<00:01:00.210> then<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.809> swim<00:01:01.079> ladder<00:01:02.809> sits<00:01:03.809> up<00:01:04.019> under

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
and then that swim ladder sits up under

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.490 
and then that swim ladder sits up under
there<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.159> I'm<00:01:05.460> going<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.640> put<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.880> away

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
there so I'm going to put it away

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.240 
there so I'm going to put it away
it's<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.590> matter<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:08.150> flipping<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.210> up

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.539 
it's a matter of flipping it up
retracting<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:12.140> put<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.260> into<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.920> storage

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
retracting it I put it into a storage

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.170 
retracting it I put it into a storage
area<00:01:16.189> and<00:01:17.189> then<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.430> cover<00:01:17.670> gets<00:01:17.909> put<00:01:18.150> back

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
you don't want to have it on it's easy

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.830 
you don't want to have it on it's easy
to<00:01:48.539> take<00:01:48.719> off<00:01:49.189> it<00:01:50.189> doesn't<00:01:50.549> need<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.789> be<00:01:50.819> on<00:01:50.939> we
