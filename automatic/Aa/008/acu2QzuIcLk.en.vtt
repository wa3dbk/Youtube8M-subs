00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110
 it's also other terms category 1 come together to go to 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.110
 tip of his nose on the portals that some people asked me 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.640
 2 in the comments 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.699
 I do not skie stutter mouth to show you skis world 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.759
 at the end of the year of the video 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.570
 I will show my technique the technology without knowing 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.700
 in which sector it will not last very long 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.929
 of logis screenshots since then she is just as on the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.230
 portals and sites different portal 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.960
 the 23th cla 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.020
 this one 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.900
 we will put the art to make my little portal dompierre we will start 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.350
 by the first the basic 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.260
 so why do it in economic version 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
 3 like that indian happiness 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.680
 that's no it's the economy class if I die below like 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.800
 it like that like that like this 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.100
 that's how he is 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.120
 it's the basic portal of I do not have any desert 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.820
 it's to go 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.000
 after that was a little over six years 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.500
 you can do it like that 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.070
 like today's dimension c4 on bing d 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.930
 3 4 5 6 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.890
 so here are 5 4 out of 5 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.340
 a little bit locked up a lot bigger 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.250
 the idea emitted all the critics 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.460
 second portal 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.450
 so seduces him 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.450
 so delattre 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.270
 m mistakes always on the economy for everyone 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.640
 6 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.910
 ap hop 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.510
 m 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.370
 so I want to clarify that these last blocks are not mandatory the 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.060
 cost blogs are not mandatory then this one can not 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.979
 open on landscape mode 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.830
 a barracks of plumbers exit wedged in a paradise style the best it is 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.830
 a hell 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.210
 and so I can not activate that one because we need a mode 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.470
 So here is 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.470
 it's a portal so we can always do it in break version 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.949
 that's wealth 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:13.489
 this stone is in the reader the reader in the foot with tone that is done 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.679
 campaign for the mini-site stone you will not make a follow-up tutorial 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.339
 it must be said that diam's years 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.109
 so we'll go 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:25.839
 one last portal so this is a very very very fast tutorial 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:33.239
 act 3 23 in the world that could not be affected with all that he's going 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.359
 have to find 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.359
 so I did not prepare at all 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:42.469
 here are three out of three 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.999
 the debt crisis 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.060
 so when I shot those little things that I have not published yet 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.339
 l last time for Shiites a Tutsi fault 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:59.149
 the authors 2 3 m like that's all 3 we have to do 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:02.529
 for those who want to go in practice seems to have to look for your club 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.780
 the principle m 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.009
 the 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:11.870
 the district of arles according to the directive 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.639
 where we can find alone 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:14.579
 portal 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.579
 this portal we will make a small staircase for the role 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:18.990
 tehran 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.909
 so we can in pichichi basis over time 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.139
 it's up to little utopias 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.680
 so I remind you that you can give me ideas of 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.729
 he loses 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:31.369
 from the screen gators 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:32.429
 So here is 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:36.859
 if the little parenthesis so you make a portal of 3 out of 3 1 train on 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.119
 3 out of 6 3 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:40.559
 and there you put your ears of their leaders 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:43.559
 of chic and normally the portal opens 

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:49.999
 normally 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.689
 so if it's signed open I do not understand why 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.760
 the advertised as this way you can not be assigned 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.319
 she survival is constantly trying to silence critics that can not 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.639
 not be incarcerated 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.810
 no if you want to naturally find boxing that intersected 

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:09.619
 not so easy 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:13.819
 we have to kill by even helping armani's campaign that looks a bit like that on 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.549
 the shot it works from site say 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.269
 a glass of wine in the mouth like that 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.180
 ap you see it looks like that normal you have to kill them after the drop 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.449
 3 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:26.779
 she is sleeping term 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:28.289
 a study shows that 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.229
 the cake soon 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.759
 so here it is stuck with a little luck it will give you men 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.719
 business 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:38.719
 There you go 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.400
 but since I'm going fishing, that's how he'll die 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.820
 you have to find a picture do you have to combine these businessmen with a 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.389
 powder 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:49.729
 and then that's all 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:50.960
 down 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.490
 blake right to block the puck that here all the foot putting sticks 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.110
 blake 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.009
 like that in the ball in kraft's head 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.850
 and you call that for procter and after 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.090
 to find c 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.800
 stronghold so double the normal you have to right click and it takes 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.309
 follow a representative 

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:08.650
 that's all that 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.889
 far from their lands this breakage of the fund can recover it also the tensions 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.279
 we were far from the good 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:18.419
 that's the truth she finds her recovering to try the market 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.039
 long after we also noted record 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.900
 6 the businessman everyone down 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.919
 we will have to dig and follow them 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.770
 some of them in general are found in the 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.770
 in time we stick so you need 12 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:39.680
 you are 3% and the 6 9 12 12 hours in other words to be able to find that 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.260
 swells 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.589
 summer was what needed 

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:43.029
 on the possible 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:47.610
 in any game mode if the adjustment of the hours and if the track finds 

00:05:47.609 --> 00:05:52.590
 naturally one city the other 44 reams put very very very fast 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.060
 a very small state of things so far why I was not there 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.449
 for a certain period of time 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:03.469
 I invite you to look I see there so that was all to avoid these 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:04.560
 little tubes everything 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.279
 it was another because diabetes 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:08.580
 do not hesitate alaric and the video 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.969
 and I have an idea about one of his daughters so you see here 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:15.960
 right of the fray more and more that a simple majority 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.889
 6 sellar 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:21.349
 that's the one that's what's abnormal that's for sure 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:23.639
 but good mourning 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.490
 quite simply 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.249
 all this baptized all wounded city it's silly but good 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:30.710
 nothing can be done 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.559
 that's how these waves from one meter to afp 

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.990
 good we end up 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.699
 for the next round 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:42.189
 likewise for the next one he especially got from her i can not wait i'm waiting 

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:46.060
 always your proposals degrees screenshot software opposite cons 

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:47.099
 44 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:50.689
 he quoted not secular and the video to share it to our subscribers we left 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:52.099
 a comment 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:52.849
 actress
