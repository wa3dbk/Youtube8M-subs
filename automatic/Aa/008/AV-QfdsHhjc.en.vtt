00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.660 

next<00:03:57.450> I'm<00:03:57.630> taking<00:03:57.660> some<00:03:58.200> painters<00:03:58.590> tape<00:03:58.830> and<00:03:59.160> I

next I'm taking some painters tape and I
have<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.850> tip<00:04:00.060> for<00:04:00.090> you<00:04:00.270> guys<00:04:00.410> okay<00:04:01.410> if<00:04:01.620> you<00:04:01.980> use

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
have a tip for you guys okay if you use

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.280 
have a tip for you guys okay if you use
painters<00:04:02.610> tape<00:04:02.670> you<00:04:03.420> have<00:04:03.630> to<00:04:03.810> make<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.080> less

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
painters tape you have to make it less

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.590 
painters tape you have to make it less
sticky<00:04:04.710> so<00:04:05.100> it<00:04:05.190> doesn't<00:04:05.490> rip<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.120> paper<00:04:06.360> off

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
sticky so it doesn't rip the paper off

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.900 
sticky so it doesn't rip the paper off
so<00:04:07.080> what<00:04:07.320> you<00:04:07.590> do<00:04:07.830> is<00:04:08.070> you<00:04:08.250> just<00:04:08.280> put<00:04:08.700> it<00:04:08.790> on

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
so what you do is you just put it on

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.820 
so what you do is you just put it on
your<00:04:09.150> hand<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.570> rip<00:04:09.870> it<00:04:10.020> off<00:04:10.170> two<00:04:10.530> or<00:04:10.680> three

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
your hand and rip it off two or three

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.590 
your hand and rip it off two or three
times<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.700> will<00:04:11.940> be<00:04:12.090> about<00:04:12.420> the

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
times and it will be about the

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.230 
times and it will be about the
stickiness<00:04:13.110> of<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.440> post-it<00:04:13.890> note<00:04:14.100> and<00:04:14.370> now

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
stickiness of a post-it note and now

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.670 
stickiness of a post-it note and now
when<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.510> put<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:15.810> on<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:16.020> paper<00:04:16.170> it's<00:04:16.530> not

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
when you put it on the paper it's not

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.290 
when you put it on the paper it's not
going<00:04:17.040> to<00:04:17.100> rip<00:04:17.280> off<00:04:17.489> when<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:17.910> take<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.239> off

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:18.300 
going to rip off when you take it off

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.060 
going to rip off when you take it off
later<00:04:20.600> so<00:04:21.600> I'm<00:04:21.900> just<00:04:22.140> putting<00:04:22.410> two<00:04:22.830> pieces

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
later so I'm just putting two pieces

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.270 
later so I'm just putting two pieces
down<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.760> sort<00:04:24.570> of<00:04:24.630> an<00:04:24.780> arrow<00:04:25.140> so<00:04:25.620> this<00:04:25.770> is<00:04:25.920> one

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
down and sort of an arrow so this is one

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.080 
down and sort of an arrow so this is one
big<00:04:26.610> chevron<00:04:27.390> and<00:04:27.660> I<00:04:28.560> just<00:04:28.800> do<00:04:29.010> this<00:04:29.190> four<00:04:29.940> or
