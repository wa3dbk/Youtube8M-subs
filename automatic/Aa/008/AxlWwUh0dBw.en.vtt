00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.060
 here 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.630
 just one of all this time we're going to 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.560
 translate the components of despres 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.560
 Spanish 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.800
 if we run our 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.169
 for example that we have done in 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.559
 previous videotutorials we can notice 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:36.399
 that our components are 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.399
 in English 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.390
 in today's task is to translate it to 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.960
 Spanish 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.500
 The first thing we are going to do is enter 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.500
 this route 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.160
 we look for the version 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:01.539
 of our despres in my case download 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.539
 in 9.1 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.910
 this then what we have to do is 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.700
 unzip it 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:34.850
 well then we look for the folder that says 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:38.619
 tv express point dll and inside it 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:43.130
 we can see all these folders 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:47.350
 in which we are going to look for in which I did 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.350
 in that which is Spanish 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:54.650
 we copy this folder we go to the 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:59.170
 folder where we have our project and 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.170
 we look for wine 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.200
 we search 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:10.479
 here of dorsal trumpet the resources that 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.479
 they are used to translate the components 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:19.349
 then we are going to make a small adjustment 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:22.280
 here in the main officer that is 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.280
 where the application starts 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.310
 the events 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.280
 and we are going to put two very simple lines 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.340
 which is where we set 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.550
 the 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.520
 the language that we are going to use in this 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.450
 Case is Spanish 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.450
 del salvador 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:11.690
 and as you will see we have everything completely 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.690
 in Spanish 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.010
 well in an easy and fast way all 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.439
 our components of sant is greater 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:29.840
 now the other challenge is that this only 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:32.090
 it works in the part 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.050
 and development 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:40.660
 now how do we distribute these 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.660
 files what we have to do is 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.410
 we copied the folder again 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.400
 language that we need that in this 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:56.090
 case in Spanish we go to this route it 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.090
 Program 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:03.200
 depends on the version we have can 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.239
 vary this and we go to shorts and 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.370
 we always look for the despres folder 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:14.019
 point of it we go in there we stick to the 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.019
 folder with those resources 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.750
 now the south is enough 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.750
 compile 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:34.539
 that said files 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.920
 and have included for installation 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:51.569
 this is so much for climbers with the 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.569
 click as 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.469
 as for local installers 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:06.210
 we have is that of ll that normally 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:08.629
 corresponds and the resource that we have 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.629
 aggregate 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:15.430
 this has been all for today I hope that you 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:18.210
 have liked and soon we will have 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.210
 videos
