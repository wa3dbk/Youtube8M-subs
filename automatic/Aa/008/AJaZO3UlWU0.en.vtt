 once again with you and for nothing like 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.830
 will have read in the title I will 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.470
 show him more or less the pieces of my 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.820
 computer that then nothing much people 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.070
 has been asking coconut that 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.720
 computer that graphs that 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.430
 processor has is that you run Carlos 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.720
 you tremble with everyone and battlefield 3 and 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.970
 ope 7 and all without anything more or less 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.500
 speeds of an average of 7 the 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:52.170
 processor is 7.7 the really 7.9 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.270
 the is the graphic graph of the game 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.190
 7 the main hard disk I have a disk 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:02.100
 solid hard and two normal but nothing the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.150
 graph of 16 gb of ram now more or 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.950
 less I'm going to show you I tell them 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.270
 the first thing the processor is an intel 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:14.390
 core i7 of 10 mb 10-core cache 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.860
 I think if I'm not wrong 3 6 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.400
 speed gigahertz and then nothing more 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.620
 one of the 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.400
 the market's best I think 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:33.220
 the graph is a pretty simple 2gb the 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:35.110
 people of 640 gb ddr3 my next inside 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.840
 of little within very little I will have this 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.470
 graph 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:45.520
 614 euros a little expensive but nothing 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.800
 what else does it have then that it is from r 5 of 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.250
 4 GB much better than the previous one 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.850
 very much very much 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.670
 this is the type of ram I have 4 of 4 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.979
 gigas each 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.990
 now move away April 4 gigas each 144 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.780
 RAM memories of 4 gigas each one that's why 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.550
 they make 16 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:13.569
 on the motherboard the motherboard supports 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.510
 I think he told me up to 32 gigabytes of 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.810
 ram is at most I think that is what you 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.810
 you can put 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.270
 ok this is the screen the screen of 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.820
 computer that I have 24 inches to 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.710
 access all enough to play 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.940
 to games like call of duty black on 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:36.410
 all very simple helmets 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.870
 I think about 20 or 30 euros 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.960
 the mouse gamer the mouse gamer and then 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.620
 another 30 or 40 euros approximately 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:49.069
 and this is the keyboard 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.170
 and well I hope they have more or less 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.319
 cleared your doubts about the computer 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.019
 I have that graph and what about 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:01.249
 I bought it in pieces, that's why it 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:04.849
 I learned so much hope there 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:06.019
 clarified the doubts that I recommend that if 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.599
 they are going to buy a computer that 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.849
 buy per piece you get more and as not 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.379
 more economic forgiveness and you can even 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.090
 take out a computer that is not in the 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.469
 market because I for example I was 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.079
 looking for a computer similar to the one 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:19.700
 I armed myself by pieces to buy it 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.829
 been one and the truth that I did not find 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.599
 none similar and then nothing more than 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:28.750
 say but you liked it like 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.750
 favorites and share chao and see you
