 game opens it and if there was any code but 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.040
 had no code and actually has 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:56.970
 a very simple manual I found the manual 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.040
 very well superfluous actually I found it 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.889
 mainly the inside of the 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.450
 pokémon xy or much better than equal 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.139

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.459

 here's the game sd has the 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:24.060
 below the law that would be the 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:28.680
 sequential version of the 3ds pokémon fire or 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.389
 the fifa ie watch TV and fell usb version 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.760
 I think it's beautiful too. 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.919
 Okay, Popi, so tearful then how 's the 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.599
 hulk does opening again found 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.569
 no wonder this 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:43.169
 ok people and so it comes in the same 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.209
 extremely simple manual full thing 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:48.090
 does not see anything 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.400
 interesting in him that disappointed me 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.870
 enough for me to show that you like this 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.799
 the universe conspiring and achieve 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:04:01.049
 business is just like this is something for 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:04.349
 care with the cover and the sbn then it is well 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:07.290
 if you bleach and it would be front of the game and 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:11.250
 clear the back of the cover that have the 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.979
 same art of the wizard 's orlanda mail if 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.489
 You want the three policemen, that's cool. 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:20.400
 from there and it would be the team magma the enemies 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.860
 so it's there the back of the game 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.020
 It is there and your Pokemon cartridge 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.909
