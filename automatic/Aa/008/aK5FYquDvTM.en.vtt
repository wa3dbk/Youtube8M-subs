scream and what we have here is we have

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.049 
scream and what we have here is we have
the<00:00:33.899> EQ<00:00:34.710> controls<00:00:34.860> basically<00:00:35.550> set<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.879> noon

the<00:00:36.270> base<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.629> little<00:00:36.870> bit<00:00:36.960> up<00:00:37.110> distortion

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
the base is a little bit up distortion

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.920 
the base is a little bit up distortion
is<00:00:38.010> actually<00:00:38.310> at<00:00:38.430> zero<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.150> then<00:00:39.390> volume<00:00:39.810> is

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
is actually at zero and then volume is

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.569 
is actually at zero and then volume is
kind<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.170> at<00:00:40.230> an<00:00:40.320> appropriate<00:00:40.500> level<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.190> what

okay<00:01:06.660> on<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.930> setting<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:07.440> have<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
okay on this setting we have the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.620 
okay on this setting we have the
mid-range<00:01:08.550> turned<00:01:08.940> down<00:01:09.120> a<00:01:09.150> little<00:01:09.390> bit

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
mid-range turned down a little bit

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.210 
mid-range turned down a little bit
distortion<00:01:10.290> has<00:01:10.410> been<00:01:10.530> turned<00:01:10.710> up<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.010> about

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
distortion has been turned up to about

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.790 
distortion has been turned up to about
11<00:01:11.400> 30<00:01:11.910> and<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.660> gives<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.990> really<00:01:13.320> good<00:01:13.530> kind

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
11 30 and this gives a really good kind

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.550 
11 30 and this gives a really good kind
of<00:01:13.920> mid<00:01:14.190> cut<00:01:14.550> that's<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.390> sound<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.110> really

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
of mid cut that's a sound that really

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.170 
of mid cut that's a sound that really
works<00:01:16.770> great<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.070> tracks<00:01:17.520> as<00:01:17.730> you<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:17.970> layer

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
works great on tracks as you can layer

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.700 
works great on tracks as you can layer
it<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.390> bunch<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.930> has<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.140> really<00:01:19.320> super

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
it a bunch and it has this really super

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:32.780 
it a bunch and it has this really super
sound<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.100> let's<00:01:20.220> see<00:01:20.310> what<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.490> sounds<00:01:20.790> like

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.310 

but<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.480> you<00:01:33.540> can<00:01:33.690> hear<00:01:33.810> what<00:01:33.930> I'm<00:01:34.020> talking

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
but that you can hear what I'm talking

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.710 
but that you can hear what I'm talking
about<00:01:34.380> with<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.330> this<00:01:36.450> setting

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
about with that one so in this setting

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.350 
about with that one so in this setting
we<00:01:37.350> have<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.800> mid-range<00:01:38.220> scoop<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.880> what<00:01:39.210> that

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
we have a mid-range scoop and what that

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.940 
we have a mid-range scoop and what that
basically<00:01:39.510> means<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.260> that<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.620> mids<00:01:40.830> have

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
basically means is that the mids have

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.380 
basically means is that the mids have
been<00:01:41.070> dropped<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.640> we've<00:01:42.090> turned<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
been dropped and we've turned the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.110 
been dropped and we've turned the
distortion<00:01:42.870> up<00:01:43.050> to<00:01:43.230> about<00:01:43.500> 11<00:01:43.860> 30<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:45.000> is

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
distortion up to about 11 30 and this is

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.360 
distortion up to about 11 30 and this is
going<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.300> give<00:01:45.510> kind<00:01:46.230> of<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.380> shred<00:01:46.650> sound<00:01:46.980> but

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
going to give kind of a shred sound but

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.710 
going to give kind of a shred sound but
it's<00:01:47.490> not<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.790> over<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.090> top<00:01:48.150> that<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:48.600> lose

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
it's not so over the top that you lose

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.600 
it's not so over the top that you lose
the<00:01:48.930> guitar<00:01:49.260> in<00:01:49.410> it<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.980> really<00:01:50.190> makes

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
the guitar in it and it really makes

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.250 
the guitar in it and it really makes
tracking<00:01:50.970> really<00:01:51.420> great<00:01:51.630> with<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.900> it<00:01:52.110> gives

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
tracking really great with this it gives

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.719 
tracking really great with this it gives
you<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.440> ability<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.860> layer<00:01:53.160> without

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
you the ability to layer without

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.580 
you the ability to layer without
overwhelming<00:01:54.420> things<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.110> sounds<00:01:55.440> a

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
overwhelming things and it sounds a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:13.000 
overwhelming things and it sounds a
little<00:01:56.040> something<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:56.430> this

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.440

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
taking it up a notch we're going to see

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.730 
taking it up a notch we're going to see
what<00:02:15.570> this<00:02:15.660> thing<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:15.870> capable<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:16.500> it's<00:02:16.710> just

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
what this thing is capable of it's just

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.410 
what this thing is capable of it's just
kind<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.310> full<00:02:17.580> blown<00:02:17.880> what<00:02:18.150> we're<00:02:18.240> going<00:02:18.330> to

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
kind of full blown what we're going to

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.030 
kind of full blown what we're going to
do<00:02:18.570> is<00:02:18.780> we're<00:02:18.870> going<00:02:18.960> to<00:02:19.020> move<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.320> mids<00:02:19.590> back

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
do is we're going to move the mids back

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.620 
do is we're going to move the mids back
to<00:02:20.160> twelve<00:02:20.430> o'clock<00:02:20.730> we're<00:02:21.300> going<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.480> take

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
to twelve o'clock we're going to take

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.870 
to twelve o'clock we're going to take
the<00:02:21.720> distortion<00:02:22.290> push<00:02:23.070> it<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.340> exactly<00:02:23.700> where

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
the distortion push it to exactly where

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.090 
the distortion push it to exactly where
it<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.120> go<00:02:24.150> at<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.750> maximum<00:02:25.260> rate<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.710> then

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
it can go at the maximum rate and then

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.170 
it can go at the maximum rate and then
at<00:02:26.250> some<00:02:26.400> point<00:02:26.610> we're<00:02:26.760> going<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:26.940> engage<00:02:27.150> the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
at some point we're going to engage the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.390 
at some point we're going to engage the
top<00:02:27.540> boost<00:02:27.840> which<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.350> basically<00:02:28.710> a<00:02:28.980> treble

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
top boost which is basically a treble

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.220 
top boost which is basically a treble
booster<00:02:29.760> or<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.120> boosts<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.540> high<00:02:30.720> end<00:02:30.930> which

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
booster or it boosts the high end which

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.840 
booster or it boosts the high end which
is<00:02:31.350> going<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.530> allow<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:32.010> go<00:02:32.280> from<00:02:32.460> rhythm

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
is going to allow you to go from rhythm

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.790 
is going to allow you to go from rhythm
to<00:02:33.000> lead<00:02:33.270> without<00:02:33.870> having<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.140> change<00:02:34.320> pickups

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
to lead without having to change pickups

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.830 
to lead without having to change pickups
and<00:02:35.010> just<00:02:35.460> hit<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.180> kind<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.420> functions

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
and just hit it and it kind of functions

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.390 
and just hit it and it kind of functions
as<00:02:37.020> both<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.290> gain<00:02:37.560> switch<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.100> it's<00:02:38.280> going

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
as both the gain switch and it's going

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.130 
as both the gain switch and it's going
to<00:02:38.460> push<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.760> in<00:02:38.850> front<00:02:38.880> of<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.210> mix<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:39.870> first

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
to push you in front of the mix so first

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.920 
to push you in front of the mix so first
let's<00:02:40.470> hear<00:02:40.770> this<00:02:40.920> pedal<00:02:41.310> distortion<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.300> just

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930
