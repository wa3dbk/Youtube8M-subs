00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.649 
than likely that we will get this much
possibly<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:35.549> might<00:01:35.790> put<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.270> into<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> No

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
possibly they might put it into a No

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.480 
possibly they might put it into a No
Disqualification<00:01:36.810> match<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:38.070> get<00:01:38.189> us<00:01:38.280> ready

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
Disqualification match to get us ready

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.910 
Disqualification match to get us ready
for<00:01:38.579> Monday<00:01:39.150> night<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.960> get<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.170> ready<00:01:40.290> for<00:01:40.409> w/e

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
for Monday night to get it ready for w/e

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.210 
for Monday night to get it ready for w/e
TLC<00:01:41.850> 2012<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.380> possibly<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.040> did<00:01:44.189> see

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
TLC 2012 that is possibly but we did see

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.950 
TLC 2012 that is possibly but we did see
this<00:01:44.490> matter<00:01:44.670> last<00:01:44.880> week<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:45.869> very

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
this matter last week so it's very

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.179 
this matter last week so it's very
unlikely<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.530> they<00:01:46.680> will<00:01:46.740> have<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> same

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
unlikely that they will have the same

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.219 
unlikely that they will have the same
stipulation<00:01:47.939> it's<00:01:48.149> likely<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:48.990> they

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
stipulation it's likely that they

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.260 
stipulation it's likely that they
probably<00:01:49.530> will<00:01:50.040> put<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> disqualification<00:01:51.210> or

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
probably will put a disqualification or

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.420 
probably will put a disqualification or
some<00:01:51.509> kind<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.780> herb<00:01:52.110> stipulation<00:01:52.799> which<00:01:53.159> gets

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
some kind of herb stipulation which gets

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.370 
some kind of herb stipulation which gets
us<00:01:53.549> excited<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:54.119> TLC<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.049> most<00:01:55.170> obvious

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
us excited for TLC and the most obvious

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.039 
us excited for TLC and the most obvious
one<00:01:55.680> would<00:01:55.860> be<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> no<00:01:56.369> DQ<00:01:56.610> or<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.270> Tables<00:01:57.930> Ladders

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
one would be a no DQ or a Tables Ladders

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.810 
one would be a no DQ or a Tables Ladders
and<00:01:58.350> Chairs<00:01:58.380> match<00:01:58.799> which<00:01:58.979> could<00:01:59.520> be<00:01:59.610> quite

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
and Chairs match which could be quite

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.690 
and Chairs match which could be quite
interesting<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.920> might<00:02:01.920> be<00:02:02.009> chairs<00:02:02.310> much<00:02:02.520> as

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
interesting and might be chairs much as

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.130 
interesting and might be chairs much as
something<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.240> couldn't<00:02:03.479> be<00:02:03.540> TLC<00:02:03.930> because

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
something that I couldn't be TLC because

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.120 
something that I couldn't be TLC because
they're<00:02:04.229> obviously<00:02:04.469> isn't<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.710> bell<00:02:04.920> or

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
they're obviously isn't a bell or

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.620 
they're obviously isn't a bell or
something<00:02:05.280> above<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.969> money<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.570> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
something above that and money in the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.210 
something above that and money in the
bank<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:06.990> going<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.500> line<00:02:07.649> between<00:02:07.829> Dolph

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
bank is going on the line between Dolph

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.660 
bank is going on the line between Dolph
Ziggler<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.700> John<00:02:09.119> Cena<00:02:09.420> at<00:02:09.690> TLC<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.340> is

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
Ziggler and John Cena at TLC so it is

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.700 
Ziggler and John Cena at TLC so it is
also<00:02:11.970> likely<00:02:12.599> that<00:02:12.959> we<00:02:13.349> will<00:02:13.470> get

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
also likely that we will get

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.550 
also likely that we will get
a<00:02:13.770> right<00:02:14.070> vs<00:02:14.610> CM<00:02:14.970> Punk<00:02:15.300> news<00:02:16.020> because

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
a right vs CM Punk news because

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.590 
a right vs CM Punk news because
obviously<00:02:16.740> sample<00:02:17.370> can't<00:02:17.640> perform<00:02:17.820> in<00:02:18.210> ring

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
obviously sample can't perform in ring

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.320 
obviously sample can't perform in ring
in<00:02:19.110> TLC<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.830> year<00:02:20.130> so<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:20.820> like<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.060> we

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330

pumped<00:02:42.600> for<00:02:43.140> Royal<00:02:43.350> Rumble<00:02:43.770> but<00:02:44.130> obviously<00:02:44.490> it

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
pumped for Royal Rumble but obviously it

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.090 
pumped for Royal Rumble but obviously it
can't<00:02:44.940> be<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.120> Royal<00:02:45.420> Rumble<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.410> can't<00:02:46.710> be

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
can't be a Royal Rumble and it can't be

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.730 
can't be a Royal Rumble and it can't be
at<00:02:47.280> Elimination<00:02:48.210> Chamber<00:02:48.470> because<00:02:49.470> obviously

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
at Elimination Chamber because obviously

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.860 
at Elimination Chamber because obviously
you've<00:02:50.070> got<00:02:50.220> six<00:02:50.550> men<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.120> rain<00:02:51.300> going<00:02:51.600> for

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
you've got six men in the rain going for

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.900 
you've got six men in the rain going for
the<00:02:51.930> w/e<00:02:52.260> championship<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.580> then<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.880> next

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
the w/e championship and then the next

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.950 
the w/e championship and then the next
PPV<00:02:54.780> in<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.960> row<00:02:55.140> would<00:02:55.770> be<00:02:56.360> WrestleMania<00:02:57.360> 29

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
PPV in the row would be WrestleMania 29

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.900 
PPV in the row would be WrestleMania 29
so<00:02:58.710> they've<00:02:59.160> got<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.340> bit<00:02:59.520> of<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.610> sticky

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
so they've got a bit of a sticky

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.600 
so they've got a bit of a sticky
situation<00:03:00.060> do<00:03:00.960> they<00:03:01.140> fro<00:03:01.380> CM<00:03:01.740> Punk<00:03:01.980> vs<00:03:02.370> right

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
situation do they fro CM Punk vs right

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.940 
situation do they fro CM Punk vs right

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
championship last year so it could be

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.780 
championship last year so it could be
WrestleMania<00:03:31.830> that<00:03:31.950> they<00:03:32.070> might<00:03:32.250> talk<00:03:32.490> about
