00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
lips and are we crazy and it also helps

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.370 
lips and are we crazy and it also helps
us<00:02:55.910> keep<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:57.019> RF<00:02:57.590> antenna<00:02:58.580> safe<00:02:59.230> so<00:03:00.230> the

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
us keep the RF antenna safe so the

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.410 
us keep the RF antenna safe so the
antenna<00:03:00.739> is<00:03:00.980> inside<00:03:01.610> that<00:03:01.640> label<00:03:02.209> is<00:03:02.269> that

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
antenna is inside that label is that

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.800 
antenna is inside that label is that
correct

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
correct

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.440 
correct
yes<00:03:02.989> so<00:03:03.920> you<00:03:03.980> have<00:03:04.220> a<00:03:04.250> printed<00:03:04.910> label<00:03:05.299> with

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
yes so you have a printed label with

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.440 
yes so you have a printed label with
human<00:03:05.720> readable<00:03:06.079> human<00:03:06.890> readable<00:03:07.280> text<00:03:08.000> on<00:03:08.299> it

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
human readable human readable text on it

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.020 
human readable human readable text on it
looks<00:03:08.989> like<00:03:09.049> there's<00:03:09.320> a<00:03:09.410> barcode<00:03:09.769> yeah<00:03:10.790> and

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
looks like there's a barcode yeah and

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.330 
looks like there's a barcode yeah and
also<00:03:11.540> there's<00:03:12.079> an<00:03:12.260> RFID<00:03:12.709> antenna<00:03:12.829> on<00:03:13.250> the

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
also there's an RFID antenna on the

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.979 
also there's an RFID antenna on the
inside<00:03:13.640> of<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:13.820> is<00:03:14.000> that<00:03:14.120> correct<00:03:14.390> yes

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
inside of that is that correct yes

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.250 
inside of that is that correct yes
okay<00:03:15.260> now<00:03:15.799> right<00:03:16.040> now<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.880> RF<00:03:17.329> antenna<00:03:17.540> is<00:03:18.019> not

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
okay now right now the RF antenna is not

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.100 
okay now right now the RF antenna is not
encoded<00:03:18.739> it<00:03:19.130> has<00:03:19.310> no<00:03:19.640> data<00:03:20.090> associated<00:03:20.930> with

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
encoded it has no data associated with

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.250 
encoded it has no data associated with
it<00:03:21.260> okay<00:03:21.950> so<00:03:23.230> okay<00:03:24.340> so<00:03:25.340> use<00:03:26.079> you<00:03:27.079> have<00:03:27.230> a

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
it okay so okay so use you have a

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.220 
it okay so okay so use you have a
program<00:03:27.709> that<00:03:27.799> helps<00:03:28.010> you<00:03:28.190> in<00:03:28.310> coat<00:03:28.519> raise<00:03:28.790> yes

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.649 

read<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.069> barcode<00:03:33.340> which<00:03:33.940> is<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.300> serial

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
read the barcode which is the serial

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.050 
read the barcode which is the serial
number<00:03:34.989> for<00:03:35.170> this<00:03:35.319> train<00:03:35.709> uh-huh<00:03:36.069> and<00:03:36.370> encode

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
number for this train uh-huh and encode

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.580 
number for this train uh-huh and encode
that<00:03:37.330> serial<00:03:37.780> number<00:03:37.810> into<00:03:38.500> our<00:03:38.830> heart<00:03:39.690> okay

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.670 

just<00:03:44.590> like<00:03:44.769> that<00:03:44.799> I<00:03:45.310> saw<00:03:46.269> I<00:03:46.659> saw<00:03:46.690> a<00:03:46.930> green<00:03:47.230> color

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
just like that I saw I saw a green color

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.600 
just like that I saw I saw a green color
flash<00:03:48.099> on<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.430> screen<00:03:48.459> there<00:03:53.340> can<00:03:54.340> you<00:03:54.489> do

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
flash on the screen there can you do

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.690 
flash on the screen there can you do
that<00:03:54.790> more<00:03:55.000> than<00:03:55.090> one<00:03:55.239> time<00:03:56.280> try<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:57.340> again<00:03:57.459> and

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
that more than one time try it again and

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.330 
that more than one time try it again and
see<00:03:57.760> what<00:03:58.000> happened<00:03:58.590> so<00:03:59.590> just<00:03:59.829> like<00:04:00.010> that<00:04:00.190> it

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
see what happened so just like that it

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.180 
see what happened so just like that it
scans<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.910> barcode<00:04:01.390> and<00:04:01.629> then<00:04:01.980> encodes<00:04:02.980> the

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
scans the barcode and then encodes the

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.369 
scans the barcode and then encodes the
RFID<00:04:03.579> tag<00:04:03.700> with<00:04:04.209> its<00:04:04.360> same<00:04:04.569> exact<00:04:04.989> serial

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
RFID tag with its same exact serial

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.640 
RFID tag with its same exact serial
number<00:04:05.650> data<00:04:06.209> into<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.360> chip<00:04:07.930> of<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.200> RFID

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
number data into the chip of the RFID

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.680 
number data into the chip of the RFID
tag<00:04:08.920> and<00:04:09.459> that<00:04:09.489> becomes<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.180> tracking<00:04:10.510> number

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
tag and that becomes the tracking number

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.500 
tag and that becomes the tracking number
for<00:04:11.260> that<00:04:11.290> tray<00:04:11.680> in<00:04:11.890> the<00:04:11.980> green<00:04:12.190> house<00:04:12.540> Wow<00:04:15.510> so

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
for that tray in the green house Wow so

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.409 
for that tray in the green house Wow so
that<00:04:16.720> thing<00:04:16.930> is<00:04:17.109> ready<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:17.709> be<00:04:18.030> ready<00:04:19.030> now<00:04:19.389> go

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
that thing is ready to be ready now go

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.219 
that thing is ready to be ready now go
through<00:04:20.019> our<00:04:20.199> production<00:04:20.859> system<00:04:21.250> okay<00:04:22.229> what

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
through our production system okay what

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.620 
through our production system okay what
happens<00:04:23.650> if<00:04:23.800> you<00:04:23.919> have<00:04:24.100> a<00:04:24.160> bad<00:04:24.550> RFID<00:04:25.360> tag

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
happens if you have a bad RFID tag

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.390 
happens if you have a bad RFID tag
because<00:04:25.990> then<00:04:26.320> you<00:04:26.440> do<00:04:26.590> get<00:04:26.770> those<00:04:26.979> once<00:04:27.310> a

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
because then you do get those once a

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.650 
because then you do get those once a
while<00:04:27.610> it<00:04:28.360> will<00:04:28.949> read<00:04:29.949> the<00:04:30.610> QR<00:04:30.850> code<00:04:31.210> but<00:04:31.539> it

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
while it will read the QR code but it

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.340 
while it will read the QR code but it
became<00:04:31.990> a<00:04:32.050> funny<00:04:32.410> or<00:04:32.680> a<00:04:32.740> tag<00:04:33.870> okay<00:04:34.870> look<00:04:35.080> you

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
became a funny or a tag okay look you

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.900 
became a funny or a tag okay look you
have<00:04:35.500> an<00:04:35.620> example<00:04:36.039> for<00:04:36.160> that<00:04:36.280> here<00:04:36.550> okay<00:04:38.910> it

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
have an example for that here okay it

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.219 
have an example for that here okay it
sounded<00:04:40.180> like<00:04:40.210> a<00:04:40.300> horn<00:04:40.630> can<00:04:40.900> you<00:04:40.990> do<00:04:41.110> that

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
sounded like a horn can you do that

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.690 
sounded like a horn can you do that
again<00:04:43.260> so<00:04:44.260> it's<00:04:44.470> reading<00:04:44.650> the<00:04:44.889> barcode<00:04:45.370> and<00:04:45.400> it

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
again so it's reading the barcode and it

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:57.160 
again so it's reading the barcode and it
cannot<00:04:46.060> it<00:04:46.690> cannot<00:04:46.840> encode<00:04:47.380> the<00:04:47.590> RFID<00:04:47.979> yes

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.280 

 we're<00:04:58.040> in<00:04:58.190> the<00:04:58.430> antenna<00:04:59.080> she<00:05:00.080> does

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
 we're in the antenna she does

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.590 
 we're in the antenna she does
reprint<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.830> label<00:05:01.160> and<00:05:01.340> and<00:05:01.850> then<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:02.480> cut

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
reprint the label and and then and cut

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.260 
reprint the label and and then and cut
it<00:05:02.750> and<00:05:02.840> you're<00:05:02.960> good<00:05:03.140> to<00:05:03.230> go<00:05:03.260> okay<00:05:04.060> well<00:05:05.060> thank

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
it and you're good to go okay well thank

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.900 
it and you're good to go okay well thank
you<00:05:05.330> for<00:05:05.510> that<00:05:05.600> demonstration
