people<00:01:00.780> who<00:01:01.170> are<00:01:01.289> saying<00:01:01.590> well<00:01:01.859> maybe<00:01:02.070> you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
people who are saying well maybe you

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.560 
people who are saying well maybe you

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
should pull out the starters and maybe

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.210 
should pull out the starters and maybe
only<00:01:03.780> let<00:01:03.960> them<00:01:04.049> play<00:01:04.199> three<00:01:04.710> quarters<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
only let them play three quarters of the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.380 
only let them play three quarters of the
game<00:01:05.400> if<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.610> get<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.760> little<00:01:05.909> bit<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.210> lead

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
game if you get a little bit of a lead

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.870 
game if you get a little bit of a lead
you<00:01:07.320> have<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> hole<00:01:07.890> basically<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.400> whole<00:01:08.549> month

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
you have a hole basically a whole month

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.730 
you have a hole basically a whole month
until<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.510> national<00:01:09.869> championship<00:01:10.380> game<00:01:10.409> too

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
until the national championship game too

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.800 
until the national championship game too
so<00:01:10.979> it's<00:01:11.159> not<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> NFL<00:01:11.729> where<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.479> maybe

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
so it's not like the NFL where you maybe

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.660 
so it's not like the NFL where you maybe
sit<00:01:13.080> some<00:01:13.229> starters<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.710> week<00:01:13.860> 16<00:01:14.220> before

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
defenders right there and the mindset of

defenders right there and the mindset of
these<00:02:33.790> receivers<00:02:34.180> is<00:02:34.569> it<00:02:34.840> is<00:02:34.989> my<00:02:35.319> ball<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:35.829> will

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
go up and take it away from you and so

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.339 
go up and take it away from you and so
you<00:02:39.010> can<00:02:39.250> expect<00:02:39.700> LSU's<00:02:40.510> defenders<00:02:40.989> to<00:02:41.019> be<00:02:41.230> as

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
fight when the ball comes down will go a

what you're seeing a bunch of giraffes I

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.710 
what you're seeing a bunch of giraffes I

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
even if they don't separate because when

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.740 
even if they don't separate because when
the<00:02:57.790> balls<00:02:57.970> in<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.209> air<00:02:58.239> they<00:02:58.450> shield

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879

Brown<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:09.609> tarvaris<00:03:09.970> King<00:03:10.180> all<00:03:10.299> those<00:03:10.450> big

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
Brown and tarvaris King all those big

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.479 
Brown and tarvaris King all those big
receivers<00:03:11.170> that<00:03:11.349> back<00:03:11.560> shoulder<00:03:11.980> fade<00:03:12.190> throw

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
receivers that back shoulder fade throw

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.580 
receivers that back shoulder fade throw
very<00:03:13.209> difficult<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.870> defend<00:03:14.139> when<00:03:14.500> you

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
very difficult to defend when you

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.740 
very difficult to defend when you
watching<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.040> passing<00:03:15.250> defense<00:03:15.670> for<00:03:16.120> LSU<00:03:16.450> on

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
watching the passing defense for LSU on

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.229 
watching the passing defense for LSU on
tape<00:03:16.959> there's<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.290> lot<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.709> hide<00:03:17.920> right<00:03:18.190> so<00:03:19.000> todd

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
tape there's a lot to hide right so todd

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.789 
tape there's a lot to hide right so todd
what<00:03:19.389> really<00:03:19.660> stands<00:03:19.930> out<00:03:20.079> what<00:03:20.260> separates

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
what really stands out what separates

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.400 
what really stands out what separates
this<00:03:21.130> passing<00:03:21.730> defense<00:03:21.849> from<00:03:22.239> other<00:03:22.510> teams<00:03:22.780> ok

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
this passing defense from other teams ok

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.229 
this passing defense from other teams ok
but<00:03:23.560> when<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:24.040> have<00:03:24.069> bigger<00:03:24.370> receivers<00:03:24.790> like

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
but when you have bigger receivers like

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.240 
but when you have bigger receivers like
georgia<00:03:25.720> does<00:03:25.989> sometimes<00:03:26.709> it<00:03:26.859> takes<00:03:26.980> them<00:03:27.220> a

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
georgia does sometimes it takes them a

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.530 
georgia does sometimes it takes them a
little<00:03:27.400> bit<00:03:27.579> longer<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:27.940> get<00:03:28.030> down<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.359> field

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
little bit longer to get down the field

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.509 
little bit longer to get down the field
and<00:03:28.780> so<00:03:28.989> that's<00:03:29.200> an<00:03:29.349> opportunity<00:03:29.590> then<00:03:30.130> for

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
and so that's an opportunity then for

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.879 
and so that's an opportunity then for
LSU's<00:03:31.000> pass<00:03:31.299> rush<00:03:31.630> if<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:31.989> watch<00:03:32.230> John<00:03:32.590> Chavis

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
LSU's pass rush if you watch John Chavis

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.280 
LSU's pass rush if you watch John Chavis
he<00:03:33.430> does<00:03:33.579> a<00:03:33.609> great<00:03:33.849> job<00:03:34.000> of<00:03:34.239> showing<00:03:34.870> a<00:03:35.079> one

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
he does a great job of showing a one

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.140 
he does a great job of showing a one
look<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:35.680> then<00:03:35.950> changing<00:03:36.730> it<00:03:36.849> right<00:03:37.000> before

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
look and then changing it right before

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.120 
look and then changing it right before
the<00:03:37.419> snap<00:03:37.569> here<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:37.930> see<00:03:38.139> six<00:03:38.500> or<00:03:38.680> coming<00:03:39.010> at

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
by looping there was a great individual

was not one of the original 60 they show
a<00:03:56.440> potential<00:03:56.859> for<00:03:57.160> six<00:03:57.400> flips<00:03:57.609> is<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.849> come

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
a potential for six flips is to come

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.270 
a potential for six flips is to come
they<00:03:58.450> dropped<00:03:58.810> three<00:03:59.200> of<00:03:59.349> those<00:03:59.500> original<00:04:00.040> six

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
they dropped three of those original six

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.280 
they dropped three of those original six
back<00:04:00.489> and<00:04:00.760> then<00:04:01.180> they<00:04:01.359> wind<00:04:01.569> up<00:04:01.720> sending<00:04:02.139> the

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
back and then they wind up sending the

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.409 
back and then they wind up sending the
corner<00:04:02.709> back<00:04:02.859> off<00:04:03.099> the<00:04:03.370> edge<00:04:03.400> so<00:04:03.879> a<00:04:04.060> lot<00:04:04.389> of

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:04.419 
corner back off the edge so a lot of

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:06.240 
corner back off the edge so a lot of
confusion<00:04:04.959> for<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.319> quarterback<00:04:05.799> as<00:04:05.980> to

going to block when the ball is snapped
sometimes<00:04:13.539> that<00:04:13.720> confusion<00:04:14.139> can<00:04:14.470> lead<00:04:14.650> to<00:04:14.769> one

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:14.919 
sometimes that confusion can lead to one

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.379 
sometimes that confusion can lead to one
false<00:04:15.220> step<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.669> then<00:04:16.000> you<00:04:16.120> have<00:04:16.209> an<00:04:16.269> issue

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
false step and then you have an issue

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.180 
false step and then you have an issue
Georgia<00:04:17.259> left<00:04:17.530> to<00:04:17.620> counter<00:04:17.949> that<00:04:18.070> with

they face great passing attacks in West
Virginia<00:04:24.910> but<00:04:25.600> this<00:04:25.690> will<00:04:25.870> be<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.020> best

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
Virginia but this will be the best

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
additive that's going to be a great game

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.230 
additive that's going to be a great game
I<00:05:17.919> also<00:05:18.130> want<00:05:18.340> to<00:05:18.370> see<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:18.580> ACC<00:05:19.030> championship

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
I also want to see the ACC championship

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.420 
I also want to see the ACC championship
because<00:05:19.690> when<00:05:19.900> you<00:05:20.229> look<00:05:20.650> back<00:05:20.680> to<00:05:21.039> it<00:05:21.310> was

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
because when you look back to it was

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.460 
because when you look back to it was
really<00:05:21.610> the<00:05:21.639> first<00:05:21.729> game<00:05:22.240> in<00:05:22.509> early<00:05:22.990> October

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
really the first game in early October

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.930 
really the first game in early October
that<00:05:23.590> Virginia<00:05:23.949> Tech<00:05:24.130> played<00:05:24.400> because<00:05:24.729> the

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
that Virginia Tech played because the

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.370 
that Virginia Tech played because the
first<00:05:25.150> floor<00:05:25.330> they<00:05:25.509> scheduled<00:05:25.960> were<00:05:26.080> a<00:05:26.110> joke

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
first floor they scheduled were a joke

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.050 
first floor they scheduled were a joke
and<00:05:26.650> so<00:05:26.800> they<00:05:27.220> came<00:05:27.400> into<00:05:27.580> that<00:05:27.729> I<00:05:27.759> don't<00:05:27.940> think

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
and so they came into that I don't think

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.309 
and so they came into that I don't think
they<00:05:28.120> were<00:05:28.210> prepared<00:05:28.630> they<00:05:28.870> had<00:05:29.110> a<00:05:29.139> young

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
they were prepared they had a young

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:30.990 
they were prepared they had a young
quarterback<00:05:29.560> who's<00:05:30.100> really<00:05:30.340> developed<00:05:30.789> since

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
quarterback who's really developed since

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.730 
quarterback who's really developed since
then<00:05:31.240> I<00:05:31.419> think<00:05:31.720> David<00:05:32.020> Wilson<00:05:32.380> at<00:05:32.470> running

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
then I think David Wilson at running

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.350 
then I think David Wilson at running
back<00:05:32.770> has<00:05:33.100> become<00:05:33.430> one<00:05:33.550> of<00:05:33.610> the<00:05:33.759> elite<00:05:34.060> backs

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
back has become one of the elite backs

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.360 
back has become one of the elite backs
in<00:05:34.569> the<00:05:34.660> country<00:05:35.020> of<00:05:35.050> speed<00:05:35.440> and<00:05:35.650> instincts<00:05:36.190> I

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
in the country of speed and instincts I

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.850 
in the country of speed and instincts I
think<00:05:37.060> Virginia<00:05:37.180> Tech<00:05:37.600> avenges<00:05:38.229> that<00:05:38.440> lost<00:05:38.710> in

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
think Virginia Tech avenges that lost in

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.050 
think Virginia Tech avenges that lost in
the<00:05:38.919> ACC<00:05:39.310> championship<00:05:39.490> game<00:05:39.910> and

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
the ACC championship game and

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.909 
the ACC championship game and
potentially<00:05:40.810> depending<00:05:41.080> on<00:05:41.319> how<00:05:41.680> things

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
potentially depending on how things

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.170 
potentially depending on how things
shake<00:05:42.160> out<00:05:42.310> could<00:05:42.520> make<00:05:42.669> things<00:05:42.880> interesting

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
shake out could make things interesting

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.909 
shake out could make things interesting
and<00:05:43.600> and<00:05:43.720> how<00:05:44.080> the<00:05:44.139> the<00:05:44.500> bcs<00:05:44.889> national

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919
