00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
hatch isn't too big actually you'd

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.370 
hatch isn't too big actually you'd
probably<00:01:04.400> just<00:01:04.580> put<00:01:04.879> something<00:01:05.239> in<00:01:05.360> here<00:01:05.630> such

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
probably just put something in here such

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.160 
probably just put something in here such
as<00:01:06.590> a<00:01:06.620> camera<00:01:07.159> keys<00:01:07.880> wallet<00:01:08.479> things<00:01:08.750> like<00:01:08.960> that

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
that's why it's not deep it's only about

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.660 
that's why it's not deep it's only about
inch<00:01:13.820> to<00:01:14.150> an<00:01:14.270> inch<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:14.479> a<00:01:14.570> half<00:01:14.630> deep<00:01:15.670> the

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
inch to an inch and a half deep the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.730 
inch to an inch and a half deep the
hatch<00:01:16.909> itself<00:01:17.420> has<00:01:18.220> a<00:01:19.220> hard<00:01:20.200> I'm<00:01:21.200> covering<00:01:21.650> on

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
hatch itself has a hard I'm covering on

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.100 
hatch itself has a hard I'm covering on
top<00:01:21.979> and<00:01:22.250> then<00:01:22.340> rubber<00:01:22.549> around<00:01:22.790> the<00:01:22.909> edges<00:01:23.210> and

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
top and then rubber around the edges and

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.100 
top and then rubber around the edges and
then<00:01:24.170> right<00:01:24.500> here<00:01:24.530> it's<00:01:25.010> got<00:01:25.340> a<00:01:25.580> hole<00:01:26.080> so<00:01:27.080> that

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
then right here it's got a hole so that

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.370 
then right here it's got a hole so that
you<00:01:27.470> could<00:01:27.650> put<00:01:27.860> like<00:01:27.890> um<00:01:29.080> probably<00:01:30.080> just<00:01:30.290> like

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
you could put like um probably just like
