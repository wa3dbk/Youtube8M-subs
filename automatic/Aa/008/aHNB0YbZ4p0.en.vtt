00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hello to all we find ourselves for a 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.190
 new video and this time it's 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.710
 to mount body damage so I had 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.210
 already his jewels maj I thought by doing 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.889
 body damage of suits at knees 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.809
 help mom the demand and so I'm going to 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.910
 to do and then it's perfect like that I 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.529
 will be able to fill low on my site 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.230
 internet but you turn putting on every 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.960
 times the video under montesson I go 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.840
 tribute because damage and costumes age I 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.210
 starts with body damage 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.349
 and then I create a video just after 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.559
 on age suit so to start on 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.649
 will make improve a belt of 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.480
 the adventurer so he will have to alternate 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.550
 runes to their intelligence strength 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.290
 agility luck as you want it 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.640
 depends what you have me I 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.079
 a lot of rumors 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.579
 an intelligence to have the best is to 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.120
 move from the smart until that 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.309
 that they could have that hop 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.039
 so here's hop I have six left 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.920
 intelligence and wisdom then I 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.239
 iron runes luck and so on and 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.229
 caetera and then you arrange for 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:09.399
 go up to level 4 at the frame level you 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:11.860
 go take boots for the boots 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:14.530
 it's the boots of cluses this poc words 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.880
 it is pronounced and we will alternate say 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.880
 a strength and intelligence 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.979
 so to read an intelligence that is 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.750
 of the negative it will pass his pass in 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.530
 positive and then suddenly it takes us away 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.869
 of the force 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.780
 and then with each success you win 10 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.119
 experience where there is less intelligence 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.270
 Then you return runes must 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.220
 here I am here to you alternate the 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.710
 force swirl the intelligence goes down that 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.039
 is very successful you win full 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.710
 of xp quickly so that's why 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:51.310
 then once you have improved 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.939
 his boots must be taken again 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.829
 belts and so when you are level 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.719
 11 you can make belts of 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.460
 tofu so that you go a lot the 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:04.299
 keep up to the level 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.920
 50 55 pretty much you go for 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.369
 alternate agility runes and 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.090
 intelligence so the same you go to 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.740
 pretty much var an intelligence like that 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.470
 story to well increase intelligence 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.730
 you diminish all the agility and then 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.540
 after you alternate you will redo 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.970
 came and one of agility so I have 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.470
 here here 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.959
 and then it's really very successful 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.370
 on veil ban my screen success success 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.750
 success for it's also because I 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.880
 am level 100 but you are going to have 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.380
 a lot of success anyway and so 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.890
 you will quickly mount your 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.390
 trade so that's for the belt of the 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.739
 tofu so that's going to be a pretty long 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.600
 step because you have to go to 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.760
 level 50 this is the most 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.890
 water and after you will be able 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.180
 use the chef's script so drink 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.890
 does level 50 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.080
 I advise you to wait 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.000
 level 55 because the more you go 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.459
 go up more had more you're going to have 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.470
 of success rate to pass the 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.080
 colds and as you earn xp that 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.420
 when you run runes it can 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.700
 to be fairly profitable enough to wait for the 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.920
 level 55 e for me that's what I 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.840
 do every time I'm not sure that 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.190
 it's the right technique but I 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.760
 think it's a lot better 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.260
 blow the ex p goes faster 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.440
 for the chef's script drink it takes 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.170
 alternate the runes force and agility so 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.450
 about 30 he a force we make them 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.350
 all pass and after a term male 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.300
 you come back agility does not break too much 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.470
 jet because after I improved it then I 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.690
 will sell them sell hotel 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.310
 such a story of not having too much 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.760
 losses 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.849
 so that's alternated that up to the level 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.920
 or so nature at levels 125 I 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.890
 believe so here is the best is to go 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.379
 up to level 60 3 with ace slip 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.000
 of the chef drink and on the focused nature so 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.209
 I have already bought unrated before 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.120
 tapas each is broken but otherwise 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.370
 fifty 50 agility of strength so you 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.489
 alternate the airs an intelligence and 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.549
 agility on it so there you can 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:10.060
 squarely past 50 a 50 street agility 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.530
 of intelligence and so on blow you 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.090
 can watch TV quietly 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.180
 in the meantime you just have all the 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.940
 60 street changed there you go up 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.639
 very quickly at least a half 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.280
 hour you will go from level 60 to 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:27.039
 It's really fast since 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.630
 there you win that I tell you no 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.940
 nonsense i will check on my site 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.560
 Internet 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.550
 125 you gain 100 experience at 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.530
 every success 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.180
 so it's huge and there's a lot more 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.110
 of success of which there is no problem 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.539
 goes up very fast 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.979
 so that's for the craft of strings maj 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.870
 so you see it's pretty simple to 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.830
 to go up in one day is enough 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.300
 so I remind you to buy so 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.639
 the nature oriented you are at the top 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.250
 level the style of the chief edge the belt 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.660
 tofu and clues boots and then 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.970
 the belt or boots of 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.650
 the adventurer as you want so 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.210
 that's it for this little tutorial I put everything from 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.310
 further on my website and then we 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.910
 is right now for the tutorial

 age costumes
