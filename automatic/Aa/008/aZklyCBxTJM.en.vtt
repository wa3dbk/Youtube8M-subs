okay<00:00:02.330> but<00:00:03.330> before<00:00:03.689> I<00:00:03.720> did<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.529> I<00:00:05.430> am<00:00:05.580> base<00:00:05.879> pedal

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
okay but before I did a I am base pedal

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.009 
okay but before I did a I am base pedal
repair<00:00:07.820> and<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:09.389> know<00:00:09.450> it<00:00:09.660> was<00:00:09.809> only<00:00:09.900> a

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
repair and I know it was only a

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.509 
repair and I know it was only a
temporary<00:00:10.260> fix<00:00:10.559> it<00:00:11.040> was<00:00:11.130> kind<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.400> an

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
temporary fix it was kind of an

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.610 
temporary fix it was kind of an
on-the-fly<00:00:11.820> thing<00:00:12.269> but<00:00:13.019> this<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.320> one<00:00:13.469> that

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
on-the-fly thing but this is one that

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.910 
on-the-fly thing but this is one that
I'm<00:00:13.679> gonna<00:00:13.769> show<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.940> ion<00:00:15.299> cymbals

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
I'm gonna show you for the ion cymbals

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.340 
I'm gonna show you for the ion cymbals
which<00:00:16.940> for<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.000> most<00:00:18.240> part<00:00:18.539> for<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.900> while<00:00:19.109> they

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
which for the most part for a while they

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.189 
which for the most part for a while they
were<00:00:19.380> pretty<00:00:19.770> reliable<00:00:20.279> but<00:00:20.660> after<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> while<00:00:21.900> I

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
were pretty reliable but after a while I

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.670 
were pretty reliable but after a while I
noticed<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.590> car<00:00:22.800> hits<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:24.380> one<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.500> my<00:00:25.590> other

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
noticed the car hits and one of my other

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.849 
noticed the car hits and one of my other
symbols<00:00:26.130> before<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.779> had<00:00:27.779> taken<00:00:28.170> apart<00:00:28.560> and

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
symbols before I had taken apart and

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.429 
symbols before I had taken apart and
fixed<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.880> it's<00:00:30.660> been<00:00:30.810> working<00:00:31.199> for

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
fixed it and it's been working for

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.220 
fixed it and it's been working for
several<00:00:31.710> months<00:00:32.189> now<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.669> just<00:00:33.660> recently<00:00:34.050> one

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
several months now and just recently one

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.870 
several months now and just recently one
of<00:00:34.320> my<00:00:34.380> other<00:00:34.530> symbols<00:00:34.980> started<00:00:35.280> acting<00:00:35.610> up<00:00:35.700> so

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
of my other symbols started acting up so

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.119 
of my other symbols started acting up so
I<00:00:35.940> did<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.210> same<00:00:36.390> thing<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:36.960> decided<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.680> I

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
I did the same thing so I decided that I

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.590 
I did the same thing so I decided that I
was<00:00:38.489> going<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.700> go<00:00:38.820> ahead<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.180> show<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.450> guys

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
was going to go ahead and show you guys

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.310 
was going to go ahead and show you guys
what<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.870> did

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
what I did

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.920 
what I did
this<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:43.170> regular<00:00:43.320> symbol<00:00:44.420> now<00:00:45.420> what

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
this is the regular symbol now what

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.200 
this is the regular symbol now what
happens<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.770> eventually<00:00:47.640> what's<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.090> to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
happens is eventually what's going to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.290 
happens is eventually what's going to
cause<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.750> thing<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.140> break<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.969> this<00:00:50.969> part

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
cause this thing to break is this part

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.950 
cause this thing to break is this part
here<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.980> going<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.160> end<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.960> separating

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
here is going to end up separating

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.979 
here is going to end up separating
itself<00:00:55.230> from<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.620> mainframe<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.989> what

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
itself from the mainframe and what

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.260 
itself from the mainframe and what
happens<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.620> when<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> hit<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.399> this<00:01:00.030> thing

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
happens is when you hit it this thing

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.460 
happens is when you hit it this thing
will<00:01:00.390> actually<00:01:00.770> in<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:02.670> very<00:01:02.910> short<00:01:03.210> distance

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
will actually in a very short distance

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.250 
will actually in a very short distance
go<00:01:04.470> down<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.010> slap<00:01:05.309> itself<00:01:05.729> back<00:01:06.030> up<00:01:06.240> which<00:01:07.080> is

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
go down and slap itself back up which is

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.710 
go down and slap itself back up which is
what<00:01:07.409> causes<00:01:07.680> an<00:01:07.979> extra<00:01:08.250> hit<00:01:08.450> which<00:01:09.450> will

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
what causes an extra hit which will

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.320 
what causes an extra hit which will
always<00:01:10.049> break<00:01:10.290> combos<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:12.030> just<00:01:12.210> not

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
always break combos and it's just not

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.880 
always break combos and it's just not
good<00:01:12.740> so<00:01:13.740> what<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.580> did<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.090> first<00:01:15.270> one<00:01:15.890> was

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
good so what I did to the first one was

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.950 
good so what I did to the first one was
I'm<00:01:17.610> not<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.000> actually<00:01:18.450> take<00:01:18.810> this

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
I'm not going to actually take this

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.870 
I'm not going to actually take this
apart<00:01:19.290> right<00:01:19.439> now<00:01:19.500> because<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.159> just<00:01:20.430> that

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
apart right now because it's just that

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.120 
apart right now because it's just that
simple<00:01:21.119> but<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.110> can<00:01:22.259> use<00:01:22.380> use<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> regular

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
simple but you can use use a regular

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.789 
simple but you can use use a regular
Phillips<00:01:23.549> head<00:01:23.759> screwdriver<00:01:24.240> take<00:01:25.140> out<00:01:25.350> all

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
Phillips head screwdriver take out all

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.240 
Phillips head screwdriver take out all
nine<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.340> these<00:01:26.640> screws<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.740> one<00:01:28.740> other<00:01:28.890> thing

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
nine of these screws and one other thing

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.429 
nine of these screws and one other thing
that's<00:01:29.400> important<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.780> want<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.020> take<00:01:31.229> off

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
that's important is you want to take off

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.980 
that's important is you want to take off
this<00:01:31.650> nut<00:01:31.950> right<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:32.750> because<00:01:33.750> that

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
this nut right here because that

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.219 
this nut right here because that
actually<00:01:34.200> holds<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> jack<00:01:35.659> for<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.720> stereo

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
actually holds the jack for the stereo

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.520 
actually holds the jack for the stereo
cord<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.799> what<00:01:38.759> happens<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.509> once<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.320> lift

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
cord and what happens is once you lift

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.639 
cord and what happens is once you lift
this<00:01:40.710> off<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:42.030> get<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> set<00:01:42.659> up<00:01:42.810> somewhat<00:01:43.470> like

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
this off you get a set up somewhat like

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.620 
this off you get a set up somewhat like
this<00:01:43.860> now<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.759> actually<00:01:45.240> going<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.509> be

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
this now this is actually going to be

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.399 
this now this is actually going to be
attached<00:01:46.170> inside<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:47.759> at<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.630> hole<00:01:48.840> so

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
attached inside of here at this hole so

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.020 
attached inside of here at this hole so
you<00:01:49.470> got<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.680> be<00:01:49.770> careful<00:01:49.950> not<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.460> pull<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.880> it

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
you got to be careful not to pull on it

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.700 
you got to be careful not to pull on it
because<00:01:51.329> you'll<00:01:51.659> break<00:01:51.899> these<00:01:52.079> wires<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
because you'll break these wires and

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.639 
because you'll break these wires and
that's<00:01:52.829> not<00:01:53.009> good<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.320> see<00:01:55.500> on

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
that's not good so and you can see on

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.389 
that's not good so and you can see on
this<00:01:55.860> one<00:01:56.070> what<00:01:56.610> happens<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:58.219> like<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.340> said

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
this one what happens is like I said

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.790 
this one what happens is like I said
there's<00:01:59.820> these<00:01:59.939> little<00:02:00.119> plastic<00:02:00.390> channels

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
there's these little plastic channels

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.850 
there's these little plastic channels
that<00:02:02.430> will<00:02:02.670> break<00:02:03.060> away<00:02:03.300> from<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.680> main

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
that will break away from the main

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.960 
that will break away from the main
symbol<00:02:05.190> and<00:02:05.550> cause<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.660> to<00:02:07.160> just<00:02:08.160> flap<00:02:08.550> back<00:02:08.729> up

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
symbol and cause it to just flap back up

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.570 
symbol and cause it to just flap back up
on<00:02:09.150> it<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.320> you<00:02:10.380> can<00:02:10.530> see<00:02:10.740> where<00:02:11.190> it's

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
on it so and you can see where it's

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.870 
on it so and you can see where it's
actually<00:02:12.570> stuck<00:02:13.260> I'm<00:02:13.860> one<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.250> these<00:02:14.370> miss

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
actually stuck I'm one of these miss

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.450 
actually stuck I'm one of these miss
front<00:02:15.150> one<00:02:15.330> here<00:02:16.130> where<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.220> broke<00:02:17.520> off<00:02:19.460> so

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
front one here where it broke off so

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.270 
front one here where it broke off so
what<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.760> want<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:20.970> do<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.750> only<00:02:22.200> tool<00:02:22.470> you

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
what you want to do the only tool you

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.560 
what you want to do the only tool you
need<00:02:23.430> aside<00:02:23.820> from<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.150> screwdriver

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
need aside from the screwdriver

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.230 
need aside from the screwdriver
obviously<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.830> do<00:02:25.980> this<00:02:26.160> repair<00:02:26.520> is<00:02:26.580> just

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
obviously to do this repair is just

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.530 
obviously to do this repair is just
epoxy<00:02:27.810> now<00:02:28.650> on<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.400> first<00:02:29.700> one<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.210> used

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
epoxy now on the first one I used

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.730 
epoxy now on the first one I used
regular<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:32.130> old<00:02:32.250> fashioned<00:02:32.730> mix<00:02:32.940> epoxy<00:02:33.740> I

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
regular the old fashioned mix epoxy I

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.340 
regular the old fashioned mix epoxy I
actually<00:02:35.220> went<00:02:35.580> ahead<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.150> splurged<00:02:36.960> on<00:02:37.050> some

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
actually went ahead and splurged on some

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.230 
actually went ahead and splurged on some
mighty<00:02:37.560> putty<00:02:37.860> which<00:02:38.400> was<00:02:38.550> only<00:02:38.790> five<00:02:38.970> bucks

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
mighty putty which was only five bucks

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.080 
mighty putty which was only five bucks
more<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:40.010> it<00:02:41.010> was<00:02:41.130> actually<00:02:41.370> cleaner<00:02:41.820> and

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
more and it was actually cleaner and

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.330 
more and it was actually cleaner and
easier<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.630> it<00:02:42.810> worked<00:02:43.200> actually<00:02:43.800> just<00:02:44.190> as

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
easier and it worked actually just as

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.060 
easier and it worked actually just as
well<00:02:44.520> as<00:02:44.700> regular<00:02:45.060> epoxy<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:45.840> I<00:02:46.110> guess<00:02:46.830> Billy

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
well as regular epoxy so I guess Billy

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.890 
well as regular epoxy so I guess Billy
Mays<00:02:47.280> got<00:02:47.520> it<00:02:47.670> right<00:02:47.880> because<00:02:48.210> it<00:02:48.540> is<00:02:48.660> pretty

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
Mays got it right because it is pretty

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.360 
Mays got it right because it is pretty
damn<00:02:49.080> good

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
damn good

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.660 
damn good
so<00:02:50.370> what<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.510> do<00:02:51.660> is<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.890> have<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.070> be<00:02:53.190> careful

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
so what you do is you have to be careful

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.480 
so what you do is you have to be careful
and<00:02:54.270> make<00:02:54.990> sure<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.620> thing<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:55.980> up<00:02:56.250> at

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
and make sure that this thing is up at

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.000 
and make sure that this thing is up at
an<00:02:57.060> angle<00:02:57.210> to<00:02:57.510> where<00:02:57.630> you<00:02:57.780> can<00:02:57.960> still<00:02:58.230> plug<00:02:58.830> it

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
an angle to where you can still plug it

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.760 
an angle to where you can still plug it
in<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.970> all<00:03:00.390> you<00:03:00.540> want<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.810> do<00:03:00.960> is<00:03:01.140> just<00:03:01.260> epoxy

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
in and all you want to do is just epoxy

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.870 
in and all you want to do is just epoxy
it<00:03:01.860> down<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.360> that's<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.600> and<00:03:04.460> what<00:03:05.460> that<00:03:05.640> does

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
it down and that's it and what that does

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
it down and that's it and what that does
is<00:03:06.360> because<00:03:06.870> now<00:03:07.110> this<00:03:07.350> isn't<00:03:07.530> here<00:03:07.890> anymore

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
is because now this isn't here anymore

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.690 
is because now this isn't here anymore
it's<00:03:09.900> not<00:03:10.080> gonna<00:03:10.320> slap<00:03:10.620> back<00:03:10.860> up<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.280> trigger

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
it's not gonna slap back up and trigger

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.110 
it's not gonna slap back up and trigger
the<00:03:11.790> piezo<00:03:12.180> sensor<00:03:12.540> again<00:03:13.040> so<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.459> that's<00:03:14.910> it

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
the piezo sensor again so and that's it

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.020 
the piezo sensor again so and that's it
and<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:16.560> works<00:03:16.770> perfectly<00:03:17.250> great<00:03:19.160> my<00:03:20.160> old<00:03:20.370> high

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
and it works perfectly great my old high

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.850 
and it works perfectly great my old high
score<00:03:21.330> on<00:03:21.540> panic<00:03:21.900> attack<00:03:22.200> was<00:03:22.410> three<00:03:22.560> hundred

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
score on panic attack was three hundred

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.530 
score on panic attack was three hundred
seventy<00:03:23.190> three<00:03:23.340> thousand<00:03:23.970> or<00:03:24.239> three<00:03:24.300> hundred

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
seventy three thousand or three hundred

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.870 
seventy three thousand or three hundred
seventy<00:03:24.989> thousand<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.860> I<00:03:26.190> beat<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.400> by<00:03:26.580> twenty

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
seventy thousand and I beat it by twenty

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.720 
seventy thousand and I beat it by twenty
five<00:03:27.000> thousand<00:03:27.510> with<00:03:27.780> just<00:03:28.250> this<00:03:29.250> fixed

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
five thousand with just this fixed

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.890 
five thousand with just this fixed
symbol<00:03:30.120> today<00:03:30.330> because<00:03:30.540> this<00:03:30.630> has<00:03:30.750> been

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
symbol today because this has been

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.720 
symbol today because this has been
acting<00:03:31.200> up<00:03:31.320> for<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.560> couple<00:03:31.920> weeks<00:03:31.950> now<00:03:32.220> and

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
acting up for a couple weeks now and

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.370 
acting up for a couple weeks now and
eventually<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:33.600> just<00:03:33.660> stopped<00:03:33.959> using<00:03:34.140> them

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
eventually I just stopped using them

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.250 
eventually I just stopped using them
beside<00:03:34.709> doing<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.250> go<00:03:35.489> for<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:35.790> again<00:03:36.260> so

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
beside doing it go for it again so

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.220 
beside doing it go for it again so
that's<00:03:37.860> pretty<00:03:38.130> much<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:38.580> it's<00:03:39.510> easy<00:03:39.900> it's

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
that's pretty much it it's easy it's

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.440 
that's pretty much it it's easy it's
simple<00:03:40.350> and<00:03:40.920> it<00:03:41.280> saves<00:03:41.550> you<00:03:41.670> fifty<00:03:42.000> bucks<00:03:42.030> and

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
simple and it saves you fifty bucks and

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.880 
simple and it saves you fifty bucks and
then<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.630> can<00:03:42.780> actually<00:03:43.080> replace<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.560> symbol

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
then you can actually replace the symbol

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.310 
then you can actually replace the symbol
when<00:03:44.040> it's<00:03:44.190> really<00:03:44.400> done<00:03:44.670> so<00:03:45.540> good<00:03:46.140> luck<00:03:46.260> with

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
when it's really done so good luck with

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.620 
when it's really done so good luck with
this
