00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
things about this rule is that after

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.390 
things about this rule is that after
you've<00:06:10.449> used<00:06:10.509> it<00:06:10.930> for<00:06:11.139> a<00:06:11.169> while<00:06:11.349> and<00:06:11.400> exhausted

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
you've used it for a while and exhausted

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.629 
you've used it for a while and exhausted
the<00:06:12.759> idea<00:06:13.410> you<00:06:14.410> can<00:06:14.560> break<00:06:14.860> out<00:06:15.130> of<00:06:15.160> the<00:06:15.460> rule

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
the idea you can break out of the rule

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.339 
the idea you can break out of the rule
and<00:06:15.910> just<00:06:16.060> play<00:06:16.240> like<00:06:16.270> you<00:06:16.539> normally<00:06:16.690> do<00:06:17.110> and

and just play like you normally do and

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:19.379 
and just play like you normally do and
suddenly<00:06:17.979> you're<00:06:18.190> normal<00:06:18.729> playing<00:06:19.000> feels

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:19.389 
suddenly you're normal playing feels

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:22.339 
suddenly you're normal playing feels
like<00:06:19.630> such<00:06:19.900> an<00:06:19.949> incredible<00:06:20.949> relief<00:06:21.460> and<00:06:21.849> it

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:22.349 
like such an incredible relief and it

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:25.170 
like such an incredible relief and it
sounds<00:06:23.349> way<00:06:23.860> more<00:06:23.889> effective<00:06:24.669> than<00:06:24.789> normal

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
sounds way more effective than normal

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.450 
sounds way more effective than normal
because<00:06:25.330> it's<00:06:25.810> contextualized<00:06:26.800> by<00:06:26.949> this<00:06:27.190> very

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
because it's contextualized by this very

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.390 
because it's contextualized by this very
simplistic<00:06:28.000> sparse<00:06:28.680> kind<00:06:29.680> of<00:06:29.770> approach<00:06:30.130> that

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
simplistic sparse kind of approach that

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.600 
simplistic sparse kind of approach that
you<00:06:30.550> have<00:06:30.699> at<00:06:30.819> the<00:06:30.940> beginning<00:06:31.710> so<00:06:32.710> I<00:06:33.039> recommend

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
you have at the beginning so I recommend

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.480 
you have at the beginning so I recommend
taking<00:06:34.509> the<00:06:34.780> rule<00:06:34.990> and<00:06:35.199> starting<00:06:36.160> your<00:06:36.280> solo

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
taking the rule and starting your solo

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.330 
taking the rule and starting your solo
with<00:06:36.729> it<00:06:36.940> like<00:06:37.150> I<00:06:37.300> did<00:06:37.360> and<00:06:37.750> then<00:06:38.410> breaking<00:06:39.070> out

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340 
with it like I did and then breaking out

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.580 
with it like I did and then breaking out
of<00:06:39.460> the<00:06:39.550> rule<00:06:39.759> for<00:06:40.270> a<00:06:40.330> climactic<00:06:40.900> point<00:06:41.110> and

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
of the rule for a climactic point and

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.680 
of the rule for a climactic point and
then<00:06:41.860> returning<00:06:42.280> to<00:06:42.550> the<00:06:42.639> rule<00:06:42.849> again<00:06:43.180> so<00:06:43.660> I

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
then returning to the rule again so I

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.860 
then returning to the rule again so I
hope<00:06:43.870> you<00:06:44.110> enjoy<00:06:44.440> this<00:06:44.620> lesson<00:06:45.160> and<00:06:45.370> that<00:06:45.870> this
