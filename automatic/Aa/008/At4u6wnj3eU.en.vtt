think<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:46.320> was<00:01:46.530> from<00:01:47.210> from<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.360> attacker

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
think it was from from a attacker

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.560 
think it was from from a attacker
attacker<00:01:49.619> i<00:01:49.770> think<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.189> was<00:01:50.310> from<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.790> special

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
attacker i think it was from a special

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.030 
attacker i think it was from a special
attacker<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:52.020> electrode<00:01:52.439> or<00:01:52.470> something<00:01:52.890> i

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
attacker like electrode or something i

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.950 
attacker like electrode or something i
lived<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.030> totally<00:01:54.240> made<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.810> big

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
lived that and that totally made a big

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.929 
lived that and that totally made a big
difference<00:01:55.140> for<00:01:55.409> me<00:01:55.590> but<00:01:56.189> he<00:01:56.430> exploded<00:01:56.790> which

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
difference for me but he exploded which

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.550 
difference for me but he exploded which
was<00:01:57.149> probably<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.479> really<00:01:57.630> good<00:01:57.750> move<00:01:58.049> on<00:01:58.320> his

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
was probably a really good move on his

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.889 
was probably a really good move on his
part<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.070> fake<00:02:00.060> out<00:02:00.180> makes<00:02:00.360> me<00:02:00.420> flinch<00:02:00.750> and

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
part and fake out makes me flinch and

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.069 
part and fake out makes me flinch and
that<00:02:01.020> makes<00:02:01.200> me<00:02:01.320> sad<00:02:01.350> but<00:02:01.860> luckily<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:03.079> don't

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
that makes me sad but luckily I don't

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.359 
that makes me sad but luckily I don't

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590

slap<00:03:20.069> me<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.519> decided<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.120> overheat<00:03:21.480> on<00:03:21.569> him

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
slap me I decided to overheat on him

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.770 
slap me I decided to overheat on him
because<00:03:22.109> it'll<00:03:22.380> kill<00:03:22.650> him<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:23.120> I<00:03:24.120> probably

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
because it'll kill him and I probably

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.479 
because it'll kill him and I probably
could<00:03:25.049> have<00:03:25.079> gotten<00:03:25.290> away<00:03:25.470> with<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.920> eruption

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.340 
could have gotten away with the eruption
but<00:03:26.819> knowing<00:03:27.359> that<00:03:27.510> he's<00:03:27.690> probably<00:03:27.930> switch<00:03:28.200> to

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
but knowing that he's probably switch to

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.440 
but knowing that he's probably switch to
something<00:03:28.590> faster<00:03:29.160> than<00:03:29.400> me<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:29.700> really<00:03:30.030> didn't

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
something faster than me I really didn't

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.319 
something faster than me I really didn't
want<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.959> but<00:03:31.739> I<00:03:31.769> decided<00:03:32.130> to<00:03:32.220> stay<00:03:32.489> in<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:33.090> die

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
want to but I decided to stay in and die

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.479 
want to but I decided to stay in and die
and<00:03:33.810> i<00:03:34.170> wish<00:03:34.380> i<00:03:34.500> had<00:03:34.620> full<00:03:34.799> power<00:03:35.010> on<00:03:35.160> that

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
and i wish i had full power on that

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.710 
and i wish i had full power on that
because<00:03:35.790> i<00:03:35.880> probably<00:03:36.090> would<00:03:36.299> have<00:03:36.359> killed<00:03:36.540> him

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
because i probably would have killed him

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.589 
because i probably would have killed him
but<00:03:36.930> no<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.829> happen<00:03:38.519> to<00:03:38.549> be<00:03:38.700> faster<00:03:39.180> but<00:03:39.209> I'm

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
but no I happen to be faster but I'm

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.660 
but no I happen to be faster but I'm
modest<00:03:40.139> and<00:03:40.470> there<00:03:40.620> was<00:03:40.739> like<00:03:40.889> a<00:03:40.920> big<00:03:41.250> big

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
modest and there was like a big big

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.390 
modest and there was like a big big
discussion<00:03:42.299> like<00:03:42.690> oh<00:03:42.930> are<00:03:43.169> you<00:03:43.200> timid<00:03:43.799> no<00:03:44.220> I'm

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
discussion like oh are you timid no I'm

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.599 
discussion like oh are you timid no I'm
not<00:03:44.579> timid<00:03:44.880> I'm<00:03:45.150> modest<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:45.959> so<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.560> still<00:03:47.430> it's

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
not timid I'm modest and so I still it's

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.150 
not timid I'm modest and so I still it's
better<00:03:47.819> because<00:03:48.120> it<00:03:48.540> was<00:03:48.720> like<00:03:49.019> one<00:03:49.829> of<00:03:49.859> his

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
I

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.080 
I
seed<00:04:24.500> flower<00:04:24.710> twice<00:04:24.979> in<00:04:25.160> a<00:04:25.220> row<00:04:25.400> when<00:04:25.610> it<00:04:25.699> hit

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
seed flower twice in a row when it hit

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.300 
seed flower twice in a row when it hit
both<00:04:26.330> times<00:04:26.660> I<00:04:26.960> probably<00:04:27.470> didn't<00:04:27.949> need<00:04:28.039> to<00:04:28.220> do

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
both times I probably didn't need to do

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.430 
both times I probably didn't need to do
with<00:04:28.430> a<00:04:28.490> second<00:04:28.819> time<00:04:28.910> on<00:04:29.120> porygon<00:04:29.930> to<00:04:30.229> it

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
with a second time on porygon to it

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.309 
with a second time on porygon to it
probably<00:04:30.979> got<00:04:31.039> a<00:04:31.099> psychic<00:04:31.340> and<00:04:31.910> one<00:04:32.389> but<00:04:33.289> I

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:33.319 
probably got a psychic and one but I

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:34.930 
probably got a psychic and one but I
didn't<00:04:33.710> notice<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:34.009> special<00:04:34.310> defense<00:04:34.639> drop

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
didn't notice the special defense drop

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.670 
didn't notice the special defense drop
and<00:04:35.180> I<00:04:35.240> should<00:04:35.539> have<00:04:35.660> used<00:04:35.810> it<00:04:36.020> there<00:04:36.229> but<00:04:36.470> i

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
and I should have used it there but i

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.469 
and I should have used it there but i
was<00:04:36.800> thinking<00:04:36.830> like<00:04:37.160> and<00:04:37.550> I<00:04:38.150> don't<00:04:38.360> really

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
was thinking like and I don't really

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.900 
was thinking like and I don't really
want<00:04:38.690> to<00:04:38.750> press<00:04:38.960> my<00:04:38.990> luck<00:04:39.440> like<00:04:39.830> it's<00:04:40.610> hit

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
want to press my luck like it's hit

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.170 
want to press my luck like it's hit
twice<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:41.870> I<00:04:42.550> was<00:04:43.550> sort<00:04:43.699> of<00:04:43.819> thinking<00:04:43.970> about

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
twice and I was sort of thinking about

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.760 
twice and I was sort of thinking about
seeding<00:04:44.630> him<00:04:44.750> and<00:04:44.900> then<00:04:44.990> switching<00:04:45.380> out<00:04:45.530> but

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
seeding him and then switching out but

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.730 
seeding him and then switching out but
then<00:04:45.949> i<00:04:46.250> remembered<00:04:46.970> that<00:04:47.000> arena<00:04:47.840> trapper

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
then i remembered that arena trapper

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:56.260 
then i remembered that arena trapper
