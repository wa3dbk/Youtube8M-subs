water when we're adding this citric acid
solution<00:00:41.199> gonna<00:00:41.949> stir<00:00:42.280> it<00:00:42.430> in<00:00:42.579> pretty

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
solution gonna stir it in pretty

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.080 
solution gonna stir it in pretty
vigorously<00:00:44.280> now<00:00:45.280> we're<00:00:45.460> going<00:00:45.550> to<00:00:45.609> heat<00:00:45.789> the

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
vigorously now we're going to heat the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
milk to 90 degrees when I guess there

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.180

we're<00:00:49.149> going<00:00:49.300> to<00:00:49.359> add<00:00:49.510> red<00:00:49.750> and<00:00:50.289> you<00:00:50.920> would<00:00:51.070> use

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
we're going to add red and you would use

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.400

a quarter of a tablet if you use liquid

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.799 
a quarter of a tablet if you use liquid
I'm<00:00:54.280> going<00:00:54.429> to<00:00:54.519> use<00:00:54.609> a<00:00:54.640> quarter<00:00:54.969> of<00:00:55.300> a<00:00:55.629> teaspoon

I'm going to use a quarter of a teaspoon

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:56.610 
I'm going to use a quarter of a teaspoon
of<00:00:56.170> liquid

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
of liquid

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.079 
of liquid
there's<00:00:57.550> our<00:00:57.879> rennet<00:00:58.239> solution<00:00:59.019> oh<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.609> I<00:01:00.879> ran

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
there's our rennet solution oh and I ran

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:03.930 
there's our rennet solution oh and I ran
it<00:01:01.239> through<00:01:01.269> the<00:01:01.539> ladle<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:03.370> then<00:01:03.579> it<00:01:03.699> can<00:01:03.789> be<00:01:03.910> a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
it through the ladle so then it can be a

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.970 
it through the ladle so then it can be a
little<00:01:04.120> bit<00:01:04.269> more<00:01:04.449> evenly<00:01:04.870> dispersed<00:01:05.530> in<00:01:05.920> the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
little bit more evenly dispersed in the

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.819 
little bit more evenly dispersed in the
milk<00:01:06.370> and<00:01:06.640> then<00:01:07.540> I'll<00:01:07.690> slowly<00:01:07.960> stir<00:01:08.530> it

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:13.109 

we're<00:01:11.829> just<00:01:11.950> gonna<00:01:12.130> let<00:01:12.340> that<00:01:12.520> setting<00:01:12.969> out

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
we're just gonna let that setting out

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.830 
we're just gonna let that setting out
five<00:01:13.810> minutes<00:01:14.729> let's<00:01:15.729> cut<00:01:16.000> some<00:01:16.240> courage<00:01:16.570> here

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
five minutes let's cut some courage here

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.740 
five minutes let's cut some courage here
cutting<00:01:17.590> heads<00:01:17.890> is<00:01:18.729> a<00:01:18.850> way<00:01:19.149> to<00:01:19.210> increase<00:01:19.630> the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
cutting heads is a way to increase the

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.179 
cutting heads is a way to increase the
surface<00:01:20.229> area<00:01:20.619> of<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:22.659> mass<00:01:22.990> by<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.829> way<00:01:24.039> the

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
surface area of this mass by the way the

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:25.919 
surface area of this mass by the way the
Kurds<00:01:24.399> are<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.789> solid<00:01:25.210> and<00:01:25.299> the<00:01:25.420> way<00:01:25.570> is<00:01:25.780> the

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929 
Kurds are the solid and the way is the

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:28.620 
Kurds are the solid and the way is the
liquid<00:01:26.289> when<00:01:27.009> the<00:01:27.640> cutting<00:01:27.880> of<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.090> Kurds<00:01:28.509> you

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
liquid when the cutting of the Kurds you

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.210 
liquid when the cutting of the Kurds you
so<00:01:28.780> that<00:01:28.929> the<00:01:29.049> way<00:01:29.229> can<00:01:29.470> drain<00:01:29.740> out<00:01:29.920> of<00:01:30.100> them

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
so that the way can drain out of them

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.039 
so that the way can drain out of them
more<00:01:30.429> easily<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:34.030> then<00:01:34.270> after<00:01:34.659> that<00:01:34.780> we're

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
more easily and then after that we're

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.020 
more easily and then after that we're
going<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.259> put<00:01:35.560> this<00:01:35.710> back<00:01:35.770> on<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.310> stove<00:01:36.460> and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
going to put this back on the stove and

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.949 
going to put this back on the stove and
heat<00:01:37.090> it<00:01:37.450> to<00:01:37.600> 105<00:01:41.159> we'll<00:01:42.159> stir<00:01:42.490> about<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.479> minute

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:43.959 
heat it to 105 we'll stir about a minute

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.789 
heat it to 105 we'll stir about a minute
to<00:01:44.619> two<00:01:44.860> minutes<00:01:44.890> and<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.869> notice<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:47.470> clear

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
to two minutes and you notice the clear

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.600 
to two minutes and you notice the clear
separation<00:01:48.220> of<00:01:48.939> the<00:01:49.509> curds<00:01:49.929> in<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:50.140> way<00:01:50.610> I'm

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
separation of the curds in a way I'm

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.339

and<00:02:25.090> now<00:02:25.450> what<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:25.780> want<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:26.140> start<00:02:26.380> doing<00:02:26.710> is

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
and now what I want to start doing is

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.540

very<00:02:29.200> gently<00:02:29.800> working<00:02:30.190> this<00:02:30.490> cheese<00:02:31.080> curd
