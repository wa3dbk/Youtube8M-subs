hey<00:00:21.840> guys<00:00:22.050> what's<00:00:22.320> up<00:00:22.439> Itachi<00:00:22.830> were<00:00:22.980> here<00:00:23.160> from

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
hey guys what's up Itachi were here from

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.980 
hey guys what's up Itachi were here from
ballin<00:00:23.609> entertainment<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.390> now<00:00:24.750> we're<00:00:24.900> going

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
ballin entertainment and now we're going

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.140 
ballin entertainment and now we're going
to<00:00:25.050> be<00:00:25.199> looking<00:00:25.529> at<00:00:25.740> step<00:00:26.220> 6

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
to be looking at step 6

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.229 
to be looking at step 6
which<00:00:27.509> is<00:00:27.689> going<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.140> be<00:00:28.410> lining<00:00:29.400> up<00:00:29.699> these

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:30.239 
which is going to be lining up these

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.400 
which is going to be lining up these
corners<00:00:31.079> like<00:00:31.739> that<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.730> all<00:00:33.090> four<00:00:33.629> side<00:00:33.989> or

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
corners like that on all four side or

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.750 
corners like that on all four side or
yeah<00:00:34.949> all<00:00:35.190> four<00:00:35.250> sides<00:00:36.589> okay<00:00:37.589> and<00:00:37.860> our<00:00:38.370> first

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
yeah all four sides okay and our first

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.660 
yeah all four sides okay and our first
five<00:00:39.300> steps<00:00:39.660> we<00:00:40.170> did<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:41.010> yellow<00:00:41.400> top

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
five steps we did the yellow top

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.329 
five steps we did the yellow top
completed<00:00:42.449> the<00:00:42.870> white<00:00:43.140> bottom<00:00:43.440> completed<00:00:44.190> in

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
completed the white bottom completed in

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.040 
completed the white bottom completed in
these<00:00:44.550> first<00:00:44.850> two<00:00:45.000> layers<00:00:45.360> now<00:00:45.690> we're<00:00:45.900> just

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
these first two layers now we're just

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.630 
these first two layers now we're just
going<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.440> do<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.860> last<00:00:47.129> layer<00:00:47.570> now<00:00:49.400> this<00:00:50.400> is

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
going to do the last layer now this is

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.310 
going to do the last layer now this is
going<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.970> have<00:00:51.089> an<00:00:51.210> algorithm<00:00:51.510> which<00:00:51.930> will<00:00:52.170> be

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
going to have an algorithm which will be

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.099 
going to have an algorithm which will be
linked<00:00:52.589> to<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:53.399> our<00:00:54.059> website<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.840> will<00:00:54.989> be

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
linked to on our website and will be

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.920 
linked to on our website and will be
written<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.800> description<00:00:56.480> also<00:00:57.480> if<00:00:57.750> you

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
written in the description also if you

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.720 
written in the description also if you
missed<00:00:58.140> any<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.590> steps<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.219> will<00:00:59.640> be

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
missed any of the steps that will be

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.970 
missed any of the steps that will be
linked<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.149> order<00:01:00.539> down<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.500> side<00:01:01.769> of<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
linked in order down this side of the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.380 
linked in order down this side of the
video<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.489> I'm<00:01:02.579> going<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.760> move<00:01:02.910> over<00:01:03.059> here<00:01:03.180> a

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
video so I'm going to move over here a

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.240 
video so I'm going to move over here a
little<00:01:03.539> bit<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.899> those<00:01:04.710> will<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:04.949> linked

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
little bit and those will be linked

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.010 
little bit and those will be linked
there<00:01:05.399> for<00:01:05.670> probably<00:01:05.970> about<00:01:06.270> 30<00:01:06.509> seconds<00:01:06.929> or

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
there for probably about 30 seconds or

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.010 
there for probably about 30 seconds or
so<00:01:07.050> so<00:01:08.899> if<00:01:09.899> you<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.369> yellow<00:01:11.940> first<00:01:12.840> two

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
so so if you have the yellow first two

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.450 
so so if you have the yellow first two
layers<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.440> the<00:01:13.530> white<00:01:13.710> we're<00:01:13.920> ready<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.310> move

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
layers in the white we're ready to move

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.940 
layers in the white we're ready to move
on<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.970> our<00:01:15.000> sixth<00:01:15.600> step<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.320> our<00:01:16.410> sixth<00:01:16.800> step

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
on to our sixth step and our sixth step

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.830 
on to our sixth step and our sixth step
is<00:01:17.250> basically<00:01:18.240> based<00:01:18.899> off<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:20.390> these<00:01:21.390> being

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
is basically based off of these being

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
is basically based off of these being
lined<00:01:22.200> up<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.920> correct<00:01:23.160> corners<00:01:23.729> as<00:01:24.860> you

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
lined up in the correct corners as you

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.100 
lined up in the correct corners as you
can<00:01:26.009> see<00:01:26.220> here<00:01:26.700> sometimes<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.540> won't<00:01:27.840> even

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
can see here sometimes you won't even

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.859 
can see here sometimes you won't even
have<00:01:28.530> two<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.549> are<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.729> same<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.780> don't

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
have two that are the same you don't

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.390 
have two that are the same you don't
have<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.200> worry<00:01:31.350> about<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.650> edge<00:01:31.770> yet<00:01:32.159> because

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
have to worry about the edge yet because

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.819 
have to worry about the edge yet because
that<00:01:32.549> will<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.729> step<00:01:33.000> seven<00:01:33.360> our<00:01:33.450> last<00:01:33.689> step<00:01:34.079> so

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
that will be step seven our last step so

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.200 
that will be step seven our last step so
if<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.400> do<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:37.280> as<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.430> see<00:01:38.640> how<00:01:38.729> it's<00:01:38.909> blue

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
if you do have as you see how it's blue

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.800 
if you do have as you see how it's blue
blue<00:01:39.899> and<00:01:40.280> it's<00:01:41.280> not<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.329> each<00:01:42.509> side

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
blue and it's not like this on each side

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.840 
blue and it's not like this on each side
where<00:01:43.020> they're<00:01:43.170> mismatched<00:01:43.680> what<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.700> want

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
where they're mismatched what you want

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.280 
where they're mismatched what you want
to<00:01:44.939> do<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.299> want<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.509> put<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
to do is you want to put that in the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.340 
to do is you want to put that in the
back<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.280> our<00:01:47.549> back<00:01:47.820> face<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.990> blue

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
back so this is our back face that blue

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.889 
back so this is our back face that blue
or<00:01:49.979> whatever<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.909> matched<00:01:51.119> up<00:01:51.360> for<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.689> and

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
or whatever is matched up for you and

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.080 
or whatever is matched up for you and
remember<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.100> don't<00:01:53.219> have<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.700> match<00:01:53.880> it

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
remember that you don't have to match it

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.209 
remember that you don't have to match it
up<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.479> can<00:01:54.689> be<00:01:54.840> like<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.680> as<00:01:55.979> long<00:01:56.189> as

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
up this can be like this and as long as

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.120 
up this can be like this and as long as
it's<00:01:56.729> two<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.840> same<00:01:58.079> colors<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.799> top

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
it's two of the same colors in this top

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.370 
it's two of the same colors in this top
corners<00:01:59.640> you<00:02:00.149> put<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.689> back<00:02:00.869> but<00:02:00.899> for

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
corners you put it in the back but for

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.840 
corners you put it in the back but for
teaching<00:02:01.799> purposes<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.490> don't<00:02:02.700> get

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
teaching purposes so you don't get

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.399 
teaching purposes so you don't get
confused<00:02:03.060> we're<00:02:03.600> going<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.930> put<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
confused we're going to put it in the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.529 
confused we're going to put it in the
back<00:02:04.560> like<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.759> we<00:02:05.850> just<00:02:05.880> put<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.420> in

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
back like this so we just put that in

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.270 
back like this so we just put that in
the<00:02:06.659> back<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.079> our<00:02:07.229> algorithm<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:07.890> going<00:02:08.190> to

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
the back and our algorithm is going to

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.340 
the back and our algorithm is going to
be<00:02:08.429> right<00:02:09.269> inverse<00:02:10.310> front<00:02:11.390> clockwise<00:02:12.390> right

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
be right inverse front clockwise right

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:22.099 
be right inverse front clockwise right
inverse<00:02:14.150> back<00:02:15.150> 180<00:02:17.420> right<00:02:19.040> clockwise<00:02:21.109> front

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
inverse back 180 right clockwise front

and<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.120> reason<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:30.480> hold<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.900> like<00:02:30.930> this

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
and the reason I hold it like this

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.220 
and the reason I hold it like this
almost<00:02:31.620> as<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.190> top<00:02:32.430> as<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.790> front<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.269> so<00:02:34.200> I

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
almost as the top as the front is so I

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.000 
almost as the top as the front is so I
can<00:02:34.500> do<00:02:34.650> it

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
can do it

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.030 
can do it
but<00:02:35.519> don't<00:02:35.730> get<00:02:35.879> confused<00:02:36.689> the<00:02:37.439> yellow<00:02:37.739> still

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
but don't get confused the yellow still

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.770 
but don't get confused the yellow still
needs<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.400> be<00:02:38.489> on<00:02:38.610> top<00:02:38.909> and<00:02:38.939> you<00:02:39.269> still<00:02:39.480> need<00:02:39.659> to

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
needs to be on top and you still need to

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.009 
needs to be on top and you still need to
keep<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.319> matched<00:02:41.250> up<00:02:41.549> face<00:02:41.849> in<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.209> back<00:02:42.420> so

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
keep that matched up face in the back so

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.539 
keep that matched up face in the back so
as<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.290> can<00:02:43.409> see<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.799> just<00:02:44.010> turn<00:02:44.189> the<00:02:44.340> top

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
as you can see you just turn the top

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.369 
as you can see you just turn the top
layer<00:02:44.849> and<00:02:45.120> now<00:02:45.390> we<00:02:45.450> have<00:02:45.659> all<00:02:45.810> our<00:02:45.840> corners

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
layer and now we have all our corners

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.369 
layer and now we have all our corners
matched<00:02:46.590> up<00:02:46.829> now<00:02:47.819> as<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.209> can<00:02:48.360> see<00:02:48.420> sometimes

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
matched up now as you can see sometimes

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:50.899 
matched up now as you can see sometimes
you're<00:02:49.590> not<00:02:49.620> going<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.159> have<00:02:50.340> any<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.790> the

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
you're not going to have any of the

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.210 
you're not going to have any of the
corners<00:02:51.269> so<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:52.170> way<00:02:52.290> we<00:02:52.470> do<00:02:52.650> this<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:53.129> you

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
corners so the way we do this is you

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.250 
corners so the way we do this is you
have<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.489> perform<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.909> output<00:02:54.360> algorithm

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
have to perform the output algorithm

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.630 
have to perform the output algorithm
twice<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:57.769> you<00:02:58.769> can<00:02:58.950> put<00:02:59.129> anything<00:02:59.400> in

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
twice so it is you can put anything in

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.130 
twice so it is you can put anything in
the<00:02:59.730> back<00:02:59.909> just<00:03:00.180> make<00:03:00.329> sure<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.659> yellows<00:03:00.989> on

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
the back just make sure you yellows on

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.119 
the back just make sure you yellows on
top<00:03:01.349> light<00:03:01.620> on<00:03:01.799> bottom<00:03:02.099> and<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.970> do<00:03:03.150> right

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129
