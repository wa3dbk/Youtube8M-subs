I<00:01:52.140> kind<00:01:53.069> of<00:01:53.190> like<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:54.349> build<00:01:55.670> five<00:01:56.670> six<00:01:57.240> seven

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
I kind of like this build five six seven

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
worry about base defense and then again

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.040 
worry about base defense and then again
and<00:02:53.400> again<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.820> only<00:02:54.000> real<00:02:54.360> dangers<00:02:54.840> from

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
and again the only real dangers from

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.960 
and again the only real dangers from

Lister's when you're fine because your

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.780 
Lister's when you're fine because your

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
it you fast enough now if you run out

it you fast enough now if you run out
gold<00:05:04.479> or<00:05:04.870> if<00:05:05.020> your<00:05:05.229> gold<00:05:05.590> mine<00:05:05.710> gets<00:05:06.009> destroyed

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
gold or if your gold mine gets destroyed

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.749 
gold or if your gold mine gets destroyed
you<00:05:06.699> wanna<00:05:07.330> really<00:05:08.050> really<00:05:08.259> really<00:05:08.650> mine<00:05:09.430> gold

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
you wanna really really really mine gold

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.150 
you wanna really really really mine gold
and<00:05:10.090> I<00:05:10.539> suggest<00:05:11.080> using<00:05:11.229> that<00:05:11.500> god<00:05:11.710> mine<00:05:11.919> there

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
and I suggest using that god mine there

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.529 
and I suggest using that god mine there
because<00:05:12.669> if<00:05:13.630> you<00:05:13.750> just<00:05:13.930> set<00:05:14.110> up<00:05:14.199> a<00:05:14.229> gold<00:05:14.530> mine

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
because if you just set up a gold mine

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.350 
because if you just set up a gold mine
they<00:05:16.539> never<00:05:16.840> attack<00:05:17.050> you<00:05:17.470> like<00:05:17.889> ever<00:05:18.360> so

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
they never attack you like ever so

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.899 
they never attack you like ever so
you're<00:05:19.570> fine<00:05:19.840> there<00:05:22.919> now<00:05:23.919> when<00:05:24.250> it<00:05:24.370> comes<00:05:24.610> to

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
you're fine there now when it comes to

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:28.379 
you're fine there now when it comes to
the<00:05:25.060> second<00:05:25.659> base<00:05:26.080> attack<00:05:26.620> there's<00:05:27.580> two<00:05:28.060> ways

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
the second base attack there's two ways

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.379 
the second base attack there's two ways
you<00:05:28.419> can<00:05:28.810> do<00:05:28.960> this<00:05:29.199> but<00:05:29.740> you<00:05:30.580> can<00:05:30.610> just<00:05:31.060> land

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
you can do this but you can just land

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.930 
you can do this but you can just land
troops<00:05:31.810> outside<00:05:32.470> of<00:05:32.590> their<00:05:32.740> base<00:05:32.889> the<00:05:33.729> same

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
troops outside of their base the same

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.050 
troops outside of their base the same
way<00:05:34.120> I<00:05:34.180> did<00:05:34.389> it<00:05:34.509> with<00:05:34.630> the<00:05:34.659> first<00:05:34.750> base<00:05:35.139> or<00:05:36.060> you

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
way I did it with the first base or you

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.330

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
can clear out the middle area and take

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.279 
can clear out the middle area and take
the<00:05:39.490> way<00:05:39.639> gate<00:05:39.880> through<00:05:40.210> this<00:05:40.659> mission<00:05:40.960> will
