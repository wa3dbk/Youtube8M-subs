00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 and it is then to talk about the health of that 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.170
 what we can do for our 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.150
 bodies and the rest the balance for 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.519
 help us balance our diets and 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.460
 talk about those calories have the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.470
 breads the tortillas that we like so much 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.910
 the good morning known as other 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.529
 while bad news because I 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.810
 love the bread and much more the tortilla 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.490
 not totally because a lot of people when 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.170
 begins to want to lose weight what 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.060
 first thing they do is say let the bread and 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.859
 the tortilla which I do not see 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.630
 completely good bread and tortilla 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.550
 we can not continue to consume are very 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.500
 healthy but you have to know which ones to choose 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.910
 and at what hours as to what hours 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.579
 ideal is if they are going to eat bread or tortillas 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.230
 that is before 6 pm that 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.030
 do not be large amounts is a woman 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.070
 that will be about 2 tortillas for one of 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.960
 the three tortillas for food then 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.460
 it is very important to have a control but 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.379
 hence, we are going to choose which ones are 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.270
 the good parts and here I bring examples 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.190
 let's use the loaves of bread 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.570
 we must avoid only eating in the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.789
 free day that I take you global to 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.120
 week would be the sweet loaves the bread 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.789
 sweet what it has is white sand and the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.409
 white flour has the sugar and they are left 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.250
 butters 2 this combination of 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.080
 elements 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.180
 they do not give us any nutrients they give us 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.890
 calories and calories that are very easy 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.470
 to accumulate then to be careful 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.060
 with that with the white bread 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.130
 we see banks everything that is white what 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.750
 which is bobbins and those are not so much 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.400
 problem like sweet bread because so 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.229
 least we do not have the sugar but not 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.880
 have nutrients then that would be the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.130
 second that you have to be careful with 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.140
 them and then when we continue with 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.420
 fiber assumptions we now have the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.940
 double fiber we already have bobbins are 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.740
 whole if they want something sweet tasty 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.360
 we have the balance cookies and some 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.660
 type of cookies that are made low in 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.250
 sugar also fit or saving you 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.750
 meanwhile they change their fat or 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.729
 search now for the most options 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.590
 healthy and as for the tortilla 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.540
 good in tortilla corn tortilla 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.520
 very good but let's start with 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.710
 which should avoid the tortilla of 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.840
 flour that has between 4 and 8 grams of 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.640
 comparison fat point 5 or 1 that 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.320
 has the corn one then we have to 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.240
 avoid flour tortillas because 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.490
 aside part of its fat is fat 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:09.350
 saturated and trans fat or whatever they do 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.350
 the hydrogenated fat and ultimately 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.490
 in the rush we greatly increase the 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.230
 calories with all the fat and it does not give anything 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.230
 but now nutrient which 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.790
 we must eat the fabulous corn 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.920
 more sparingly and not at night 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.020
 then we have blue tortillas 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.600
 blue corn is the black corn 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.670
 it's fantastic it has even more fiber than the 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.170
 that normal corn and you know the pozole 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.150
 It can also be done with black corn 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.370
 although it does not look as delicious but 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.290
 you know a lot not only is it like 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.360
 they look so black we are not healthy with 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.280
 a decision diet to notice the union 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.950
 you do not pass implementation that takes no 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.290
 for very good to release sugar not 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.910
 finally has some wonders and now in 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.170
 place of fried things a thing that 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.540
 I recommend is can you put your 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.250
 tortillas to the comal as I have the 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.840
 security that giving right now is the same as 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.330
 that can be cut into squares for 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.250
 chips or eat like that and that way the 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.080
 little stores but without having a link to 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.510
 good I understand that you have a 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.850
 free nutrition seminar where 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.950

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.660
