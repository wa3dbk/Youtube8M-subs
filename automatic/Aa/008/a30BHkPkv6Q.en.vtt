got<00:00:01.650> a<00:00:01.680> kowtow<00:00:02.580> ATM<00:00:03.149> 50<00:00:03.570> stealth<00:00:05.000> and<00:00:07.460> it's<00:00:08.460> got

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
got a kowtow ATM 50 stealth and it's got

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.520 
got a kowtow ATM 50 stealth and it's got
a<00:00:08.610> problem<00:00:08.849> with<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.530> speedometer

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
a problem with the speedometer

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.379 
a problem with the speedometer
speedometers<00:00:11.190> not<00:00:11.219> working<00:00:11.429> or<00:00:12.000> dominators

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
speedometers not working or dominators

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.990 
speedometers not working or dominators
not<00:00:12.570> working<00:00:13.309> so<00:00:16.100> went<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.130> check<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.580> see<00:00:17.789> what

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
not working so went to check to see what

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.730 
not working so went to check to see what
it<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.119> exactly<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:19.160> down<00:00:20.160> here<00:00:21.320> you<00:00:22.320> can<00:00:22.350> see

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
it is exactly and down here you can see

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.420 
it is exactly and down here you can see
the<00:00:22.980> speedometer<00:00:23.850> cable<00:00:24.949> if<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.070> spin<00:00:26.340> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
the speedometer cable if I spin the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.240 
the speedometer cable if I spin the
wheel<00:00:27.410> you<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.439> see<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.010> turns<00:00:31.070> so<00:00:32.070> it's

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
wheel you can see that it turns so it's

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.549 
wheel you can see that it turns so it's
not<00:00:32.399> it's<00:00:33.210> not<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.719> part<00:00:33.989> here<00:00:34.260> that's<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
not it's not this part here that's the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.130 
not it's not this part here that's the
problem<00:00:35.870> if<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.989> go<00:00:37.170> up<00:00:37.380> here<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:38.040> I've<00:00:38.430> already

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
problem if I go up here and I've already

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.619 
problem if I go up here and I've already
disassembled<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.320> panel's<00:00:41.000> and<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.329> do<00:00:42.420> that

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
disassembled the panel's and to do that

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.200 
disassembled the panel's and to do that
you've<00:00:42.809> got<00:00:44.480> two<00:00:45.480> screws<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:45.960> each<00:00:46.110> side<00:00:46.410> here

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
you've got two screws on each side here

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.200 
you've got two screws on each side here
once<00:00:48.210> through<00:00:48.480> there<00:00:49.550> it's<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.059> other

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
once through there it's on the other

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.010 
once through there it's on the other
side<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.809> little<00:00:51.989> five<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.770> panel

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
side so it's a little five on that panel

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.599 
side so it's a little five on that panel
and<00:00:55.020> then<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.829> top<00:00:56.730> panel<00:00:57.109> you've<00:00:58.109> got<00:00:58.609> one

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
and then on the top panel you've got one

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.009 
and then on the top panel you've got one
screw<00:00:59.910> there<00:01:00.440> one<00:01:01.440> there<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.690> then<00:01:03.690> an<00:01:03.870> eight

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
screw there one there and then an eight

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.890 
screw there one there and then an eight
millimeter<00:01:04.260> bolt<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.760> front<00:01:08.570> so<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
millimeter bolt on the front so the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.410 
millimeter bolt on the front so the
panel<00:01:10.500> removal<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.130> pretty<00:01:11.369> basic<00:01:11.520> I'm<00:01:12.240> not

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
panel removal is pretty basic I'm not

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.590 
panel removal is pretty basic I'm not
going<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.630> go<00:01:12.750> into<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:14.000> but<00:01:15.000> if<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.240> go<00:01:15.420> up

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
going to go into that but if you go up

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:38.380 
going to go into that but if you go up
in<00:01:15.750> here<00:01:18.200> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.380> see<00:01:29.150> just<00:01:30.150> loosen<00:01:30.540> this<00:01:30.659> guy

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.120 

see<00:01:39.390> there<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:41.490> cable<00:01:42.319> and<00:01:43.319> if<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.649> spin<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
see there the cable and if I spin the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.499 
see there the cable and if I spin the
wheel<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:45.890> don't<00:01:46.890> get<00:01:47.039> any<00:01:47.189> movement<00:01:47.340> at<00:01:47.700> all<00:01:47.789> so

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
wheel I don't get any movement at all so

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.120 
wheel I don't get any movement at all so
what<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.719> tells<00:01:48.899> me<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.439> cable<00:01:49.679> is

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
what that tells me is the cable is

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.770 
what that tells me is the cable is
broken<00:01:50.789> somewhere<00:01:51.329> between<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:53.569> the<00:01:54.569> wheel

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
broken somewhere between the the wheel

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.999 
broken somewhere between the the wheel
and<00:01:55.109> the<00:01:55.409> speedometer<00:01:56.369> gauge<00:01:57.799> still<00:01:58.799> have<00:01:58.920> to

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
and the speedometer gauge still have to

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.819 
and the speedometer gauge still have to
replace<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.459> cable
