fortunate<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.329> our<00:01:39.450> behalf<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:40.069> again<00:01:41.069> we<00:01:41.250> was

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
fortunate on our behalf but again we was

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.130 
fortunate on our behalf but again we was
we<00:01:41.759> was<00:01:41.849> pushing<00:01:42.239> and<00:01:42.390> asking<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.750> question

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
we was pushing and asking the question

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.279 
we was pushing and asking the question
so<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:44.509> obviously<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.689> get<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.899> question

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
so and obviously to get that question

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.679 
so and obviously to get that question
was<00:01:46.409> great<00:01:47.270> from<00:01:48.270> our<00:01:48.390> point<00:01:48.539> of<00:01:48.630> view

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
was great from our point of view

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.179 
was great from our point of view
obviously<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.140> next<00:01:49.380> goal<00:01:49.560> was<00:01:49.770> massive

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
obviously the next goal was massive

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.190 
obviously the next goal was massive
because<00:01:50.340> obviously<00:01:50.520> two-nil<00:01:51.179> going<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.989> three

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
because obviously two-nil going to three

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.469 
because obviously two-nil going to three
nails<00:01:52.409> game<00:01:52.679> over<00:01:53.069> 21<00:01:53.489> e<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.819> the<00:01:54.000> back<00:01:54.239> in<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
nails game over 21 e to the back in the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.940 
nails game over 21 e to the back in the
game<00:01:54.629> so<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.049> disappointing<00:01:55.349> that<00:01:55.560> respect

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
game so it's disappointing that respect

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.539 
game so it's disappointing that respect
but<00:01:56.069> he's<00:01:56.759> got<00:01:56.879> a<00:01:56.909> bore<00:01:57.179> there<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:58.280> think<00:01:59.280> as

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
but he's got a bore there I think as

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.039 
but he's got a bore there I think as
defenders<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.119> could<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.390> maybe<00:02:00.509> been<00:02:00.659> aware

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
defenders we could have maybe been aware

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.449 
defenders we could have maybe been aware
of<00:02:01.079> him<00:02:01.319> but<00:02:01.500> at<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.679> same<00:02:01.860> time<00:02:02.129> you're<00:02:02.310> not

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
of him but at the same time you're not

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:05.359 
of him but at the same time you're not
going<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:02.729> looking<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.739> to<00:02:04.739> pick<00:02:04.979> up<00:02:05.129> in<00:02:05.280> the

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.970 
it's obviously a big game for England
but

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980
