 bakti roupitcha a well insulated tip well 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.410
 easy to understand that you want to take 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.299
 with authority figures and with 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.039
 that they can affect our decision you 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.740
 is watching another episode fast 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.270
 attach books where the talk is about the bias of 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.279
 authority of the book the art of thinking 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.769
 clearly toulon became br 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.599
 The next tip is attention when people 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.300
 is facing political scientists 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.969
 medical lawyers businessmen and 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.219
 wholesale consulting economists in general 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.780
 when we perceive someone with 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.940
 a figure of authority and ends up 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.840
 easier to swallow everything she is 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.550
 Speaking 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.190
 if you realize what's happening 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.180
 with you then it's good for those who give a 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.469
 step back and take a deep breath 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.309
 regains its rationality 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.860
 sobriety of your skepticism and you 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.360
 focus on ideas in the argument that 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.550
 Rolling in then forget a little 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.250
 that imposing figure that person 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.189
 who was there was well dressed 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.549
 if a tall person is a short person 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.580
 someone who rolls up all cute talking to 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.979
 works that famous company if it has 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.280
 diploma of that university respected 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.299
 by all this aside isolates all 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.259
 personal elements and focuses on the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.710
 argument 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.770
 I talk a lot about this where world 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.680
 because it is because the born where the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.590
 themes complexity is very high. 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.790
 talking about clinical researches of 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.030
 effects of metabolism that do well what 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.240
 does not do well because it is a myth and it is natural 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.820
 How do you have so much luggage that is 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.810
 necessary for us to acquire in order to 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.240
 talk 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.820
 people in general who are not of the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.670
 area they want shortcuts that the figure of 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.110
 authority a shortcut motor spoke tone 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.020
 It must be a struggle right? 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.759
 and only notice if the person is recommended 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.680
 as this as that because it is good for 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.140
 health or whatever 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.390
 and is a person with a degree from the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.610
 I do not know where I came from. 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.980
 white apron 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.560
 talking beautiful is professor emeritus not d 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.960
 I know where it 's normal for us to think thigh 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.680
 I think you can trust this guy. 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.120
 but look back at rationality 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.090
 just the fact that the person has written 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.250
 books and a smart-looking or 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.350
 any other symbol of authority 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.970
 this is not part of an argument 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.830
 logic 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.510
 so today's quick tip for us 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.350
 take care before deciding any 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.480
 thing 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.910
 based on authority for a little bit 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.630
 to think the decision that we are 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.850
 about to choose is a decision based on 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.510
 in argument or will it be that we are 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.270
 deciding based on authority 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.270
 authority because only one 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.340
 shortcut the cognitive shortcut nÃ© most 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.530
 especially when people are 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.600
 trusting someone because she has a 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.100
 a diploma that we do not have because it 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.110
 He is wearing a suit and tie and we 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.209
 is using a person who has a hair 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.880
 gray speaks pretty 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.470
 if you find yourself deciding something about it 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.959
 power of authority 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.750
 it's worth stopping a little 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.700
 check the logic of your choice as 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.549

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:28.730
 it attacks her well 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.840
 this talk of authority and 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.180
 rationality that arguments 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.090
 intelligent and rational people has a great deal to do 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.420
 with our other series it's a series 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.430
 natural call of books that you are

 seeing that you just watched the air 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.049
 free but there is another right on the street 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.910
 where books and the first episodes of 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.170
 act gol de letra you make a 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.140
 interesting story that is a 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.480
 actual practical example was that the 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.370
 people see in practice the lack of 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:05.299
 rationality the lack of argumentation 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:08.030
 rigorous scientific research has brought 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.600
 several people worldwide 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.780
 I will leave for serious but are 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.880
 nutrition recommendations 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.380
 by authority bias because 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.810
 appeared people with great conviction 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.840
 spoke beautiful spoke with confidence 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.110
 only they were people who did not have 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.639
 clinical data did not 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.740
 rationality of arguments for you 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.770
 Checked out that matches to go to the channel.
