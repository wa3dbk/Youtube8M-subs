body at that level and write that number

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.660 
body at that level and write that number
down<00:02:30.599> in<00:02:31.080> centimeters<00:02:31.739> once<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.340> have<00:02:32.519> these

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
measurements down remember we're in

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.530 
measurements down remember we're in
centimeters<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.190> kilograms<00:02:35.640> you're<00:02:36.299> going

centimeters and kilograms you're going

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.270 
centimeters and kilograms you're going

to calculate a number called your body

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:48.010 
to calculate a number called your body
density<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:39.000> I'll<00:02:39.090> put<00:02:39.269> up<00:02:39.299> those<00:02:39.510> equations

once you have your body density you're

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.730 
once you have your body density you're
going<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.210> put<00:02:50.420> that<00:02:50.870> number<00:02:51.110> into<00:02:51.470> the
