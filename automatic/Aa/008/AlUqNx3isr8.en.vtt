00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
going to use an antelope benchmark to

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.890 
going to use an antelope benchmark to
benchmark<00:00:11.309> these<00:00:11.490> devices<00:00:11.849> we<00:00:12.719> are<00:00:12.750> also

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
benchmark these devices we are also

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.560 
benchmark these devices we are also
going<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.590> shut<00:00:13.830> down<00:00:13.860> these<00:00:14.250> devices<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.000> not

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
going to shut down these devices and not

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.420 
going to shut down these devices and not
even<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:16.049> we<00:00:16.260> are<00:00:16.379> also<00:00:16.560> going<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.010> restart

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
even that we are also going to restart

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.210 
even that we are also going to restart
these<00:00:17.880> devices<00:00:18.210> together<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.960> see<00:00:19.199> which<00:00:20.010> one

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
these devices together to see which one

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.460 
these devices together to see which one
is<00:00:20.369> going<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.640> restart<00:00:21.000> quicker<00:00:21.539> than<00:00:22.140> each

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
is going to restart quicker than each

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.390 
is going to restart quicker than each
other<00:00:24.320> so<00:00:25.320> before<00:00:25.500> getting<00:00:26.010> into<00:00:26.189> an

other so before getting into an
benchmark<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.090> have<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.359> make<00:00:27.570> sure<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.990> you

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
benchmark you have to make sure that you

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.109

power off so here we go so I think HTC

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.780 
power off so here we go so I think HTC
One<00:01:12.119> has<00:01:12.420> shut<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.990> down<00:01:13.140> quicker<00:01:16.430> now<00:01:17.430> we<00:01:17.490> will

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
One has shut it down quicker now we will

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.600 
One has shut it down quicker now we will
try<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> boot<00:01:18.420> them<00:01:18.659> up<00:01:18.900> together<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:23.220> when<00:01:23.430> you

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
try to boot them up together so when you

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.399 
try to boot them up together so when you
press<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> power<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.750> off<00:01:24.810> key<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.200> both<00:01:25.380> of

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
press a power on and off key on both of

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.649 
press a power on and off key on both of
these<00:01:25.710> devices<00:01:26.040> HTC<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.909> going<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.270> respond

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
these devices HTC is going to respond

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.280 
these devices HTC is going to respond
quicker<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.170> comparison<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.979> s4<00:01:29.430> and

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
quicker in comparison to the s4 and

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.780 
quicker in comparison to the s4 and
let's<00:01:31.290> see<00:01:31.439> which<00:01:31.590> one<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.890> going<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.159> boot<00:01:32.670> up

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
let's see which one is going to boot up

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.840 
let's see which one is going to boot up
quicker<00:01:33.030> force<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:34.530> HTC<00:01:34.920> One<00:01:35.100> has<00:01:35.340> booted<00:01:35.640> up

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
quicker force so HTC One has booted up

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.789 
quicker force so HTC One has booted up
quicker<00:01:36.119> foss<00:01:37.549> and<00:01:38.930> now<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:39.990> can<00:01:40.290> continue<00:01:40.650> a

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
quicker foss and now you can continue a

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.240 
quicker foss and now you can continue a
walk<00:01:41.040> as<00:01:41.250> for<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.939> still<00:01:42.119> trying<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:43.250> boot

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
walk as for is it still trying to boot

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.190 
walk as for is it still trying to boot
up<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.700> now<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.930> has<00:01:46.200> booted<00:01:46.500> up<00:01:46.710> pause<00:01:48.049> so<00:01:49.049> in

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
up and now it has booted up pause so in

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.830 
up and now it has booted up pause so in
booting<00:01:49.500> up<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.799> think<00:01:50.070> HTC<00:01:50.220> one<00:01:50.700> takes<00:01:51.479> up<00:01:51.689> in

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
booting up I think HTC one takes up in

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.700 
booting up I think HTC one takes up in
over<00:01:52.049> here<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:54.420> now<00:01:54.600> we<00:01:54.659> are<00:01:55.079> going<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.470> restart

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
over here so now we are going to restart

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.740 
over here so now we are going to restart
these<00:01:56.159> devices<00:01:56.490> together<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.360> see<00:01:57.540> which<00:01:57.719> one

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
these devices together to see which one

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.480 
these devices together to see which one
is<00:01:58.020> going<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.409> restart<00:01:58.649> quicker<00:01:59.159> fault

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
is going to restart quicker fault

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.160 
is going to restart quicker fault
because<00:01:59.729> in<00:02:00.119> booting<00:02:00.479> up<00:02:00.570> we<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:00.899> seen<00:02:01.140> that

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
because in booting up we have seen that

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.280 
because in booting up we have seen that
HTC<00:02:02.159> One<00:02:02.369> has<00:02:02.850> booted<00:02:03.210> up<00:02:03.450> really<00:02:03.719> quickly<00:02:04.020> in

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
HTC One has booted up really quickly in

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:17.180 
HTC One has booted up really quickly in
comparison<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.280> spoke<00:02:07.160> so<00:02:08.160> here<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.489> go

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:40.480 

so<00:02:17.970> VF<00:02:18.300> pressed<00:02:18.660> restart<00:02:19.500> at<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:20.010> same<00:02:20.280> time

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.700 

so<00:02:41.490> here<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.760> think<00:02:42.300> s3<00:02:42.780> has<00:02:42.960> booted<00:02:43.230> up<00:02:43.440> quicker

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
so here I think s3 has booted up quicker

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:55.520 
so here I think s3 has booted up quicker
than<00:02:46.550> HTC<00:02:47.550> One<00:02:53.030> so<00:02:54.030> in<00:02:54.360> boarding<00:02:54.720> up<00:02:54.900> HTC<00:02:55.380> one

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
than HTC One so in boarding up HTC one

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.380 
than HTC One so in boarding up HTC one
is<00:02:55.650> better<00:02:55.830> in<00:02:56.190> restarting<00:02:57.060> your<00:02:57.240> device

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
is better in restarting your device

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.560 
is better in restarting your device
samsung<00:02:58.170> galaxy<00:02:58.500> s4<00:02:58.860> is<00:02:58.980> better<00:02:59.160> so<00:02:59.970> s4<00:03:00.390> is

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
samsung galaxy s4 is better so s4 is

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.420 
samsung galaxy s4 is better so s4 is
