00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.750
 we are going to make a few potatoes, you have to 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.960
 start by saying that here in the 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.930
 Peninsula is a bit difficult to find 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.750
 the dad specialty that is the Canary Islands 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.320
 but we're going to replace it with some 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.640
 tiny potatoes potatoes 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.320
 red because here we do not have the variety 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.720
 specific that we would need then 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.110
 well they are a kind of potatoes 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.950
 you wrinkle but I 'm generis' then 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.490
 for this we put them in a casserole 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.890
 we cover them with water a little less 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.730
 that what would be covered and we're going to 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.520
 add a good handful of coarse salt 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.860
 well we have already added the fat salt a 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.700
 good handful then now we're going to 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:01.270
 cover and we will let them cook about 8 o 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.430
 10 minutes and when that time ago 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.979
 we will click to see if they are soft 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.450
 if it was not enough 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.270
 blanditas then good we would continue 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.420
 cooking hours a little more can then 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.659
 we have had taking the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.490
 to quote something more than 10 minutes out of 10 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.430
 to 15 minutes because I did not think 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.680
 they were soft enough and 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.720
 well passed that time we have 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.210
 drained the water but without removing the 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.600
 top of the whole that is to say we have opened a 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.180
 grate through the lid and we drained the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.280
 water but remove the cap 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.619
 continuation with the fire off though 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.710
 It is still hot, because we are going back to 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.550
 put the pot and leave some 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.149
 minutes then that over the fire the 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.000
 casserole we will be stirring then every two 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.840
 or three minutes for the salt to go 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.420
 impregnating in potatoes 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.359
 You can see how this is the result of 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:05.159
 the potato crumbs have their capita 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:08.550
 salt and well then you see that although not 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.280
 they are the true Canarian potatoes but 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.420
 well we can do 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.420
 something similar
