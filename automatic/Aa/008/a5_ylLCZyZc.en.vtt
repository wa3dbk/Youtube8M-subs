00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:27.310
 Welcome to our second 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:30.190
 video blog channel the homo news today 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.770
 It should be in the short contribution to the 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:37.270
 antifreeze control go the 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.280
 antifreeze control is part of 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.400
 heating if you like that protects 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.410
 the water boiler from frost damage and 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.530
 I'm sitting here in front of the heater 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.570
 I'll show you where you are 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.890
 But first you have to pay attention to a few 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.900
 introductory words 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.350
 why do i shoot this video for you 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.420
 at all for all professionals again the 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.180
 please switch off immediately 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.890
 you'll say what a nonsense that 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.720
 we know everything but it was not a 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.580
 he is right for us if he does 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.090
 Shut down does not need you 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.070
 look at 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.170
 for beginners they do not 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.140
 but maybe it can 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.760
 maybe be a tip because it is us 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.680
 happened just under a year ago as will 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.930
 the camper here is our brush ixeo 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.600
 bought 726 and ours 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.930
 first weekend trip just started 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.990
 are 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.520
 we went completely into the trap 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.219
 and he would not have the mistake himself 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.530
 to do as well 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:38.380
 Of course you have to say 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.170
 yes user manual has read completely 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.090
 Clear advantages also came before everything 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.070
 but if a where bought like new 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.259
 then you know many innovations 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.409
 much technology we serve you only times 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.090
 must deal with and can therefore 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.439
 you read one or the other over 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.149
 actually stands here in the 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:59.500
 user manual everything in it 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:01.990
 pages 5 and 6 are relevant for lost control 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.789
 I will make the two sides for you 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.640
 download also on our facebook page 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.719
 diego - deploy 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.140
 you can still do that in peace 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:13.290
 Let's see if he's lying when he's the one 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.350
 instructions here is not too much anyway 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.480
 so request what happened to us 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.880
 Water tank filled for the for the 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.900
 weekend 120 liters fit in with us 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.630
 the pure water container 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.970
 the horror accident is made full and as 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.380
 he then drove 60 70 kilometers 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.270
 later we were also ours 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.100
 because at least the goal has arrived 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.020
 first station and then we have 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.130
 found that the water tank almost 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.720
 was empty and when I went out 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.540
 looked and have already seen there 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.450
 Hard- working water is running under it 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.120
 car raus yes there you do of course 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.950
 Worrying first thinks what broke it was 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.230
 but nothing broke but it was 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.460
 here antifreeze control of the 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.890
 boiler for heating 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.800
 the problem that has afterwards 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.790
 issued because it was like that at the 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.100
 delivery from our brussels the 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.840
 the valve was open and have that 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.340
 we smoothly overlook the the water 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.260
 points that was still on during the 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.420
 all the time and so has the water pump 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.580
 busy filling the boiler again and again 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.830
 there fit ten liters in and the boiler 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.230
 About the antifreeze control has been diligent 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.480
 the water is disposed of from the camper 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.440
 I'm supposed to be outside on the street 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.720
 noticed what he has great you learn this 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.010
 Today I wanted to show you and you 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.140
 to draw attention to it 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.710
 be careful of the frost protection 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.750
 Control works when in here 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.770
 the temperature measurement is 3 degrees at the boiler 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.510
 is reached and then this opens 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.770
 valve for emptying the water boiler 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.590
 and thus no frost damage 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:54.940
 but are independent of the temperature 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.010
 if the when the valve is open and 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.930
 the water pump is on then has that 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.940
 exactly the effect that happened to us 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.920
 So look at it like that 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.480
 works with the drain valve that 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.030
 is totally simple but it has to stop 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.020
 know and that's why I'm showing you now 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.020
 In short where is the valve and a 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.310
 not a lever anymore but button pressure 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.739
 if you know it will happen then 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:22.060
 such stupid things so I'll show it 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:24.760
 So here you go 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.490
 heating room at the same time a great 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.450
 Storage for all sorts of things you otherwise 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.130
 take away 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.780
 here is a small gas bottle for 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.100
 our grill in it currently but that should 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.090
 just do not bother us 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.540
 I want to show you 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.220
 where to find the drain valve 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.050
 the antifreeze control can be found 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.630
 that's exactly what it looks like here 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.060
 little people down there that 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.729
 wooden floor of the one can take high 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.080
 Here is the actual one 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:56.210
 heating down that you just open 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:00.740
 Here you can see our trummer six 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:03.370
 Heating the working class that is 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.490
 also nicely dimensioned into the money 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:10.220
 The temperature is currently loose 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.690
 from we are very satisfied with right 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.280
 but not made behind the minister 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.180
 I think that's enough 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:20.150
 out so that is the frost protection valve around 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.270
 it is open at the moment it is open 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:27.070
 You can see that by the blue button here 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:30.440
 It is outside and is the drain valve 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:33.760
 at the moment where it is in the position 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:37.010
 the boiler is emptied out 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.870
 the ten liter conclusion are in there if there 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:43.479
 guided outside as it happens to us 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:46.250
 is unwanted in the moment around that now 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:50.510
 to close again that is totally simple 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.550
 you just have to know then bring here 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:56.510
 the drain valve in the operating 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:58.610
 position and open close the last one 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.160
 final with the button is now here 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:04.539
 there is no more collection in it and thus is 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.740
 that the valve is frost protection 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:08.389
 Closed and the water stays nice 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.389
 in the mobile home in the boiler where it is 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:15.020
 hopefully and if it belongs again 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:17.690
 this should be cold 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.490
 emptied of this mechanism that is 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.539
 everything I wanted to show is more 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.539
 not to be noticed at the moment 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.919
 before that there is a second valve 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:33.600
 that protects not written speak but 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:35.820
 this is a pressure relief valve and that 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.480
 after two positions as well 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:42.330
 now set at the moment 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:44.820
 leathergerber lever down it is 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:48.240
 closed and in the moment where you do that 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:51.919
 high presses sofa plastic lever is 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.840
 Simple at the moment it is open 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:57.180
 that means this emptying pruning the 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.630
 leads to the outside is including 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:03.600
 And here, too, water is emptied 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:07.050
 look for that here the ebner below 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.580
 is when you are on the way and you 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.450
 do not want that here too 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.450
 water is final value
