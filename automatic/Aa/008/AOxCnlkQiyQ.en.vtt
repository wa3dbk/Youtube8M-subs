good<00:00:02.100> morning<00:00:02.490> children<00:00:03.120> today<00:00:03.749> we<00:00:03.959> shall

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
good morning children today we shall

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.070 
good morning children today we shall
learn<00:00:04.380> about<00:00:04.590> the<00:00:05.070> leaves<00:00:05.340> its<00:00:05.810> functions<00:00:06.810> and

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
learn about the leaves its functions and

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.360 
learn about the leaves its functions and
the<00:00:07.560> modifications<00:00:08.900> if<00:00:09.900> you<00:00:10.289> look<00:00:10.469> around<00:00:10.889> you

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
the modifications if you look around you

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.659 
the modifications if you look around you
would<00:00:11.549> find<00:00:11.849> many<00:00:12.360> kinds<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:12.990> leaves<00:00:13.669> some

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:14.669 
would find many kinds of leaves some

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:15.739

nation<00:02:36.110> is<00:02:36.260> called<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:36.920> reticulate<00:02:37.760> venation

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
nation is called the reticulate venation

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.270 
nation is called the reticulate venation
for<00:02:39.560> example<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.940> hibiscus<00:02:41.690> leaf<00:02:42.020> has<00:02:42.770> the

for example the hibiscus leaf has the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.630 
for example the hibiscus leaf has the
reticulate<00:02:43.820> venation<00:02:44.320> so<00:02:45.320> we<00:02:45.500> can<00:02:45.710> say<00:02:46.010> the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
reticulate venation so we can say the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.260 
reticulate venation so we can say the
hibiscus<00:02:47.360> has<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.660> tap<00:02:48.410> root<00:02:48.740> system<00:02:49.280> what<00:02:50.240> are

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
hibiscus has a tap root system what are

the functions of a leaf let us see we
all<00:02:53.750> know<00:02:54.050> that<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.650> main<00:02:54.920> function<00:02:55.580> of<00:02:55.730> leaf

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
all know that the main function of leaf

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.830
