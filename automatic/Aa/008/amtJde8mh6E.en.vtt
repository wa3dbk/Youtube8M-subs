bold text everything so let's see how it
performs<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:09.290> automatically<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.439> see<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:11.100> it

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
performs so automatically I see like it

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.980 
performs so automatically I see like it
has<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:12.060> cut<00:01:12.330> across<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:13.070> document<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
has like cut across the document and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:22.310 
has like cut across the document and
let's<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.470> take<00:01:17.150> collect<00:01:20.090> so<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:22.110> see

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
let's just take collect so you just see

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.820 
let's just take collect so you just see
how<00:01:22.830> clear<00:01:23.369> picture<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.060> has<00:01:24.210> taken<00:01:24.619> so<00:01:25.619> this

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
how clear picture it has taken so this

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.609 
how clear picture it has taken so this
is<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.790> app<00:01:26.970> has<00:01:27.360> automatically<00:01:28.020> adjusted

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
is the app has automatically adjusted

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.980 
is the app has automatically adjusted
the<00:01:28.770> angle<00:01:28.799> like<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.880> was<00:01:30.030> taking<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.479> from<00:01:30.630> side

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
the angle like I was taking it from side

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.380 
the angle like I was taking it from side
angle<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.619> wasn't<00:01:32.250> taking<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.670> from<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.119> front

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
angle I wasn't taking it from the front

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.420 
angle I wasn't taking it from the front
and<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.780> has<00:01:33.930> automatically<00:01:34.619> made<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.159> I

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and it has automatically made it like I

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.899 
and it has automatically made it like I
just<00:01:36.420> took<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.689> just<00:01:37.350> over<00:01:37.680> above<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
just took it just over above it of the
