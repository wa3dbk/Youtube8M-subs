00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
just that I was outside because I

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:52.470 
just that I was outside because I
thought<00:02:51.370> it<00:02:51.519> would<00:02:51.609> be<00:02:51.700> better<00:02:51.879> lighting<00:02:52.180> and

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
thought it would be better lighting and

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.330 
thought it would be better lighting and
I<00:02:52.510> hope<00:02:52.719> the<00:02:52.840> lighting<00:02:53.200> was<00:02:53.319> better<00:02:53.499> but
