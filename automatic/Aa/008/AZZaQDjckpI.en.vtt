00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hi to all guys here as always the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.730
 your blegi tutorial in this video vi 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.099
 I present a theme that is available on 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.929
 cydia his name is upload and as I already have 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.340
 said it is a theme for winterboard the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.920
 famous cydia tweak 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.509
 so I activated these voices which 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.340
 you can also see yourself on the screen 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.230
 as you see it goes to change the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.720
 notification center the lockscreen e 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.240
 the user interface is the springboard 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.010
 meanwhile as you see I installed one 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.779
 series of and applications in such a way that 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.150
 you can realize what it is 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.070
 theme style as you have many of them 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.550
 have changed think that this theme has 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.620
 support for more than 3 thousand applications 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.050
 look everything has changed too 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.739
 notification center rather than menu 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.390
 the multitasking also changed 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.739
 buttons we use to close the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.090
 applications from less than multitasking 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.010
 as you can see and the ones have changed too 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.870
 small hicks we use to cancel 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.059
 the applications therefore a truly theme 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.699
 complete even the entire interface 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.300
 User application has changed to 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.949
 please upload as you can see but 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.290
 now you will not have to do anything but 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.000
 relax and enjoy an overview 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.000
 of icons close up 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.439
 on the winterboard it has arrived 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:52.490
 time to see what the two are 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.219
 extra items 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.079
 look if I deactivate up labels so much 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.719
 to begin with and perform a respring for 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.990
 apply the changes look at unlock 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:05.479
 the device and have disappeared all 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.189
 names of the icons this may like o 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.909
 I don't like it even though I don't like it 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.250
 lot 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.650
 let's see the second extra item 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.160
 watched one of the classic wallpapers of 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.920
 apple 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.349
 as you can see, however, it is darker than normal 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.879
 I will show you further by going 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.980
 on settings try to change 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:25.010
 background so you realize it is 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.970
 really the original background here I go 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.799
 here on select active background for example 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.739
 this is this background that of 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.900
 default and as you see even if the background 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.319
 it's the normal one, the theme darkens it 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.879
 as you can see this can be 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.069
 deactivated by checking the 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:46.489
 second extra in fact if we go up 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:49.780
 winterboard and let's go to select deans e 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.880
 activate the other then the svp dim 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.579
 let's do another respring and look at it 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.349
 background is back with normal colors and 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.720
 I must say that this is definitely more so 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.609
 pleasant upload can be downloaded from cydia 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.769
 from the bigboss hypos to the price of a 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.349
 dollar and 49 supports all versions 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.239
 of ios 6 and of course to work 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.560
 requires winterboard software 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.000
