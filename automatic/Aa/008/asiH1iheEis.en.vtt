00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
hey what's up everyone my name is Chris

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.720 
hey what's up everyone my name is Chris
winter<00:00:01.829> and<00:00:02.129> today<00:00:02.370> I'm<00:00:02.429> going<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.580> take<00:00:02.669> a

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
winter and today I'm going to take a

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.730 
winter and today I'm going to take a
look<00:00:02.879> at<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.120> very<00:00:03.330> exciting<00:00:03.720> and<00:00:04.080> very<00:00:04.350> wide

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
look at a very exciting and very wide

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.940 
look at a very exciting and very wide
angle<00:00:04.920> lens<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.910> Canon<00:00:06.299> 10<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:07.140> 18<00:00:07.500> millimeter

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
angle lens the Canon 10 to 18 millimeter

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.730 
angle lens the Canon 10 to 18 millimeter
STM<00:00:08.820> so<00:00:09.330> this<00:00:09.510> lens<00:00:09.750> here<00:00:10.019> has<00:00:10.290> two<00:00:10.530> very

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
STM so this lens here has two very

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.499 
STM so this lens here has two very
exciting<00:00:10.889> features<00:00:11.490> firstly<00:00:12.090> it's<00:00:12.300> got<00:00:12.420> an

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
exciting features firstly it's got an

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.570 
exciting features firstly it's got an
incredibly<00:00:13.019> wide<00:00:13.230> angle<00:00:13.710> especially<00:00:14.370> for<00:00:14.549> a

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
incredibly wide angle especially for a

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.400 
incredibly wide angle especially for a
crop<00:00:14.759> sensor<00:00:15.059> camera<00:00:15.089> at<00:00:15.480> 10<00:00:15.690> millimeters<00:00:16.230> and

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
crop sensor camera at 10 millimeters and

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.769 
crop sensor camera at 10 millimeters and
secondly<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.369> has<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.640> STM<00:00:18.210> motor<00:00:18.240> or

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
secondly it has that STM motor or

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.109 
secondly it has that STM motor or
stepper<00:00:19.199> motor<00:00:19.500> which<00:00:20.340> should<00:00:20.580> mean<00:00:20.789> you

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
stepper motor which should mean you

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.060 
stepper motor which should mean you
should<00:00:21.390> be<00:00:21.420> getting<00:00:21.660> some<00:00:21.930> nice<00:00:22.080> autofocus<00:00:22.890> in

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
should be getting some nice autofocus in

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.269 
should be getting some nice autofocus in
both<00:00:23.760> Stills<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.689> video<00:00:24.930> mode<00:00:25.199> guys<00:00:26.130> if<00:00:26.220> you

10 to 18 STM let's start this video off
by<00:00:38.070> talking<00:00:38.129> about<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.820> build<00:00:39.030> quality<00:00:39.290> now

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
by talking about the build quality now

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.900 
by talking about the build quality now
this<00:00:40.440> lens<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.829> actually<00:00:41.129> quite<00:00:41.340> different<00:00:41.610> to

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
this lens is actually quite different to

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.970 
this lens is actually quite different to
a<00:00:41.940> lot<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.120> other<00:00:42.329> ultra<00:00:42.840> wide<00:00:42.989> lenses<00:00:43.440> now

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
a lot of other ultra wide lenses now

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.010 
a lot of other ultra wide lenses now
traditionally<00:00:44.489> they've<00:00:45.059> been<00:00:45.239> really<00:00:45.600> quite

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
traditionally they've been really quite

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.500 
traditionally they've been really quite
heavy<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.590> quite<00:00:46.829> large<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.940> 10<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.239> 18

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
heavy and quite large the 10 to 18

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.150 
heavy and quite large the 10 to 18
millimeter<00:00:48.960> STM<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.649> other<00:00:49.770> hand<00:00:49.980> is

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
millimeter STM on the other hand is

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.220 
millimeter STM on the other hand is
incredibly<00:00:50.579> light<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.780> almost<00:00:52.079> a

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
incredibly light and it's it's almost a

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.290 
incredibly light and it's it's almost a
petite<00:00:52.559> lens<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.640> don't<00:00:53.820> mind<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
petite lens but I don't mind that and

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.580 
petite lens but I don't mind that and
sometimes<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:54.780> nice<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.199> light<00:00:55.379> lens

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
sometimes it's nice to have a light lens

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
sometimes it's nice to have a light lens
especially<00:00:56.160> if<00:00:56.280> you're<00:00:56.370> going<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.550> be

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
especially if you're going to be

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.889 
especially if you're going to be
traveling<00:00:57.000> with<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.239> now<00:00:57.570> some<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.780> that

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
traveling with it now some of that

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:58.970 
traveling with it now some of that
weight<00:00:58.079> loss<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.379> due<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> fact<00:00:58.859> that

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
weight loss is due to the fact that

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.260 
weight loss is due to the fact that
we've<00:00:59.129> got<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.280> plastic<00:00:59.699> mount<00:00:59.820> on<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.030> bottom

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
we've got a plastic mount on the bottom

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.090 
we've got a plastic mount on the bottom
as<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.870> right<00:01:01.050> here<00:01:01.109> rather<00:01:01.829> than<00:01:01.980> a

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
as you can see right here rather than a

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.740 
as you can see right here rather than a
metallic<00:01:02.520> mount<00:01:02.730> now<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.449> little<00:01:03.660> bit

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
metallic mount now it's a little bit

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.179 
metallic mount now it's a little bit
disappointing<00:01:03.899> but<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.070> be<00:01:05.159> a

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
disappointing but you just have to be a

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.200 
disappointing but you just have to be a
little<00:01:05.369> bit<00:01:05.489> careful<00:01:05.670> when<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.909> put<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.119> on

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
little bit careful when you put it on

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.810 
little bit careful when you put it on
and<00:01:06.510> you'll<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:06.930> okay<00:01:07.170> now<00:01:07.860> moving<00:01:08.130> along<00:01:08.369> up

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
and you'll be okay now moving along up

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.280 
and you'll be okay now moving along up
this<00:01:09.150> lens<00:01:09.420> here<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.869> see<00:01:09.990> we<00:01:10.140> have<00:01:10.260> a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
this lens here you can see we have a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.590 
this lens here you can see we have a
very<00:01:10.560> nice<00:01:10.890> zoom<00:01:11.460> ring<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.330> actually

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
very nice zoom ring and it's actually

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.420 
very nice zoom ring and it's actually
quite<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.780> wide<00:01:13.020> zoom<00:01:13.260> ring<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
quite a wide zoom ring and just like the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.310 
quite a wide zoom ring and just like the
other<00:01:14.549> STM<00:01:14.970> lenses<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> very<00:01:16.080> nice

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
other STM lenses we have a very nice

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.980 
other STM lenses we have a very nice
focus<00:01:16.860> ring<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.220> very<00:01:17.460> smooth<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.119> it's

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
focus ring it's very smooth and it's

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.630 
focus ring it's very smooth and it's
also<00:01:19.170> full<00:01:19.590> time<00:01:19.770> manual<00:01:19.979> focus<00:01:20.369> which<00:01:20.520> is

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
also full time manual focus which is

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.760 
also full time manual focus which is
nice<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.970> see<00:01:21.110> one<00:01:22.110> other<00:01:22.259> feature<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.590> I'm

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
nice to see one other feature that I'm

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.140 
nice to see one other feature that I'm
really<00:01:23.009> happy<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.340> included<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:23.970> lens

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
really happy that included on this lens

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.990 
really happy that included on this lens
is<00:01:24.360> image<00:01:24.720> stabilization<00:01:25.670> sure<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:26.909> an

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
is image stabilization sure on an

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.700 
is image stabilization sure on an
ultra-wide<00:01:27.360> lens<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.900> might<00:01:28.140> not<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.439> so

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
ultra-wide lens it might not be so

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.200 
ultra-wide lens it might not be so
important<00:01:29.250> but<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.640> very<00:01:29.790> nice<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.060> have

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
important but it is very nice to have

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.190 
important but it is very nice to have
especially<00:01:30.720> you're<00:01:30.840> going<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.079> doing

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
especially you're going to be doing

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.109 
especially you're going to be doing
video<00:01:31.500> work<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.979> maybe<00:01:32.400> getting<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.820> up<00:01:32.970> on

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
video work and maybe getting this up on

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.359 
video work and maybe getting this up on
a<00:01:33.150> Steadicam<00:01:33.659> now<00:01:34.380> normally<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.799> my<00:01:34.920> videos<00:01:35.220> I

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
a Steadicam now normally in my videos I

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.249 
a Steadicam now normally in my videos I
like<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.640> test<00:01:35.880> out<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.119> bokeh<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.600> see<00:01:36.869> just

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
like to test out the bokeh and see just

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.690 
like to test out the bokeh and see just
how<00:01:37.380> much<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.860> blur<00:01:38.009> at<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.250> background

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
how much I can blur at the background

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.429 
how much I can blur at the background
but<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.450> lens<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:39.900> not<00:01:40.049> really<00:01:40.290> much<00:01:40.380> of

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
but on this lens it's not really much of

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.929 
but on this lens it's not really much of
a<00:01:40.650> thing<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.100> that's<00:01:41.400> because<00:01:41.670> we've<00:01:41.820> got

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
a thing and that's because we've got

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.179 
a thing and that's because we've got
such<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> wide<00:01:42.450> angle<00:01:42.570> lens<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.680> relatively

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
such a wide angle lens and a relatively

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.800 
such a wide angle lens and a relatively
slow<00:01:44.399> aperture<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.180> actually<00:01:45.659> quite

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
slow aperture it's actually quite

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.359 
slow aperture it's actually quite
difficult<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.259> get<00:01:46.380> any<00:01:46.590> sort<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.040> out<00:01:47.250> of

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
difficult to get any sort of out of

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.490 
difficult to get any sort of out of
focus<00:01:47.579> area<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.630> as<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:48.960> see<00:01:49.020> here<00:01:49.409> if

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
focus area but as you can see here if

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.840 
focus area but as you can see here if
you<00:01:49.560> get<00:01:49.680> close<00:01:49.890> enough<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.189> your<00:01:50.369> subject<00:01:50.759> you

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
you get close enough to your subject you

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.219 
you get close enough to your subject you
can<00:01:50.970> actually<00:01:51.090> get<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> little<00:01:51.570> bit<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.869> bokeh

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
can actually get a little bit of bokeh

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.020 
can actually get a little bit of bokeh
but<00:01:52.829> honestly<00:01:53.130> that's<00:01:53.399> not<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> reason<00:01:54.000> why

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
but honestly that's not the reason why

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.760 
but honestly that's not the reason why
we're<00:01:54.270> getting<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.570> lens<00:01:54.840> now<00:01:55.560> I'd<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.710> to

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
we're getting this lens now I'd like to

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.319 
we're getting this lens now I'd like to
demonstrate<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.340> focal<00:01:56.670> length<00:01:56.820> for<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.149> now

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
demonstrate the focal length for you now

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.760 
demonstrate the focal length for you now

canon 70d the lenses will start out at
18<00:02:04.140> millimeters<00:02:04.680> which<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.860> great<00:02:05.130> for

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
18 millimeters which is great for

18 millimeters which is great for
everyday<00:02:05.579> photography<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:06.840> as<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.049> can<00:02:07.200> see

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
everyday photography but as you can see

autofocus<00:02:32.680> now<00:02:32.829> this<00:02:32.980> lens<00:02:33.189> here<00:02:33.430> has<00:02:33.609> an<00:02:33.730> STM

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
autofocus now this lens here has an STM

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.220 
autofocus now this lens here has an STM
motor<00:02:34.150> which<00:02:34.480> means<00:02:34.659> it<00:02:34.780> should<00:02:34.930> have<00:02:35.079> some

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
motor which means it should have some

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.069 
motor which means it should have some
pretty<00:02:35.439> fast<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:35.950> silent<00:02:36.400> autofocus<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:37.780> also

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
pretty fast and silent autofocus it also

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.660 
pretty fast and silent autofocus it also
is<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.260> very<00:02:38.530> wide<00:02:38.769> angle<00:02:38.799> lens<00:02:39.220> so<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.519> should

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
is a very wide angle lens so it should

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.099 
is a very wide angle lens so it should
be<00:02:39.760> quite<00:02:40.000> easy<00:02:40.180> for<00:02:40.329> it<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.629> keep<00:02:40.780> things<00:02:40.989> in

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
be quite easy for it to keep things in

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.809 
be quite easy for it to keep things in
focus<00:02:41.140> so<00:02:41.739> let's<00:02:41.890> just<00:02:42.040> do<00:02:42.159> a<00:02:42.189> quick<00:02:42.400> test<00:02:42.579> and

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
focus so let's just do a quick test and

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:50.640 
focus so let's just do a quick test and
see<00:02:42.970> just<00:02:43.390> a<00:02:43.510> quick<00:02:43.689> it<00:02:43.810> is<00:02:49.319> so<00:02:50.319> as<00:02:50.440> you<00:02:50.560> can

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
see just a quick it is so as you can

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.819 
see just a quick it is so as you can
tell<00:02:51.299> it's<00:02:52.299> very<00:02:52.359> very<00:02:52.900> easy<00:02:53.170> for<00:02:53.349> it<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.739> do

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
tell it's very very easy for it to do

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.500 
tell it's very very easy for it to do
any<00:02:54.069> kind<00:02:54.340> of<00:02:54.400> auto<00:02:54.609> focusing<00:02:55.060> essentially

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
any kind of auto focusing essentially

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.640 
any kind of auto focusing essentially
because<00:02:55.810> everything<00:02:56.709> is<00:02:56.829> in<00:02:56.950> focus<00:02:57.099> anyway<00:02:57.730> so

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
because everything is in focus anyway so

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.640 
because everything is in focus anyway so
auto<00:02:59.650> focus<00:03:00.040> for<00:03:00.340> stills<00:03:00.579> is<00:03:00.879> very<00:03:01.209> very<00:03:01.420> good

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
auto focus for stills is very very good

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.110 
auto focus for stills is very very good
let's<00:03:02.650> now<00:03:02.739> test<00:03:02.799> out<00:03:03.129> the<00:03:03.220> video<00:03:03.459> autofocus

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
let's now test out the video autofocus

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.610 
let's now test out the video autofocus
and<00:03:04.389> again<00:03:04.629> it<00:03:04.750> shouldn't<00:03:04.989> have<00:03:05.079> any<00:03:05.200> problems

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
and again it shouldn't have any problems

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.770 
and again it shouldn't have any problems
because<00:03:06.060> most<00:03:07.060> of<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.239> things<00:03:07.420> are<00:03:07.599> in<00:03:07.629> focus

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
because most of the things are in focus

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.729 
because most of the things are in focus
anyway<00:03:08.200> but<00:03:08.409> let's<00:03:08.500> test<00:03:08.739> it<00:03:08.889> out

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.599 

we<00:03:14.739> are<00:03:14.889> at<00:03:15.159> 18<00:03:15.790> millimeters<00:03:16.299> as<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:18.310> can<00:03:18.430> see

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
we are at 18 millimeters as you can see

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.240 
we are at 18 millimeters as you can see
most<00:03:18.879> things<00:03:19.290> are<00:03:20.290> in<00:03:20.500> focus<00:03:20.680> but<00:03:21.069> it<00:03:21.160> is

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
most things are in focus but it is

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.949 
most things are in focus but it is
working<00:03:21.579> really<00:03:21.730> quite<00:03:22.000> well<00:03:22.209> what<00:03:22.780> I'll<00:03:22.870> do

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
working really quite well what I'll do

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.710 
working really quite well what I'll do
right<00:03:22.989> now<00:03:23.260> is<00:03:23.410> throw<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.769> 10<00:03:23.949> millimeters

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
right now is throw it to 10 millimeters

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.880 
right now is throw it to 10 millimeters
and<00:03:25.720> we'll<00:03:25.900> see<00:03:26.019> how<00:03:26.169> this<00:03:26.290> works

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.190 

really<00:03:32.700> having<00:03:32.850> no<00:03:33.060> problems<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:33.720> it's<00:03:33.930> dead

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
really having no problems and it's dead

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.430 
really having no problems and it's dead
silent<00:03:34.710> one<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.790> quietest<00:03:36.120> lenses<00:03:36.510> I've

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
silent one of the quietest lenses I've

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.360 
silent one of the quietest lenses I've
heard<00:03:37.650> from<00:03:37.830> Canon<00:03:38.160> yet<00:03:39.890> now<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:40.950> be<00:03:41.130> fair<00:03:41.310> this

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
heard from Canon yet now to be fair this

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.010 
heard from Canon yet now to be fair this
isn't<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.850> lens<00:03:42.030> I'm<00:03:42.210> going<00:03:42.360> to<00:03:42.420> use<00:03:42.540> every<00:03:42.750> day

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
isn't a lens I'm going to use every day

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.840 
isn't a lens I'm going to use every day
so<00:03:43.050> what<00:03:43.590> types<00:03:43.830> of<00:03:43.980> photography<00:03:44.070> is<00:03:44.550> it<00:03:44.670> good

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
so what types of photography is it good

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:45.230 
so what types of photography is it good
for

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
for

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
wide-angle lens you can get some really

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.440 
wide-angle lens you can get some really
nice<00:04:04.890> shots<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.490> if<00:04:05.820> you<00:04:05.880> add<00:04:06.030> in<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.150> image

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
nice shots and if you add in the image

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.930 
nice shots and if you add in the image
stabilization<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.530> STM<00:04:07.920> motor<00:04:07.950> it<00:04:08.820> could

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
stabilization and the STM motor it could

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.150 
stabilization and the STM motor it could
be<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.030> perfect<00:04:09.450> match<00:04:09.570> for<00:04:09.600> moving<00:04:10.170> video<00:04:10.260> so

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
be a perfect match for moving video so

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.130 
be a perfect match for moving video so
let's<00:04:11.310> talk<00:04:11.430> about<00:04:11.489> image<00:04:12.000> quality<00:04:12.209> now<00:04:12.630> so

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
let's talk about image quality now so

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.600 
let's talk about image quality now so
overall<00:04:13.470> I've<00:04:13.709> been<00:04:13.830> really<00:04:14.100> quite<00:04:14.250> impressed

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
overall I've been really quite impressed

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.190 
overall I've been really quite impressed
with<00:04:14.730> this<00:04:14.820> lens<00:04:15.030> especially<00:04:15.690> for<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:15.930> price

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
with this lens especially for the price

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.470 
with this lens especially for the price
now<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:17.010> is<00:04:17.070> decently<00:04:17.579> sharp<00:04:17.880> at<00:04:18.030> all<00:04:18.090> focal

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
now it is decently sharp at all focal

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.580 
now it is decently sharp at all focal
lengths<00:04:18.750> especially<00:04:19.200> if<00:04:19.260> you're<00:04:19.350> going<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.530> be

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
lengths especially if you're going to be

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.310 
lengths especially if you're going to be
using<00:04:19.890> image<00:04:20.190> stabilization<00:04:20.930> we<00:04:21.930> do<00:04:22.079> have<00:04:22.290> a

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
using image stabilization we do have a

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.810 
using image stabilization we do have a
little<00:04:22.590> bit<00:04:22.770> of<00:04:22.860> chromatic<00:04:23.220> aberration<00:04:23.669> but

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
little bit of chromatic aberration but

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.280 
little bit of chromatic aberration but
nothing<00:04:24.090> that<00:04:24.240> can't<00:04:24.419> be<00:04:24.510> fixed<00:04:24.570> in<00:04:24.900> post<00:04:25.050> and

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
nothing that can't be fixed in post and

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.260 
nothing that can't be fixed in post and
it<00:04:25.410> is<00:04:25.530> quite<00:04:25.830> easy<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:26.280> get<00:04:26.640> flares<00:04:26.970> with<00:04:27.150> this

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
it is quite easy to get flares with this

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.909 
it is quite easy to get flares with this
lens<00:04:27.480> especially<00:04:28.320> if<00:04:28.440> you're<00:04:28.560> not<00:04:28.680> get<00:04:28.830> a

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
lens especially if you're not get a

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.920 
lens especially if you're not get a
pitcher<00:04:29.190> down<00:04:29.370> that's<00:04:30.150> not<00:04:30.300> a<00:04:30.330> huge<00:04:30.600> issue<00:04:30.780> for

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
pitcher down that's not a huge issue for

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.110 
pitcher down that's not a huge issue for
me<00:04:31.230> I<00:04:31.410> actually<00:04:31.560> quite<00:04:31.860> like<00:04:32.070> flaring<00:04:32.520> but

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
me I actually quite like flaring but

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.120 
me I actually quite like flaring but
some<00:04:33.270> people<00:04:33.600> do<00:04:34.530> want<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.740> know<00:04:34.890> whether<00:04:35.040> or

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
some people do want to know whether or

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.190 
some people do want to know whether or
not<00:04:35.250> it's<00:04:35.430> there<00:04:35.690> distortion<00:04:36.690> is<00:04:36.810> handled

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
not it's there distortion is handled

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.780 
not it's there distortion is handled
really<00:04:37.380> quite<00:04:37.680> well<00:04:37.830> for<00:04:38.040> an<00:04:38.130> ultra<00:04:38.460> wide<00:04:38.490> and

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
really quite well for an ultra wide and
