00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
been in there for a few hours but

shortly<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.170> we'll<00:00:22.560> get<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.710> new<00:00:22.949> pressure<00:00:23.400> fix

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
shortly and we'll get a new pressure fix

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.029 
shortly and we'll get a new pressure fix
for<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.900> see<00:00:25.080> if<00:00:25.199> indeed<00:00:25.410> things<00:00:25.890> are

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
for you to see if indeed things are

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.650 
for you to see if indeed things are
increasing<00:00:26.550> or<00:00:26.699> staying<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.119> same<00:00:27.150> or<00:00:27.570> even

increasing or staying the same or even

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.509 
increasing or staying the same or even
weakening<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.170> bit<00:00:28.349> what<00:00:28.920> we<00:00:29.039> think<00:00:29.250> it's<00:00:29.400> been

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
weakening a bit what we think it's been

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.730 
weakening a bit what we think it's been
happening<00:00:30.000> here<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.109> hurricane<00:00:31.560> has

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
happening here is that the hurricane has

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.060 
happening here is that the hurricane has
been<00:00:31.980> undergoing<00:00:32.759> some<00:00:33.270> shear<00:00:33.570> it's

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
been undergoing some shear it's

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.260 
been undergoing some shear it's
interacting<00:00:35.070> with<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.250> bit<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.640> trough<00:00:35.910> in

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
interacting with a bit of a trough in

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.030 
interacting with a bit of a trough in
the<00:00:36.750> atmosphere<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> little<00:00:37.649> bit<00:00:37.829> farther

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
the atmosphere here a little bit farther

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.240 
the atmosphere here a little bit farther
to<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.370> west<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:39.300> was<00:00:39.510> anticipated<00:00:40.379> but<00:00:40.980> in

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
to the west this was anticipated but in

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.280 
to the west this was anticipated but in
the<00:00:41.520> longer<00:00:41.760> term<00:00:42.000> while<00:00:42.930> we're<00:00:43.110> talking

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
the longer term while we're talking

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.529 
the longer term while we're talking
basically<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.100> next<00:00:44.219> day<00:00:44.460> or<00:00:44.579> two<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:45.270> think

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
basically the next day or two we think

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.450 
basically the next day or two we think
that<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.020> trough<00:00:46.289> will<00:00:46.559> pretty<00:00:46.739> much<00:00:46.829> go<00:00:47.190> away

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
that the trough will pretty much go away

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.490 
that the trough will pretty much go away
and<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:48.059> its<00:00:48.210> place<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.450> pretty<00:00:48.780> big<00:00:48.960> ridge<00:00:49.230> will

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
and in its place a pretty big ridge will

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.760 
and in its place a pretty big ridge will
build<00:00:49.820> generally<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.120> north<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.870> where

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
build generally to the north of where

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.400 
build generally to the north of where
this<00:00:53.160> hurricane<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.840> hurricane<00:00:55.260> will

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
this hurricane is and the hurricane will

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.410 
this hurricane is and the hurricane will
get<00:00:55.590> forced<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> west-northwest

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
get forced to the west-northwest

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.799 
get forced to the west-northwest

there well there is a chance that we may

there well there is a chance that we may
get<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.320> hurricane<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.070> move<00:01:23.850> north<00:01:24.180> ala

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
get this hurricane to move north ala

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.469 
get this hurricane to move north ala
Dennis<00:01:25.890> did<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> few<00:01:26.400> weeks<00:01:26.460> ago<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.119> then

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
Dennis did a few weeks ago and then

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.539 
Dennis did a few weeks ago and then
maybe<00:01:27.720> make<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.439> curve<00:01:28.680> or<00:01:29.009> recurve

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
maybe make the curve or recurve

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.030 
maybe make the curve or recurve
hopefully<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.210> maybe<00:01:31.079> not<00:01:31.350> directly<00:01:31.710> affect

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
hopefully and maybe not directly affect

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.950 
hopefully and maybe not directly affect
the<00:01:32.070> u.s.<00:01:32.310> maybe<00:01:32.520> not<00:01:32.759> make<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> landfall<00:01:33.479> that

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
the u.s. maybe not make a landfall that

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.870 
the u.s. maybe not make a landfall that
is<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.380> hope<00:01:34.560> here<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.369> going<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.850> a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
is the hope here but it's going to be a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.210 
is the hope here but it's going to be a
real<00:01:36.299> close<00:01:36.630> call<00:01:36.659> if<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.470> does<00:01:37.680> happen<00:01:37.710> and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
real close call if that does happen and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.890 
real close call if that does happen and
there's<00:01:38.790> probably<00:01:38.970> at<00:01:39.270> least<00:01:39.299> an<00:01:39.630> equal

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
there's probably at least an equal

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.630 
there's probably at least an equal
chance<00:01:39.930> at<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.439> point<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:41.159> we<00:01:41.280> are<00:01:41.460> going

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
chance at this point that we are going

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.520 
chance at this point that we are going
to<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.150> major<00:01:42.630> impact<00:01:43.049> along<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
to get a major impact along the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.170 
to get a major impact along the
southeast<00:01:43.979> coast<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.430> US<00:01:44.700> sometime

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
southeast coast of the US sometime

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.480 
southeast coast of the US sometime
toward<00:01:45.450> midweek<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.040> one<00:01:47.250> that

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
toward midweek so this is one that

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.190 
toward midweek so this is one that
really<00:01:47.909> needs<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.210> be<00:01:48.329> watched<00:01:48.570> because<00:01:48.810> we<00:01:49.079> do

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
really needs to be watched because we do

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.440 
really needs to be watched because we do
