00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:13.000
 the fusillo in rap makes a double challenge 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.820
 besides being a very easy pasta 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.190
 very fast to deliver from from 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.650
 cook and serve on the street also 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.600
 because there is the use of sauces 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.390
 squeeze now famous than that of 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.940
 combal la carbonara amatriciana il 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.720
 piece of bread and pasta put together 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:34.450
 when there is also a large sauce 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.789
 however persuasive I find it an alibi 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.409
 of perversion are two elements that 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.480
 they are able to tie together with those who are small 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:42.850
 they eat pasta with bread and my grandfather 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.280
 he told me he didn't eat pass with bread 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.989
 it is not elegant and more but always said 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.670
 that those who ate pasta with bread did not 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.539
 would have ever made money in life and 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.539
 he was not wrong 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:02.660
 the father we paired and the piada 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:06.869
 Romagnola Italian the other concept a 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.750
 intrinsique of the fusillo is what it is 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.690
 you will hardly eat a pass 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.810
 biting inside you can do 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.490
 a freak that fills your mouth but 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.000
 you will never have the teeth that go to 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.380
 bite passes this innovation 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.869
 in economics and functionality 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.420
 we added something to the way 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.020
 also perceive the gluttony 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.120
 some pasta 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.980
 maybe I would say that street food does not 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.870
 affects the haute cuisine 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.450
 maybe 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.480
 to the origins of the recipes that 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.770
 they come from street food being perhaps 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.570
 street food 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.770
 the first expression of catering 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.450
 Italian 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.910
 haute cuisine in some way 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.020
 it can affect street food in the sense 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:00.240
 that can improve it because it has to be said 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.250
 which is in small spaces like normally 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.500
 are the locations that serve seafood 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.280
 you need to have excellent organization 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.280
 a great technique 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.060
 well now maybe their time to sit down 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.060
 at table tonight in my cell 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.630
 bakker still clogged the office between 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.140
 email 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.140
 request to which I would say I would say 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.650
 I take my rat and go to the office a 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.650

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.660

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.230

 Tropea onion obviously slightly 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:26.829
