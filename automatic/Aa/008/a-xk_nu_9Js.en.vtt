00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
damage on top of the Nexus that's going

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.389 
damage on top of the Nexus that's going
to<00:00:48.570> be<00:00:48.660> very<00:00:48.690> very<00:00:49.170> difficult<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:50.219> new

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
to be very very difficult the new

to be very very difficult the new
verdict<00:00:50.640> counter<00:00:50.910> yeah<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:52.140> fact

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
verdict counter yeah that is in fact

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.740 
verdict counter yeah that is in fact
within<00:00:52.829> range<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.820> those<00:00:53.969> siege<00:00:54.180> tanks<00:00:54.480> able

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
within range so those siege tanks able

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.020 
within range so those siege tanks able
to<00:00:54.809> dish<00:00:55.020> out<00:00:55.199> damage<00:00:55.440> onto<00:00:56.010> those<00:00:56.520> buildings

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
to dish out damage onto those buildings

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.209 
to dish out damage onto those buildings
and<00:00:57.239> onto<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.020> Texas<00:00:58.440> as<00:00:58.559> well<00:00:58.590> taking<00:00:59.100> down

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
and onto that Texas as well taking down

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.590 
and onto that Texas as well taking down
that<00:00:59.340> pylon<00:00:59.730> making<00:01:00.030> sure<00:01:00.120> there's<00:01:00.449> no

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
that pylon making sure there's no

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
additional of units company Colossus

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.850 
additional of units company Colossus
have<00:01:02.910> been<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.300> colossus<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.409> doing<00:01:04.830> that

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
have been a colossus it doing that

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.770 
have been a colossus it doing that
longest<00:01:05.339> attack<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.909> damage<00:01:06.570> has<00:01:06.750> been

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
longest attack that the damage has been

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.830 
longest attack that the damage has been
reduced<00:01:07.350> for<00:01:08.130> those<00:01:08.280> Colossus<00:01:08.760> however<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
reduced for those Colossus however the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.870 
reduced for those Colossus however the
attack<00:01:10.140> rate<00:01:10.350> has<00:01:10.530> been<00:01:10.560> increased<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.850> that

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
attack rate has been increased so that

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.149 
attack rate has been increased so that
really<00:01:12.510> only<00:01:12.720> changes<00:01:13.260> things<00:01:13.409> changes
