00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.980
 to develop 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.810
 by the way at the same speed 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.320
 they require care glasses 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.320
 the same global energy needs

 the idea came to him on a return trip to the Caribbean 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.180
