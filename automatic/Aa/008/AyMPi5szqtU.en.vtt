00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.420

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.560
 a significant event but so far unfortunately not 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.440

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.299
 real outcome despite the significance 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.310
 negotiations and meetings in Ukrainian 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.920
