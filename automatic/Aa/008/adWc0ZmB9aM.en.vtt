free<00:01:08.189> man<00:01:08.659> could<00:01:09.659> be<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:10.020> they<00:01:10.140> fix<00:01:10.409> their

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
free man could be but they fix their

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.450 
free man could be but they fix their
mistakes<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:10.979> they<00:01:11.040> got<00:01:11.220> better

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
mistakes and they got better

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.219 
mistakes and they got better
progressively<00:01:11.909> over<00:01:12.030> time<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.840> think<00:01:13.080> that

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
progressively over time and I think that

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.859 
progressively over time and I think that
with<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.799> right<00:01:14.159> people<00:01:14.580> handling<00:01:14.939> things

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
with the right people handling things

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.230 
with the right people handling things
could<00:01:16.140> be<00:01:16.170> awesome<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.680> immediately<00:01:17.460> George

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
could be awesome and immediately George

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.100 
could be awesome and immediately George
Lucas<00:01:18.479> was<00:01:18.600> kind<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.750> running<00:01:18.900> his<00:01:19.049> own

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
Lucas was kind of running his own

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.960 
Lucas was kind of running his own
creation<00:01:19.350> anyway<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.460> think<00:01:20.549> it's<00:01:20.729> cool<00:01:20.909> to

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
creation anyway so I think it's cool to

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.039 
creation anyway so I think it's cool to
someone<00:01:21.240> else<00:01:21.330> getting<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.659> chance<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.930> play

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
someone else getting a chance to play

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.570 
someone else getting a chance to play
around<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.979> clone<00:01:23.220> war<00:01:23.430> series

around with it and that clone war series

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.370
