is<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.289> take<00:00:52.500> inventory<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:53.160> who<00:00:53.340> we<00:00:53.460> are

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
because how do we know where we grow how

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.430 
because how do we know where we grow how
do<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.160> know<00:00:56.340> what<00:00:56.460> are<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.640> next<00:00:56.789> steps<00:00:57.260> if<00:00:58.260> we

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
do we know what are the next steps if we

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.139 
do we know what are the next steps if we
don't<00:00:58.590> take<00:00:58.770> an<00:00:58.920> honest<00:00:59.190> assessment<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.850> who

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149

don't take an honest assessment of who
we<00:01:00.270> are<00:01:00.620> sometimes<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.890> means<00:01:02.070> we<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.340> to

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
we are sometimes this means we have to

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.820

believe<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.509> important<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:53.460> trials<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.090> my

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
believe is so important the trials in my

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.660 
believe is so important the trials in my
life<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.899> fires<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.649> have<00:01:55.710> tested<00:01:56.310> me<00:01:56.490> I

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
life the fires that have tested me I

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.289 
life the fires that have tested me I
feel<00:01:57.420> like<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.780> what<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.290> what<00:01:58.530> grows<00:01:58.770> me<00:01:59.009> and

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
feel like of what is what grows me and

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.459 
feel like of what is what grows me and
I've<00:02:00.299> heard<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.600> been<00:02:00.719> said<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:01.320> not

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
I've heard it been said that it's not

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.920 
I've heard it been said that it's not
the<00:02:01.619> trial<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.280> breaks<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.909> it's<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.600> trial

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
the trial that breaks you it's the trial

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.770 
the trial that breaks you it's the trial
that<00:02:04.110> reveals<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:05.040> us<00:02:05.759> what<00:02:06.240> we<00:02:06.360> need<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.630> do

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
that reveals in us what we need to do

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.330 
that reveals in us what we need to do
and<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.020> liken<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.439> her<00:02:07.619> finding<00:02:07.979> gold<00:02:08.160> a

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
and I liken it to her finding gold a

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.639 
and I liken it to her finding gold a
goldsmith<00:02:08.819> when<00:02:09.390> he<00:02:09.479> wants<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.810> purify<00:02:10.229> Goldie

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
goldsmith when he wants to purify Goldie

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.390 
goldsmith when he wants to purify Goldie
heats<00:02:10.920> at

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
heats at

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.910 
heats at
and<00:02:11.489> then<00:02:12.360> scrapes<00:02:12.780> off<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.170> drawers<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.769> the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
and then scrapes off the drawers of the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.429 
and then scrapes off the drawers of the
top<00:02:14.159> so<00:02:14.519> that<00:02:14.549> that<00:02:14.760> gold<00:02:15.090> becomes<00:02:15.450> pure<00:02:15.989> and

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
top so that that gold becomes pure and

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.890 
top so that that gold becomes pure and
that's<00:02:16.620> what<00:02:16.769> trials<00:02:17.189> do<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.519> our<00:02:17.610> life<00:02:17.849> if<00:02:18.120> we

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
that's what trials do in our life if we

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.539 
that's what trials do in our life if we
allow<00:02:19.200> them<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.680> grow<00:02:19.709> us<00:02:20.159> and<00:02:20.340> let<00:02:20.430> them

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
allow them to grow us and let them

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.410 
allow them to grow us and let them
become<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:21.030> person<00:02:21.209> you<00:02:21.450> want<00:02:21.599> to<00:02:21.659> be<00:02:23.329> do<00:02:24.329> we

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
become that person you want to be do we

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.960 
become that person you want to be do we
have<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.720> do<00:02:24.870> list<00:02:24.900> or<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.500> be<00:02:25.650> list<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.879> I

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
have a to do list or to be list and I

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.099 
have a to do list or to be list and I
think<00:02:27.209> this<00:02:27.269> is<00:02:27.329> really<00:02:27.450> important<00:02:28.079> because

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
think this is really important because

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.530 
think this is really important because
if<00:02:28.470> we're<00:02:28.650> focused<00:02:29.069> too<00:02:29.250> much<00:02:29.280> on<00:02:29.519> tasks<00:02:30.030> what

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
if we're focused too much on tasks what

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.509 
if we're focused too much on tasks what
does<00:02:30.629> it<00:02:30.750> matter<00:02:30.959> if<00:02:31.109> I<00:02:31.290> finish<00:02:31.530> my<00:02:31.620> taxes<00:02:32.370> and

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
does it matter if I finish my taxes and

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.460 
does it matter if I finish my taxes and
I<00:02:32.579> got<00:02:32.760> all<00:02:32.849> these<00:02:32.939> things<00:02:33.180> done<00:02:33.420> but<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.200> let<00:02:34.349> my

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.530 
I got all these things done but I let my
family<00:02:34.650> down<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.250> let<00:02:35.700> my<00:02:35.790> wife<00:02:35.939> down<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.299> wasn't

letting that actually represent in our

letting that actually represent in our

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
to see ourselves in every opportunity

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:28.490 
to see ourselves in every opportunity
we're<00:03:27.239> demonstrating<00:03:27.510> our<00:03:27.870> character<00:03:28.260> with

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500

we're demonstrating our character with
everything<00:03:29.010> that<00:03:29.129> we<00:03:29.220> do<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.639> therefore

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
everything that we do and therefore

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.939 
everything that we do and therefore
Trust<00:03:30.930> is<00:03:31.109> the<00:03:31.139> most<00:03:31.409> important<00:03:31.829> thing

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
Trust is the most important thing

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.369 
Trust is the most important thing

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
because if you don't have trust it

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.199 
because if you don't have trust it
doesn't<00:03:34.620> matter<00:03:34.739> what<00:03:34.889> you<00:03:35.040> say<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.970> doesn't
