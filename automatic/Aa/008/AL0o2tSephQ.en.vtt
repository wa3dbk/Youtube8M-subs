00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.969
 we find ourselves for new impressions in entrepreneurs with the 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.659
 rugby star at paluel marmont co-founder of the company at michÃ¨le and augustin 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:20.579
 with Michel Nadeau will produce 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.509
 the company that today has 39 people and that it realized 30 million 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:26.369
 euros of turnover 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.380
 so obviously we had a lot of questions for this company that you 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.140
 know all invited to accept it wins so a respite 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.080
 have an augustin adjustment i would like to ask you and finally how 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.180
 do you explain today such a notoriety and companies and 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.770
 finally pressing the agri-food sector ita sector but it's 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.770
 still difficult to innovate so why this notoriety 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.120
 I think it's just because we have an innovative approach 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.230
 we did we did not want to make a mark so it became a brand at 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.870
 it's just two names of two friends who were sitting together 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.280
 on the school benches in the 4th 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.059
 of what put a little marketing a job that pointed out that I 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.570
 do what she did and he did a business school but what I did 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.680
 a sacred mixture after falling into a gait is cited the point of 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.870
 departure the consumer feeling 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.780
 may be a little fed up with being handled by very little footsteps 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.930
 understand the legibility of the ingredients that make up the products 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.410
 large-scale food consumption 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.620
 and therefore not go in a boat in a sincere way to share 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.030
 a human helburg world adventure with consumers who want it and 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.960
 I believe that sky 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.159
 works today 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.929
 it is this process of sincerity and joy of living and sharing 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:31.750
 consumers 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.310
 in stockholm there are questions that went back to desertec figaro 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.299
 other entrepreneurs 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.780
 a matter of aesthetics the years run on the benefits even sees her 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.500
 banking communication it finally allows a better control of 

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:46.420
 costs we will say messages and it avoids especially expenses of arranged 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.539
 the advantage of the witnesses when one embodies his brand knows that it is more 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.060
 easy to do a little pub on the channels as they say 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.909
 which allows to discover one or more adventures to the greatest number 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.689
 of ways to orient festival of costs is very low here are shots 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.079
 still powerful my only one of these amounts here is the time that passes 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.689
 who still feels really reduced so also what you think to lead 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.630
 a company that is just starting to do 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.990
 she conducts her communication like that i think they are not thought 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:09.969
 it's before all 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:13.069
 to agitate your imagination or not your wallet me I worked in 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.889
 big boxes before I was a little scared by the ability to throw 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:16.889
 money through the windows 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:19.959
 and I think that when we have good ideas we have new ideas 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.529
 little innovative we are able to talk about itself to discover a 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:25.810
 low cost product so basically the creed it's not fair and your 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:28.989
 imagination and pavon wallet so in this case we find today with 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.340
 105 applications still in the big distribution in India in the sea ropes 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.730
 black 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.689
 is the ass against all over not yet then 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.559
 Today, we are almost present in all the big stores 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:40.040
 distribution in France 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.590
 given the servant vocation of kumar very well so we are really very 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.730
 Qualitative gourmet city center at first as all our 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.600
 efforts on it but elsewhere it is found everywhere so in 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.140
 business catering of airports stations its stable a little tense in 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.540
 cinema but also monoprix franprix carrefour city which are for us 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.750
 extremely important partners in the test price make it a mark 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.510
 also a little bit a bit popular in the cast is not in a 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.050
 elitist approach where luxury but we are of the quality accessible to the biggest 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.460
 number she will have just today in you have to go forward you grant 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.749
 your capital you still want to go further we want to develop further 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:17.129
 your own boutiques finally been outpaced also internationally 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.279
 and for that you need captivating vast operation of increase of 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:22.170
 capital then we are lucky that after six years 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.260
 why today the business is profitable so they clear the money 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.600
 to feed its growth so either we take for a growth rate 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.589
 group ends at 50% growth per year and are figures that are still 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:34.409
 modest compared to market prices 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.749
 either we decide to express more quickly the potential that we assume of this 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:41.189
 adventure at this mark and there a few months it is necessary to appeal to capital 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:44.579
 outsiders to go faster so these facts that lie to fund a 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:45.639
 shop project 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.399
 to complete a little distribution and that a somewhat exclusive offer that we 

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:51.099
 will have in the coffee shops boutique michel auguste it is also referred 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.329
 the international we started russia japan the eyes it's happening 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.069
 very well but tinkering body a little so the idea happened the speed 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.009
 superior and as a holiday critic that often comes up is that 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:01.069
 you are warm 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.449
 what do you answer to me dear I do not know what that means 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.869
 it does not matter to me that the country is reporting on price 

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:09.439
 be good but what is the only judge for me is the end consumer 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.860
 so it's that consumer buys not once thanks to 7 after 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.559
 because the entire product mix ordered to the plates marketing 

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:19.509
 so me what matters to me is the quality of the raw material that I 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.659
 so go when I go in my cow to drink fresh whole milk that's 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:25.080
 always more expensive than lula is partly skim 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.879
 chili coffee knows it to find the right balance between quality and 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:30.159
 value for money 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:34.069
 thank you very much augustin paluel-marmont we find ourselves very quickly yet very 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:34.780
 impressive 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.590
 of entrepreneurs in the meantime we could of course ask your questions% and 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.770
 I am waiting for the cities of figaro point fr and tf1 and eauze to make them 

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:46.240

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.060
