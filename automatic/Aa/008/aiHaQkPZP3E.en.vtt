00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.620
 we did not come from nowhere we were here 

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:07.359
 Although they do not want to see us we know well 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.009
 what is shut up what it costs 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.780
 bite your tongue and we've done it 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.790
 many times so as not to lose the job 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.070
 to not look bad so they do not tell us 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.350
 so they do not get sick too many times 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.420
 and sometimes too long to 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.490
 there we go but we know well to say what 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.710
 our and do we also know how to do 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.930
 clearly because we have done everything with 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.920
 our work our effort as 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.030
 did our parents and our 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.940
 grandparents 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.710
 we do not come from nothing, we are the ones 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.120
 those who were here were already here 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.340
 from always and those who arrived one day 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.750
 and those who come from all 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.450
 parts those that move those that 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.980
 work sufferers who Laughs 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.410
 who are outraged and those who return to 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.870
 get up every morning every morning 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.640
 if we know what it costs to get up every 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.989
 tomorrow to go to work and also 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.540
 we know what it costs to get up every 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.670
 tomorrow without work we have sown 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.850
 the orchards we have swept the streets and 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.450
 we have put bricks we have taught 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.780
 maths 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.870
 And now we have also launched 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.549
 life cooperation projects 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.860
 we are the ones who learn every day of 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.930
 our children and our grandparents 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.070
 they teach us dignity we know from 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.409
 the cuts and we know about the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.780
 privatizations we know of not reaching 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.310
 end of the month and the mortgage we know of 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.799
 the broken sidewalks of pretending I of the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.330
 blood is made clear that's why we have 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.790
 protested and we have worked for another 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.670
 possible world another world solidarity 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.619
 transparency and cooperation democracy 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.280
 of the truth not only of which 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.869
 presumes name 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.760
 we are the ones we see at school 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.229
 public the guarantee of the future are the 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.520
 that demand a public partnership for 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.560
 everyone who does not want to see it 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.240
 turned into a business we are the ones that 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.830
 every day they see the services deteriorate 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.570
 public we are the ones who pay the receipts 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.369
 of light and those that sometimes can not 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.930
 pay it those who have spaces for 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.369
 culture sport for 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.470
 living together but do not want 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.820
 commodify and spend the night in 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.830
 the town hall to defend the school 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.330
 of music and we camped in the square to 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.280
 that a family was not expelled from their 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.390
 house we are the ones who do not have the 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.190
 correction installed in the 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.289
 jointly in the town hall of 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.690
 tebas those who are fed up with useless 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.850
 squandering what it costs so much we are 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.440
 those who denounce the abuses are 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.360
 We say that this is not the case 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.690
 conditions of which other mobile all 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.730
 together all together we come from what 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.010
 comes we follow the same thing that you saw and 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.080
 as you remember everything as you 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.610
 We said that it's okay that they will not count 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.680
 with us we do not want more deceptions 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.209
 that the things by his name that we have 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.920
 rights and that we want them to be 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.180
 our that democracy is a matter of 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.269
 all and that our people do not 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.709
 it is already good that enough is enough 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.819
 We have gone where you were , we have already 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.579
 looked like tumors 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.349
 you know us we have leaned and 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.359
 we have protested but that is not 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.069
 enough and that's why we've decided 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:44.049
 take charge of what is ours 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.430
 It belongs to everyone because you have to do 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.010
 things differently and because together 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.620
 we can do them we are the corporation the 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.359
 transparency democracy we are 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.359
