off all these other dudes those sans and
that<00:01:39.090> possibly<00:01:39.450> will<00:01:39.659> take<00:01:39.840> quite<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.200> while

that possibly will take quite a while

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.770

from the series seeing those battles

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.389 
from the series seeing those battles
going<00:01:42.960> down<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:43.470> I'm<00:01:43.500> pretty<00:01:43.740> sure<00:01:43.829> Goku<00:01:44.280> will

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
going down but I'm pretty sure Goku will

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.700 
going down but I'm pretty sure Goku will
be<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> lot<00:01:44.729> stronger<00:01:45.030> than<00:01:45.210> Koshi<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.049> all

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
be a lot stronger than Koshi and all

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.069 
be a lot stronger than Koshi and all
those<00:01:46.979> lieutenants<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.820> captains<00:01:48.299> and

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
those lieutenants and captains and

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.530 
those lieutenants and captains and
everything<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.920> possibly<00:01:50.729> Goku<00:01:51.180> will<00:01:51.329> take

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
everything so possibly Goku will take

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.210 
everything so possibly Goku will take
care<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.720> all<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.110> these<00:01:52.290> guys<00:01:52.799> along<00:01:53.159> with

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
care of all of these guys along with

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.700 
care of all of these guys along with
Vegeta<00:01:53.640> piccolo<00:01:54.600> might<00:01:54.990> take<00:01:55.229> care<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.530> some

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710
