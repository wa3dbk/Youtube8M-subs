00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
exactly that expensive so many of you

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.839 
exactly that expensive so many of you
might<00:00:27.660> get<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.080> try<00:00:28.260> them<00:00:28.410> out<00:00:28.529> but<00:00:29.099> again<00:00:29.580> he's

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
might get to try them out but again he's

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.840 
might get to try them out but again he's
only<00:00:30.060> 80<00:00:30.359> /<00:00:30.869> also<00:00:31.260> he<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.769> quite<00:00:32.189> expensive<00:00:32.430> for

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
only 80 / also he is quite expensive for

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.209 
only 80 / also he is quite expensive for
a<00:00:33.059> 80<00:00:33.420> overall<00:00:33.840> player<00:00:34.050> but<00:00:34.649> let's<00:00:34.829> begin<00:00:35.010> to

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
a 80 overall player but let's begin to

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.090 
a 80 overall player but let's begin to
of<00:00:35.340> how<00:00:35.640> he<00:00:36.000> plays<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.690> he<00:00:37.140> has<00:00:37.350> high<00:00:37.590> attacking

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
of how he plays so he has high attacking

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.369 
of how he plays so he has high attacking
a<00:00:38.190> medium<00:00:38.550> defending<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.930> work<00:00:40.110> rates

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
a medium defending so the work rates

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.840 
a medium defending so the work rates
weren't<00:00:40.680> really<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.070> bad<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.610> honest

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
weren't really that bad to be honest

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.459 
weren't really that bad to be honest
with<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.120> guys<00:00:42.270> because<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.750> really<00:00:43.200> know<00:00:43.320> his

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
team out position but many of you have

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.119

better if you want to try them out as a

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.039 
better if you want to try them out as a
left<00:01:57.090> forward<00:01:57.390> rather<00:01:57.570> than<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.869> left

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
left forward rather than the left

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.109 
left forward rather than the left
midfielder<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.799> don't<00:01:59.280> think<00:01:59.340> I'd<00:01:59.640> recommend

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
midfielder I don't think I'd recommend

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.600 
midfielder I don't think I'd recommend
him<00:02:00.420> much<00:02:00.600> as<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.869> left<00:02:01.049> midfielder

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
him much as the left midfielder

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.830 
him much as the left midfielder
especially<00:02:02.610> due<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.820> his<00:02:03.119> passing<00:02:03.479> his

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
especially due to his passing his

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.520 
especially due to his passing his
pausing<00:02:04.259> isn't<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.649> was<00:02:05.579> average<00:02:06.240> at<00:02:06.360> best

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
pausing isn't that was average at best

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.589 
pausing isn't that was average at best
nothing<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.340> know<00:02:08.459> amazing<00:02:08.759> when<00:02:09.479> it

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
nothing to you know amazing when it

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.820 
nothing to you know amazing when it
comes<00:02:09.750> down<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:09.989> crossing<00:02:10.440> or<00:02:10.530> anything<00:02:10.800> like

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
comes down to crossing or anything like

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.990 
comes down to crossing or anything like
that<00:02:10.920> left<00:02:11.370> for<00:02:11.610> words<00:02:11.790> he<00:02:12.180> seems<00:02:12.480> more

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
that left for words he seems more

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.300 
that left for words he seems more
the<00:02:13.330> more<00:02:13.840> of<00:02:13.870> a<00:02:13.990> bad<00:02:14.200> player<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.650> just<00:02:14.920> cut<00:02:15.160> in

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
the more of a bad player to just cut in

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.610 
the more of a bad player to just cut in
financial<00:02:15.910> or<00:02:16.090> just<00:02:16.330> take<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.480> long<00:02:16.750> shot<00:02:16.990> from

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
financial or just take a long shot from

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.980 
financial or just take a long shot from
the<00:02:18.250> edge<00:02:18.280> of<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.550> area<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:19.420> he<00:02:19.570> seems<00:02:19.810> more

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
the edge of the area so he seems more

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.420 
the edge of the area so he seems more
effective<00:02:20.470> as<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.650> left<00:02:20.950> forward<00:02:21.220> in<00:02:21.310> my

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
effective as the left forward in my

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.010 
effective as the left forward in my
opinion<00:02:21.730> because<00:02:21.940> he<00:02:22.330> has<00:02:22.450> some<00:02:22.660> really<00:02:22.840> good

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
opinion because he has some really good

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.470 
opinion because he has some really good
pace<00:02:23.230> as<00:02:23.410> well<00:02:23.590> what<00:02:24.130> defensively<00:02:24.910> he<00:02:25.240> isn't

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
pace as well what defensively he isn't

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.720 
pace as well what defensively he isn't
that<00:02:25.630> good<00:02:25.870> because<00:02:26.020> he<00:02:26.680> is<00:02:26.800> really<00:02:27.310> really

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
that good because he is really really

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.010 
that good because he is really really
weak<00:02:28.090> I<00:02:28.360> mean<00:02:28.570> he<00:02:29.440> says<00:02:29.980> 66<00:02:30.790> strength<00:02:31.660> on<00:02:31.840> his

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
weak I mean he says 66 strength on his

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.470 
weak I mean he says 66 strength on his
car<00:02:32.260> in<00:02:32.740> his<00:02:32.950> in<00:02:33.160> gamestats<00:02:33.550> he<00:02:33.970> seems<00:02:34.240> much

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
car in his in gamestats he seems much

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.970 
car in his in gamestats he seems much
weaker<00:02:34.840> than<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:35.110> I<00:02:35.230> don't<00:02:35.260> know<00:02:35.530> why<00:02:35.740> and

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
weaker than that I don't know why and

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.340 
weaker than that I don't know why and
