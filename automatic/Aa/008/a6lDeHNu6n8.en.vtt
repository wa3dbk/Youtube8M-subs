00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.630
 number nine and now welcome here 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.109
 on my channel I'm nice you are 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.420
 There we have a nice with the reason 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.890
 gameplay mw3 I have it myself 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.900
 nothing he plays more on the computer 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.850
 and that's why he is all the prettier 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.010
 that we have been sent at that time 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.119
 and i can only say the guy is working 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.850
 over and lay on the knockout again 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.640
 dunk ton you have so today otherwise 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.210
 but let's go around the question as possible 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.550
 thousandfold asked heads back 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.809
 wide 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.950
 a thousand monika already asked what 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.739
 Do I stop black ops 3 ? 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.110
 My expectations and I have it so often 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.680
 I have written that now 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.600
 again over it so I'm expecting 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.539
 quite simply lots of fun and games 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.649
 he hope I look as follows 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.019
 to get 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.570
 I would like that is not so 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.490
 what gives us an extra tint? 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.960
 jumps and stuff like that though I do 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.159
 I'm afraid that 's something similar 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:19.229
 I would hope so 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.729
 that there are reasonable servers with it 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.890
 the whole sometimes you will be fairer 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.590
 at the game so I still know at 62 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.090
 I only had a 6k line there 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.860
 there you have against the people with the good 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.079
 Management is no chance at all 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.990
 which was also extremely important for 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.540
 call of duty times I mean how often where 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.189
 that somehow said so 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.979
 decent server we want damn 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.049
 do not be so hard so the game 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.009
 times as a bit righteous is he 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.009
 now I can not 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.570
 can complain relatively good the 100000 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.909
 he can no longer manage the ps4 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.180
 as a 40 process means in the lies 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.790
 at just under 15 to 20 in the normal case 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.409
 and that's okay but that 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.780
 all about wlan yes I am still 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.329
 Wlan because my sugar room is there 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.180
 behind and until then equation not 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.530
 completely forgotten by therefore still plays with 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.229
 but i want to do it 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.660
 does not complain about reasonable servers and 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.690
 all would be 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.920
 the maps they should not be so in the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.840
 go high 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.090
 So I do not mind if it's there 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.590
 two three levels are indeed synonymous if it 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.620
 then more, especially if you do not 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.910
 can do extra extra boost then that 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.310
 no sense that somewhere high 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.260
 climbs and then from above but just 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.040
 Sniper the whole time is sitting so yes 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.280
 does not like it so much and I like it 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.280
 not even these mega big maps yes 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.720
 So no idea that will always be one 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.140
 bit the fun today died 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.320
 is and has to separate by miles 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.050
 then I would be very over arms 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.310
 Woman who really exists 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.290
 So I do not want to be like that somehow 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.660
 have laser weapons or because they too 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.090
 not such the counterfeit weapons 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.250
 which is actually a real weapon 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.070
 which are not installed only 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.140
 because the right ones can not do that 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.940
 So I would like to be bought 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.830
 I like playing with ak 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.260
 play after eleven and would then 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.500
 also that the sound of the weapons exactly 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.490
 so all this is drowning at the weapons 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.470
 here with sparkling stones and rolls the 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.510
 Chemo and so on is not for me 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.780
 everything is not brown if there is one 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.700
 Ordinary gold valley would surround the 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.430
 you can earn yourself properly 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.950
 has that too great but that's the 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.230
 must be like everywhere else 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.880
 black ops 1 yes that's right 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.310
 made whether one who earn only 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.989
 must or for black ops 1 this must be titan 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.200
 and can later buy free with money 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.090
 I do not care about that when 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.910
 at least it's fine to me either way 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.770
 earn or he buys with online 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.350
 money so not here with neutral because 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.060
 I am her opponent of so I will 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.410
 I will not put in any more money 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.510
 have I already bought the game and I 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.640
 will buy this pass again and me 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.470
 think so have enough money from 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.380
 I also get something important from me 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.730
 who is that you finally got his headset 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.560
 or use properly 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:18.260
 So listen to this sound that you have 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.669
 already really cool so otherwise looking for 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.950
 and destroy later for example 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.400
 you made the opponent really heard 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.710
 become 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.960
 as soon as he tells the story so white 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.020
 I do not like such an elephant, yes that 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.190
 I also wanted to be one of those 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.780
 could not have run or he can without sound 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.210
 I'm there for me too 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.660
 whole setting somehow fit so yes 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.160
 I horny future returns the map allowed 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.740
 learned and used the future yes 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.070
 best as a card as you 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.289
 then really could be somewhere now 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.289
 with weapons that you could have now 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:56.199
 and the sounds are important too yes 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:58.580
 So not only that 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.310
 ambient noise are reasonable 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:05.210
 but also the sound of the weapon 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.889
 must fit then yes killstreaks is too 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.710
 maybe ne thing from mine 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:12.800
 We do not need any atoms 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.979
 or something that always misleads people 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.919
 just to camp his team or play 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:21.919
 to boost to cheat to send 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:25.250
 we do not need that, I, who I am 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:27.740
 finds really cool if the highest kill 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.539
 series if the dogs so worth it 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.510
 old black ops 1 him certainly one 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.979
 he has big fan of this part like 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.740
 that was also the part played 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:38.330
 where I really good the first time 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.110
 Gameplay could jump back then 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.880
 for me and that will not be enough then 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.370
 stop doing such a shop ghana 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.490
 or such worship where you can 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.630
 changing properly can be all 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.389
 will be satisfied then again 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.560
 give the 100 plus gameplays and I am 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.560
 satisfied 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.199
 then I wish that in the game if 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.320
 then there is and you can tell there and there 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:05.570
 an error the weapon is still too strong 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.580
 in the map there are the ongoing in the 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.530
 clips in it was not planned 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.599
 that since which are that one 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.130
 as soon as possible patches come out he 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:15.080
 has it all here again 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.000
 is cleaned up and the fun is not 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.490
 suffers and now comes that 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.590
 most important thing I want and that 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.430
 has nothing at all with the game 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:27.110
 to do with yourself but rather something with you 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.270
 because I have the last elections 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.130
 call of duty so had the feeling that 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:35.320
 People do not care anymore 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:38.659
 have let in the game that has always been so 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:42.650
 badly done playable side 

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:45.469
 here continue to look at the 2 but yes 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.150
 he can still play so well if 

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:48.830
 you do not get involved in it 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.289
 if you do not even because you do not 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:54.380
 even if you do not break anything at the beginning 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:56.000
 Sometime further reflects and looks what 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.279
 there is going on and especially with his 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.529
 Colleagues then continue playing yes 

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:02.779
 So then the game makes a lot more 

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:05.210
 Do not always sweat this solo 

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:07.279
 I need five times or something 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.919
 Whatever we do then I will do it 

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:12.050
 no fun just for fun 

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:15.320
 play on the game 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:18.710
 then I guarantee you will black ops 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.120
 3 If it gets really good then we will 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.139
 yes, that's not all, I say 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.479
 I just have not played it yet 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:24.979
 I'm curious if the beta I will 

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:26.750
 Pre-book in all cases and me 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:30.020
 I'll hopefully also be in the picture key 

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:33.260
 get and then I will play 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.300
 we'll keep watching so now you're on 

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.680
 the series 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.960
 like and in the comments 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.539
 what you write for expectations 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:47.029
 from the game and not otherwise 

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:50.150
 forget and from it and say is like 

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:54.710
 always drumming drum rolls 

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:59.469
 As usual , that's what I do online and me 

00:07:54.710 --> 00:08:03.190
 Hope we always see ourselves wearing swirls 

00:07:59.469 --> 00:08:03.190
 and see you again
