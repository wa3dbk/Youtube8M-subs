00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:27.140
 good evening to all, dear friends, welcome 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.060
 in this new block tutorial for 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.180
 object block for minecraft object 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.300
 this time we will talk about the number block 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.730
 3 or the canvas is normal 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.920
 feeding was shaved because not 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.830
 there is no better way to get rid of 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:48.739
 quintals of dirt without wanting to waste 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:51.739
 800 as they are called no things however it is 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.660
 yes without wasting 800 shovels that put us 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.390
 a nice creeper for two or three hearts there 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.020
 pice or blues clean that either 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.579
 you can do it with detergent 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.770
 fantastic who does not go to clean the squares 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.460
 of the city with detergent for the 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.020
 falcri for maybe ok then the dadt 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.180
 what can we say simply that the 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.950
 block more present in the states 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.119
 superficial between the state of fat and ba 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.130
 surface and the stone below plus o 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.460
 unless reality is so for paper 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.570
 fantastic let's see some digging here 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.570
 below it already has it 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:35.500
 what we are simply looking for 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:40.659
 diamonds maybe certain melodies effect 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:44.530
 here we have just said this 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.939
 we will find the stone at 99.9 percent of the 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.520
 cases you will find the first state 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.829
 surface of a gas block which 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.689
 we said that then all the vanishes 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:56.049
 his two blocks or packs one above 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.579
 the other is the stone that we know the 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.409
 absolute most present block in the 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:04.569
 over war of the base world in which c spa 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:08.380
 it is not the first time it is yes 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:11.069
 found in the low area and of all of 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.140
 all the world below the whole area 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:18.940
 perfect of what we can also say 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.750
 interesting that can become gas but 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.870
 this we have already talked about 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.360
 abundantly perfect, always kind 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.590
 always in to become the gas in front of us 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.870
 can become gas and if you want 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.090
 more detailed information see the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.690
 our tutorial on fat the first 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.280
 gas tutorial we did and 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.600
 so this is another matter 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.880
 death is if excavated will leave to itself 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.160
 same difference as gas or 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:51.160
 stone that will give the first and the second 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:53.079
 cobol stone instead if the fat leaves 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.739
 Article 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.520
 hear the scene directly from how 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.300
 you hold 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.240
 he said let's get ahead he made it clear 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:09.100
 if there are stupid people like me who 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.690
 could where it takes time if everyone 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.550
 they were like you creeper it was just 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:19.120
 this of the world at this fantastic time 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.490
 using a hoe on the normal way 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.160
 naturally separate gold china 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:29.740
 I too have done this all yours 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:31.600
 jewels in this already flew of that 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.880
 that came from your general funds 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.440
 I use them again, I don't use it to do 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:41.730
 see that it becomes a fall brand becomes 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.670
 fablehaven caf at the milan 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.130
 the arable land that Syrians 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.160
 will turn into dirt i turned into 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:56.370
 of other transformed walks that I was 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:59.140
 to say if starna sv transformed 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.860
 when you trample it when it's not there 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.810
 near water or simply yourself 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.830
 if you throw an animal over it don't 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.010
 we know if it is not said what happens if 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:16.000
 don't put a seed in it for a while 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:18.790
 the same thing happens but a question 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.020
 more and more on thunder away but you girls 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.690
 but you also have boyfriends 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.640
 talkative like this is a key of 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.740
 shutdown are rockol icons found 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.450
 this has nothing to do with the guardian in front of 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.390
 I wonder why then bla bla bla 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.100
 grind you have a button to push you 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.380
 to know you know the icing outside 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:40.230
 you can simply get a rate 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.230
 to turn them off no lever will not vote 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.900
 the de is useless as well as the gas for 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.930
 any kohler crafting recipe 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:53.230
 and stone and can turn you off not even 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.210
 for arezzo I'm going to see if I can 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.430
 melt my girlfriend too 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.030
 It at least half the problem becomes 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.440
 a nice hoe less to some use 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.630
 not if I can go out in the meantime 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.910
 is 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.710
 the computer to a touch very similar but 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.660
 in class you can open and close a 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.630
 liking this also has nothing to do with 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.980
 the tutorials but maybe under so many girls 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.480
 that also an extraordinary why not 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.390
 I can turn off my boyfriend like 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:22.170
 I turn off minecraft because no it's okay and me 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:26.120
 now turn off boyfriend of and to 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.120
 next bye bye
