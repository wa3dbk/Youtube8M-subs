00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.500 
what the game will be like you know we
are<00:00:07.259> not<00:00:08.160> just<00:00:08.189> trying<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:09.000> make<00:00:09.150> another

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
are not just trying to make another

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.700 
are not just trying to make another
armor<00:00:09.960> this<00:00:10.559> time<00:00:10.800> we<00:00:11.160> are<00:00:11.280> trying<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.670> make<00:00:11.849> it

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 
armor this time we are trying to make it

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.700 
armor this time we are trying to make it
really<00:00:13.710> interesting<00:00:14.009> for<00:00:14.820> greater<00:00:15.450> audience

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
really interesting for greater audience

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.090 
really interesting for greater audience
to<00:00:16.710> significantly<00:00:17.699> improve<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.210> engine<00:00:18.570> and

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
to significantly improve the engine and

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.710 
to significantly improve the engine and
to<00:00:20.100> deliver<00:00:20.460> really<00:00:21.119> interesting<00:00:21.510> gameplay

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
to deliver really interesting gameplay

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.859 
to deliver really interesting gameplay
so<00:00:22.100> we'll<00:00:23.100> work<00:00:23.369> on<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.760> physical<00:00:24.300> simulation

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
so we'll work on the physical simulation

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.040 
so we'll work on the physical simulation
will<00:00:25.560> improve<00:00:25.920> animations<00:00:26.630> there<00:00:27.630> will<00:00:27.720> be<00:00:27.750> 3

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
will improve animations there will be 3

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.599 
will improve animations there will be 3
mission<00:00:28.380> editor<00:00:28.470> which<00:00:28.920> will<00:00:29.130> be<00:00:29.250> certainly

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
mission editor which will be certainly

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.080 
mission editor which will be certainly

you can notice the high-resolution

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.820 
you can notice the high-resolution
satellite<00:01:05.670> imagery<00:01:06.330> we've<00:01:07.110> actually<00:01:07.320> sent

Greg elimination the final game it will

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.340 
Greg elimination the final game it will
be<00:01:33.509> possible<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:35.090> modify<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.479> your<00:01:36.690> gear<00:01:36.930> but

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
be possible to modify in your gear but

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.499 
be possible to modify in your gear but
now<00:01:37.590> let's<00:01:38.460> see<00:01:38.700> what<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:38.940> can<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.240> with<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
now let's see what we can do with the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.540 
now let's see what we can do with the
long<00:01:39.690> range<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.410> tix<00:01:40.740> which<00:01:41.610> can<00:01:41.820> be<00:01:41.940> unmounted

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
long range of tix which can be unmounted

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.120 
long range of tix which can be unmounted
there<00:01:44.550> we<00:01:44.670> go<00:01:45.110> but<00:01:46.110> item<00:01:46.470> on<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> collimator

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
there we go but item on the collimator

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.240 
there we go but item on the collimator
on<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.539> the<00:01:48.539> animations<00:01:48.990> are<00:01:49.200> not<00:01:49.800> completed

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
on it the animations are not completed

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.120 
on it the animations are not completed
reactor<00:01:50.610> days<00:01:50.789> but<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.800> it's<00:01:52.800> already

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
reactor days but the it's already

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.180 
reactor days but the it's already
working<00:01:53.250> game-wise<00:01:54.200> I've<00:01:55.200> done<00:01:55.500> switched<00:01:55.860> to

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
working game-wise I've done switched to

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.350 
working game-wise I've done switched to
another<00:01:56.820> shooter

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.150 

and<00:02:00.480> I'm<00:02:00.930> not<00:02:01.140> going<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.380> demonstrate<00:02:01.620> a<00:02:01.920> lid

let's see the rag doll in the pot from

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.690 
let's see the rag doll in the pot from
the<00:02:14.970> clothes<00:02:16.190> how<00:02:17.190> did<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.400> switch<00:02:17.670> to
