and let the water drain out of that once

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.950 
and let the water drain out of that once
this<00:01:35.469> is<00:01:35.679> done<00:01:35.889> draining<00:01:36.450> simply<00:01:37.450> close<00:01:37.719> it

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
this is done draining simply close it

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.520 
this is done draining simply close it
and<00:01:38.079> then<00:01:38.859> pull<00:01:39.389> the<00:01:40.389> smaller<00:01:40.780> valve<00:01:41.170> which<00:01:41.499> is

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
and then pull the smaller valve which is

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.230 
and then pull the smaller valve which is
your<00:01:41.829> grey<00:01:42.039> water<00:01:42.340> that's<00:01:42.670> going<00:01:42.789> to<00:01:42.909> be<00:01:43.060> your

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
your grey water that's going to be your

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.139 
your grey water that's going to be your
showers<00:01:43.719> and<00:01:43.990> sink<00:01:44.409> water<00:01:44.649> and<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.969> reason

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
showers and sink water and the reason

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.660 
showers and sink water and the reason
for<00:01:46.479> doing<00:01:46.600> this<00:01:46.899> is<00:01:47.109> because<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:47.770> grey<00:01:48.369> water

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
for doing this is because the grey water

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.809 
for doing this is because the grey water
will<00:01:49.090> actually<00:01:49.450> help<00:01:49.630> rinse<00:01:50.079> if<00:01:50.670> there's<00:01:51.670> any

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
will actually help rinse if there's any

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.999 
will actually help rinse if there's any
solid<00:01:52.389> waste<00:01:52.630> or<00:01:52.929> anything<00:01:53.319> left<00:01:53.590> in<00:01:53.799> this

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
solid waste or anything left in this

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:54.629 
solid waste or anything left in this
hose

hose

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:57.749 
hose
it'll<00:01:55.270> help<00:01:55.420> rinse<00:01:55.899> that<00:01:56.170> hose<00:01:56.469> out<00:01:56.859> so<00:01:57.609> that

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
it'll help rinse that hose out so that

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.029 
it'll help rinse that hose out so that
it<00:01:57.850> doesn't<00:01:57.880> have<00:01:58.299> a<00:01:58.329> lot<00:01:58.600> of<00:01:58.630> a<00:01:58.990> lot<00:01:59.649> of<00:01:59.770> debris

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
it doesn't have a lot of a lot of debris

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.059 
it doesn't have a lot of a lot of debris
inside<00:02:00.639> of<00:02:00.850> it<00:02:00.969> so<00:02:01.749> make<00:02:02.409> sure<00:02:02.439> you<00:02:02.679> pull<00:02:02.920> your
