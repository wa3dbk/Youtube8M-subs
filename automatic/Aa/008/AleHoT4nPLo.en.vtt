differences in custom game for setting
up<00:00:39.180> an<00:00:39.300> assault<00:00:39.690> map<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.650> obviously<00:00:41.460> you

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
up an assault map that obviously you

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.850 
up an assault map that obviously you
need<00:00:41.730> set<00:00:42.000> up<00:00:42.120> game<00:00:42.330> type<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.750> be<00:00:42.780> assault<00:00:43.320> it

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
need set up game type to be assault it

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.190 
need set up game type to be assault it
doesn't<00:00:44.160> matter<00:00:44.220> what<00:00:44.520> assault<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:46.020> do

bomb and one bomb but any of them will

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:52.189 
bomb and one bomb but any of them will
work<00:00:50.730> if<00:00:50.970> you're<00:00:51.089> setting<00:00:51.390> up<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.600> custom<00:00:51.989> game

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
work if you're setting up a custom game

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.770 
work if you're setting up a custom game
type<00:00:52.470> it<00:00:53.129> just<00:00:53.400> changes<00:00:53.970> what<00:00:54.150> the<00:00:54.239> defaults

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
type it just changes what the defaults

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.259 
type it just changes what the defaults
are<00:00:54.930> going<00:00:55.080> to<00:00:55.140> be<00:00:55.290> now<00:00:55.620> score<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.280> win<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:57.089> is

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
are going to be now score to win this is

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.810 
are going to be now score to win this is
how<00:00:57.420> many<00:00:57.480> explosions<00:00:58.410> happen<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.550> that

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
how many explosions happen like that

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.520 
how many explosions happen like that
nations<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> bomb<00:01:01.110> to<00:01:01.530> win<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.830> game

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
nations of the bomb to win the game

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.530 
nations of the bomb to win the game
obviously<00:01:04.530> because<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.190> team<00:01:05.640> game<00:01:05.970> you

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
obviously because it's a team game you

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.470 
obviously because it's a team game you
can't<00:01:06.810> change<00:01:07.050> team<00:01:07.500> enabled<00:01:08.210> for<00:01:09.210> assault

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
can't change team enabled for assault

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.090 
can't change team enabled for assault
option<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.290> where<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.740> set<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:10.920> up

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
option this is where you can set it up

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.280 
option this is where you can set it up
to<00:01:11.159> be<00:01:11.280> multi<00:01:11.880> ball<00:01:12.060> which<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:13.080> know<00:01:13.110> if

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
to be multi ball which is you know if

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.110 
to be multi ball which is you know if
you<00:01:13.380> had<00:01:13.500> two<00:01:13.830> teams<00:01:14.100> three<00:01:14.460> teams<00:01:14.670> for<00:01:14.880> teens

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
you had two teams three teams for teens

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.450 
you had two teams three teams for teens
whatever<00:01:15.480> that's<00:01:16.080> how<00:01:16.200> many<00:01:16.380> bombs<00:01:17.070> will<00:01:17.370> be

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
whatever that's how many bombs will be

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.570 
whatever that's how many bombs will be
in<00:01:17.580> play<00:01:18.500> one-sided<00:01:19.500> which<00:01:19.890> means<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.370> team

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
in play one-sided which means the team

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.130 
in play one-sided which means the team
alternates<00:01:21.120> between<00:01:21.210> attacking<00:01:21.990> and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
alternates between attacking and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.710 
alternates between attacking and
defending<00:01:22.530> their<00:01:22.950> bases<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.700> then<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
defending their bases and then the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.040 
defending their bases and then the
neutral<00:01:25.200> bomb<00:01:25.410> which<00:01:25.950> if<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.600> use<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.870> one

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
neutral bomb which if you use this one

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.530 
neutral bomb which if you use this one
you<00:01:28.230> need<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> neutral<00:01:29.310> bomb<00:01:29.580> plate<00:01:29.970> which<00:01:30.270> is

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
you need a neutral bomb plate which is

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.120 
you need a neutral bomb plate which is
if<00:01:30.870> you've<00:01:31.020> seen<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.290> tutorial<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:31.980> how<00:01:32.010> to

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
if you've seen the tutorial on how to

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.250 
if you've seen the tutorial on how to
set<00:01:32.340> up<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.520> map<00:01:32.730> you<00:01:33.300> know<00:01:33.480> how<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.810> set<00:01:34.080> that<00:01:34.110> up

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
set up a map you know how to set that up

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.170 
set up a map you know how to set that up
and<00:01:34.650> then<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.160> got<00:01:35.310> grifball<00:01:35.850> which<00:01:36.030> is

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
and then you got grifball which is

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.880 
and then you got grifball which is
basically<00:01:36.630> kind<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.260> general<00:01:37.620> rules

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
basically kind of like the general rules

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.680 
basically kind of like the general rules
of<00:01:38.220> Griffith<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.000> were<00:01:39.090> setting<00:01:39.360> up<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.600> of

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
of Griffith you were setting up one of

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.390 
of Griffith you were setting up one of
those<00:01:39.810> maps<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.380> would<00:01:40.530> set<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.980> grifball

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
those maps you would set the grifball

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
those maps you would set the grifball
rules<00:01:41.910> to<00:01:42.270> get<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.720> work<00:01:42.980> now<00:01:44.360> this<00:01:45.360> is

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
rules to get that to work now this is

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.540 
rules to get that to work now this is
how<00:01:45.720> long<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.110> takes<00:01:46.350> actually<00:01:46.890> arm<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.370> while

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
how long it takes actually arm it while

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.790 
how long it takes actually arm it while
you're<00:01:47.730> in<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.030> base<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:49.260> is<00:01:49.410> how<00:01:49.530> long

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
you're in the base and this is how long

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.800 
you're in the base and this is how long
it<00:01:50.250> takes<00:01:50.580> for<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.940> bomb<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.120> actually<00:01:51.540> blow

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
it takes for the bomb to actually blow

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.800 
it takes for the bomb to actually blow
up<00:01:52.190> the<00:01:53.190> disarm<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.880> obviously<00:01:54.240> how<00:01:54.450> long<00:01:54.660> does

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
up the disarm is obviously how long does

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.570 
up the disarm is obviously how long does
it<00:01:54.870> take<00:01:55.140> for<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.620> let's<00:01:55.830> say<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.100> blue<00:01:56.340> team

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
it take for like let's say the blue team

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.040 
it take for like let's say the blue team
puts<00:01:56.880> their<00:01:57.060> bomb<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.510> how<00:01:57.660> long<00:01:57.840> does<00:01:57.990> it

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
puts their bomb and how long does it

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.950 
puts their bomb and how long does it
take<00:01:58.260> the<00:01:58.410> red<00:01:58.560> team<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.860> disarm<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.960> like

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
take the red team to disarm it and like

way if I like disarm the bomb it
automatically<00:02:17.730> appears<00:02:18.150> back<00:02:18.390> on<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:18.660> other

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
automatically appears back on the other

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.490 
automatically appears back on the other
players<00:02:19.769> space<00:02:20.660> weapons<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.810> vehicles<00:02:21.840> is

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
players space weapons and vehicles is

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.880 
players space weapons and vehicles is
exactly<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.280> same<00:02:23.489> as<00:02:23.730> default<00:02:24.890> general

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
exactly the same as default general

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.459 
exactly the same as default general
settings<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.549> exactly<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.719> same<00:02:27.900> as<00:02:28.049> default

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:28.469 
settings is exactly the same as default

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.949 
settings is exactly the same as default
the<00:02:29.219> only<00:02:29.430> thing<00:02:29.609> that's<00:02:29.790> different<00:02:30.030> is<00:02:30.450> the

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
the only thing that's different is the

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:31.910 
the only thing that's different is the
bomb<00:02:31.170> carrier

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
bomb carrier

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.140 
bomb carrier
rates<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.280> this<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.580> if<00:02:32.790> you're<00:02:33.030> actually

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
rates and this is if you're actually

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.170 
rates and this is if you're actually
holding<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.780> bomb<00:02:34.700> default<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:35.940> your

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
holding the bomb default is your

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.210 
holding the bomb default is your
movement<00:02:36.569> is<00:02:36.690> slowed<00:02:36.989> you<00:02:37.470> can<00:02:37.620> only<00:02:37.770> be<00:02:38.099> in

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
movement is slowed you can only be in

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.080 
movement is slowed you can only be in
the<00:02:38.310> passenger<00:02:38.910> only<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:42.140> your<00:02:43.940> yeah<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:44.970> think

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
the passenger only and your yeah I think

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.240 
the passenger only and your yeah I think
that's<00:02:45.390> pretty<00:02:45.510> much<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.750> only<00:02:46.069> default<00:02:47.069> I

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
that's pretty much the only default I

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.309 
that's pretty much the only default I
thought<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:47.700> had<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:48.209> waypoint<00:02:48.720> on<00:02:49.050> your<00:02:49.170> head

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
thought you had a waypoint on your head

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.020 
thought you had a waypoint on your head
but<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.590> guess<00:02:49.800> not<00:02:49.980> but<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.310> can<00:02:50.489> set<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.880> up<00:02:50.970> to

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
but I guess not but you can set it up to

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.510 
but I guess not but you can set it up to
be<00:02:51.600> like<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:52.050> waypoint<00:02:52.290> on<00:02:52.770> your<00:02:52.920> head<00:02:53.069> visible

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
be like a waypoint on your head visible

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.850 
be like a waypoint on your head visible
to<00:02:53.610> everybody<00:02:53.940> or<00:02:54.239> just<00:02:54.270> your<00:02:54.540> allies<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.709> can
