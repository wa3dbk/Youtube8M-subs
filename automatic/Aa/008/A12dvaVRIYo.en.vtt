aqua<00:02:03.040> so<00:02:03.549> those<00:02:04.180> are<00:02:04.299> the<00:02:04.360> three<00:02:04.600> people<00:02:04.960> I<00:02:05.470> was

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
aqua so those are the three people I was

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.679 
aqua so those are the three people I was
about<00:02:06.399> to<00:02:06.520> say<00:02:06.640> on<00:02:06.790> my<00:02:06.820> team<00:02:07.210> but<00:02:07.390> I'm<00:02:07.540> actually

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
about to say on my team but I'm actually

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.380 
about to say on my team but I'm actually
not<00:02:07.899> in<00:02:08.079> this<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:09.310> also<00:02:09.519> on<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:09.940> third<00:02:10.149> team

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
not in this and also on the third team

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.640 
not in this and also on the third team
I'm<00:02:10.570> pretty<00:02:10.840> sure<00:02:11.049> there<00:02:11.230> was<00:02:11.320> like<00:02:11.470> some

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
I'm pretty sure there was like some

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.520 
I'm pretty sure there was like some
other<00:02:11.739> ant<00:02:12.010> eyes<00:02:12.310> or<00:02:12.489> something<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:14.110> Negro

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
other ant eyes or something the Negro

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.160 
other ant eyes or something the Negro
cell<00:02:14.860> pot<00:02:15.130> kid<00:02:15.489> and<00:02:15.790> can't<00:02:16.150> find<00:02:16.510> Nemo<00:02:16.930> I

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
cell pot kid and can't find Nemo I

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.930 
cell pot kid and can't find Nemo I
believe<00:02:17.829> they<00:02:17.950> were<00:02:18.010> in<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.160> two-man<00:02:18.549> maybe<00:02:18.850> a

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
believe they were in a two-man maybe a

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.370 
believe they were in a two-man maybe a
three-minute<00:02:19.450> another<00:02:19.750> third<00:02:19.959> I<00:02:20.079> couldn't

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
three-minute another third I couldn't

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.560 
three-minute another third I couldn't
get<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:20.620> from<00:02:20.739> watching<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.100> video<00:02:21.310> but<00:02:22.299> they

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
get it from watching the video but they

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.080 
get it from watching the video but they
were<00:02:22.630> ant<00:02:22.930> eyes<00:02:23.170> I'm<00:02:23.470> unlike<00:02:24.310> 90%<00:02:24.940> sure<00:02:25.060> that

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
were ant eyes I'm unlike 90% sure that

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.020 
were ant eyes I'm unlike 90% sure that
those<00:02:25.870> were<00:02:26.049> ant<00:02:26.200> eyes<00:02:26.579> so<00:02:27.579> I<00:02:27.820> don't<00:02:27.970> know

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
those were ant eyes so I don't know

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.250 
those were ant eyes so I don't know
maybe<00:02:28.209> if<00:02:28.329> you<00:02:28.390> know<00:02:28.510> who<00:02:28.630> those<00:02:28.780> people<00:02:28.840> are

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
maybe if you know who those people are

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.710 
maybe if you know who those people are
exposed<00:02:30.190> them<00:02:30.489> in<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.700> comments<00:02:31.090> section<00:02:31.150> but

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
exposed them in the comments section but

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.930 
exposed them in the comments section but
I'm<00:02:32.440> pretty<00:02:33.190> sure<00:02:33.280> they<00:02:33.489> were<00:02:33.549> worse<00:02:33.669> they

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
I'm pretty sure they were worse they

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.490 
I'm pretty sure they were worse they
they<00:02:34.150> got<00:02:34.329> smacked<00:02:34.570> around<00:02:34.750> as<00:02:35.079> well<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:35.440> this

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
they got smacked around as well so this

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.740 
they got smacked around as well so this
is<00:02:35.560> kind<00:02:35.769> of<00:02:35.799> like<00:02:35.949> three<00:02:36.190> try<00:02:36.370> hard<00:02:36.549> teams

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
is kind of like three try hard teams

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.150 
is kind of like three try hard teams
but<00:02:37.960> it<00:02:38.140> wasn't<00:02:38.440> really<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.620> close<00:02:38.920> game

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
but it wasn't really a close game

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.180 
but it wasn't really a close game
whatsoever<00:02:39.820> so<00:02:40.570> I<00:02:40.900> don't<00:02:41.380> know<00:02:41.470> anyways<00:02:41.950> I

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
whatsoever so I don't know anyways I

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.120 
whatsoever so I don't know anyways I
think<00:02:43.030> this<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.570> gonna<00:02:43.690> be<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.990> last<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.440> the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
think this is gonna be the last of the

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.950 
think this is gonna be the last of the
uploads<00:02:45.940> where<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.180> upload<00:02:46.210> it<00:02:46.480> from<00:02:46.690> now<00:02:46.810> my

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
uploads where I upload it from now my

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.110 
uploads where I upload it from now my
point<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.260> view<00:02:47.440> for<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.370> little<00:02:48.640> bit<00:02:48.790> I'm<00:02:48.970> not

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
point of view for a little bit I'm not

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.490 
point of view for a little bit I'm not
sure<00:02:49.300> I<00:02:49.330> have<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.630> check<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.930> files<00:02:49.960> but<00:02:50.410> I'm

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
sure I have to check the files but I'm

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.570 
sure I have to check the files but I'm
pretty<00:02:50.740> sure<00:02:50.890> these<00:02:51.040> were<00:02:51.160> like<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.310> main

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
pretty sure these were like the main

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.730 
pretty sure these were like the main
three<00:02:51.880> that<00:02:52.030> I<00:02:52.060> went<00:02:52.270> back<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.570> got<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:53.620> were

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
three that I went back and got that were

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.710 
three that I went back and got that were
important<00:02:54.310> so<00:02:54.730> that<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.120> gives<00:02:55.270> a<00:02:55.360> few<00:02:55.510> more

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
important so that it gives a few more

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.790 
important so that it gives a few more
but<00:02:55.840> they're<00:02:55.959> gonna<00:02:56.050> probably<00:02:56.200> uploaded<00:02:56.740> on

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
but they're gonna probably uploaded on

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.030 
but they're gonna probably uploaded on
my<00:02:56.890> second<00:02:57.250> channel<00:02:57.550> but<00:02:58.510> yeah<00:02:59.040> anyways

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
my second channel but yeah anyways

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.470 
my second channel but yeah anyways
that's<00:03:00.310> pretty<00:03:00.520> much<00:03:00.610> all<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:00.820> needed<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.240> cover

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
that's pretty much all I needed to cover

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.890 
that's pretty much all I needed to cover
as<00:03:01.780> far<00:03:02.560> as<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:03.190> video<00:03:03.340> is<00:03:03.610> concerned<00:03:04.150> as<00:03:04.810> far

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
as far as the video is concerned as far

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.300 
as far as the video is concerned as far
as<00:03:05.020> the<00:03:05.140> gameplay<00:03:05.350> is<00:03:05.590> concerned<00:03:05.950> actually<00:03:06.280> I

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
as the gameplay is concerned actually I

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.250 
as the gameplay is concerned actually I
should<00:03:06.490> say<00:03:06.520> oh<00:03:06.940> actually<00:03:07.780> know<00:03:08.080> one<00:03:08.200> more

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
should say oh actually know one more

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.440 
should say oh actually know one more
thing<00:03:08.320> also<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:09.100> got<00:03:09.730> this<00:03:09.820> from<00:03:09.970> theater<00:03:10.300> mode

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
thing also I got this from theater mode

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.070 
thing also I got this from theater mode
so<00:03:10.840> I<00:03:10.870> believe<00:03:11.410> like<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.770> last<00:03:12.270> three<00:03:13.270> minutes

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
so I believe like the last three minutes

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.940 
so I believe like the last three minutes
I<00:03:14.290> think<00:03:14.590> were<00:03:15.010> not<00:03:15.489> there<00:03:15.790> so<00:03:16.780> I<00:03:17.470> think<00:03:17.739> it<00:03:17.830> was

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
I think were not there so I think it was

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.940 
I think were not there so I think it was
a<00:03:17.980> host<00:03:18.220> migration<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:19.290> he<00:03:20.290> didn't<00:03:20.530> say<00:03:20.680> both

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
a host migration and he didn't say both

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.000 
a host migration and he didn't say both
parts<00:03:21.340> he<00:03:21.459> just<00:03:21.640> shaved<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.940> first<00:03:22.540> part<00:03:23.010> but

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
parts he just shaved the first part but

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.890 
parts he just shaved the first part but
at<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.700> point<00:03:24.880> of<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.239> I<00:03:25.300> think<00:03:25.540> that<00:03:25.780> we're

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
at the point of that I think that we're

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.080 
at the point of that I think that we're
winning<00:03:26.080> by<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.320> hundred<00:03:26.890> points<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:27.610> one<00:03:28.000> of

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
winning by a hundred points and one of

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.940 
winning by a hundred points and one of
the<00:03:28.239> one<00:03:29.110> of<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.230> kids<00:03:29.440> had<00:03:29.590> already<00:03:29.800> like

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
the one of the kids had already like

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.010 
the one of the kids had already like
dashed<00:03:30.220> or<00:03:30.489> left<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.910> game<00:03:31.090> so<00:03:31.360> it<00:03:31.600> was<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.900> to

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
dashed or left the game so it was the to

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.990 
dashed or left the game so it was the to
be<00:03:32.140> three<00:03:32.350> at<00:03:32.410> that<00:03:32.500> point<00:03:32.800> and<00:03:32.980> they<00:03:33.910> were

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
be three at that point and they were

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.610 
be three at that point and they were
already<00:03:34.090> getting<00:03:34.270> smacked<00:03:34.570> up<00:03:34.720> pretty<00:03:34.900> bad<00:03:35.170> so

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
already getting smacked up pretty bad so

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.380 
already getting smacked up pretty bad so
I<00:03:35.980> don't<00:03:36.459> really<00:03:36.550> know<00:03:36.730> what<00:03:36.880> happened<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.209> it

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
I don't really know what happened to it

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.870 
I don't really know what happened to it
I'm<00:03:38.020> pretty<00:03:38.380> sure<00:03:38.620> it's<00:03:38.860> saved<00:03:39.160> it's<00:03:39.760> not

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
I'm pretty sure it's saved it's not

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.220 
I'm pretty sure it's saved it's not
saved<00:03:40.180> but<00:03:40.450> like<00:03:40.600> it<00:03:40.720> was<00:03:40.810> like<00:03:40.959> a<00:03:40.989> host

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
saved but like it was like a host

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.780 
saved but like it was like a host
migration<00:03:41.380> every<00:03:42.220> time<00:03:42.340> there's<00:03:42.489> hope<00:03:42.670> my

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
migration every time there's hope my

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.640 
migration every time there's hope my
host<00:03:43.030> migration<00:03:43.209> it<00:03:43.540> splits<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.019> video<00:03:44.350> up<00:03:44.500> in

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
host migration it splits the video up in

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.920 
host migration it splits the video up in
theater<00:03:44.950> I<00:03:45.130> think<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:45.850> clouds<00:03:46.120> kid<00:03:46.450> was<00:03:46.600> host

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
theater I think the clouds kid was host

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.640 
theater I think the clouds kid was host
at<00:03:47.230> that<00:03:47.410> point<00:03:47.680> he<00:03:47.890> left<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:48.930> yeah<00:03:49.930> that<00:03:50.380> I

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
at that point he left and yeah that I

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.780 
at that point he left and yeah that I
don't<00:03:50.920> know<00:03:51.010> that<00:03:51.040> this<00:03:51.280> was<00:03:51.430> like<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:51.640> most

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
don't know that this was like the most

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.550 
don't know that this was like the most
reasonable<00:03:52.180> thing<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.420> me<00:03:52.540> but<00:03:52.690> anyways<00:03:52.989> not

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
reasonable thing to me but anyways not

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.810 
reasonable thing to me but anyways not
really<00:03:53.739> big<00:03:53.890> deal<00:03:54.040> there<00:03:54.160> getting<00:03:54.370> smacked<00:03:54.610> up

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
really big deal there getting smacked up

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.310 
really big deal there getting smacked up
anyways<00:03:55.209> I<00:03:55.540> don't<00:03:55.660> think<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.959> last<00:03:56.049> three

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
anyways I don't think the last three

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.560 
anyways I don't think the last three
minutes<00:03:56.470> is<00:03:56.799> that<00:03:57.519> important<00:03:57.970> but<00:03:58.180> yeah<00:03:58.330> other

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
minutes is that important but yeah other

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.570 
minutes is that important but yeah other
than<00:03:58.780> that<00:03:58.989> that<00:03:59.620> is<00:03:59.650> now<00:03:59.980> that<00:04:00.220> is<00:04:00.370> pretty

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
than that that is now that is pretty

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.340 
than that that is now that is pretty
much<00:04:00.670> it<00:04:00.910> as<00:04:01.420> far<00:04:01.480> as<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:01.900> gameplay<00:04:02.080> is

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
much it as far as the gameplay is

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.039 
much it as far as the gameplay is
concerned<00:04:02.769> I<00:04:02.830> think<00:04:02.860> I<00:04:03.070> covered<00:04:03.310> everything

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
concerned I think I covered everything
