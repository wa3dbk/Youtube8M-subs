00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.640
 169 kg dry for 148 horses are 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.350
 values â€‹â€‹that until a few years ago 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.540
 would have been those typical of a 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.490
 supersport top of the range while they are 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.599
 those that today identify the new 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.160
 ducati 899 panigale the new super media 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:34.220
 of panigal village that we are trying 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.810
 for you today the ducati 899 is immoral 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.940
 panigale arrives on the market with 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.470
 the ambition to please both those who arrive 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.690
 from a six hundred and wants a bike more 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.700
 powerful is he who descends from a thousand e 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.530
 look for something performance but less 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.870
 challenging to manage kinship with 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.280
 the 11 99 panigale is quite narrow 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.050
 since the monocoque frame and the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.080
 itself is also a good part of the engine 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.760
 descends from superquadro 1200 la 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.290
 cycling is less refined due to the 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.630
 traditional swingarm that replaces 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.579
 the single arm of 11 99 and for 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.159
 the use of less expensive suspensions 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.720
 the engine derives from superquadro 1200 e 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.520
 shares with his older brother la 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.500
 most of the components and also the 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.689
 basic philosophy then pistons with 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.810
 very large and 100 mm bore e 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.759
 stroke reduced to 57.2 mm to reach 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.240
 high rpm with ease the power 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.189
 maximum is 148 horses and 10750 laps 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.299
 with a maximum torque exceeding 10 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.299
 kg three at 9,000 rpm 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:31.619
 899 electronic equipment 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.829
 panigale is the same as 11 99 then 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.049
 we find 3 settable riding mode abs 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.539
 on three positions ducati quick shift 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.229
 electronic gearbox and also the engine 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.229
 brake system 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.220
 on the track the Ducati 899 panigale 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.650
 reproposes the same strong sensations 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.870
 of 11 99 with entry into the curve 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.300
 fast and travel speed from 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.250
 primacy in the agility of changing folds e 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.560
 always the reference is the greatest weight 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.060
 compared to eleven 99 it is compensated 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.740
 well from the rear tire more 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.830
 narrow and more front brakes 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.660
 small the engine is docile but decided in 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.490
 track you can exploit up to 100 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.080
 percent thanks to the excellent long and 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.150
 apt report 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.400
 the brakes are easy and safe the attack is 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.440
 less effective than 12 and this 99 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.510
 will appeal to less savvy riders than 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.220
 however they can rely on a 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.790
 abs with very little surgery 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.790
 invasive 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.709
 points made and 899 panigale is a super 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.450
 average, therefore, the stronger the stronger 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.550
 refined of a six hundred but it is also 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.840
 less demanding than a maxi is one 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.090
 choice certainly very interesting 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.800
 for those who want to go to the track often and 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.720
 look for a performance bike e 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.030
 fun ducats to the proposed price 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.030
 of 15 thousand 918 euros turnkey
