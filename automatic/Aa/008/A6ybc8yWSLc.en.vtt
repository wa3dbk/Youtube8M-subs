00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
it's a complex balancing act to get the

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.569 
it's a complex balancing act to get the
most<00:01:53.630> from<00:01:53.869> each<00:01:54.079> rider<00:01:54.409> and<00:01:54.649> keep<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.340> team

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
and this will often be used as a tactic

to protect the majority of the team and

keep the pace high the more riders that

keep the pace high the more riders that

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
can stay together the more the work of

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.170 
can stay together the more the work of
pushing<00:02:52.220> through<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.489> air<00:02:52.609> can<00:02:52.819> be<00:02:52.850> shared

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
pushing through the air can be shared

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.720 
pushing through the air can be shared
and<00:02:53.420> in<00:02:53.630> theory<00:02:54.049> the<00:02:54.680> faster<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.370> group<00:02:55.579> will

travel the second reason to keep riders
together<00:03:00.109> is<00:03:00.319> that<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.859> finishing<00:03:01.100> time<00:03:01.519> for

together is that the finishing time for
