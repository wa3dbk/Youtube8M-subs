ability<00:01:14.400> can<00:01:14.729> be<00:01:14.760> parried<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:15.869> also

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
ability can be parried and it can also

the route as well as the increase in

periodontitis<00:01:25.049> lee<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> higher<00:01:26.009> chance<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.729> if

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
periodontitis lee a higher chance but if

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.810 
periodontitis lee a higher chance but if
you're<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> pet<00:01:27.869> class<00:01:28.140> you'll<00:01:29.070> avoid<00:01:29.310> most<00:01:29.610> of

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
you're a pet class you'll avoid most of

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.310 
you're a pet class you'll avoid most of
the<00:01:29.939> damage<00:01:30.119> but<00:01:32.630> forecasters<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:34.020> might<00:01:34.170> be

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
the damage but forecasters this might be

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.510 
the damage but forecasters this might be
a<00:01:34.350> little<00:01:34.470> tricky<00:01:34.710> because<00:01:34.890> he<00:01:35.189> does<00:01:35.340> hit

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
a little tricky because he does hit

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.440 
a little tricky because he does hit
pretty<00:01:35.670> hard<00:01:35.790> now<00:01:36.689> he<00:01:36.750> does<00:01:37.530> not<00:01:37.939> or<00:01:38.939> what<00:01:39.299> I'm

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
pretty hard now he does not or what I'm

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.910 
pretty hard now he does not or what I'm
thinking<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:39.960> rares<00:01:40.229> now<00:01:40.500> because<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.860> is

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
thinking with rares now because this is

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.179 
thinking with rares now because this is
the<00:01:41.100> second<00:01:41.430> rare<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:42.060> not<00:01:42.750> drop<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.259> they

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the second rare to not drop it is they

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.149 
the second rare to not drop it is they
will<00:01:44.420> sometimes<00:01:45.420> drop<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.079> Shawn's<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.799> ritual

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
will sometimes drop the Shawn's a ritual

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.240 
will sometimes drop the Shawn's a ritual
stones<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.759> then<00:01:48.390> most<00:01:48.930> all<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.890> time<00:01:50.070> they

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
stones and then most all the time they

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.090 
stones and then most all the time they
will<00:01:50.340> drop<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.670> 15<00:01:51.030> valid<00:01:51.329> points<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:52.100> mobs

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
will drop the 15 valid points so mobs

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.069 
will drop the 15 valid points so mobs
can<00:01:53.310> be<00:01:53.460> formed<00:01:53.909> for<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.210> valor<00:01:54.479> points<00:01:54.720> but

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
can be formed for the valor points but

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.370 
can be formed for the valor points but
the<00:01:55.200> Shawn's<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.770> ritual<00:01:56.159> stones<00:01:56.430> will<00:01:57.119> be
