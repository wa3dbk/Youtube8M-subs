lengths<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.170> shorter<00:01:43.500> lengths<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:43.920> they<00:01:44.100> do

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
lengths and shorter lengths and they do

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.460 
lengths and shorter lengths and they do
work<00:01:44.670> really<00:01:44.939> well<00:01:45.180> as<00:01:45.450> quite<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.960> short<00:01:46.259> board

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
work really well as quite a short board

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.440 
work really well as quite a short board
they<00:01:46.710> are<00:01:46.979> truly<00:01:47.610> gone<00:01:47.790> for<00:01:48.090> four<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.390> six

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
they are truly gone for four to six

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.420 
they are truly gone for four to six
inches<00:01:48.930> shorter<00:01:49.320> than<00:01:49.619> your<00:01:49.799> typical<00:01:49.920> short

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
inches shorter than your typical short

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.880 
inches shorter than your typical short
board<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.090> what<00:01:51.570> makes<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:52.020> such<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> fun

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
board so what makes this such a fun

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.179 
board so what makes this such a fun
board<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:54.119> direct<00:01:54.869> thing<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.740> makes

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
board like the direct thing that makes

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.920 
board like the direct thing that makes
it<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.579> enjoyable<00:01:57.000> with<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.420> features<00:01:57.780> that

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
it so enjoyable with the features that

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.480 
it so enjoyable with the features that
we're<00:01:58.049> going<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> look<00:01:58.469> at<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.460> a

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
we're going to have a look at it is a

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.100 
we're going to have a look at it is a
speed<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.149> you're<00:02:00.270> generating<00:02:00.659> when<00:02:00.990> you've

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
speed that you're generating when you've

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.410 
speed that you're generating when you've
got<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.560> much<00:02:01.740> speed<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.250> smaller<00:02:02.850> conditions

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
got so much speed in smaller conditions

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.090 
got so much speed in smaller conditions
where<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.780> usually<00:02:03.930> expect<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.680> be<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> dull

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
where you usually expect it to be a dull

that you're finding and 7-foot mini melt
but<00:02:41.070> being<00:02:41.340> able<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:41.550> write<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:41.910> quite<00:02:42.180> short

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
but being able to write it quite short

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.750 
but being able to write it quite short
and<00:02:42.840> have<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.440> ton<00:02:43.740> of<00:02:43.770> fun<00:02:44.040> in<00:02:44.310> those<00:02:44.460> smaller

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
and have a ton of fun in those smaller

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.330 
and have a ton of fun in those smaller
days<00:02:45.260> one<00:02:46.260> of<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.440> other<00:02:46.590> features<00:02:47.040> that

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
days one of the other features that

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.250 
days one of the other features that
makes<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.820> a<00:02:47.880> great<00:02:48.030> board<00:02:48.420> is<00:02:48.720> you've<00:02:49.020> got<00:02:49.230> a

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
makes it a great board is you've got a

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.440 
makes it a great board is you've got a
lot<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.620> volume<00:02:50.040> at<00:02:50.190> both<00:02:50.430> ends<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.240> board

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
lot of volume at both ends of the board

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.690 
lot of volume at both ends of the board
so<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.170> first<00:02:52.440> thing<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.740> point<00:02:52.950> out<00:02:53.160> is<00:02:53.400> how

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
so the first thing I point out is how

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.240 
so the first thing I point out is how
thick<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.450> tail<00:02:55.080> is<00:02:55.320> right<00:02:55.680> through<00:02:55.890> here

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
thick that tail is right through here

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.030 
thick that tail is right through here
you've<00:02:56.910> got<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.180> double<00:02:57.390> flyer<00:02:57.840> 2<00:02:58.200> round<00:02:58.680> tail

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
you've got a double flyer 2 round tail

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.890 
you've got a double flyer 2 round tail
bringing<00:02:59.790> it<00:02:59.880> in<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.060> little<00:03:00.330> bit<00:03:00.480> but<00:03:00.750> it's

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
bringing it in a little bit but it's

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.020 
bringing it in a little bit but it's
quite<00:03:01.110> chunky<00:03:01.410> it's<00:03:02.100> got<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.370> lot<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.610> volume

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
quite chunky it's got a lot of volume

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.090 
quite chunky it's got a lot of volume
and<00:03:03.240> this<00:03:03.480> is<00:03:03.630> adding<00:03:04.020> once<00:03:04.200> again<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.680> extra

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
and this is adding once again to extra

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.280 
and this is adding once again to extra
speed<00:03:05.460> remember<00:03:06.330> when<00:03:06.570> you<00:03:06.690> got<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.990> smaller

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
speed remember when you got the smaller

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.020 
speed remember when you got the smaller
conditions<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.310> number<00:03:08.460> one<00:03:08.700> thing<00:03:08.910> you're

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
conditions the number one thing you're

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.030 
conditions the number one thing you're
lacking<00:03:09.180> in<00:03:09.570> speed<00:03:09.870> so<00:03:10.260> when<00:03:10.470> you've<00:03:10.590> got<00:03:10.620> all

lacking in speed so when you've got all

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.730 
lacking in speed so when you've got all
the<00:03:11.430> features<00:03:11.640> marrying<00:03:12.390> up<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:13.260> give<00:03:13.530> your

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
up something like this now particularly

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.050 
up something like this now particularly
one<00:03:43.020> of<00:03:43.050> the<00:03:43.170> things<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:43.890> really<00:03:44.850> like

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
one of the things that I really like

one of the things that I really like
about<00:03:45.090> this<00:03:45.540> board<00:03:45.780> I<00:03:46.170> think<00:03:46.830> it's<00:03:46.950> important

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
about this board I think it's important

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.210 
about this board I think it's important
when<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.150> try<00:03:48.360> to<00:03:48.390> choose<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:49.230> summer<00:03:49.650> board<00:03:49.980> is

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
when you try to choose a summer board is

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.040 
when you try to choose a summer board is
the<00:03:50.790> outline<00:03:51.150> I'm<00:03:51.390> talking<00:03:51.750> about<00:03:51.930> the

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
the outline I'm talking about the

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.620 
the outline I'm talking about the
silhouette<00:03:52.590> of<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.770> board<00:03:53.040> if<00:03:53.280> you<00:03:54.000> have<00:03:54.330> a

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
silhouette of the board if you have a

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.210 
silhouette of the board if you have a
little<00:03:54.959> look<00:03:55.140> through<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.440> camera<00:03:55.740> that<00:03:55.920> you

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
little look through the camera that you

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.280 
little look through the camera that you
can<00:03:56.250> see<00:03:56.700> that<00:03:57.270> it's<00:03:57.450> actually<00:03:57.600> got<00:03:57.959> quite<00:03:58.170> a

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
can see that it's actually got quite a

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.680 
can see that it's actually got quite a
straight<00:03:58.680> outline<00:03:59.220> so<00:03:59.880> we<00:04:00.390> have<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.510> lot<00:04:00.660> of

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
straight outline so we have a lot of

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.300 
straight outline so we have a lot of
boards<00:04:01.020> out<00:04:01.170> there<00:04:01.200> there<00:04:01.560> trying<00:04:01.830> to<00:04:01.920> kind<00:04:02.220> of

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
boards out there there trying to kind of

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.360 
boards out there there trying to kind of
create<00:04:02.610> a<00:04:02.640> hybrid<00:04:03.500> short<00:04:04.500> board<00:04:04.770> versus

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
create a hybrid short board versus

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.750 
create a hybrid short board versus
summer<00:04:05.640> board<00:04:05.940> mix<00:04:06.690> up<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.170> it<00:04:08.160> becomes<00:04:08.550> two

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
summer board mix up and it becomes two

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.090 
summer board mix up and it becomes two
Kirby<00:04:09.240> so<00:04:09.540> when<00:04:09.690> you<00:04:09.780> go<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:09.930> bulbus<00:04:10.500> board<00:04:10.830> if

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
Kirby so when you go to bulbus board if

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.699 
Kirby so when you go to bulbus board if
you<00:04:11.580> imagine<00:04:11.850> as<00:04:12.480> an<00:04:12.900> analogy<00:04:13.320> that<00:04:13.590> you're

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
you imagine as an analogy that you're

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.150 
you imagine as an analogy that you're
pushing<00:04:13.920> a<00:04:14.280> ball<00:04:15.060> like<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:15.540> blood<00:04:16.140> ball<00:04:16.440> through

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
the water it's pushing a lot of water

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.360 
the water it's pushing a lot of water
and<00:04:19.109> it's<00:04:19.200> kind<00:04:19.410> of<00:04:19.470> resisting<00:04:19.950> against<00:04:20.280> the

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
and it's kind of resisting against the

and it's kind of resisting against the
water<00:04:20.549> where<00:04:21.150> if<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.390> push<00:04:21.690> through<00:04:21.900> a<00:04:21.989> spear

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
water where if you push through a spear

double<00:05:02.050> flyer<00:05:02.470> to<00:05:02.800> round<00:05:03.070> out<00:05:03.370> and<00:05:03.610> why

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
double flyer to round out and why

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.360 
double flyer to round out and why
they're<00:05:04.419> doing<00:05:04.600> that<00:05:04.750> is<00:05:05.169> so<00:05:05.410> they<00:05:05.889> can<00:05:06.040> keep<00:05:06.220> a

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
they're doing that is so they can keep a

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.100 
they're doing that is so they can keep a
straight<00:05:06.639> outline<00:05:07.030> in<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:07.270> board<00:05:07.510> like<00:05:07.960> I've

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
straight outline in the board like I've

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.110 
straight outline in the board like I've
