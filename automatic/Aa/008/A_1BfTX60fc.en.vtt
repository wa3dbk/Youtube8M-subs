pressing<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.660> set<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.080> be<00:00:16.289> so<00:00:16.590> we<00:00:16.710> actually<00:00:16.859> go

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
pressing a set of be so we actually go

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.900 
pressing a set of be so we actually go
forward<00:00:17.960> so<00:00:18.960> most<00:00:19.260> people<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.859> are<00:00:20.070> guessing

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
but goes too slow i can actually avoid a

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.480 
but goes too slow i can actually avoid a
roadblock<00:02:55.240> for<00:02:55.360> once<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:55.930> guess<00:02:56.200> well<00:02:56.830> let's<00:02:57.370> do

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
roadblock for once I guess well let's do

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.030 
roadblock for once I guess well let's do
it<00:02:57.610> again<00:02:57.730> ah<00:02:58.060> ah<00:02:58.240> ah<00:02:58.660> that's<00:02:59.140> just<00:02:59.230> cheap<00:02:59.770> man

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040
