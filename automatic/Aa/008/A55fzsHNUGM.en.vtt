you'll see a flight I also need to get a
good<00:00:30.449> sized<00:00:30.720> battery<00:00:31.230> for<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:32.390> but<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.630> lot<00:00:34.020> of

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
good sized battery for it but a lot of

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.590 
good sized battery for it but a lot of
people<00:00:34.290> are<00:00:34.500> asking<00:00:34.890> me<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.219> size

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
people are asking me the size

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.119 
people are asking me the size
comparisons<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.989> some<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.469> differences

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
comparisons and some of the differences

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.119 
comparisons and some of the differences
and<00:00:38.190> then<00:00:38.610> different<00:00:39.180> things<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.890> can't<00:00:40.890> really

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
and then different things I can't really

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.889 
and then different things I can't really
discuss<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.790> lot<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> things<00:00:42.540> at<00:00:42.719> this

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
discuss a lot of the things at this

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.330 
discuss a lot of the things at this
point<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.440> don't<00:00:43.500> know<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:44.070> there<00:00:44.250> are

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
point I don't know that there are

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.400 
point I don't know that there are
abilities<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.239> kind<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.600> stuff<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.110> this

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
abilities and that kind of stuff of this

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.639 
abilities and that kind of stuff of this
one<00:00:46.649> yet<00:00:47.270> but<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.629> can<00:00:48.960> definitely<00:00:49.079> show<00:00:49.590> you

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
one yet but I can definitely show you

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.750 
one yet but I can definitely show you
guys<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.660> comparison<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:52.440> size<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
guys a comparison in size and the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.959 
guys a comparison in size and the
difference<00:00:54.180> between<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:56.280> give<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
difference between that and give you a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.229 
difference between that and give you a
couple<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.510> numbers<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.320> stuff<00:00:58.969> so<00:00:59.969> let's

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
couple of numbers and stuff so let's

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.819 
couple of numbers and stuff so let's
start<00:01:00.600> off<00:01:00.690> with<00:01:00.960> some<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.379> numbers<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
start off with some of the numbers and

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.369 
start off with some of the numbers and
the<00:01:02.250> size<00:01:02.489> differences<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.600> then<00:01:03.780> we'll<00:01:03.989> take

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the size differences and then we'll take

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.380 
the size differences and then we'll take
the<00:01:04.559> camera<00:01:04.920> off<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.100> pod<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.760> take<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> closer

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the camera off the pod and take a closer

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.289 
the camera off the pod and take a closer
look<00:01:06.750> at<00:01:06.900> them<00:01:07.020> side-by-side<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:10.020> TRX

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
look at them side-by-side the TRX

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.679 
look at them side-by-side the TRX
okay<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.600> 500<00:01:13.170> teawrex<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.860> main<00:01:14.040> blades<00:01:14.369> are

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
okay the 500 teawrex the main blades are

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.660 
okay the 500 teawrex the main blades are
17<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:16.080> quarter<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.710> length<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:18.750> saab

three in size difference they're a

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.050 
three in size difference they're a

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
little bit longer which is going to give

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.450 
little bit longer which is going to give

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
you a little bit more balance to flying

about<00:02:18.379> four<00:02:19.379> inches<00:02:19.829> there<00:02:20.099> you<00:02:20.549> know<00:02:20.670> mostly

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
about four inches there you know mostly

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.009 
about four inches there you know mostly

size they're calling whether they're six

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.319 
size they're calling whether they're six
hundredths<00:02:30.719> or<00:02:30.810> seven<00:02:31.260> 70s<00:02:32.159> or<00:02:32.370> six<00:02:32.639> 30s<00:02:33.120> or

five hundredths

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.750 
five hundredths
they're<00:02:36.870> definitely<00:02:37.500> bigger<00:02:37.769> this<00:02:38.099> is<00:02:38.159> the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
they're definitely bigger this is the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:46.490 
they're definitely bigger this is the
size<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:40.950> t-rex<00:02:42.260> 550<00:02:43.260> e<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:45.780> it's<00:02:46.200> between

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
size of a t-rex 550 e so it's between

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.420 
size of a t-rex 550 e so it's between
like<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:46.980> 550<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.909> 600<00:02:48.480> size<00:02:49.099> when<00:02:50.099> I<00:02:50.129> take

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
like a 550 and a 600 size when I take

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.920 
like a 550 and a 600 size when I take
the<00:02:50.579> camera<00:02:50.790> off<00:02:50.939> the<00:02:51.090> pod<00:02:51.449> you'll<00:02:51.750> see

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
the camera off the pod you'll see

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.909 
the camera off the pod you'll see
there's<00:02:52.139> a<00:02:52.199> big<00:02:52.439> difference<00:02:53.329> the<00:02:54.379> Saab<00:02:55.379> stands

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
there's a big difference the Saab stands

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:00.860 
there's a big difference the Saab stands
taller<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:57.750> head<00:02:58.349> is<00:02:58.530> up<00:02:58.709> higher<00:02:59.419> the<00:03:00.419> tail<00:03:00.659> is

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
taller the head is up higher the tail is

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.929 
taller the head is up higher the tail is
longer<00:03:01.139> and<00:03:01.409> so<00:03:02.189> forth

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939

somebody was also asking me a question I

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.800 
somebody was also asking me a question I
can't<00:03:08.280> answer<00:03:08.459> if<00:03:08.909> they<00:03:09.090> were<00:03:09.150> gonna<00:03:09.389> put<00:03:09.689> out

can't answer if they were gonna put out

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.819 
can't answer if they were gonna put out
a<00:03:09.919> 450<00:03:10.919> model<00:03:11.370> size<00:03:11.689> I<00:03:12.689> don't<00:03:13.319> know<00:03:13.500> if<00:03:13.650> they

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
a 450 model size I don't know if they

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.069 
a 450 model size I don't know if they
will<00:03:14.099> I<00:03:14.400> would<00:03:14.819> assume<00:03:15.120> probably<00:03:15.419> down<00:03:15.870> the

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
will I would assume probably down the

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.749 
will I would assume probably down the
road<00:03:16.259> you'll<00:03:16.500> probably<00:03:16.769> see<00:03:17.250> one<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.900> 450<00:03:19.759> 400

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:20.759 
road you'll probably see one the 450 400

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:23.869 
road you'll probably see one the 450 400
always<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.180> very<00:03:21.479> popular<00:03:22.079> size<00:03:22.949> anything
