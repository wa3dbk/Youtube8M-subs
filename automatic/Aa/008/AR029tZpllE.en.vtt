00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.160 
size around the land uses a lot of fuel
in<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.920> fuel<00:01:47.159> economy<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.640> absolute<00:01:48.360> rubbish

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
in the fuel economy is absolute rubbish

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.260 
in the fuel economy is absolute rubbish
of<00:01:49.860> course<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.579> kind<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.909> make<00:01:51.090> some

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
of course you can kind of make some

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.660 
of course you can kind of make some
changes<00:01:51.659> with<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.020> with<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> tune<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.799> put<00:01:53.549> on

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
changes with that with a tune I put on

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.490 
changes with that with a tune I put on
the<00:01:53.790> easy<00:01:54.000> flash<00:01:54.360> turn<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:54.899> not<00:01:55.079> only<00:01:55.290> gives

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
the easy flash turn this not only gives

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.649 
the easy flash turn this not only gives
you<00:01:55.590> some<00:01:55.799> more<00:01:55.950> power<00:01:56.189> but<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.119> also<00:01:57.270> makes

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
you some more power but it also makes

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.569 
you some more power but it also makes
the<00:01:57.810> fuel<00:01:58.049> economy<00:01:58.290> are<00:01:58.799> better<00:01:59.340> by

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
the fuel economy are better by

frightening<00:02:02.969> things<00:02:03.240> about<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.630> car<00:02:03.869> is

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
frightening things about this car is

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.340 
frightening things about this car is
that<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:05.040> accelerator<00:02:05.780> doesn't<00:02:06.780> seem<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.229> be

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
that the accelerator doesn't seem to be

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.219 
that the accelerator doesn't seem to be
connected<00:02:07.860> at<00:02:07.979> all<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.030> engine<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.810> feels

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
connected at all to the engine it feels

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.550 
connected at all to the engine it feels
like<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.739> accelerator<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.870> connected<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:12.989> an

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
like the accelerator is connected to an

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.650 
like the accelerator is connected to an
old<00:02:13.680> Morse<00:02:13.950> code<00:02:14.310> unit<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.940> when<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:15.480> put

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
old Morse code unit and when you put

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.240 
old Morse code unit and when you put
your<00:02:15.780> foot<00:02:15.930> down<00:02:15.989> someone<00:02:16.830> starts<00:02:17.069> going

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
your foot down someone starts going

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.250 
your foot down someone starts going
mmmm-mmm<00:02:17.910> baby<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.330> someone<00:02:18.690> else<00:02:18.930> says<00:02:19.110> to

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
mmmm-mmm baby and someone else says to

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.839 
mmmm-mmm baby and someone else says to
the<00:02:19.349> engine<00:02:19.650> are<00:02:19.860> you'd<00:02:20.099> better<00:02:20.310> accelerate

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
the engine are you'd better accelerate

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.820 
the engine are you'd better accelerate
now<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:21.270> is<00:02:21.540> actually<00:02:22.020> frightening<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.620> very

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
now it is actually frightening the very

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.140 
now it is actually frightening the very
first<00:02:23.099> time<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.340> realized<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.000> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
first time I realized that the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.210 
first time I realized that the
accelerator<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:25.050> not<00:02:25.349> actually<00:02:25.709> connected<00:02:26.130> to

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
accelerator is not actually connected to

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.949 
accelerator is not actually connected to
the<00:02:26.340> car<00:02:26.550> was<00:02:27.030> when<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.239> was<00:02:27.360> accelerating

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
the car was when I was accelerating

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.080 
the car was when I was accelerating
towards<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.349> corner<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.860> then<00:02:29.310> once<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.760> got<00:02:29.910> to

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
towards a corner and then once I got to

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.759 
towards a corner and then once I got to
kind<00:02:30.300> of<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.480> tightest<00:02:31.050> bit<00:02:31.200> of<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.349> corner<00:02:31.620> I

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
kind of the tightest bit of the corner I

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.920 
kind of the tightest bit of the corner I
took<00:02:32.130> my<00:02:32.280> foot<00:02:32.430> off<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.700> accelerator<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:33.690> car

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
took my foot off the accelerator the car

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.050 
took my foot off the accelerator the car
keeps<00:02:34.230> accelerating<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:35.430> can<00:02:35.610> take<00:02:35.880> your

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
keeps accelerating you can take your

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.660 
keeps accelerating you can take your
foot<00:02:36.269> completely<00:02:36.540> off<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.590> accelerator<00:02:37.890> the

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
foot completely off the accelerator the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.270 
foot completely off the accelerator the
car<00:02:38.910> will<00:02:39.239> keep<00:02:39.599> accelerating<00:02:40.050> for<00:02:41.010> another

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
car will keep accelerating for another

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.180 
car will keep accelerating for another
second<00:02:41.819> it<00:02:41.910> is<00:02:42.390> absolutely<00:02:43.290> frightening<00:02:43.590> get

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
second it is absolutely frightening get

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.910 
second it is absolutely frightening get
to<00:02:44.340> 4,000<00:02:44.940> rpm<00:02:45.300> as<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.690> needle<00:02:45.989> hits<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.260> 4000

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
to 4,000 rpm as the needle hits the 4000

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.250 
to 4,000 rpm as the needle hits the 4000
pull<00:02:47.459> your<00:02:47.640> foot<00:02:47.880> right<00:02:48.660> off<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.019> accelerator

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
pull your foot right off the accelerator

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.430 
pull your foot right off the accelerator
and<00:02:49.650> you'll<00:02:50.130> see<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.700> keeps<00:02:51.239> climbing<00:02:51.510> it's

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
and you'll see it keeps climbing it's

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.340 
and you'll see it keeps climbing it's
ridiculous<00:02:53.160> all<00:02:53.459> right<00:02:54.180> let's<00:02:54.450> move<00:02:54.690> inside

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
ridiculous all right let's move inside

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.140 
ridiculous all right let's move inside
the<00:02:55.560> car<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:56.010> let's<00:02:56.519> have<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.700> little<00:02:56.850> chat

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
the car and let's have a little chat

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.870 
the car and let's have a little chat
about<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.510> GPS<00:02:57.989> now<00:02:58.410> GPS<00:02:58.920> is<00:02:59.069> pretty<00:02:59.310> handy<00:02:59.549> it

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
about the GPS now GPS is pretty handy it

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.570 
about the GPS now GPS is pretty handy it
saves<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.540> lot<00:03:00.569> of<00:03:00.750> relationships<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.980> GPS<00:03:02.430> in

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
saves a lot of relationships the GPS in

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.729 
saves a lot of relationships the GPS in
this<00:03:02.700> car<00:03:02.940> absolutely<00:03:03.440> sucks

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
this car absolutely sucks

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.160 
this car absolutely sucks
you<00:03:05.250> can<00:03:05.430> put<00:03:05.610> your<00:03:05.760> address<00:03:05.970> in<00:03:06.090> but<00:03:06.900> then<00:03:07.049> if

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
you can put your address in but then if

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.440 
you can put your address in but then if
you<00:03:07.290> want<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.560> cancel<00:03:07.830> that<00:03:08.040> guidance<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:09.209> is

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
you want to cancel that guidance it is

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.960 
you want to cancel that guidance it is
actually<00:03:09.870> easier<00:03:10.319> to<00:03:10.530> find<00:03:10.769> your<00:03:10.920> way<00:03:11.160> into

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
actually easier to find your way into

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.640 
actually easier to find your way into
the<00:03:12.060> depths<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.630> catacombs<00:03:13.140> of<00:03:13.349> the<00:03:13.440> Great

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
the depths of the catacombs of the Great

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.589 
the depths of the catacombs of the Great
Pyramid<00:03:13.920> then<00:03:14.580> actually<00:03:15.000> guide<00:03:15.239> your<00:03:15.510> way

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
Pyramid then actually guide your way

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.630 
Pyramid then actually guide your way
through<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.080> menu<00:03:16.200> system<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:17.130> cancel<00:03:17.549> the

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
through the menu system to cancel the

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.580 
through the menu system to cancel the
guidance<00:03:18.030> now<00:03:18.450> like<00:03:18.750> most<00:03:19.019> cars<00:03:19.290> these<00:03:19.530> days

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
guidance now like most cars these days

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.030 
guidance now like most cars these days
the<00:03:20.310> GPS<00:03:20.910> is<00:03:21.180> connected<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.079> handbrake<00:03:22.530> so

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
the GPS is connected to the handbrake so

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.470 
the GPS is connected to the handbrake so
you<00:03:23.100> cannot<00:03:23.549> use<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:23.820> while<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.239> car<00:03:24.450> is

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
you cannot use it while the car is

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.900 
you cannot use it while the car is
moving<00:03:24.660> now<00:03:25.470> this<00:03:25.709> probably<00:03:26.100> made<00:03:26.370> sense<00:03:26.730> to

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
moving now this probably made sense to

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.940 
moving now this probably made sense to
some<00:03:27.120> safety<00:03:27.420> experts<00:03:27.959> somewhere<00:03:28.320> but<00:03:28.799> it's

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
some safety experts somewhere but it's

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.280 
some safety experts somewhere but it's
actually<00:03:29.459> uh<00:03:29.670> turley<00:03:30.000> crap<00:03:30.359> if<00:03:30.569> somebody's

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
actually uh turley crap if somebody's
