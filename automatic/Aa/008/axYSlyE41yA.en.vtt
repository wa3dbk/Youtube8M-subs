00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hello, welcome to another one. 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.109
 video tutorial here on my channel I am 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.450
 Jaime Trinity and today he would be giving 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.330
 some tips on how to paint a good 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.980
 portrait very recently 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.680
 I took a picture of a family to 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.350
 paint and I took a tutorial 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.060
 about skin colors and would be showing 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.490
 for you now 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.070
 good first of all it is important that 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.050
 Can you get a good photo? 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.480
 setting so you can see 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.059
 all the details but it is important 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.670
 highlight that the photo has to come out clear 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.680
 and with the original colors can not be 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.149
 neither too light and too dark like 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.370
 happened here in my case 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.320
 I only have two revelations one 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.230
 completely different from the other 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.360
 the clearest hides some details that 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.289
 the face has good to facilitate the life of 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.570
 you 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:01.949
 we will take as a basis the agreement that 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:03.600
 ready come yellow naples meat is 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.210
 plus the big problem of using it pure 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.950
 it will never arrive in the real color that the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.720
 People have here in the photo. 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.510
 So who's going to make us go? 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.979
 mixing some colors in her to people 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.610
 reach the key that the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.610
 people want 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.430
 good the first thing that will make the color 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.470
 dark base 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.619
 for that we will add earth said 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.530
 natural and a little bit of violet to 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:43.270
 give a darkened color 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.270
 see how she looked like 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.500
 good now to get that rush 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.750
 left eye corner 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.359
 Let's add some white to 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.679
 a little more violet 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:02.359
 Look how the one you need does not need 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.259
 nor to say that after being under a 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:05.030
 glass right 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.719
 It's nice to listen to you do the 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.719
 color tests 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.650
 to stop the lighter and 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.880
 cold that lies below the eye is the 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.750
 present a little whiter one 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.710
 Just a little dick pomegranate and we tested 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.710
 the color in the photo 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.360
 now so that the lightness and clarity 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.520
 the right side of the photo 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.950
 I add in yellow in the politicagem 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.370
 a little bit of ocher yellow and orange 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:55.050
 meat and brightening with white more 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.050
 once you do the test in the picture 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.830
 now adds in the path in the latter 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.750
 mix that we make, we can even 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.770
 the most rosy hue you have in 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:16.840
 cheek 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:20.110
 look only now with the yellow blend 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.990
 naples white meat in a little bit alone 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.000
 to blue we can get that 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.240
 light gray color that is below the 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.240
 neck 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.340
 let's set now woke up lip 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:39.580
 for that we will use for naples 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.400
 meat a little carmine just a little bit 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:46.930
 of violet and to give a burned earth 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:49.810
 said natural and see how it was now 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.209
 to set the color of the eye through 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.320
 several attempts to mix 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.190
 we managed to achieve a result 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:00.100
 here mixing them overseas a little bit 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:03.040
 earth of natural scene a little brown 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.650
 vandick a little white and people 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.959
 managed to reach the key of the eye 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.450
 good and here are some tips on how to 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.930
 show some color to paint a 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.930
 monster 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.479
 see how our palette stayed 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:25.419
 got 16 colors for one skin color 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:26.860
 for the lip and one for the eye well 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:31.900
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.419
 video lesson and there is the picture of 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.650
 finished family 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.380
