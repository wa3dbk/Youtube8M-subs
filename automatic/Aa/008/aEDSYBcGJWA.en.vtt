you're<00:00:18.630> gonna<00:00:18.750> shoot<00:00:19.020> raw<00:00:19.289> right<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:19.859> tell<00:00:20.039> me

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
you're gonna shoot raw right so tell me

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.650 
you're gonna shoot raw right so tell me
a<00:00:20.400> little<00:00:20.550> bit<00:00:20.699> about<00:00:20.880> why<00:00:21.180> you're<00:00:21.420> shooting

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
a little bit about why you're shooting

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.090 
a little bit about why you're shooting
raw<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.020> what<00:00:22.170> it'll<00:00:22.320> do<00:00:22.439> for<00:00:22.619> us<00:00:22.710> well<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
raw and what it'll do for us well the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.130 
raw and what it'll do for us well the
thing<00:00:23.220> about<00:00:23.250> raw<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.180> you're<00:00:24.510> bypassing

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
thing about raw is that you're bypassing

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.589 
thing about raw is that you're bypassing
any<00:00:25.650> sort<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.070> in-camera<00:00:26.550> processing<00:00:27.449> right

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
any sort of in-camera processing right

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.259 
any sort of in-camera processing right
so<00:00:28.140> instead<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.619> sort<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.010> baking<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.820> look<00:00:30.090> on

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
so instead of sort of baking the look on

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.150 
so instead of sort of baking the look on
set<00:00:30.630> into<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> image<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.590> can<00:00:31.890> make<00:00:32.040> those

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
set into the image you can make those

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.950 
set into the image you can make those
decisions<00:00:32.460> later<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.450> post-production

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
decisions later on in post-production

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.650 
decisions later on in post-production
and<00:00:34.550> while<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:35.820> really<00:00:36.149> cool<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.480> can

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
and while it's really cool that you can

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.209 
and while it's really cool that you can
do<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:36.930> be<00:00:37.200> aware<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.770> does<00:00:37.980> add

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
do that just be aware that it does add

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.119 
do that just be aware that it does add
things<00:00:38.960> complexities<00:00:39.960> if<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.200> will<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.920> your

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
shooting raw these other black magic

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.179 
shooting raw these other black magic
pocket<00:01:09.570> cameras<00:01:10.229> which<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.470> explored<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.100> an

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
pocket cameras which we explored on an

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.090 
pocket cameras which we explored on an
earlier<00:01:11.549> episode<00:01:11.700> are<00:01:12.180> shooting<00:01:12.990> prores<00:01:13.619> hke

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
earlier episode are shooting prores hke

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.100 
earlier episode are shooting prores hke
oh<00:01:14.490> all<00:01:14.970> right<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.780> that's<00:01:15.960> an

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
oh all right and and that's an

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.990 
oh all right and and that's an
uncompressed<00:01:16.619> raw<00:01:16.979> right<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.610> isn't<00:01:17.850> unka

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
uncompressed raw right that isn't unka

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.039 
uncompressed raw right that isn't unka
that's<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.210> big<00:01:18.360> actually<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.780> pretty<00:01:18.960> good

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
that's a big actually a pretty good

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.679 
that's a big actually a pretty good
point<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.470> make<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.880> cinema<00:01:21.420> camera

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
point to make that on the cinema camera

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.170 
point to make that on the cinema camera
it<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.930> an<00:01:22.080> uncompressed<00:01:22.650> raw<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
it is an uncompressed raw and on the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.149 
it is an uncompressed raw and on the
pocket<00:01:24.570> cinema<00:01:25.140> camera<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.619> compressed

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
pocket cinema camera it's a compressed

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.510 
pocket cinema camera it's a compressed
but<00:01:26.400> visually<00:01:26.939> lossless<00:01:27.659> raw<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:28.369> there's<00:01:29.369> some

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
but visually lossless raw a there's some

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.069 
but visually lossless raw a there's some
math<00:01:29.729> going<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.810> call<00:01:30.960> it

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
math going on so you have to call it

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.600 
math going on so you have to call it
compressed<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.740> mean<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.369> going<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.549> be

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
compressed I mean it's going to be

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.160 
compressed I mean it's going to be
interesting<00:01:32.790> when<00:01:33.090> we<00:01:33.210> get<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> evaluate<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
interesting when we get the evaluate the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.260 
interesting when we get the evaluate the
footage<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.500> see<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:35.070> know<00:01:35.189> when<00:01:35.729> raw<00:01:36.060> does

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
footage to see you know when raw does

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.730 
footage to see you know when raw does
come<00:01:36.450> out<00:01:36.509> for<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.689> pocket<00:01:37.020> camera<00:01:37.290> yeah<00:01:37.590> if

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740
