00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
can create a spoke spoke to wheel pretty

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.919 
can create a spoke spoke to wheel pretty
fast<00:00:12.650> alright<00:00:13.650> let's<00:00:14.070> get<00:00:14.190> started<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:14.929> we're

fast alright let's get started so we're

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.179 
fast alright let's get started so we're
gonna<00:00:16.049> start<00:00:16.680> by<00:00:16.770> creating<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.550> cylinder<00:00:18.210> and

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
gonna start by creating a cylinder and

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.599 
gonna start by creating a cylinder and
we're<00:00:20.189> gonna<00:00:21.050> make<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.580> nice<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.789> thin

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
we're gonna make that nice and thin

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.009 
we're gonna make that nice and thin
something<00:00:26.609> like<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.939> just<00:00:27.300> stretch<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.960> out

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
something like that just stretch it out

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.810 
something like that just stretch it out
a<00:00:28.080> bit<00:00:28.580> bit<00:00:29.580> more<00:00:31.189> ok<00:00:32.189> maybe<00:00:32.460> something<00:00:32.730> like

that
we're<00:00:34.020> gonna<00:00:34.110> hit<00:00:34.260> e<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.739> rotate<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:36.050> make<00:00:37.050> sure

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
we're gonna hit e to rotate it make sure

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.080 
we're gonna hit e to rotate it make sure
you<00:00:37.770> rotate<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.309> at<00:00:38.489> 90<00:00:39.030> degrees<00:00:40.309> so<00:00:41.309> we're

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
you rotate it at 90 degrees so we're

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.330 
you rotate it at 90 degrees so we're
going<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.540> our<00:00:43.079> editor<00:00:45.530> -<00:00:46.530> nandi<00:00:46.860> like<00:00:47.129> that

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
going to our editor - nandi like that

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.660 
going to our editor - nandi like that
and<00:00:47.969> now<00:00:48.780> we're<00:00:49.079> gonna<00:00:49.200> position<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.370> our

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
and now we're gonna position it on our

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:59.000 
and now we're gonna position it on our
grid<00:00:53.719> and<00:00:54.719> make<00:00:54.780> sure<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.039> on<00:00:57.770> the<00:00:58.770> grid

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
grid and make sure that it's on the grid

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.860 
grid and make sure that it's on the grid
exactly<00:00:59.940> like<00:01:00.359> that

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
exactly like that

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.719 
exactly like that
Oh<00:01:01.640> like<00:01:02.899> that<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.920> zoom<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.430> make

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
Oh like that just to zoom in to make

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.120 
Oh like that just to zoom in to make
sure<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:06.299> were<00:01:08.390> centered<00:01:09.680> like<00:01:10.680> that

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
sure that were centered like that

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.770 
sure that were centered like that
okay<00:01:11.820> those<00:01:12.299> fit<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:14.119> we<00:01:15.119> need<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.479> move<00:01:15.630> it

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
okay those fit and we need to move it

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.260 
okay those fit and we need to move it
out<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> little<00:01:16.140> bit<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.920> that's<00:01:17.400> not<00:01:17.880> aligned

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
out a little bit so that's not aligned

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.410 
out a little bit so that's not aligned
as<00:01:18.509> well<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.820> in<00:01:20.820> there<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> bit<00:01:23.119> okay<00:01:24.150> like

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420

that
so<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.930> spoke<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.320> pointing<00:01:28.710> towards<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
so the spoke is pointing towards the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.120 
so the spoke is pointing towards the
center<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> grid<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.979> now<00:01:31.979> we're

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
center of the grid like so now we're

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.289 
center of the grid like so now we're
gonna<00:01:32.220> do<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.610> we're<00:01:32.790> gonna<00:01:32.850> select<00:01:33.119> that

gonna do is we're gonna select that

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.520 
gonna do is we're gonna select that
spoke<00:01:33.689> we're<00:01:34.470> gonna<00:01:34.560> go<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.829> edit<00:01:36.530> duplicate

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.840 
parent that's fine we're gonna rotate
the<00:01:53.610> spokes<00:01:53.939> on<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.079> axis<00:01:55.470> here<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.920> we're

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
the spokes on this axis here and we're

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.959 
the spokes on this axis here and we're
gonna<00:01:56.939> rotate<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.540> by<00:01:57.780> 30<00:01:58.500> degrees<00:01:58.649> per<00:01:59.640> copy

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
gonna rotate it by 30 degrees per copy

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.520 
gonna rotate it by 30 degrees per copy
and<00:02:00.530> in<00:02:01.530> total<00:02:01.740> we<00:02:01.920> want<00:02:02.780> 12<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.290> we<00:02:04.380> already

gonna<00:02:26.830> go<00:02:27.010> with<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.640> polygon<00:02:28.480> pipe<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.970> then

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
gonna go with a polygon pipe and then

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.760 
gonna go with a polygon pipe and then
drag<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.569> out<00:02:32.400> like<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:34.500> pull<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.530> up<00:02:35.739> a

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
drag that out like so pull it up a

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.990 
drag that out like so pull it up a
little<00:02:35.920> bit<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:37.530> in<00:02:38.530> our<00:02:38.680> attitude<00:02:38.950> editor<00:02:39.400> so

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
little bit and in our attitude editor so

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.660 
little bit and in our attitude editor so
we're<00:02:40.420> gonna<00:02:40.510> go<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:40.780> object<00:02:41.530> mode<00:02:41.769> okay

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
we're gonna go to object mode okay

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.490 
we're gonna go to object mode okay
we're<00:02:43.450> gonna<00:02:43.540> make<00:02:43.780> sure<00:02:43.989> that<00:02:44.200> we<00:02:44.319> have

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.759 
we're gonna make sure that we have
enough<00:02:46.080> divisions<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.290> make<00:02:47.440> it<00:02:47.590> nice<00:02:47.739> and

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
enough divisions to make it nice and

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.590 
enough divisions to make it nice and
smooth<00:02:48.220> so<00:02:48.700> we're<00:02:48.940> going<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.120> bump<00:02:49.330> it<00:02:49.480> up<00:02:49.540> to

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
smooth so we're going to bump it up to

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.940 
smooth so we're going to bump it up to
60<00:02:51.209> looks<00:02:52.209> better<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:53.530> now<00:02:53.650> we're<00:02:53.769> going<00:02:53.860> to

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
60 looks better and now we're going to

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.120 
60 looks better and now we're going to
go<00:02:54.069> to<00:02:54.130> our<00:02:55.200> top<00:02:56.200> view<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:58.230> we're<00:02:59.230> gonna<00:02:59.319> move

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
go to our top view and we're gonna move

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:07.289 
go to our top view and we're gonna move
that<00:03:00.400> up<00:03:01.769> hit<00:03:02.769> have<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.220> zoom<00:03:03.400> in<00:03:06.299> something

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
that up hit have to zoom in something

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:13.650 
that up hit have to zoom in something
like<00:03:07.450> that<00:03:09.660> something<00:03:10.660> like<00:03:10.840> so<00:03:11.380> I<00:03:12.000> can<00:03:13.000> are<00:03:13.239> to

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
like that something like so I can are to

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.490 
like that something like so I can are to
scale<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:14.080> out<00:03:14.140> just<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:16.780> make<00:03:16.959> sure<00:03:17.230> that

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
scale that out just to make sure that

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.440 
scale that out just to make sure that
all<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.859> spokes<00:03:18.250> are<00:03:18.459> in<00:03:18.519> contact<00:03:19.000> like<00:03:19.329> that

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
all the spokes are in contact like that

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.770 
all the spokes are in contact like that
we're<00:03:22.450> gonna<00:03:22.540> just<00:03:23.579> check<00:03:24.579> it<00:03:24.730> from<00:03:24.970> our<00:03:25.180> side

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
we're gonna just check it from our side

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.319 
we're gonna just check it from our side
view<00:03:26.170> to<00:03:26.440> make<00:03:26.590> sure<00:03:26.829> that<00:03:27.190> our<00:03:27.250> spokes<00:03:28.120> are

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
view to make sure that our spokes are

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.150 
view to make sure that our spokes are
centered<00:03:28.690> out<00:03:28.810> in<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:28.959> middle<00:03:29.260> so<00:03:29.950> we're

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
centered out in the middle so we're

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.789 
centered out in the middle so we're
gonna<00:03:30.280> hit<00:03:30.489> W<00:03:31.359> and<00:03:31.690> we're<00:03:31.840> gonna<00:03:31.930> push<00:03:32.530> the

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
gonna hit W and we're gonna push the

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.650 
gonna hit W and we're gonna push the
wheel<00:03:33.010> down<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.310> little<00:03:33.579> bit<00:03:33.790> so<00:03:34.209> that's<00:03:34.359> in<00:03:34.540> the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
wheel down a little bit so that's in the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.349 
wheel down a little bit so that's in the
center<00:03:35.310> like<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:38.709> then<00:03:39.100> we<00:03:39.160> hit<00:03:39.310> 5<00:03:39.640> for

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
center like that and then we hit 5 for

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.979 
center like that and then we hit 5 for
shaded<00:03:40.690> mode<00:03:42.209> okay<00:03:43.209> and<00:03:43.480> now<00:03:43.690> what<00:03:43.840> we're

Beth<00:04:25.760> lookin<00:04:26.210> like<00:04:26.690> that<00:04:27.610> so<00:04:28.610> it's<00:04:28.940> looking

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
Beth lookin like that so it's looking

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.820 
Beth lookin like that so it's looking
pretty<00:04:30.080> round<00:04:30.760> we're<00:04:31.760> gonna<00:04:31.820> create<00:04:32.300> a<00:04:32.360> little

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
pretty round we're gonna create a little

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.290 
pretty round we're gonna create a little
cap<00:04:33.830> in<00:04:34.040> the<00:04:34.130> middle<00:04:34.370> here<00:04:34.640> so<00:04:36.580> let's<00:04:37.580> make

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
cap in the middle here so let's make

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.050 
cap in the middle here so let's make
that<00:04:38.330> a<00:04:38.570> cylinder<00:04:40.540> I'm<00:04:41.540> gonna<00:04:41.780> pull<00:04:42.020> that<00:04:42.170> up

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
that a cylinder I'm gonna pull that up

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.490 
that a cylinder I'm gonna pull that up
and<00:04:44.060> we're<00:04:44.810> gonna<00:04:44.930> move<00:04:45.290> that<00:04:45.350> to<00:04:46.010> the<00:04:46.310> center

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
and we're gonna move that to the center

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.180 
and we're gonna move that to the center
use<00:04:48.500> our<00:04:48.710> top<00:04:48.950> view<00:04:48.980> for<00:04:49.490> that<00:04:50.710> it'd<00:04:51.710> have<00:04:51.950> to

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
use our top view for that it'd have to

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.340 
use our top view for that it'd have to
zoom<00:04:52.400> in<00:04:53.710> I'm<00:04:54.710> gonna<00:04:55.720> move<00:04:56.720> something<00:04:57.200> like

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
zoom in I'm gonna move something like

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.130 
zoom in I'm gonna move something like
that<00:04:57.620> actually<00:04:58.280> it's<00:04:58.700> pretty<00:04:59.600> smooth<00:04:59.990> in<00:05:00.080> the

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
that actually it's pretty smooth in the

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.440 
that actually it's pretty smooth in the
middle<00:05:00.380> and<00:05:01.100> your<00:05:01.490> attribute<00:05:01.940> editor<00:05:02.060> we're

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
middle and your attribute editor we're

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.980 
middle and your attribute editor we're
gonna<00:05:02.540> make<00:05:02.750> sure<00:05:02.960> we<00:05:03.140> got<00:05:03.290> enough<00:05:04.990> divisions

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
gonna make sure we got enough divisions

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.980 
gonna make sure we got enough divisions
so<00:05:06.860> it's<00:05:07.010> nice<00:05:07.220> and<00:05:07.250> round<00:05:07.600> bump<00:05:08.600> that<00:05:08.720> up<00:05:08.780> to

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
so it's nice and round bump that up to

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.840 
so it's nice and round bump that up to
60<00:05:10.300> we're<00:05:11.300> gonna<00:05:11.419> check<00:05:11.750> our<00:05:11.900> side<00:05:12.169> view<00:05:12.850> we're

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
60 we're gonna check our side view we're

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.630 
60 we're gonna check our side view we're
gonna<00:05:13.970> pull<00:05:14.330> that<00:05:14.480> down<00:05:17.830> let's<00:05:18.830> see<00:05:19.130> if<00:05:19.370> that

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
gonna pull that down let's see if that

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.360 
gonna pull that down let's see if that
is<00:05:21.550> yeah<00:05:22.550> that's<00:05:22.850> not<00:05:23.060> too<00:05:23.210> bad<00:05:24.100> let<00:05:25.100> you<00:05:25.190> down

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
is yeah that's not too bad let you down

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.659 
is yeah that's not too bad let you down
a<00:05:25.400> little<00:05:25.460> bit<00:05:25.610> more<00:05:27.040> I'm<00:05:28.040> just<00:05:28.310> gonna<00:05:28.430> check

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
a little bit more I'm just gonna check

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.510 
a little bit more I'm just gonna check
it<00:05:28.820> in<00:05:28.910> our<00:05:29.030> perspective<00:05:29.540> view<00:05:30.280> how<00:05:31.280> that

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
it in our perspective view how that

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.170 
it in our perspective view how that
looks

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.750 

alright<00:05:35.590> now<00:05:36.590> we're<00:05:36.890> gonna<00:05:36.979> do<00:05:37.190> is<00:05:37.430> we're
