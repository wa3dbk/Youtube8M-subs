jitter whatsoever but I did notice

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.880 
jitter whatsoever but I did notice
something<00:00:39.660> i<00:00:39.899> did<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> little<00:00:40.140> test<00:00:40.590> in

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
something i did a little test in

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.380 
something i did a little test in
Photoshop<00:00:42.710> as<00:00:43.710> well<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.110> just<00:00:46.940> just<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.090> show

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
Photoshop as well and just just to show

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:57.450 
Photoshop as well and just just to show
you

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.459 

okay<00:00:58.180> we<00:00:58.480> make<00:00:59.379> sure<00:00:59.590> I<00:00:59.620> have<00:00:59.920> a<00:00:59.950> brush<00:01:00.430> like

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
okay we make sure I have a brush like

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:09.710 
okay we make sure I have a brush like
just<00:01:03.540> circle<00:01:04.540> align<00:01:06.360> actually<00:01:07.360> didn't<00:01:07.600> do<00:01:07.690> it

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
just circle align actually didn't do it

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.010 
just circle align actually didn't do it
huh<00:01:10.720> well<00:01:11.590> anyway<00:01:12.390> earlier<00:01:13.390> when<00:01:13.659> I<00:01:13.720> tested

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
huh well anyway earlier when I tested

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.719 
huh well anyway earlier when I tested
this<00:01:14.350> it<00:01:14.619> have<00:01:14.800> like<00:01:14.950> a<00:01:15.009> little<00:01:15.250> bit<00:01:15.520> of<00:01:15.550> it

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
this it have like a little bit of it

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.510 
this it have like a little bit of it
like<00:01:15.880> a<00:01:16.590> jitter<00:01:17.590> in<00:01:17.800> it<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.369> only

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
like a jitter in it and the only

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.430 
like a jitter in it and the only
difference<00:01:18.970> would<00:01:19.119> be<00:01:19.180> that<00:01:19.330> it<00:01:19.899> wouldn't

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
difference would be that it wouldn't

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.590 
difference would be that it wouldn't
have<00:01:20.890> that<00:01:21.159> jitter<00:01:21.490> on<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.909> screen<00:01:22.270> but<00:01:22.540> it

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
have that jitter on the screen but it

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.580 
have that jitter on the screen but it
would<00:01:22.780> show<00:01:23.020> it<00:01:23.170> here<00:01:24.090> but<00:01:25.090> now<00:01:25.390> it's<00:01:26.320> not

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
would show it here but now it's not

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.190 
would show it here but now it's not
shining<00:01:26.920> it<00:01:27.100> on<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.340> screen<00:01:27.550> which<00:01:27.909> is<00:01:28.200> real
