00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 a family that recorded the exact moment 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.210
 in which the wheel of a bus falls off 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.760
 of the machine and traveling at full speed 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.750
 by route 68 goes directly to the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.150
 where are they 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.160
 risky behavior of some drivers 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.670
 that multiply in this time of 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.670
 holidays 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.670
 deaf or station 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.199
 behind 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.170
 and in the worst of his nightmares the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.540
 family thought he would witness a 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.000
 true horror movie just the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.890
 day they returned from vacation yes because 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.290
 this Saturday they were traveling on Route 68 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.970
 heading to Santiago when they noticed 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.730
 that this bus was started 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.520
 detach part of the lower train and in 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.650
 what we passed to the bus 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.739
 warning him to stop please who 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.140
 wheel is already falling and the driver nano 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.690
 he does not take us into account and it was terror in 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.320
 the moment because I said you do not feel 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.320
 of death to the bus 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.200
 and it goes flying is a scare of those 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.390
 that only fortunately managed to escape from 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.090
 the mortal wheel that for eternal seconds 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.560
 went directly to his vehicle what 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.450
 they did not find anything better than 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.450
 face the driver when they stopped 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.690
 and says to an old lady 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.930
 but the attitude of this field a 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.700
 completely irresponsible driving 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.890
 of the driver of this bus that was near 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.020
 from 30 passengers to a walk on the coast 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.970
 central and that apparently did not notice 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.369
 of the very serious problem that it brings 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.380
 slopes and that could generate a true 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.119
 tragedy but not only with the passengers 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.800
 on board but also with the 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.710
 private drivers that at that time 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.300
 they traveled the medical route no less 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.640
 wrong that nothing happened and they said no no 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.700
 I do not even have a story it was a bad tightening of 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.350
 bolts or one could we say a 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.810
 negligence in the tightening of garment 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.090
 then when they are released when they are left 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.100
 they are releasing and dropping the bolts that goes 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.260
 to be that the lid comes out and after 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.970
 the tire gets incomplete and 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.830
 clear if the wheel was ejected by 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.750
 several meters to be on the side of 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.370
 the road maintenance problems 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.740
 that are looked at closely by the 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.690
 authority 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.310
 a bus that does not meet the standards of 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.680
 security so images look 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.690
 there is a collapse of the anchoring system 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.980
 of the tire this tire comes out 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.350
 the road becomes a 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.300
 projectile highly dangerous behaviors 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.670
 irresponsible that especially in time 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.470
 summer they become daily bread and 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.750
 Just show this driver of the 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.700
 year that while driving at high speed 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.380
 From Santiago to ViÃ±a del Mar, you are not 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.300
 nothing better happens than to talk 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.370
 by cell phone in the middle of the long 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.770
 conversation advances even to several 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.480
 vehicles but that did not even bother him 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.520
 it seems that this professional driver 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.370
 he forgot that the cell phone and the steering wheel 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.350
 they do not go hand in hand every time we are 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.630
 irresponsible we not only affect 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.360
 our safety but the environment 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.250
 the vehicles that are transported to 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.690
 side of us on the road but 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.000
 Recklessness is not only in the 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.530
 public transport is something to see that 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.030
 there are several drivers who do not 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.980
 nothing evil and daily commit 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.530
 Recklessness that can often be 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.540
 cause something worse the most common in this 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.740
 case is to see cars loaded with suitcases and 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.740
 furniture until more can not 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.310
 what is found between lakes 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:37.469
 with a vomit from my list 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.269
 and you are absolutely right this house news 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:41.370
 that's why it's best to have all the 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.019
 senses in the steering wheel will not be that 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.760
 overconfidence can be 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.010
 protagonist of such imprudence 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.840
 unusual like this that could end up in 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.370
 a tragedy 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.849
 formally 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.849
 already
