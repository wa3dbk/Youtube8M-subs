00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
Rings in the back there to break down

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.460 
Rings in the back there to break down
the<00:01:32.700> front<00:01:32.909> gate<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.210> later<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.110> as<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> game

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
the front gate and later on as the game

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.899 
the front gate and later on as the game
progresses<00:01:34.890> there<00:01:35.189> will<00:01:35.310> be<00:01:35.340> these<00:01:35.549> ladders

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
progresses there will be these ladders

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.609 
progresses there will be these ladders
that<00:01:36.240> will<00:01:36.360> line<00:01:36.570> up<00:01:36.600> against<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> walls<00:01:37.350> and

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
that will line up against the walls and

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.679 
that will line up against the walls and
act<00:01:38.070> as<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.340> different<00:01:38.640> siege<00:01:38.909> apparatuses

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
act as the different siege apparatuses

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.929 
act as the different siege apparatuses
that<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.500> orcs<00:01:41.159> because<00:01:41.549> that's<00:01:41.729> who<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
that the orcs because that's who the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.280 
that the orcs because that's who the
foot<00:01:42.150> representing<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.810> they're<00:01:43.020> kind<00:01:43.259> of

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
foot representing this they're kind of

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.980 
foot representing this they're kind of
an<00:01:43.409> orc<00:01:43.649> army<00:01:44.009> will<00:01:44.460> use<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:45.000> enter<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> castle

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
an orc army will use to enter the castle

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.539 
an orc army will use to enter the castle
so<00:01:46.530> at<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.799> point<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.130> kind<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.340> got<00:01:47.430> to

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
so at that point you kind of got to

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.310 
so at that point you kind of got to
spread<00:01:47.820> your<00:01:47.970> troops<00:01:48.270> out<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.170> can<00:01:49.259> see

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
spread your troops out so as you can see

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.630 
spread your troops out so as you can see
this<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.649> me<00:01:49.770> as<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> flood<00:01:50.159> trying<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.430> rush

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
this is me as a flood trying to rush

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.880 
this is me as a flood trying to rush
into<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.119> building<00:01:51.479> once<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.470> humans<00:01:52.770> are

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
into the building once the humans are

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.219 
into the building once the humans are
kind<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.130> spread<00:01:54.090> out<00:01:54.119> more<00:01:54.420> thinly<00:01:54.780> because

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
kind of spread out more thinly because

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.209 
kind of spread out more thinly because
of<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.409> beginning<00:01:55.530> they<00:01:55.860> only<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.130> to

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
of the beginning they only have to

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.980 
of the beginning they only have to
concentrate<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.790> front<00:01:57.030> gate<00:01:57.240> later<00:01:57.780> on

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
concentrate on the front gate later on

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.330 
concentrate on the front gate later on
they<00:01:58.110> kind<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.560> pay<00:01:58.710> attention<00:01:59.100> to

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
they kind of have to pay attention to

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.310 
they kind of have to pay attention to
three<00:01:59.640> different<00:01:59.820> spots<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.840> once<00:02:01.200> they're

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
three different spots so once they're

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.389 
three different spots so once they're
spread<00:02:01.560> out<00:02:01.649> more<00:02:01.799> thinly<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.250> can

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
spread out more thinly you can

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.160 
spread out more thinly you can
definitely<00:02:02.520> start<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.149> eliminate<00:02:03.570> them<00:02:03.990> one

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
definitely start to eliminate them one

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.980 
definitely start to eliminate them one
by<00:02:04.320> one<00:02:04.530> right<00:02:05.430> here<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.030> different<00:02:06.450> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
by one right here is the different the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.630 
by one right here is the different the
main<00:02:07.290> door<00:02:07.469> access<00:02:07.799> point<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.129> should<00:02:08.310> say<00:02:08.459> that

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
main door access point I should say that

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.550 
main door access point I should say that
leads<00:02:08.789> up<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.090> ramp<00:02:09.390> up<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.780> higher<00:02:10.110> area

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
leads up to a ramp up to the higher area

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.380 
leads up to a ramp up to the higher area
and<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:11.459> can<00:02:11.640> want<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.849> have<00:02:11.970> post<00:02:12.180> your

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
are going at the front gate which they

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.449 
are going at the front gate which they
do<00:02:28.110> need<00:02:28.349> to<00:02:28.470> break<00:02:28.650> down<00:02:28.680> every<00:02:29.160> time<00:02:29.340> it

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
do need to break down every time it

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.280 
do need to break down every time it
reloads<00:02:29.910> so<00:02:30.540> if<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.870> don't<00:02:30.989> wanna<00:02:31.110> leave<00:02:31.260> that

reloads so if you don't wanna leave that

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.770 
reloads so if you don't wanna leave that
gate<00:02:31.620> unattended<00:02:32.099> for<00:02:32.310> too<00:02:32.430> long<00:02:32.610> as<00:02:33.599> we're

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
gate unattended for too long as we're

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.690 
gate unattended for too long as we're
gonna<00:02:33.870> progress<00:02:34.110> here<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.590> can<00:02:34.769> see<00:02:35.069> that

gonna progress here you can see that

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.640 
gonna progress here you can see that
there's<00:02:36.420> kind<00:02:36.629> of<00:02:36.690> like<00:02:36.780> these<00:02:37.379> different
