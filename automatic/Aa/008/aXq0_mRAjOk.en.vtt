biologist there stumped because this
match<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.369> nothing<00:00:20.789> they've<00:00:20.970> ever<00:00:21.060> seen

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
match is nothing they've ever seen

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.179 
match is nothing they've ever seen
they're<00:00:21.750> thrown<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.500> all<00:00:22.650> kinds<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.039> options

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
they're thrown in all kinds of options

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.859 
they're thrown in all kinds of options
at<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.850> what<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.090> could<00:00:24.269> be<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.600> backbone

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
at it of what it could be the backbone

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.269 
at it of what it could be the backbone
of<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.439> shark<00:00:25.800> an<00:00:26.760> oarfish<00:00:27.890> none<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.010> them<00:00:29.130> know

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
of a shark an oarfish none of them know

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.380 
of a shark an oarfish none of them know
for<00:00:29.490> sure<00:00:30.170> but<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.679> original<00:00:32.160> photo

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
for sure but this is the original photo

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.920 
for sure but this is the original photo
that<00:00:33.390> they<00:00:33.540> took<00:00:35.210> and<00:00:36.210> as<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.660> see<00:00:36.809> it's

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
that they took and as you can see it's

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.479 
that they took and as you can see it's
absolutely<00:00:37.110> wicked<00:00:37.680> looking<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:41.070> when<00:00:41.370> they

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
absolutely wicked looking and when they

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.700 
absolutely wicked looking and when they
came<00:00:41.700> back<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.270> they<00:00:42.809> took<00:00:42.960> more<00:00:43.170> photos<00:00:43.559> it

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
came back and they took more photos it

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.920 
came back and they took more photos it
was<00:00:43.800> more<00:00:44.040> decomposed<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.329> was<00:00:45.450> rotting

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
was more decomposed and it was rotting

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.950 
was more decomposed and it was rotting
and<00:00:48.020> they<00:00:49.020> said<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.379> they<00:00:49.500> had<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.800> bury<00:00:50.160> it

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
and they said that they had to bury it

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.360 
and they said that they had to bury it
but<00:00:51.960> as<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.140> can<00:00:52.379> see<00:00:52.440> from<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.949> clip<00:00:53.250> right

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
but as you can see from this clip right

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.020 
but as you can see from this clip right
here

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
here

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.750 
here
been<00:00:54.960> never<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.710> my<00:00:56.100> life<00:00:56.370> have<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.730> seen

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
been never in my life have I seen

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.689 
been never in my life have I seen
anything<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:58.109> struck<00:00:58.890> me<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.550> like<00:00:59.670> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
anything that is struck me is it like a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.880 
anything that is struck me is it like a
dragon's<00:01:00.420> head<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:01.440> want<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.649> talk<00:01:01.770> about

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
dragon's head you want to talk about

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.580 
dragon's head you want to talk about
horns<00:01:02.870> that's<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.199> my<00:01:04.409> own<00:01:04.439> opinion<00:01:06.590> they're

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
horns that's just my own opinion they're

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.170 
horns that's just my own opinion they're
not<00:01:07.740> sure<00:01:07.920> what<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:08.640> they<00:01:08.880> said<00:01:09.060> they

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
not sure what this is but they said they

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.250 
not sure what this is but they said they
would<00:01:09.299> have<00:01:09.390> had<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.689> have<00:01:09.810> gotten<00:01:09.990> some

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
would have had to have gotten some

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.500 
would have had to have gotten some
samples<00:01:10.920> some<00:01:11.130> bone<00:01:11.340> samples<00:01:11.909> some<00:01:12.030> vertebrae

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
samples some bone samples some vertebrae

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.480 
samples some bone samples some vertebrae
and<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.260> seems<00:01:13.500> like<00:01:13.680> they<00:01:13.830> they're<00:01:14.250> saying

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
and it seems like they they're saying

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.270 
and it seems like they they're saying
they<00:01:14.640> didn't<00:01:15.030> do<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.720> because<00:01:16.530> they<00:01:16.860> buried

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
they didn't do that because they buried

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.010 
they didn't do that because they buried
it<00:01:18.500> so<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:19.860> broken<00:01:20.159> up<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:21.150> cannot<00:01:21.390> we

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
it so it's broken up and we cannot we

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.410 
it so it's broken up and we cannot we
cannot<00:01:22.290> identify<00:01:22.439> what<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.250> now<00:01:24.210> maybe

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
cannot identify what it is now maybe

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.870 
cannot identify what it is now maybe
it's<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.720> bull<00:01:24.930> fish<00:01:25.200> he<00:01:25.470> joked<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.189> mean<00:01:26.729> they've

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
it's a bull fish he joked I mean they've

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.260 
it's a bull fish he joked I mean they've
called<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.299> all<00:01:27.509> kinds<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.259> different<00:01:28.439> things

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
called it all kinds of different things

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.910 
called it all kinds of different things
he<00:01:30.270> says<00:01:30.479> perhaps<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:31.049> were<00:01:31.170> able<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.650> analyze

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
he says perhaps we were able to analyze

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.190 
he says perhaps we were able to analyze
the<00:01:32.310> bones<00:01:32.520> who<00:01:32.790> might<00:01:32.970> know<00:01:33.150> more<00:01:33.450> but<00:01:34.020> for

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the bones who might know more but for

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.710 
the bones who might know more but for
this<00:01:34.320> specific<00:01:35.070> genetic<00:01:35.460> analysis<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.390> is

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
this specific genetic analysis it is

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.200 
this specific genetic analysis it is
very<00:01:37.140> expensive<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.009> who<00:01:38.250> would<00:01:38.430> pay<00:01:38.670> so

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
very expensive and who would pay so

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.319 
very expensive and who would pay so
basically<00:01:40.460> this<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.520> going<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.880> get<00:01:42.030> swept

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
basically this is going to get swept

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:49.340 
basically this is going to get swept
under<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.689> rug<00:01:44.540> and<00:01:45.710> as<00:01:47.119> he<00:01:48.119> also<00:01:48.299> states<00:01:49.079> down

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
under the rug and as he also states down

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.370 
under the rug and as he also states down
here<00:01:49.820> asked<00:01:50.820> for<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.030> horns<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:52.020> pretty

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
here asked for the horns it's pretty

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.940 
here asked for the horns it's pretty
inconclusive<00:01:52.770> no<00:01:53.640> one<00:01:53.850> knows<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.210> any<00:01:54.420> things

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
inconclusive no one knows of any things

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.280 
inconclusive no one knows of any things
anything<00:01:55.950> with<00:01:56.820> horns<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.570> sea

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.070 

my<00:02:03.290> guess<00:02:03.939> they<00:02:04.939> got<00:02:05.119> themselves<00:02:05.330> a<00:02:05.659> dragon

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
my guess they got themselves a dragon

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.940 
my guess they got themselves a dragon
right<00:02:06.259> here<00:02:08.050> closest<00:02:09.050> I've<00:02:09.200> ever<00:02:09.410> seen<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:09.920> it

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
right here closest I've ever seen to it

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.820 
right here closest I've ever seen to it
and<00:02:10.250> they<00:02:10.580> don't<00:02:10.700> know<00:02:10.880> what<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.150> is<00:02:11.830> anyway

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
and they don't know what it is anyway

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.160 
and they don't know what it is anyway
it's<00:02:13.220> very<00:02:13.370> interesting<00:02:14.180> I<00:02:14.360> wanted<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:14.989> share

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
it's very interesting I wanted to share

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.420 
it's very interesting I wanted to share
it<00:02:15.260> with<00:02:15.349> you<00:02:15.440> guys<00:02:15.620> you<00:02:15.890> guys<00:02:16.010> could<00:02:16.220> at<00:02:16.310> least
