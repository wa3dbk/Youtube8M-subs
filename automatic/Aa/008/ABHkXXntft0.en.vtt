00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.150
 blackbird dear friends my name is 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.880
 cornflowers this video I want to tell 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.460
 this is for car dormant recycling 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.410
 which make up the starting one 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.170
 September 2014 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.760
 so the program I passed my steel by 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.250
 will take in '96 and got a discount 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.820
 States 50 thousand rubles and bought a new 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.220
 the car 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.609
 the difference is recording video data for those 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.040
 people who are just going to their 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.110
 car and do not know what to do 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.570
 because when I come across this 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.280
 the situation I did not understand anything 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.270
 didn't know her face some 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.760
 deprived 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.950
 cops like pitfalls therefore 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.770
 I want to share my experience how to let 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.770
 the wisdom of which i acquired for 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.190
 This stage is the first thing I want to advise 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.590
 this is the auto show where we are going 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.940
 purchase a car and 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.780
 ask about the salon namely 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.750
 manager 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.480
 Does this recycling program 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.180
 before the salon but because not all have not 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.880
 all car dealerships, it acts second 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.060
 step we need to make a copy of TCP and 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.280
 copies of registration certificate 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.830
 the car 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.820
 you need to stop but the cabin did not arise 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:24.240
 questions that you were home owners 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.360
 cars that gave recycling further 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.100
 you need to rent a state number and go to 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.920
 grief to deregister 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.380
 car want to point out that you should 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.080
 harry says you give the car to 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.810
 recycling program state 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.490
 optimize the car industry because you 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.890
 should give 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.869
 special plan for recycling and state 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.340
 the program is slightly different 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.440
 normal disposal machine data coffee 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.090
 the form that I gave you 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.209
 make the pen below the photo will 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.020
 is presented 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:06.209
 and necessarily if your car 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.780
 moves you want to lead the berries 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:12.930

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.470

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.350
 must issue and after the vehicle is licensed 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:00.270
