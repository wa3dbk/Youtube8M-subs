00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
of the state is the landscape seems a

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.270 
of the state is the landscape seems a
very<00:01:06.420> permanent<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.560> way<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.009> it<00:01:08.130> seems

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
very permanent in a way and it seems

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.070 
very permanent in a way and it seems
very<00:01:08.549> sort<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:08.940> austere<00:01:09.390> about<00:01:09.899> that

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
very sort of austere about that

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.880 
very sort of austere about that
landscape<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.950> has<00:01:11.610> been<00:01:12.509> a<00:01:12.539> draw<00:01:13.440> for<00:01:13.770> me

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
landscape that has been a draw for me

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.669

for<00:01:14.220> many<00:01:14.880> years<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.690> I<00:01:15.750> still<00:01:16.140> get<00:01:16.289> out<00:01:16.440> there

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
for many years and I still get out there

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:20.690 
for many years and I still get out there
as<00:01:16.830> much<00:01:17.009> as<00:01:17.190> I<00:01:17.399> possibly<00:01:17.819> can<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:19.640> pay<00:01:20.640> tribute

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
but it is you know to me it's one of the

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.050 
but it is you know to me it's one of the
great<00:04:41.050> places<00:04:41.560> in<00:04:41.889> the<00:04:41.979> American<00:04:42.370> West<00:04:42.490> if<00:04:42.850> not

great places in the American West if not
you<00:04:43.630> know<00:04:43.750> in<00:04:44.440> the<00:04:44.500> world<00:04:45.389> would<00:04:46.389> you<00:04:46.510> say<00:04:46.690> that

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
you know in the world would you say that

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.620 
you know in the world would you say that
partly<00:04:47.530> why<00:04:47.919> you<00:04:47.949> wanted<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.669> say<00:04:48.880> but<00:04:49.330> there

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
partly why you wanted to say but there

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.960 
partly why you wanted to say but there
is<00:04:49.840> because<00:04:50.050> it<00:04:50.320> doesn't<00:04:50.650> get<00:04:50.949> a<00:04:51.280> lot<00:04:51.789> of

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
is because it doesn't get a lot of

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.300 
is because it doesn't get a lot of
recognition<00:04:52.210> yeah<00:04:53.139> I<00:04:53.380> mean<00:04:53.560> but<00:04:53.710> partially<00:04:54.220> it

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
recognition yeah I mean but partially it

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.060 
recognition yeah I mean but partially it
was<00:04:54.490> and<00:04:54.850> partially<00:04:55.530> you<00:04:56.530> know<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:56.770> sort<00:04:56.979> of

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
was and partially you know the sort of

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.830 
was and partially you know the sort of
concept<00:04:57.760> that<00:04:57.880> I<00:04:57.940> had<00:04:58.240> for<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:58.780> novel<00:04:59.229> is

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
concept that I had for the novel is

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.350 
concept that I had for the novel is
indivisible<00:05:01.840> from<00:05:02.289> that<00:05:02.970> landscape<00:05:03.970> and<00:05:04.240> that

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
indivisible from that landscape and that

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.779 
indivisible from that landscape and that
geography<00:05:04.780> that<00:05:05.260> terrain<00:05:05.680> and<00:05:06.160> historically

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
geography that terrain and historically

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.090 
geography that terrain and historically
what<00:05:07.150> happened<00:05:07.630> you<00:05:08.050> know<00:05:08.169> in<00:05:08.410> that<00:05:08.620> part<00:05:08.979> of

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
what happened you know in that part of

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.610 
what happened you know in that part of
the<00:05:09.160> state<00:05:09.490> in<00:05:09.820> the<00:05:10.330> you<00:05:10.660> know<00:05:10.750> 1950s<00:05:11.440> and

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
the state in the you know 1950s and

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.909 
the state in the you know 1950s and
1960s<00:05:12.600> so<00:05:13.600> it<00:05:13.990> just<00:05:14.169> sort<00:05:14.229> of<00:05:14.380> had<00:05:14.530> everything

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
1960s so it just sort of had everything

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.430 
1960s so it just sort of had everything
that<00:05:15.100> I<00:05:15.310> needed<00:05:15.340> to<00:05:15.940> tell<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.750> story<00:05:17.080> in<00:05:17.320> the

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
that I needed to tell the story in the

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.770 
that I needed to tell the story in the
landscape<00:05:17.919> you<00:05:18.130> know<00:05:18.280> very<00:05:18.580> much<00:05:18.699> is<00:05:19.330> sort<00:05:19.690> of

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
landscape you know very much is sort of

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.040 
landscape you know very much is sort of
a<00:05:20.100> character<00:05:21.100> in<00:05:21.460> and<00:05:21.760> of<00:05:21.850> itself<00:05:22.150> in<00:05:22.539> the

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
a character in and of itself in the

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.470
