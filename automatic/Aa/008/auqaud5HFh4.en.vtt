 to lose weight instead we want to throw fat to do this is a lot 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.170
 important to do low intensity physical activity and that is where we are 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.770
 helps the bold iphone 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.080
 chemistry at all times what we are burning 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.810
 during the first minutes of training the tea in the computer polar effect 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.070
 a thorough heart rate analysis to determine intensity 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.650
 ideal for maximizing fat consumption and he indicates directly on the

 how many calories I burned

 and also how much time spent in the ideal area for weight loss 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:51.759
