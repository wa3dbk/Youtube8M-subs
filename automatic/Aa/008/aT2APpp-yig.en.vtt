guhong b2 is half brights from HK now
store<00:00:51.239> don't<00:00:52.239> really<00:00:52.480> like<00:00:52.629> these<00:00:52.719> stickers

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
store don't really like these stickers

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.350 
store don't really like these stickers
that<00:00:53.230> much<00:00:53.379> because<00:00:53.770> as<00:00:54.070> you<00:00:54.190> can<00:00:54.309> see<00:00:54.460> they

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
that much because as you can see they

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.720 
that much because as you can see they
are<00:00:55.590> smaller<00:00:56.590> and<00:00:56.860> they<00:00:56.920> don't<00:00:57.070> fit<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:57.520> piece

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
are smaller and they don't fit the piece

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.670 
are smaller and they don't fit the piece
as<00:00:57.910> well<00:00:58.059> as<00:00:58.329> the<00:00:58.690> zhanchi<00:00:58.899> you<00:00:59.440> can<00:00:59.559> see

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
as well as the zhanchi you can see

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.200 
as well as the zhanchi you can see
there's<00:00:59.860> like<00:00:59.980> more<00:01:00.219> black<00:01:00.460> showing<00:01:00.910> up<00:01:01.090> on

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
there's like more black showing up on

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.119 
there's like more black showing up on
this<00:01:01.300> cube<00:01:01.539> don't<00:01:02.500> you<00:01:02.620> sure<00:01:02.710> if<00:01:02.800> you<00:01:02.860> can<00:01:02.980> tell

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
this cube don't you sure if you can tell

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.590 
this cube don't you sure if you can tell
or<00:01:03.160> not<00:01:03.340> but<00:01:03.640> I<00:01:03.670> do<00:01:03.879> notice<00:01:04.180> that<00:01:04.299> what<00:01:04.510> I'm

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
or not but I do notice that what I'm

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.270 
or not but I do notice that what I'm
solving<00:01:04.809> it<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.909> next<00:01:07.150> thing<00:01:08.040> they're<00:01:09.040> both

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
solving it so next thing they're both

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.280 
solving it so next thing they're both
tension<00:01:09.760> that<00:01:09.940> felt<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.420> same<00:01:10.659> so<00:01:11.020> I'll<00:01:11.110> give

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
tension that felt the same so I'll give

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.840 
tension that felt the same so I'll give
you<00:01:11.409> quick<00:01:11.619> corner<00:01:11.920> cutting<00:01:12.100> thing<00:01:12.369> I'm

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
you quick corner cutting thing I'm

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.020 
you quick corner cutting thing I'm
pretty<00:01:13.119> sure<00:01:13.240> they're<00:01:13.390> both<00:01:13.540> about<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:14.020> same

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
pretty sure they're both about the same

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.020 
pretty sure they're both about the same
so<00:01:16.770> 1qb<00:01:17.770> a<00:01:18.270> problem<00:01:19.270> line<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:20.020> line<00:01:20.490> no<00:01:21.490> problem

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
so 1qb a problem line to line no problem

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.550 
so 1qb a problem line to line no problem
this<00:01:22.540> is<00:01:22.720> an<00:01:23.020> Qing<00:01:23.200> again<00:01:23.439> by<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.650> way<00:01:24.210> 45<00:01:25.560> I'm

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
this is an Qing again by the way 45 I'm

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.130 
this is an Qing again by the way 45 I'm
problem<00:01:26.860> a<00:01:27.220> little<00:01:27.760> bit<00:01:27.939> more<00:01:28.740> no<00:01:29.740> problem<00:01:29.790> and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
problem a little bit more no problem and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.969 
problem a little bit more no problem and
if<00:01:32.140> you<00:01:32.259> go<00:01:32.380> any<00:01:32.530> further

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
if you go any further

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.460 
if you go any further
it<00:01:33.189> just<00:01:33.520> reversed<00:01:33.850> corner<00:01:34.119> cuts<00:01:34.330> so<00:01:34.750> pretty

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
it just reversed corner cuts so pretty

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.960 
it just reversed corner cuts so pretty
much<00:01:35.619> there's<00:01:35.890> no<00:01:36.009> such<00:01:36.189> thing<00:01:36.369> as<00:01:36.460> a<00:01:36.520> lock-up

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
much there's no such thing as a lock-up

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.820 
much there's no such thing as a lock-up
on<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.299> zhanchi<00:01:37.509> will<00:01:37.960> when<00:01:38.590> your<00:01:38.710> front

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
on the zhanchi will when your front

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.010 
on the zhanchi will when your front
corner<00:01:39.310> kind<00:01:39.490> of<00:01:39.549> guess<00:01:39.700> because<00:01:40.570> it's<00:01:40.900> either

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
corner kind of guess because it's either

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.240 
corner kind of guess because it's either
going<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.439> corner<00:01:42.070> cut<00:01:42.250> or<00:01:42.460> it's<00:01:43.090> going<00:01:43.299> to

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
going to corner cut or it's going to

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.710 
going to corner cut or it's going to
reverse<00:01:45.250> corner<00:01:45.490> cutting<00:01:45.579> that<00:01:46.030> there<00:01:46.600> might

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
reverse corner cutting that there might

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.109 
reverse corner cutting that there might
be<00:01:46.750> a<00:01:46.840> small<00:01:47.290> spot<00:01:47.799> around<00:01:48.159> there<00:01:48.520> where<00:01:48.909> it

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
be a small spot around there where it

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.450 
be a small spot around there where it
might<00:01:49.240> lock<00:01:49.420> up<00:01:49.659> but<00:01:50.049> as<00:01:50.799> you<00:01:50.920> can<00:01:51.009> see<00:01:51.070> it<00:01:51.310> also

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
might lock up but as you can see it also

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.050 
might lock up but as you can see it also
know<00:01:52.210> this<00:01:52.360> cut<00:01:52.659> so<00:01:53.700> corner<00:01:54.700> cutting<00:01:54.880> is

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
know this cut so corner cutting is

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.609 
know this cut so corner cutting is
amazing<00:01:55.420> on<00:01:55.479> zhanchi<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.079> goo<00:01:56.170> hyung<00:01:56.320> is

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
amazing on zhanchi and the goo hyung is

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.160 
amazing on zhanchi and the goo hyung is
either<00:01:56.799> the<00:01:56.950> same<00:01:57.130> or<00:01:57.189> a<00:01:57.399> little<00:01:57.820> bit<00:01:57.939> worse

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
either the same or a little bit worse

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.120 
either the same or a little bit worse
so<00:01:59.710> 1qb<00:02:00.250> no<00:02:00.880> problem

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
so 1qb no problem

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.889 
so 1qb no problem
line<00:02:03.759> to<00:02:04.000> line<00:02:04.299> no<00:02:05.140> problem<00:02:06.149> 45<00:02:08.309> problem

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
line to line no problem 45 problem

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.760 
line to line no problem 45 problem
little

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
little

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.560 
little
and<00:02:12.770> I<00:02:12.860> guess<00:02:12.980> it<00:02:13.100> does<00:02:13.220> lock<00:02:13.400> up<00:02:13.610> one<00:02:14.240> thing<00:02:14.450> to

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
and I guess it does lock up one thing to

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.480 
and I guess it does lock up one thing to
note<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:15.740> zhanchi<00:02:16.010> I<00:02:16.370> have<00:02:16.580> popped<00:02:17.290> probably

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
note the zhanchi I have popped probably

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.030 
note the zhanchi I have popped probably
under<00:02:19.490> 10<00:02:19.760> times<00:02:20.170> since<00:02:21.170> I've<00:02:21.440> owned<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:21.650> and

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
under 10 times since I've owned it and

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.490 
under 10 times since I've owned it and
it's<00:02:22.190> been<00:02:22.400> about<00:02:22.810> over<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:23.840> year<00:02:24.110> now

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
it's been about over a year now

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.780 
it's been about over a year now
and<00:02:24.590> this<00:02:25.070> I<00:02:26.080> solved<00:02:27.080> near<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.370> same<00:02:28.550> amount

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
and this I solved near the same amount

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.210 
and this I solved near the same amount
of<00:02:28.850> times<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.360> it's<00:02:29.480> pops<00:02:29.720> probably<00:02:30.230> double

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
of times and it's pops probably double

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.810 
of times and it's pops probably double
the<00:02:31.250> triple<00:02:31.580> at<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.760> amount<00:02:31.880> of<00:02:31.970> times<00:02:33.820> with

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
the triple at the amount of times with

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.430 
the triple at the amount of times with
saying<00:02:35.120> that<00:02:35.330> though<00:02:35.480> this<00:02:35.720> isn't<00:02:35.930> I'm<00:02:36.260> not

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
saying that though this isn't I'm not

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.200 
saying that though this isn't I'm not
saying<00:02:36.620> that<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.950> GU<00:02:37.040> long<00:02:37.190> v2<00:02:37.520> pops<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:38.030> lot

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
saying that the GU long v2 pops a lot

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.990 
saying that the GU long v2 pops a lot
but<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:39.230> does<00:02:39.440> pop<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.980> considerable<00:02:40.670> amount

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
but it does pop a considerable amount

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.610 
but it does pop a considerable amount
more<00:02:41.540> than<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:42.200> zhanchi

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
more than the zhanchi

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.530 
more than the zhanchi
which<00:02:42.800> still<00:02:43.040> isn't<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.310> lot<00:02:43.459> but<00:02:43.700> still<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:44.150> just

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
which still isn't a lot but still I just

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.699 
which still isn't a lot but still I just
want<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.780> point<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:45.020> out<00:02:45.110> that<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.410> goo<00:02:45.530> hyung

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
want to point it out that the goo hyung

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.510 
want to point it out that the goo hyung
v2<00:02:46.580> does<00:02:46.850> pop<00:02:47.120> more<00:02:47.480> than<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.930> Zanjeer

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
v2 does pop more than the Zanjeer

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.880 
v2 does pop more than the Zanjeer
so<00:02:49.910> yeah<00:02:50.510> corner-cutting<00:02:50.900> is<00:02:51.410> good<00:02:51.650> but

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
so yeah corner-cutting is good but

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.800 
so yeah corner-cutting is good but
eventually<00:02:52.190> he<00:02:52.430> locks<00:02:52.610> up<00:02:52.850> tried<00:02:53.510> different

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
eventually he locks up tried different

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.530 
eventually he locks up tried different
side<00:02:53.959> so<00:02:54.950> it<00:02:55.250> can<00:02:55.400> cut<00:02:55.550> 45<00:02:55.850> a<00:02:55.970> little<00:02:56.300> bit<00:02:56.390> more

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
side so it can cut 45 a little bit more

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.900 
side so it can cut 45 a little bit more
it<00:02:56.720> ends<00:02:57.080> up<00:02:57.170> walking<00:02:57.350> up<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:58.430> reverse<00:02:58.640> corner

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
it ends up walking up and reverse corner

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.400 
it ends up walking up and reverse corner
cutting<00:02:59.000> it<00:02:59.510> can<00:03:01.750> do<00:03:02.750> a<00:03:02.780> little<00:03:03.020> bit<00:03:03.140> less<00:03:03.290> than

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
cutting it can do a little bit less than

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.410 
cutting it can do a little bit less than
this<00:03:03.500> ant<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:03.920> ever<00:03:04.100> something<00:03:04.420> yeah

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
this ant you to ever something yeah

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.830 
this ant you to ever something yeah
because<00:03:05.510> I'm<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.780> Sanchi<00:03:06.080> it<00:03:06.200> would<00:03:06.410> cut<00:03:06.650> that

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
because I'm the Sanchi it would cut that

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.050 
because I'm the Sanchi it would cut that
so<00:03:08.840> just<00:03:08.870> under<00:03:09.260> QB<00:03:09.650> Oh<00:03:09.910> looks<00:03:10.910> like<00:03:10.970> it's

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
so just under QB Oh looks like it's

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:19.870 
so just under QB Oh looks like it's
locking<00:03:11.330> up<00:03:18.130> yeah<00:03:19.130> so<00:03:19.280> they<00:03:19.400> both<00:03:19.519> you<00:03:19.670> just

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
locking up yeah so they both you just

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.550 
locking up yeah so they both you just
under<00:03:20.150> QP<00:03:20.510> for<00:03:20.720> reverse<00:03:20.900> corner<00:03:21.080> cutting<00:03:21.140> and

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
under QP for reverse corner cutting and

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.460 
under QP for reverse corner cutting and
then<00:03:22.280> in<00:03:22.640> actual<00:03:23.540> corner<00:03:23.750> cutting<00:03:23.900> Sanchi

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
then in actual corner cutting Sanchi

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.960 
then in actual corner cutting Sanchi
does<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.650> little<00:03:24.890> bit<00:03:25.010> more<00:03:25.160> than<00:03:25.489> this<00:03:25.640> but

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
does a little bit more than this but

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.070 
does a little bit more than this but
they<00:03:26.150> can<00:03:26.300> both<00:03:26.390> do<00:03:26.540> over<00:03:26.780> 45<00:03:28.300> so<00:03:29.300> these<00:03:29.660> are<00:03:29.930> my

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
they can both do over 45 so these are my

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.120 
they can both do over 45 so these are my
two<00:03:30.140> minions<00:03:30.500> actually<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:32.750> I'd<00:03:33.709> have<00:03:33.860> to<00:03:33.920> say

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
two minions actually and I'd have to say

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.120 
two minions actually and I'd have to say
they<00:03:34.400> both<00:03:34.790> I<00:03:35.209> both<00:03:35.930> lude<00:03:36.170> them<00:03:36.350> i've<00:03:36.800> lubed

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
they both I both lude them i've lubed

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.610 
they both I both lude them i've lubed
them<00:03:37.340> both<00:03:37.489> I<00:03:37.670> mean<00:03:37.700> with<00:03:38.350> Rubik's<00:03:39.350> and<00:03:39.560> I've

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
them both I mean with Rubik's and I've

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.400 
them both I mean with Rubik's and I've
loop<00:03:39.769> loop<00:03:40.190> them<00:03:40.430> both<00:03:40.549> the<00:03:40.760> exact<00:03:41.030> same<00:03:41.180> way

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
loop loop them both the exact same way

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.630 
loop loop them both the exact same way
so<00:03:42.410> there's<00:03:42.590> no<00:03:42.709> unfair<00:03:43.160> advantage<00:03:43.519> or

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
so there's no unfair advantage or

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.390 
so there's no unfair advantage or
anything<00:03:43.910> between<00:03:44.030> cubes<00:03:45.040> once<00:03:46.040> again<00:03:46.160> this

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
anything between cubes once again this

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.460 
anything between cubes once again this
is<00:03:46.549> his<00:03:46.670> ng<00:03:46.970> on<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.239> right<00:03:47.390> goo<00:03:48.170> hyung<00:03:48.290> be

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
is his ng on the right goo hyung be

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.390 
is his ng on the right goo hyung be
doing<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.739> left<00:03:48.860> and<00:03:49.459> I'd<00:03:50.299> ask<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.540> say<00:03:50.690> that<00:03:50.930> I

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
doing the left and I'd ask to say that I

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.890 
doing the left and I'd ask to say that I
actually<00:03:52.400> like<00:03:52.760> this<00:03:52.910> ante<00:03:53.209> more<00:03:53.420> this<00:03:53.630> is<00:03:53.720> my

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
actually like this ante more this is my

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.000 
actually like this ante more this is my
main<00:03:54.140> and<00:03:55.510> they<00:03:56.510> both<00:03:56.660> have<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.080> same<00:03:57.110> speed

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
main and they both have the same speed

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.720 
main and they both have the same speed
I'd<00:03:58.310> say<00:03:59.590> this<00:04:00.590> seems<00:04:00.769> a<00:04:00.920> little<00:04:00.980> bit<00:04:01.160> smoother

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
I'd say this seems a little bit smoother

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.630 
I'd say this seems a little bit smoother
but<00:04:02.690> I<00:04:03.080> feel<00:04:03.500> more<00:04:03.680> in<00:04:03.860> control<00:04:03.890> to<00:04:04.430> zhanchi

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
but I feel more in control to zhanchi

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.170 
but I feel more in control to zhanchi
and<00:04:05.030> once<00:04:05.239> again<00:04:05.510> this<00:04:06.200> has<00:04:06.700> though

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
and once again this has though

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.210 
and once again this has though
three<00:04:08.840> times<00:04:09.049> the<00:04:09.260> last<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.769> amount<00:04:09.950> of<00:04:10.010> pops

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
three times the last the amount of pops

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.900 
three times the last the amount of pops
to<00:04:10.760> a<00:04:10.790> three<00:04:11.030> times<00:04:11.209> less<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:12.230> I<00:04:13.190> don't<00:04:13.730> know<00:04:13.880> I

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
to a three times less and I don't know I

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.599 
to a three times less and I don't know I
just

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.570 

I<00:04:17.349> feel<00:04:18.349> more<00:04:18.470> in<00:04:18.620> control<00:04:18.650> with<00:04:19.069> his<00:04:19.189> engine

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.429 

on<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.699> other<00:04:22.819> hand<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.539> GU<00:04:23.930> Humvee<00:04:24.259> -

00:04:24.429 --> 00:04:24.439 
on the other hand the GU Humvee -

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:27.490 
on the other hand the GU Humvee -
although<00:04:25.099> I<00:04:25.250> still<00:04:25.669> feel<00:04:25.969> it's<00:04:26.900> still<00:04:27.050> very

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500

out<00:04:30.409> it<00:04:30.560> feels<00:04:30.740> smoother<00:04:31.189> than<00:04:31.340> zhanchi

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
out it feels smoother than zhanchi

is<00:04:32.419> in<00:04:32.810> she<00:04:32.960> is<00:04:32.990> more<00:04:33.259> of<00:04:33.349> a<00:04:33.879> clicky<00:04:34.879> feel<00:04:35.060> but<00:04:35.509> I

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
is in she is more of a clicky feel but I

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.080 
is in she is more of a clicky feel but I
kind<00:04:35.900> of<00:04:35.930> like<00:04:36.050> that<00:04:36.199> actually<00:04:36.379> but<00:04:37.219> they<00:04:38.000> go

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
kind of like that actually but they go

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.270 
kind of like that actually but they go
along<00:04:38.210> I<00:04:38.419> feel<00:04:38.659> sort<00:04:39.139> of<00:04:39.229> less<00:04:39.560> in<00:04:39.800> control<00:04:39.919> I'd

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
along I feel sort of less in control I'd

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:54.040 
along I feel sort of less in control I'd
say<00:04:40.460> I<00:04:51.159> don't<00:04:52.159> know<00:04:52.219> I<00:04:52.250> just<00:04:52.810> something<00:04:53.810> about

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
say I don't know I just something about

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.689 
say I don't know I just something about
the<00:04:54.349> goo<00:04:54.469> hyung<00:04:54.620> it<00:04:54.800> feels<00:04:55.009> like<00:04:55.190> it<00:04:55.340> maybe

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
the goo hyung it feels like it maybe

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.219 
the goo hyung it feels like it maybe
it's<00:04:55.909> too<00:04:56.090> loose<00:04:56.330> but<00:04:56.629> the<00:04:56.750> tension<00:04:57.050> it's<00:04:57.139> like

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
it's too loose but the tension it's like

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.129 
it's too loose but the tension it's like
I<00:04:57.319> said<00:04:57.469> before<00:04:57.789> are<00:04:58.789> exactly<00:04:59.569> the<00:04:59.719> same<00:04:59.960> on

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
I said before are exactly the same on

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.909 
I said before are exactly the same on
both<00:05:00.229> cubes<00:05:00.669> and<00:05:01.669> I<00:05:02.379> don't<00:05:03.379> know<00:05:03.560> it's<00:05:03.800> just

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
both cubes and I don't know it's just

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:05.680 
both cubes and I don't know it's just
the<00:05:04.219> zhanchi<00:05:04.520> I<00:05:04.909> feel<00:05:05.180> much<00:05:05.360> more<00:05:05.539> in<00:05:05.659> control

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
the zhanchi I feel much more in control

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.110 
the zhanchi I feel much more in control
and<00:05:06.319> it<00:05:06.979> doesn't<00:05:07.250> pop<00:05:07.340> as<00:05:07.550> much<00:05:07.669> maybe<00:05:07.909> that

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
and it doesn't pop as much maybe that

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.430 
and it doesn't pop as much maybe that
I'm<00:05:08.210> just<00:05:08.389> scared<00:05:08.599> of<00:05:08.659> this<00:05:08.810> popping<00:05:09.229> so<00:05:09.409> I

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
I'm just scared of this popping so I

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.189 
I'm just scared of this popping so I
have<00:05:09.650> to<00:05:09.770> be<00:05:09.889> more<00:05:10.039> cautious<00:05:10.219> but<00:05:10.930> either<00:05:11.930> way

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
have to be more cautious but either way

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.260 
have to be more cautious but either way
I'd<00:05:13.009> have<00:05:13.159> to<00:05:13.279> say<00:05:13.460> that<00:05:13.490> is<00:05:13.909> and<00:05:14.090> she<00:05:14.240> is

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
I'd have to say that is and she is

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.809 
I'd have to say that is and she is
better<00:05:14.599> considering<00:05:15.529> it<00:05:15.710> is<00:05:15.800> my<00:05:15.919> main<00:05:16.069> this<00:05:16.699> is
