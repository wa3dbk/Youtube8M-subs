energizes the eye if you have a lot of

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.359 
energizes the eye if you have a lot of
the<00:01:56.100> same<00:01:56.460> type<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.909> grouping<00:01:58.159> to<00:01:59.159> do

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
the same type of grouping to do

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.039 
the same type of grouping to do
something<00:01:59.790> really<00:01:59.939> different<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.780> real

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
something really different in a real

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.130 
something really different in a real
bright<00:02:01.350> color<00:02:01.740> will<00:02:02.369> kind<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.820> add<00:02:02.969> energy<00:02:03.450> so

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
bright color will kind of add energy so
