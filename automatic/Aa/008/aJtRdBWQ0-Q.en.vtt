 hello you love and welcome today 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.490
 it is the participants doing one today 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.440
 Super delicious dessert is what I think 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.389
 also what christmas and i would 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.389
 say we go and go to the kitchen 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.860
 That is very simple today 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.970
 and consists for the most part of 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.300
 delicious apples 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.980
 yes I have a few apples from the 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.390
 fallobst like you know here 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.880
 brought the apples do not have to 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.320
 super chic look because of it 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.520
 applesauce is made that I have 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.100

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.540

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.910
 and I'll handle it too 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.460
 Of course , we still need all organic 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.879
 add some agave syrup or sugar 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.579
 then we need a cinnamon mixture 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.410
 or cinnamon is clearly a christmas year 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.070
 that is why they are not 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.129

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.750

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.269
 Lemon juice and peel is needed 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.280

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.510
 Of course, a normal cream 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.240
 but you know with milk 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.130
 I somehow at war foot because of that 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.130
 namely the soy is its atto of midi 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.750
 really great service bar and then 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.610
 I had to be strong but I want to 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.560

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.680

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.509

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.380
 Today this is from alnatura's 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.750

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.409

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.880

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.070
 I need us money, it's been going 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.200
 relatively fast and I would say so 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.990
 go now to ride the lemon and 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.159
 to squeeze the lemon as always 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.659
 you do not have to have it in your head 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.520
 Of course, always submit 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.710
 ok you still need a little bit 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.320
 Apple juice I have great organic 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.200
 apple juice it near us yes 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.729
 fattened and I always use that 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.450
 is really very delicious of it 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:01.030
 nature nature nature cloudy nature cloudy that is 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.219
 slept little early but never mind 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.280
 So apple juice must in any case still 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.860
 a little sag for the apples 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.550
 and now I have it too and now 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.890
 Let's go 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.030
 Here I have the lemon peel 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.770
 grated 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.540
 yes it was a very small lemon 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.740
 that's why it's not that much now 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.990
 but that's enough 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.520
 totally and afterwards I have the here now 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.510
 lemon out 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.150
 press and have a little bit now 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.630
 lemon juice all this I do now 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.060
 the apples will cut you 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.250
 and yes, because they are the apple right away 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.900
 I've cut cd lemon zest 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.450
 and on the lemon juice over it 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.880
 yes, something is a shot 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.550
 apple juice or two not too much 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.580
 so that does not get too fluid and I have 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.930
 even made over the vanilla 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.700
 half parcel about 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.440
 yes I taste it again like 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.780
 sweet which is otherwise this will still 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.880
 after with agave syrup and now goes 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.760
 put it on the hearth plate and about 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.750
 10 minutes with a very small flame 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.280
 Simmer 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.870
 Here I have the pan 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.910
 I have something prepared and indeed 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.360
 Vanilla sugar and a little agave syrup 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.830
 done here in the pan and have the 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.620
 almond leaves guests scattered over it 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.830
 I'll finish it all 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.510
 caramelize 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:19.750
 and yes here is the apple here 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.480
 Practically I could do it now 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.100
 on a small flame ten minutes and 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.450
 I show you the other chaos you 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.240
 Not 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.670
 and yes and then I'm the same 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.650

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.990
 have heated on the stove with the apples 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.070
 for that I have to clear by now 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:41.140
 hewn mixer and have to cool the 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.620
 apple sauce or apple mix 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.180
 practically a small glass is filled 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.920

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.780

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.400
 stand so that it is nice and cool 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.709

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.000

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.890
 The almonds come to the end when 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.810
 I already size and caramelized 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.880

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.600
 The flag hit a blob 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.710
 on top of that done 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.510
 then I caramelized the almonds 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.800
