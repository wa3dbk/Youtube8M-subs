00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello so this time I was interested 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.359
 how much skew do I need 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.040
 actually to come in the east 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.429
 that means you will have a beard 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.160
 tries is not nothing asphalt 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.199
 especially as there are street beings 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.850
 better we have the app of pirelli 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.930
 downloaded to measure the inclination 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.769
 the fiz one can otherwise drive dad 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.769
 motorcycles endes from war 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.810
 well i once started pressing 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:42.820
 pushed the motorcycle to the side 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:46.059
 continue with 33 30 degrees oblique position of the 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.190
 epo dresses started since highway 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:53.140
 exposed 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:55.559
 So soft style now lay just so 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.809
 stay on the motorcycle 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.010
 yes there was also the hot dollar 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:10.270
 exposed so what I then 27 to 31 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:14.799
 I guess once and now comes 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:18.549
 then you should be able to do it often 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:21.280
 work still a bit over-motivated 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:24.729
 I wanted to be evenly slanted 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.210
 drive with trailer on so to 42 degrees 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:30.520
 come 40 52 39 degrees 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.009
 that is not necessary the topic 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.170
 Afterwards it is oblique you have to 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:41.480
 never be otherwise 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:44.870
 to come out so ok then once I have the 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:55.550
 camera so prokop already liked 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:57.080
 okay that's not bad either 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.410
 Now show me from this perspective 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:05.210
 once again with crutches recognizes 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:09.800
 press bit more are indeed god but 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.010
 also so 30 degrees again when pressing 21 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.010
 Degree 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.630
 it's ok but so well put it now or 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:27.050
 for me again so perrey we have short 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:31.370
 the 31 degrees 32 to the rent goes once 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.769
 by farfÃ¡n from the third lay and 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.050
 Help up in the upper curve 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.530
 that it definitely depends on it 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:44.209
 Faster, yes, I was already there 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:48.799
 37 degrees so at 37 degrees you get on 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:51.019
 every case 34 degrees 33 so I would 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:54.110
 say almost 30 degrees when you look 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.299
 really puts out and others 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.769
 then you even come to believe me 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:04.160
 from 30 degrees on the knee because that's me 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:07.130
 which has interested me and believes 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.260
 always shrek was crap but you look 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.430
 it just does not hang out 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.110
 so oblique yes I have now camera 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.790
 changed again and was now 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.820
 always his round that not only his 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.010
 white points quite understood and also 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:27.440
 now always taken the time at the video 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:33.410
 and you will automatically faster if 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:35.780
 press one is the slowest create 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:40.700
 is a bit faster up there 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:43.700
 then just faster and also one 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:48.079
 A little bit weird you drive automatically 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:53.440
 if one is up that is still 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:55.819
 the countries so i was there really 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.220
 always on your knees even if you do it sometimes 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.319
 So you do not see this one 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.579
 speed and inclination on the knee 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.299
 here once again the times 15 18 14 30 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.040
 the goal 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.840
 although I actually drive evenly 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.889
 So as I said that is not now 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.359
 go to the maximum angle but 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.959
 which shelf do I get up to? 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:18.320
 knee 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:22.570
 that this is faster, of course 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:25.250
 also clear that app from pirelli 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.060
 incredibly free that I can not do it 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.060
 I've had it longer
