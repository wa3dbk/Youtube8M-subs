so let's go down here I think I see a

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.550 
so let's go down here I think I see a
ladder<00:06:00.340> I<00:06:00.670> do<00:06:01.270> see<00:06:01.690> a<00:06:01.720> ladder<00:06:01.930> at<00:06:02.290> least<00:06:02.440> it

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
ladder I do see a ladder at least it

looks like a ladder see you here if we

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.120 
looks like a ladder see you here if we
can<00:06:06.490> go<00:06:06.610> up<00:06:06.730> the<00:06:06.850> ladder<00:06:07.830> the<00:06:08.830> ladder<00:06:08.860> out

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
can go up the ladder the ladder out

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.160 
can go up the ladder the ladder out
let's<00:06:09.760> I<00:06:10.090> don't<00:06:10.450> know<00:06:10.510> if<00:06:10.600> it'll<00:06:10.720> keep<00:06:10.930> me<00:06:10.990> up

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710 
control panel for the floodgate CD

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:57.800 
control panel for the floodgate CD
display<00:06:53.069> intended<00:06:53.759> all<00:06:54.000> right<00:06:54.240> um<00:06:56.810> Richard

what<00:06:58.199> am<00:06:58.289> I<00:06:58.349> I<00:06:58.800> didn't<00:06:59.490> really<00:06:59.639> I<00:06:59.970> don't<00:07:00.270> know

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:00.389 
what am I I didn't really I don't know

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:04.460 
what am I I didn't really I don't know
I'm<00:07:00.569> gonna<00:07:00.690> have<00:07:00.900> to<00:07:01.849> figure<00:07:02.849> out<00:07:03.180> the<00:07:03.470> enter

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:04.470 
I'm gonna have to figure out the enter

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.629 
I'm gonna have to figure out the enter
one<00:07:04.680> digit<00:07:05.039> I<00:07:05.690> don't<00:07:06.690> I<00:07:06.840> don't<00:07:06.870> know<00:07:07.110> how<00:07:07.639> well

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 
one digit I don't I don't know how well

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:09.920 
one digit I don't I don't know how well
I<00:07:08.669> could<00:07:08.970> I<00:07:09.000> guess<00:07:09.270> go<00:07:09.479> through<00:07:09.690> every

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:09.930 
I could I guess go through every

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.460 
I could I guess go through every
possible<00:07:10.139> number<00:07:10.800> combination<00:07:11.659> all<00:07:12.659> 99

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:13.470 
possible number combination all 99

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:18.980 
possible number combination all 99
numbers<00:07:13.949> until<00:07:14.280> I<00:07:14.340> get<00:07:14.550> it<00:07:14.580> right<00:07:15.470> but<00:07:16.470> uh<00:07:17.990> you

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:18.990 
numbers until I get it right but uh you

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.909 
numbers until I get it right but uh you
know<00:07:20.090> that<00:07:21.090> would<00:07:21.240> take<00:07:21.419> a<00:07:21.449> while<00:07:21.690> so<00:07:21.919> I'm

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 
know that would take a while so I'm

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:24.770 
know that would take a while so I'm
going<00:07:23.280> to<00:07:23.310> save<00:07:23.699> figuring<00:07:24.120> this<00:07:24.240> out<00:07:24.449> for<00:07:24.690> the

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 
going to save figuring this out for the

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.070 
going to save figuring this out for the
next<00:07:24.900> video<00:07:25.610> so<00:07:26.610> and<00:07:27.060> that's<00:07:27.360> I<00:07:27.750> don't<00:07:27.810> see

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 
next video so and that's I don't see

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.520 
next video so and that's I don't see
anything<00:07:28.259> I<00:07:28.440> can<00:07:28.560> do<00:07:28.710> in<00:07:28.830> here<00:07:29.210> so<00:07:30.210> i'm<00:07:30.750> going

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:31.530 
anything I can do in here so i'm going

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.670 
anything I can do in here so i'm going
to<00:07:31.620> go<00:07:31.710> ahead<00:07:31.830> and<00:07:32.070> in<00:07:32.250> this<00:07:32.400> video<00:07:32.580> here<00:07:33.060> and<00:07:33.680> i

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 
to go ahead and in this video here and i

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.850 
to go ahead and in this video here and i
will<00:07:34.949> continue<00:07:35.340> on<00:07:36.080> hopefully<00:07:37.080> figuring<00:07:37.740> that

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:37.860 
will continue on hopefully figuring that

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.520 
will continue on hopefully figuring that
puzzle<00:07:38.490> out<00:07:38.580> the<00:07:38.759> next<00:07:38.880> video<00:07:39.060> so<00:07:39.719> i<00:07:39.960> will<00:07:40.229> see

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:40.530 
puzzle out the next video so i will see

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.800 
puzzle out the next video so i will see
you<00:07:40.590> then
