used reason before in my life but they

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.620 
used reason before in my life but they
sit<00:01:06.619> it's<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:07.890> scratching<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.460> screen<00:01:08.880> they

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
sit it's just scratching the screen they

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.500 
sit it's just scratching the screen they
said<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.860> could<00:01:11.070> set<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.640> reason<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
said that you could set and reason the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.710 
said that you could set and reason the
UM<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.500> grid<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.100> snap<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.729> 16th<00:01:15.540> note

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
UM the grid to snap to 16th note

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.880 
UM the grid to snap to 16th note
triplets<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.170> then<00:01:16.320> all<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.500> had<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.650> do<00:01:16.770> is

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
triplets so then all you had to do is

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.859 
triplets so then all you had to do is
paint<00:01:17.100> them<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:18.119> was<00:01:18.479> thinking<00:01:18.720> wait<00:01:18.840> a

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
paint them in and I was thinking wait a

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.920 
paint them in and I was thinking wait a
second<00:01:19.229> can't<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.500> do<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.920> acid<00:01:20.930> can

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
second can't you do that in acid can

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.830 
second can't you do that in acid can
turns<00:01:22.229> out<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.770> huh<00:01:23.479> so<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:25.200> whole<00:01:25.409> time

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
turns out you can huh so this whole time

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.990 
turns out you can huh so this whole time
we've<00:01:27.840> been<00:01:27.979> wasting<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.340> we're<00:01:29.520> comfortable

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
we've been wasting and we're comfortable

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.340 
we've been wasting and we're comfortable
with<00:01:30.240> doing<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.810> only<00:01:30.930> takes<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.320> couple

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
with doing it so it only takes a couple

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.700 
with doing it so it only takes a couple
seconds<00:01:31.950> for<00:01:32.100> us<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.280> do<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.759> don't<00:01:33.710> my

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
seconds for us to do it like I don't my

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.010 
seconds for us to do it like I don't my
productivity<00:01:35.430> isn't<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.270> know<00:01:36.390> down<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.930> my

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
productivity isn't you know down and my

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.050 
productivity isn't you know down and my
workflow<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.799> awful<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.670> use<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
workflow is and awful so if you use the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.270 
workflow is and awful so if you use the
other<00:01:39.150> method<00:01:39.600> cool<00:01:39.780> keep<00:01:39.990> using<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:40.710> this

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
other method cool keep using it but this

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.230 
other method cool keep using it but this
is<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:43.369> guess<00:01:44.369> for<00:01:44.520> beginners<00:01:45.149> a

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
is this is I guess for beginners a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.830 
is this is I guess for beginners a
faster<00:01:45.689> way<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:47.310> here's<00:01:48.299> how<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.479> do<00:01:48.659> it

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
faster way and here's how you do it

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.649 
faster way and here's how you do it
so<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.530> get<00:01:49.770> your<00:01:49.920> snare<00:01:52.100> you<00:01:53.479> drag<00:01:54.479> your

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
so you get your snare you drag your

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.190 
so you get your snare you drag your
snare<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.490> then<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.610> go<00:01:56.790> up<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
snare in and then you go up to the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.060
