00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.270
 here is a premiere here 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.270
 in germany and a whole new one 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.160
 ship from quiksilver very well known 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.920
 under us the name quiksilver 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.539
 this is the 755 pilote house from the 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.699
 new capture series 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.949
 and that's a very special boat 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.129
 That's what I will do now in detail 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.870
 show this 755 pilote household like that 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.400
 many great features for anglers that we 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.590
 as a bit real time by quickly 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.780
 have to go first this huge 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.460
 boarding as I well everywhere 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.110
 come in with a very stable for 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.790
 then it can be done here 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.489
 so to speak, that sealed properly 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.350
 we keep coming to a feature that 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.879
 is a plate the extra for example 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.739
 to fish or bait fish 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.289
 It has been made equal to cutting 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.030
 well thought out with a trough so that 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.940
 Dirty water can drain and not 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.110
 somewhere in the boot goes in 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.969
 We see many routes everywhere 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.759
 therefore, of course, predestined for 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.740
 fish a very big fish where 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.060
 Of course, you can throw fish in now 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.259
 Can you get caught or not? 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.180
 Maybe bait fischer stops then can 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.659
 if you have to go there 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:20.020
 allows it with pump with fresh water 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.060
 supplying everything in it huge in size to 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.450
 This boat was really up to the practice 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.700
 we do not think we have little houses 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.470
 So everything is built solid too 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.420
 here where fasteners are attached to it 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.310
 everything can be massive and thick so that 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.610
 you can also attach stronger leyen 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.610
 can 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.200
 We also have something clever here 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.960
 I can lean against myself while fishing 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.250
 without a hard one knew 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.400
 at the same time that too is 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:50.470
 backrest for the very well worked 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:53.759
 sit very stable and with one 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.750
 Mechanism simply goes up and down 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.240
 but then disappeared and 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.090
 Hidden I have space again 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.470
 discovery there would be more fish 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.659
 Of course he has more space 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.130
 in this boat both as well 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.979
 the starboard side of the starboard side 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.959
 there are once again great possibilities 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.799
 the fish and bring with it too 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.850
 Pump with completion so that you on board 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.079
 in the back, actually 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:25.750
 No fish at all is understanding him 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:27.220
 the routes do not have that right now 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.080
 be used not stand around in the off 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.260
 and it no longer makes constantly broken 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.440
 There is a wonderful possibility here 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.440
 optional 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.010
 yes, because everyone can only make hungry 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.130
 in between then the 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.840
 seating open the medium 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.700
 still have to be positioned a table 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:53.300
 and we can be a wonderful angler 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:56.120
 Breakfast buffet at the 755 pallett 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.980
 house was really everything 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.620
 thought a very very large sliding door 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.630
 very strong built three-piece I have 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.620
 not seen that way either 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.630
 if you open it you have a lot 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.960
 very big passage and then you come 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.280
 in the large interior of the very deep 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.840
 it is clear that you already notice 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.110
 although I did not grow up big 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.640
 am 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.930
 See how much space is left here 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.940
 So really very big ones 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.710
 People can stand here comfortably without 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.400
 to bend over or to plan 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.840
 we have another one 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.160
 possibility of washing that means to 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.320
 for example, to wash dishes or the 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.510
 knife then heavy on the fish 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.100
 have worked 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.810
 we still have a gas cooker of a 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:38.110
 also what we cook everywhere 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.110
 storage space very much space 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.110
 very comfortable chairs though chairs can 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.470
 you really do not call this one 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.960
 after already comfortable chair in the boot 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.090
 are high rattle this is too 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.040
 movable and great also the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.340
 front is rotatable so that I too 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.230
 for example sit down here I can 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.390
 can not keep turning one more 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.030
 table and also position with im 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.430
 brut is also impressive 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.440
 here the big slices area with 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.240
 Real glass very stable worked like 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.710
 stability everywhere with this boat 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.040
 and security very much 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.870
 The area here was the whole cockpit 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.000
 it's made of a different material 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.170
 normal gfk made what also 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.380
 much more robust is everywhere where 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.800
 the instruments have space too 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.730
 possibilities other things 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.850
 to grow a wheel with a very 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.520
 high quality lever here also for the 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.230
 gear shift so you see it is 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.000
 really really thought of everything 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.650
 been 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.570
 the engineers will like it light 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.890
 thought of this boat for it 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.930
 already falls from the side windows 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.030
 a lot of light pure with it even more 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.880
 brightness comes into the boat you have it 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.710
 with a big chile of rosewood 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.480
 equipped and you can not see it 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.010
 only fresh air will be abundant 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.550
 plenty of light in the boat 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.810
 yes and for nap if during the 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.340
 fishing or maybe even at night 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.570
 in the harbor or maybe on one 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.790
 small hiking tour by boat 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.580
 Also, it is arranged one sees you 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.070
 Here space but it's not all 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.980
 unfortunately again from sleep 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.750
 this entire area can be considered 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.610
 sleeping space or lying area 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.000
 transform and you have with it 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.710
 bursting plentifully 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.580
 I with two perhaps even in 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:25.350
 child to stay here 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.850
 a great feature is also the second one 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.860
 control stand out here 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.330
 not only that I am in nice weather 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.860
 can stand outside and control 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.750
 but even if i am on the 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.130
 I'm stalking am immediately to the call 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.750
 I'm done with that right away 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.790
 can see what happens when creating 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.190
 So a very meaningful 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.580
 purchase and an account feature for 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.580
 this boat 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:55.020
 The 755 parts swap from quiksilver is 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:58.110
 739 long and two meters 79 wide 46 1550 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.689
 euro is the price including 150 ps 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.029
 mercury outboard engine i think thats 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:07.729
 for so much courage and so much we for 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:07.729
 As an angler get absolutely fairer price
