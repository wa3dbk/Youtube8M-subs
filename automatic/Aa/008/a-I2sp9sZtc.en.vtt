 so I'll point out to you the creams 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.969
 that I usually use the creams I 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.550
 I have and that they have the 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.500
 not the size of a pound 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.020
 the first one is that you already know 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.579
 who has been talking for a long time 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.800
 Since the time I started recording the 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.109
 first videos is this from here beauty 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.410
 also improving the barbecue 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:56.930
 and it has some branches by the 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.730
 between them also develop their 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.809
 maintenance line and your line of 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.989
 treatment 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.970
 this combing cream is part of a 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.980
 line of a series of creams for 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.810
 comb my own mine too 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.369
 preference is the traditional one 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.860
 traditional in my opinion is a crime 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.869
 which has a legal consistency it down 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.460
 and it leaves the hair easier it leaves the 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.680
 hair with a definition and a duration 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.979
 much larger than the others 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.619
 the consistency of it I threw the camera that 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.560
 have excuses to register here is 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.079
 good consistency as you can see 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.530
 It's not a cream that we say like that. 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:39.280
 fluid that comes out easily is a 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.810
 cream, very cool in my opinion 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.420

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.149

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.280

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.500
 combing cream 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.480
 he has what says that it is of childlike use that 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.019
 I do not know where I kept this 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.500
 saved is how vital this is from here 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:49.480
 which is more suitable for hair as 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.940
 my so, but in quotes, I'm not loose and have 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.849
 an intensive in has to be very nice 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.519
 because it defines the curls well for you 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.950
 who decided to let her natural hair 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.620
 then for many black who has that 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.390
 literally black hair is natural that 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.000
 have trouble finding a cream is 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.750
 always defining this undulation and 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.209
 to appreciate the naturalness of the cream 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.579
 intensive in the turnip is the most indicated 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.739
 is the vital is one of my favorites 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.690
 Intensive in my hair I do not like 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:24.160
 because it makes him look very 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.410
 thought to be light compared to a 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.230
 more natural hair understand us'm 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.060
 Speaking I try to speak of density. 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.970
 I'm not discussing the structure and 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.739
 texture trying to exemplify to you 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.380
 How is he? Because in a little while. 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.930
 get the comments like ah are you 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.239
 getting worse, I 'm not here to make anything worse 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.190
 nor anyone else I have a gift an example 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.919
 so I'm giving this kind of 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.230
 example then just like I told you 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:52.660
 Who's with your hair there? 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.470
 I believe because it is natural dry 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.549
 the intensive is better indicated than the 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.980
 vital 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:04.299

 He has this little church for a certain 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.359
 time 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.819
