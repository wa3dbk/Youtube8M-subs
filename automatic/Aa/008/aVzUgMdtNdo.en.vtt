00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hi all guys today i succeeded 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.379
 to buy the new iphone 5 at day one 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.809
 in Italy I want to propose the video 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.910
 unboxing the phone we are going to open 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.309
 as you can see I still don't have it 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.630
 open I will not show you the tension 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.970
 because I don't have the micro sim 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.600
 therefore for the moment of the network 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.630
 settle for trustworthy boxing waiting 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.670
 of the next videos where I will also do the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.900
 review also some comparison with 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.939
 Android 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.270
 as you can see the box is black 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.940
 because it is the black version of the iphone 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.940
 let's open the phone here 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:48.210
 to expect new I still have to wait 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.430
 now first impressions seem a lot 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.610
 light as you have already heard 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.420
 from the thousand reviews the phone is 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.609
 very compact and in any case gives respect 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.640
 4s from that feeling of length that 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.470
 however, we will have to get used to it 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.430
 let's go and see a moment inside the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.540
 what is definitely present package 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.270
 you have already seen in other videos what is there 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:21.060
 inside the box then let's go to 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:25.670
 see here as you can see there is the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:32.700
 pin to go and insert the nano sim 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:35.400
 charger with the new jack that 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.390
 just as you will know if you have a mac 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.000
 iphone 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.939
 you will have to buy the adapter now 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.649
 I can also use it a lot ve 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.649
 I show you the new 8-pin jack 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.990
 new airport headphones you will definitely have 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.549
 already seen with their design 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.789
 particular that also on the blog I have 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.979
 explained what it is and why 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.909
 because they improve the sound thanks to 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:13.890
 small holes present 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:16.200
 we try to open it ok 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.780
 here we know what to see 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.680
 we could wrap it to put it back in 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.360
 place to teramo the out of here here 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.420
 just to show the holes that 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.030
 I also reported on the blog 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.610
 few words these small holes are needed 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.890
 to improve the bass and others 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.650
 while listening to music 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.870
 for the moment is all and see you at 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.879
 next video I hope there has been 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.879
 interesting and the next
