knife that's one that's one technique
that<00:03:09.900> battalion<00:03:10.320> I<00:03:10.650> will<00:03:11.250> do<00:03:11.430> so<00:03:12.060> if<00:03:12.360> you're

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
that battalion I will do so if you're

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.660 
that battalion I will do so if you're
processing<00:03:12.900> small<00:03:13.260> pieces<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.800> wood<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:14.190> you

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
processing small pieces of wood that you

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.250 
processing small pieces of wood that you
can't<00:03:14.940> that<00:03:15.510> won't<00:03:15.660> stand<00:03:15.900> up<00:03:15.960> on<00:03:16.080> themselves

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
can't that won't stand up on themselves

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.690 
can't that won't stand up on themselves
and<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:16.710> want<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:16.920> split<00:03:17.070> them<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.520> then<00:03:17.610> you

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
and you want to split them and then you

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.860 
and you want to split them and then you
might<00:03:17.820> have<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.030> use<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.150> battalion<00:03:18.570> technique

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
might have to use a battalion technique

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.590 
might have to use a battalion technique
as<00:03:18.960> well<00:03:19.110> um<00:03:19.410> you<00:03:20.160> know<00:03:20.190> I<00:03:20.580> think<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.180> you
