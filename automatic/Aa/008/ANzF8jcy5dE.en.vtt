00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.919
 Hello friends with you amway921 and in 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:14.429
 This video will be entitled to fiercely 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:16.800
 bhagavan and and tasks abbreviated lbz end 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.869
 It’s all from these ildyz and and sat down 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.269
 light tanks would not be so easy for me 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.769
 make you play like that they wouldn't lie 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:26.369
 heads of cabbage and all kinds of bulldogs 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.730
 toys but would still lbz buckle award 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.140
 has a weight process itself in 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.480
 most cases of course especially on 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.450
 light tanks is pain and humiliation but 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.700
 I want to get a reward and so for now 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.800
 fighting for t28 concept 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.260
 Well, in the end in this particular 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.600
 video we'll talk exactly on both one 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.420
 specific task which is very 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.540
 uneasy in its definition and very 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.600
 uneasy in its decision this is number seven 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.000
 lbz number 7 and it sounds like this 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.940
 not even that roughly it sounds exactly 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.140
 so detect sau enemy and 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.230
 The quantity will vary in 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.880
 depending on the opponent's sau level 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.370
 pass on her intelligence-data or 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.560
 immobilize on the piece need 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.480
 discover the opponent himself give 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.840
 pony explored or immobilize one 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:21.120
 a piece on t-28 2 on t55a 3 and on this 206 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.550
 object to detect immobilizes 3 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.190
 and kill one of them but so that one more 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.900
 it was at the same time a level older and if 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.300
 we want to execute it also on 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.340
 fine then in the case of duo it is 28 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.440
 you just need to survive at the end of the battle 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.330
 then we are entitled to monetary compensation 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.030
 in the form of a handful of silver 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.120
 well, in the case of the other two it is to survive yet 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.860
 and win that too basically do 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.049
 It turns out to be quite not just shows 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.330
 practice but more on that later but before 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.090
 let's just read the text and 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.700
 try to understand what is to understand 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.340
 a man who knows how to letters begin with 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.680
 first word discover our game under 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.409
 detect is meant to light first 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.479
 if your refining your enemy art 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.580
 somebody has already lit up and then you are 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.069
 arrived a second time and covered it 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.510
 the file is no longer considered immediately either 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.350
 any light tank flying in front of you 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.100
 shone your 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.640
 in enemy artillery your lbz ruins 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.500
 Immediately at the root God bless him to pass on 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.020
 scout it or immobilize 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.210
 let's start with the transfer of intelligence to 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.010
 understanding a normal person under 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.710
 intelligence transfer is understood 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.470
 the following art needs to be shown and 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.890
 keep in the light some time to 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.960
 allies and destroyed so here's an epic 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.120
 and the clinical wargaming file is that 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.990
 if you do this 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.150
 basic never perform and how you 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.640
 think I learned about it fortunately for me 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.670
 suggested if I tried it 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.690
 do it yourself but do you know get into a fight 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.340
 and get alive up to two artillery yes 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.020
 First let's start with the fact that 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.540
 easy way to play this game without 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.640
 arts it is to perform lbz where necessary 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.920
 find yes and immobilize find 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.510
 pen-foot pootryvat and somehow 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.940
 call but when you 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.820
 lb for this perform this one artillery 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.250
 You are here in battle, it is at all 0 or if not but 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.450
 whether you hurried a little and went wrong 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.030
 the moment when not all enemies 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.620
 shone not everything so clearly you fly out of 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.170
 headline waffle waits for you 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.860
 fully charged and literally kills 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.870
 on 1 and you're okay another 15 more minutes 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.180
 any other cards trying everything 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.580
 do it while doing it 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.190
 written script and she doesn't 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.140
 counted here in this course as 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.180
 it's good that I avoided this prompted me 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.490
 this whole subject nikitos which just 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.710
 in the platoon play who put on 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.440
 to accomplish help me perform lbz 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.950
 probably half the evening but he is at the same time 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.220
 studied for a day and a half you know the secret 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.770
 know what 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.530
 epic secret wargaming how to perform 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.700
 databases and data and do not need to highlight 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.430
 for allies 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.650
 you can kill her yourself as you please 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.490
 you can destroy but only that you 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.950
 have discovered 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.640
 and you each quantity which is required 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.430
 for lbz 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.490
 in each they made their own hole 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.370
 with every outfit you need to sell 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.290
 you can kill at least like but not at all 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.229
 rely only on what you 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.600
 you only need to highlight it 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.000
 big epic knowing this 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.460
 with 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.770
 the word immobilize in the definition lbz already 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.600
 not a city with such a hazy because for 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.180
 sherlock so 1 tip 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.460
 because only the most probably thin 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.320
 a cold-blooded surgeon and will be able to 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.930
 immobilize the art being surrounded 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.820
 enemies are still there two or three other art 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.920
 without that spoil the pelt 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.600
 Surely you will take a harp with damage 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.210
 it turns out to be this 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.820
 decision where about this one could find out 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.890
 but nowhere if you do not advance this 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.050
 ask in google if you are on 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.120
 forums do not read all these topics only 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.980
 in this case, everything will be clear on 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.350
 courtyard which is almost 96 developers 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.980
 promised to fix all these names lbz 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:08.710
 WHO and now there lasts with patch 95 but so 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.320
 at least I have the joy I exult, I 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.970
 broke through the whole battle stood nothing 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.330
 did just waiting for such a moment 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.160
 when the road is clear when the light is green 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.650
 ahead when here they are three my poop 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.140
 brown squares remains at least 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.150
 one bullet each plant and already there 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.460
 no matter you can kill again I repeat 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.250
 kill them completely but at least 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.110
 one bullet in each in the garden for my 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.270
 lbz had to do it with two 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.729
 artami but it is with three times so here 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.250
 many yes and then I repeat to 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:41.770
 at least provide yourself with arp in 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.440
 this team is already concerned for lbz 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.270
 higher-level tanks there 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.710
 must be with him in the platoon 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.229
 necessarily at least two arts 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.880
 because to get into a fight where them at least 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.140
 three 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.750
 never thought it would be for me 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.910
 problem but it turns out pretty 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.580
 big problem so you know 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.620
 here to perform lbz need 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.530
 so rally in platoons 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.290
 so play team play them 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.710
 the ability of each other that while all 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:13.960
 represent three team members 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.419
 completely drop out of battle only for 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.419
 the fact that they all do each other 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:21.580
 forehead for it of course u before it is nonsense 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:24.940
 so crazy enough not only in 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.040
 definitions nonsense so also generally in 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.530
 that the team is definitely not about 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.680
 victory comes with such players here 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.990
 which all the base of the brain 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.910
 chronic it is quite a problem but not 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.010
 less on the other 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:40.140
 I want to get a reward myself 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.770
 the process is kinda cool at all 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.300
 levels 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.970
 except probably light tanks and 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.550
 artillery adore honest foreheads went to 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:50.070
 slab on medium tanks with straps they are not 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.140
 cause some kind of here's a heart of 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.600
 crazy no they are quite a funny 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.720
 but on light tanks for me, it 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.710
 such a nightmare turned out to be just gloom if 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.900
 would not lbz 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.250
 would never sit behind light tanks like 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.230
 I would just sit down to finish 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.630
 never sit on a light tank 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:09.180
 God forbid, but nevertheless in this 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.280
 nothing will happen on top of the battle 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.860
 victory will be around the corner 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.380
 well really i didn’t fulfill the conditions here 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.480
 excellent performance in battle did not survive yes and 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.050
 God bless him with the other hand I suppose all 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.330
 survived 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.610
 after all, pour everything into the gadyushnik themselves 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:26.190
 allies of these squares rush them 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:29.100
 cover rescue survive there just 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.540
 unreal it lbz as I should not 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.430
 just rename me completely 

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:35.070
 throw out of the game forget about him and and 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:38.700
 generally burn all the sheets of paper where they are 

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:40.770
 once these conditions were written but 

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.490
 on this i have everyone thanks for today 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.980
 what looked 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:46.190
 be armed and warned by them 

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.970
 regarding 7 albazino light tanks 

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:51.170
 subscribe to my channel to new 

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.170
 See you all for now
