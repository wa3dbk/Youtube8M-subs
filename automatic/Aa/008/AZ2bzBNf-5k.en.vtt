00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.950
 In herself 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.640
 hello everyone I'm killer scorpion and 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.980
 I want to give you warm welcome 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.290
 to this tutorial more or less brief and I say 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.480
 which is short because that's the way it is if the video 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.579
 it will be extended so much is by the 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.710
 show of the game that I will put to them 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.410
 end to confirm that if it works 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.540
 good good today I will teach you to 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.210
 you to get the sonic adventure 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.980
 of the former for this the first thing they have 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.080
 what to do is go to the description of 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.360
 this video and click on one of the links 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.460
 that I will leave the game there I have uploaded 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.830
 by four mega saredi so there's no 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.310
 pretext not to download the game x of 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.890
 one thing the file weighs over 700 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.020
 therefore megabytes depending on your 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.460
 Internet can take 10 or 20 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.860
 minutes up to four hours for 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.930
 download it also advised that the 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.670
 file keep it on your desktop so 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.549
 faster access to it as soon as 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.680
 finish your download as soon as you have 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.100
 the game we go to the location of the 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.100
 archive 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.719
 they will see that they have downloaded a file 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.210
 of rar format with the name of the game 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.399
 click the secondary button to the 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.780
 file and then click where 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.780
 says extract here 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.619
 Now we wait for the extraction of 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.039
 files this can take from 1 to 5 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.039
 minutes 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.920
 you will notice that thanks to the extraction 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.470
 appeared a folder and a document of 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.600
 basically the important text is the 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.190
 folder but I'll tell you quickly that the 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.840
 text document contains a 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.270
 thanks from me for having 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.700
 downloaded the files open the folder 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.890
 really this game does not need 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.470
 installation so if you want to already play 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.360
 you can do it in this part of the video 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.550
 I will show you how you can change the 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.709
 size of the game screen since 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.840
 the keys to enter will not help us 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.120
 this time x of ok 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.490
 as soon as you have the game by default it 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.590
 will open in a window not so small xdddd 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.900
 but if you want to have the game 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.989
 in full screen you should do what 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.280
 next inside the folder 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.860
 we will find a document that is called 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.870
 sony the x this document contains the 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.580
 configuration options and we can 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.290
 open as if it were any other 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.290
 file by double clicking 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.120
 inside the document we look for the line 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.010
 that says screen size equal 1 if you want 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.070
 play the game and see it in all the 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.200
 screen we change the 1 for the 0 though 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.690
 I personally prefer to play it in 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.600
 window xd so I'll put the 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.670
 1 when they close the notebook, they do not know 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.410
 forget to accept the changes that have 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.620
 made to be applied from 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:28.900
 now xd and now if you already open the game 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.900
 to check that if xdddd works 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.270
 As always, do not expect me to go too 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.890
 fast I have so many shits that 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.890
 forward this xd 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.549
 so maybe you also get them 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.920
 a saved game does not really have 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:58.010
 no progress xd so if they want 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.139
 they can erase it maybe they ask for 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.329
 what got me into options the answer is 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:04.340
 very simple I want to show you 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.469
 that the game comes in the languages â€‹â€‹of 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.659
 English and Japanese like any other 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:10.639
 sonic adventure and as well as any 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:13.459
 another copy of this game comes with 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:16.370
 subtitles in Spanish English and so on 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.470
 etcetera really I prefer to put it 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.750
 completely in English both the 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.849

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.880
