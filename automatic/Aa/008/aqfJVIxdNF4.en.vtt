with<00:00:03.689> Chris<00:00:03.990> against<00:00:04.380> Chris<00:00:04.830> that<00:00:05.009> was<00:00:05.040> a

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:05.299 
with Chris against Chris that was a

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:07.280 
with Chris against Chris that was a
statement<00:00:06.299> game<00:00:06.569> I<00:00:06.720> think<00:00:06.870> that<00:00:07.140> was<00:00:07.259> the

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
statement game I think that was the

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.720 
statement game I think that was the
thinking<00:00:07.560> of<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.799> lot<00:00:07.919> of<00:00:08.010> people<00:00:08.160> coming<00:00:08.580> into

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
thinking of a lot of people coming into

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.520 
thinking of a lot of people coming into
it<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.450> could<00:00:09.570> be<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.719> statement<00:00:10.139> game<00:00:10.170> for

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
it that it could be a statement game for

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.280 
it that it could be a statement game for
you<00:00:10.590> what<00:00:10.769> statement<00:00:11.250> did<00:00:11.340> you<00:00:11.429> make<00:00:11.610> uh<00:00:12.290> we

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
you what statement did you make uh we

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.129 
you what statement did you make uh we
can<00:00:13.410> score<00:00:14.030> I<00:00:15.030> got<00:00:15.509> shot<00:00:15.690> out<00:00:15.719> three<00:00:15.990> times

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
can score I got shot out three times

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.439 
can score I got shot out three times
already<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.529> year<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.760> don't<00:00:18.180> think<00:00:18.390> we

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
already this year and I don't think we

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.670 
already this year and I don't think we
would<00:00:18.539> like<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.720> spread<00:00:19.109> those<00:00:19.260> goals<00:00:19.500> out

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
would like to spread those goals out

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.370 
would like to spread those goals out
over<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> couple<00:00:20.520> more<00:00:20.670> games<00:00:20.789> but<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.869> think

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
over a couple more games but I think

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.560 
over a couple more games but I think
