00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.410
 you need to make pâté at home because it is not 

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:08.200
 necessary because they sell delicious pates 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.139
 and the lifelong pâté that to me 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.780
 love it but with this we get 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.639
 apart from doing it from the ingredients 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.920
 that we like more then give us the 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.170
 I like to see how simple it is 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.269
 is to know what it takes to be able 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.960
 change one ingredient for another in order 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:28.630
 today say chicken and chicken breast data 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.800
 chicken, I'm going to show you the rest of 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.470
 ingredients that you are going to see that are 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.320
 super 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.100
 easy and also the recipe is super 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.280
 super easy first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.790
 clean the livers and leave them a couple 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.430
 of hours in the milk that carries a leaf 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.480
 of laurel a little salt two grains 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.090
 of white pepper 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.650
 pâté usually takes butter I 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.309
 I preferred to make a combination between 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.470
 Iberian lard and butter 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.500
 torradas made in the oven for 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.340
 accompany white wine and then we will 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.520
 cover with a jelly jiménez jelly 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:13.080
 and good to make gelatin a one 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.820
 neutral jelly leaf el pedro ximénez 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.830
 if you want you can add it to the pâté 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.409
 many liver pate recipes 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.350
 chicken I give a little to my taste and 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.210
 I've tried it and it 's rich indeed 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.729
 the pâté I have it in the fridge for 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.340
 can teach it let's start 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.929
 cleaning the city and cough 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.929
 let's finish cleaning this 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:44.110
 and this is what we are going to put in 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.110
 milk I'm going to leave it a couple of hours 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.020
 do not 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.860
 this in the fridge a couple of hours and 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.860
 we return with the recipe 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.929
 we are a couple of tablespoons of oil 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.539
 olive and let's sauté the breast of 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.009
 chicken and the livers here you have the 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.200
 higaditos after a couple of hours in 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.200
 the fridge and let's drain the milk 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:21.030
 let's add salt to the good lettuce 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.720
 we made all the salt the pepper and 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.720
 to the mess 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.310
 2 phil addicts do not need to chop the 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.310
 because then we are going to venture 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.000
 the wine 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.410
 come to do with it 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.870
 while this is reducing we are going to 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.090
 prepare the gelatin because as it takes 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.819
 in clarifying so we have half warm 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.300
 first the sheet is that you have to 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.300
 betray the 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.300
 we leave it for about 5 minutes let's put 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.260
 so that you hydrate everything well and there 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.420
 we leave it 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.670
 the pedro ximénez you already know sweet wine 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.170
 Cordovan great for making sauces 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.170
 reductions as we have ever seen 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.260
 when it breaks to boil, we throw the 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.370
 gelatin drained lost takes a 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.010
 minute and we have it ready 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.599
 in search of the lost gelatin to see if 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.270
 it's transparent the water is also 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:51.290
 transparent and if I do not find it 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.290
 See how it looks 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:00.970
 I forget it now in 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.810
 and nothing a minute stirring so that 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.810
 undo the gelatine well 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:11.380
 you can use neutral powder gelatine 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.870
 I like the fish tail better or the 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.060
 gelatin sheet more than gelatin in 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.260
 dust but good 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.600
 or it would also serve 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.080
 perfect this we already have it we'll leave it 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:29.000
 go out and cool down a bit the ideal is 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:32.240
 make the pate and let it cool 23 hours 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.510
 in the fridge and then make the jello and 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.360
 add sela as we do not have time then 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.090
 let's cool down the paté a little 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.350
 freezer 5 minutes 10 minutillos and you 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.350
 we will add the gelatine little by little 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.729
 you do not need to buy the robot 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.889
 to crush the one that I did when I 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.400
 I bought everything and it's the only thing 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:58.039
 I have is the only thing that shreds so 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.410
 As you can see, the wine has practically 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.990
 evaporated everything we remove the sheet from 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.080
 laurel 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.650
 and well the little wine that remains 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.650
 to withdraw 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:19.050
 and here we add butter and 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.860
 butter and we give it four laps 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.490
 until it melts 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.990
 and then all this to the chopper and now 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.310
 we have the paper if it has no more 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.500
 mystery you have already seen that we have 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.389
 done nothing ten minutes in rigorous 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.699
 direct good a direct fake that you 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:37.360
 they call the pate you know what they say 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:41.610
 many calories is to say that I do not 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.610
 protestes I promise a salad 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.860
 we let cool at room temperature and 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:05.280
 to the fridge to solidify now as 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.230
 you see is 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.280
 soft 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:13.770
 Once cold prepare the gelatin and 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.240
 we return to refrigerate a couple of hours and 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.240
 the result taught us 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:29.389
 we do not have here web does not fall and toast 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.620
 of bread you can buy I like 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.090
 because you put them in the oven three 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:37.150
 minutes on each side and left 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.150
 stupendous paper texture
