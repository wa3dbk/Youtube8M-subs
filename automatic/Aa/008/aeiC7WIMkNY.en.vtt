00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.230
 ajax and the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.700
 away match against ado den haag and in 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.469
 the hague has to do without the farmers 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.940
 his left back nicolai boilesen 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.190
 the denis in any case the next 10 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.270
 weeks old with a knee injury and all 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.189
 Probability will Nick Viergever 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.840
 take his place 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.640
 Viergever will mainly be up in recent weeks 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.930
 the spare bank and now has to work 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.410
 if you know you knew you are then 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.340
 what what then relaxed and then 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.930
 just happens then is not 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.710
 the litter preparation simply different 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.030
 then what i say relaxed and now you know 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.150
 that you are in the container from the beginning 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.710
 must and then yes then the photos are full 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.660
 real full to percent 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.820
 second ready for course you have to 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.190
 are autoclaves and certainly those you bet on 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.410
 everyone still playing so that's good 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.120
 and can train well today 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.059
 it only complaints but that is virtually 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.470
 gone and yes with a woman for the injury 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.040
 van boilers is hard at the 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.350
 selection 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.879
 it's a loss for the team 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.950
 of course also an opportunity for others 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.869
 as for nick celebrity 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.880
 so he spent the last weeks mainly on 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.140
 the bank but now has to play again 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.310
 that is really a lot of pain and it 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.020
 saying very acid is an important one 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.310
 player also for 10 enters his 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.800
 all the code already said 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.470
 So now you need one to get your other up 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.979
 and so the opportunity for me to join 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.750
 to play 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.820
 so you don't have to grab it at the bank 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.770
 likes there is one that is now pair 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.180
 matches happen and the bar anyway 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.190
 huge that you don't bring your own 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.649
 can do and that is nothing for a football 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.420
 and play football and they wanted 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.430
 training sessions are fun though 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.429
 games I really feel if I 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.240
 you feel rewarded and that 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.039
 gives a good feeling 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.899
 and I want that late in the coming weeks 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.940
 see Viergever was the captain of 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.649
 az not go to ajax with the idea that he 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.660
 would end up on the couch but then that 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.610
 yet the defender looked quickly 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.819
 forward again and I converted the button 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.340
 Nick's chance is coming again and that 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.170
 comes naturally 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.420
 by little things that you have a good cupboard 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.609
 and yes that is now that is more now 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.689
 come so that's good 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:02.460
 it looks like you are in everyone now 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.069
 case can focus on a position 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.450
 that will be nice in the coming months 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:09.509
 yes that's nice of course you know 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.400
 where am I then it is there for 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.640
 that you can play in the middle of fun 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:19.260
 that is now again shown that the 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.330
 left back position yes not fully occupied 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.060
 is so then there may lie there 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.200
 may be but you now know that you do 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.910
 she must aim there 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.579
 the duel with ado is important because at 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.470
 profit language right pressure on psv on side 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:34.200
 play until Tuesday against Feyenoord so 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.319
 if ajax wins, the team is the leader 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.060
 now have to put down that to the 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.950
 winter with good results 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.140
 up and play points must be the gap 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.450
 to make psv just smaller for sure 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.739
 certainly not bigger so feyenoord is 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.930
 also normally short behind as a feyenoord 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.349
 does psv win than city that also at 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.450
 Twente also think it is now between 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.379
 those four clubs and we are in the right place 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.180
 a 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.099
 yes we must stay there and 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.409
 so we were in first place as quickly as possible 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.219
 yes we are keen on 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.219
 to move up a spot
