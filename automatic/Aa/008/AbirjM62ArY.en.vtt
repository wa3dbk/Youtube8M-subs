00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
scratch set up what we have here is a

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.520 
scratch set up what we have here is a
vestax<00:00:29.199> pdx<00:00:30.029> 2000<00:00:31.029> pretty<00:00:31.449> all<00:00:31.720> deck<00:00:32.050> now<00:00:32.259> I've

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:32.530 
vestax pdx 2000 pretty all deck now I've

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.770 
vestax pdx 2000 pretty all deck now I've
had<00:00:32.950> it<00:00:33.070> for<00:00:33.220> a<00:00:33.250> while<00:00:33.340> and<00:00:33.610> most<00:00:34.270> basic

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
had it for a while and most basic

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.800 
had it for a while and most basic
scratch<00:00:35.650> setups<00:00:36.330> vertically<00:00:37.330> so<00:00:37.630> you<00:00:37.690> have

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
scratch setups vertically so you have

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.990 
scratch setups vertically so you have
your<00:00:37.870> decks<00:00:38.520> vertically<00:00:39.520> as<00:00:39.610> opposed<00:00:39.880> to

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
your decks vertically as opposed to

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.700 
your decks vertically as opposed to
horizontally<00:00:40.630> although<00:00:41.110> it's<00:00:41.230> not<00:00:41.410> strictly

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
horizontally although it's not strictly

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.560 
horizontally although it's not strictly
necessary<00:00:42.040> it<00:00:42.670> does<00:00:42.850> give<00:00:43.030> you<00:00:43.150> a<00:00:43.180> little<00:00:43.330> bit

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
necessary it does give you a little bit

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.710 
necessary it does give you a little bit
of<00:00:44.160> an<00:00:45.160> easier<00:00:45.550> access<00:00:45.730> to<00:00:46.000> the<00:00:46.300> record

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
of an easier access to the record

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.680 
of an easier access to the record
without<00:00:47.140> knocking<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.400> needle<00:00:48.820> and<00:00:48.970> also<00:00:49.630> you

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
without knocking the needle and also you

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.300 
without knocking the needle and also you
have<00:00:49.990> the<00:00:50.020> power<00:00:50.380> button<00:00:50.590> right<00:00:50.860> here<00:00:50.890> and

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.310 
have the power button right here and

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.610 
have the power button right here and
things<00:00:51.790> are<00:00:51.940> pretty<00:00:52.060> much<00:00:52.210> better<00:00:53.140> to<00:00:53.380> hand

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
things are pretty much better to hand

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.220 
things are pretty much better to hand

is<00:01:59.260> a<00:01:59.350> baby<00:01:59.950> scratch<00:02:00.250> so<00:02:00.640> let<00:02:00.760> me<00:02:00.790> find<00:02:01.090> a<00:02:01.210> nice

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
is a baby scratch so let me find a nice

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.730 
is a baby scratch so let me find a nice
sample<00:02:01.630> for<00:02:01.930> us<00:02:02.020> I<00:02:02.400> will<00:02:03.400> eliminate<00:02:03.700> you<00:02:04.119> I

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
sample for us I will eliminate you I

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.980 
sample for us I will eliminate you I
will<00:02:05.740> eliminate<00:02:06.070> you<00:02:06.450> yeah<00:02:07.450> that<00:02:07.659> sounds

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
will eliminate you yeah that sounds

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.979 
will eliminate you yeah that sounds
really<00:02:08.259> like<00:02:08.469> like<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:08.979> scratch<00:02:09.340> tg1<00:02:09.819> would<00:02:10.749> use

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
really like like a scratch tg1 would use

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.660 
really like like a scratch tg1 would use
that<00:02:11.200> so<00:02:11.499> what<00:02:11.889> we're<00:02:12.010> going<00:02:12.099> to<00:02:12.189> do<00:02:12.340> is<00:02:12.489> just

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
that so what we're going to do is just

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.209 
that so what we're going to do is just
basically<00:02:13.420> move<00:02:13.749> the

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:14.219 
basically move the

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:38.459 
basically move the
from<00:02:15.219> 12<00:02:15.519> to<00:02:15.700> one<00:02:15.879> o'clock<00:02:17.519> like<00:02:18.519> this<00:02:37.469> what

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:38.469 
from 12 to one o'clock like this what

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.259 
from 12 to one o'clock like this what
we're<00:02:38.680> really<00:02:38.920> comes<00:02:39.159> into<00:02:39.340> his<00:02:39.519> own<00:02:39.760> is<00:02:40.060> where

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
we're really comes into his own is where

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.729 
we're really comes into his own is where
the<00:02:40.359> beats<00:02:40.540> all<00:02:40.780> gonna<00:02:41.019> get<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.230> bit<00:02:41.409> rocket

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
the beats all gonna get a bit rocket

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:48.040 
the beats all gonna get a bit rocket
here

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:03:03.070 

I<00:03:00.100> will<00:03:01.100> eliminate<00:03:01.430> you<00:03:01.870> but<00:03:02.870> basically

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
I will eliminate you but basically

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.000 
I will eliminate you but basically
that's<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.560> baby<00:03:03.770> scratch<00:03:04.100> really<00:03:04.550> simple

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
that's the baby scratch really simple

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.320 
that's the baby scratch really simple
that<00:03:07.010> beat<00:03:07.220> was<00:03:07.340> by<00:03:07.490> motion<00:03:07.910> man<00:03:08.030> by<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.240> way

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
that beat was by motion man by the way

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.960 
that beat was by motion man by the way
cochlea<00:03:08.840> door<00:03:09.050> and<00:03:09.460> so<00:03:10.460> we're<00:03:10.670> going<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:10.850> move

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
cochlea door and so we're going to move

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.880 
cochlea door and so we're going to move
on<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.150> a<00:03:11.510> more<00:03:11.540> advanced<00:03:12.170> scratch<00:03:12.500> this<00:03:12.740> is

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
on to a more advanced scratch this is

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.710 
on to a more advanced scratch this is
using<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.370> cross<00:03:13.580> fader<00:03:13.880> itself<00:03:14.420> or

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
using the cross fader itself or

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.720 
using the cross fader itself or
alternatively<00:03:15.650> you<00:03:15.800> can<00:03:15.890> use<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.160> up<00:03:16.280> theater

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
alternatively you can use the up theater

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.700 
alternatively you can use the up theater
you<00:03:17.120> can<00:03:17.240> also<00:03:17.390> use<00:03:17.570> the<00:03:17.690> line<00:03:17.900> switch<00:03:18.290> if

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
you can also use the line switch if

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.320 
you can also use the line switch if
you're<00:03:19.040> more<00:03:19.160> adventurous<00:03:19.610> user<00:03:19.940> reverse

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
you're more adventurous user reverse

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.450 
you're more adventurous user reverse
button<00:03:20.690> hamster<00:03:21.500> switch<00:03:21.710> basically<00:03:22.280> anything

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
button hamster switch basically anything

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.700 
button hamster switch basically anything
that<00:03:22.610> turns<00:03:22.910> it<00:03:23.120> off<00:03:23.270> for<00:03:23.930> this<00:03:24.050> cutting

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
that turns it off for this cutting

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.810 
that turns it off for this cutting

like jazzy jeff and DJ aladdin baby
scratch<00:03:31.760> pioneered<00:03:32.270> by<00:03:32.560> Grand<00:03:33.560> Wizard

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
scratch pioneered by Grand Wizard

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.220 
scratch pioneered by Grand Wizard
Theodore<00:03:34.250> when<00:03:34.940> in<00:03:35.150> his<00:03:35.300> bedroom<00:03:35.540> is<00:03:35.930> mother

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
Theodore when in his bedroom is mother

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.230 
Theodore when in his bedroom is mother
caught<00:03:36.500> him<00:03:36.700> telling<00:03:37.700> him<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:37.910> turn<00:03:38.060> his

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
caught him telling him to turn his

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.600 
caught him telling him to turn his
mixing<00:03:39.050> down<00:03:39.230> and<00:03:39.530> he<00:03:39.920> had<00:03:40.010> a<00:03:40.040> hold<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.430> record

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
mixing down and he had a hold the record

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.220 
mixing down and he had a hold the record
slightly<00:03:41.150> moving<00:03:41.390> backwards<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:41.870> forwards

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
slightly moving backwards and forwards

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.660 
slightly moving backwards and forwards
and<00:03:42.350> thought<00:03:42.590> yeah<00:03:43.130> that's<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.370> pretty<00:03:43.520> good

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
and thought yeah that's a pretty good

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.340 
and thought yeah that's a pretty good
idea<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:44.150> developed<00:03:44.540> it<00:03:44.630> from<00:03:44.780> this<00:03:44.960> or<00:03:45.200> a

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
idea and developed it from this or a

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.020 
idea and developed it from this or a
little<00:03:46.040> bit<00:03:46.130> of<00:03:46.190> background<00:03:46.340> there<00:03:46.670> anyway

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
little bit of background there anyway

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.300 
little bit of background there anyway
gonna<00:03:47.420> get<00:03:47.540> on<00:03:47.690> to<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:47.840> coin<00:03:48.080> so<00:03:48.680> we're<00:03:49.190> going

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
gonna get on to the coin so we're going

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.830 
gonna get on to the coin so we're going
to<00:03:49.400> find<00:03:49.550> ourselves<00:03:49.670> another<00:03:49.970> nice<00:03:50.540> sample

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
to find ourselves another nice sample

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.610 
to find ourselves another nice sample
baby<00:03:51.470> worthy<00:03:55.270> so<00:03:56.270> there<00:03:56.390> we<00:03:56.510> have<00:03:56.540> it<00:03:56.690> from<00:03:57.170> one

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
baby worthy so there we have it from one

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.610 
baby worthy so there we have it from one
o'clock<00:03:57.950> two<00:03:58.160> three<00:03:58.760> o'clock<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:03.290> record

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
o'clock two three o'clock the record

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.949 
o'clock two three o'clock the record
says<00:04:03.650> hey<00:04:04.070> so<00:04:04.640> what<00:04:05.030> gonna<00:04:05.209> do<00:04:05.390> is<00:04:05.570> we're<00:04:05.870> going

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
says hey so what gonna do is we're going

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.270 
says hey so what gonna do is we're going
to<00:04:06.050> cut<00:04:06.260> out<00:04:06.290> that<00:04:06.410> buck<00:04:06.739> noise<00:04:06.950> we<00:04:07.190> were

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
to cut out that buck noise we were

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.040 
to cut out that buck noise we were
hearing<00:04:07.489> with<00:04:07.640> a<00:04:07.700> baby<00:04:07.970> scratch<00:04:10.870> see<00:04:11.870> that

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
hearing with a baby scratch see that

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.690 
hearing with a baby scratch see that
we're<00:04:12.230> on<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.890> way<00:04:12.980> back<00:04:13.160> we're<00:04:13.340> gonna<00:04:13.400> cut

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
we're on the way back we're gonna cut

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.580 
we're on the way back we're gonna cut
that<00:04:13.820> out<00:04:13.880> with<00:04:14.180> a<00:04:14.209> crossfader<00:04:14.750> or<00:04:15.020> Fiat<00:04:15.530> or

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
that out with a crossfader or Fiat or

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.289 
that out with a crossfader or Fiat or
whatever<00:04:15.830> you<00:04:15.920> use<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.280> use<00:04:16.489> my<00:04:16.850> cross<00:04:17.090> fader

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
whatever you use I use my cross fader

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.210 
whatever you use I use my cross fader
hamster<00:04:17.780> style<00:04:18.020> so<00:04:18.320> that's<00:04:18.470> like<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.890> reverse

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
hamster style so that's like the reverse

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.010 
hamster style so that's like the reverse
of<00:04:19.430> what<00:04:19.549> you<00:04:19.700> would<00:04:19.790> normally<00:04:19.940> use<00:04:20.120> but<00:04:20.900> it

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
of what you would normally use but it

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.150 
of what you would normally use but it
doesn't<00:04:21.320> really<00:04:21.380> matter<00:04:21.590> it's<00:04:21.739> just<00:04:21.859> whatever

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
doesn't really matter it's just whatever

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.670 
doesn't really matter it's just whatever
you<00:04:22.310> get<00:04:22.460> used<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.760> so<00:04:23.720> let's<00:04:24.080> check<00:04:24.260> you<00:04:24.530> can

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
you get used to so let's check you can

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:43.150 
you get used to so let's check you can
check<00:04:24.860> out<00:04:24.919> a<00:04:25.190> cookie<00:04:41.770> so<00:04:42.770> now<00:04:42.860> we're<00:04:42.980> going<00:04:43.100> to

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
check out a cookie so now we're going to
