00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
nice walk through the chasm I growing

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:08.200 
nice walk through the chasm I growing
every<00:01:00.270> mob<00:01:00.480> known<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.840> man<00:01:01.020> onto<00:01:01.410> your<00:01:01.530> back

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.120 

and<00:01:09.210> maybe<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:09.990> need<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> few<00:01:10.710> more<00:01:10.890> mobs

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
and maybe we just need a few more mobs

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.510 
and maybe we just need a few more mobs
possibly<00:01:12.020> in<00:01:13.020> order<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.500> show<00:01:13.830> how<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.070> area

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
possibly in order to show how the area

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.109 
possibly in order to show how the area
looting<00:01:15.060> works<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:19.490> I<00:01:20.490> believe<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.909> only

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
looting works and I believe this only

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.999 
looting works and I believe this only
works<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.570> looting<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.110> free<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:22.619> all<00:01:22.770> or

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
works if the looting is free for all or

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.640 
works if the looting is free for all or
if<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> loot<00:01:23.549> on<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.360> mobs<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.869> assigned<00:01:25.350> to

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
if the loot on the mobs is assigned to

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.149 
if the loot on the mobs is assigned to
you<00:01:26.119> so<00:01:27.119> here<00:01:27.840> we're<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.080> going<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.409> swipe
