real<00:03:19.459> aircraft<00:03:19.700> so<00:03:20.620> even<00:03:21.620> though<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:22.160> yeah

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
real aircraft so even though the yeah

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.369 
real aircraft so even though the yeah
the<00:03:22.760> silver<00:03:23.120> paint<00:03:23.480> just<00:03:23.750> represents

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
the silver paint just represents

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:25.809 
the silver paint just represents
polished<00:03:24.830> metal<00:03:25.160> okay<00:03:25.400> so<00:03:25.459> on<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:25.700> real

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
polished metal okay so on the real

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.280 
polished metal okay so on the real
aircraft<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:26.390> wasn't<00:03:26.630> silver<00:03:26.840> paint<00:03:27.050> it<00:03:27.170> was

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
aircraft it wasn't silver paint it was

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.850 
aircraft it wasn't silver paint it was
actual<00:03:27.860> bare<00:03:28.220> metal<00:03:28.870> yes<00:03:29.870> so<00:03:30.290> then<00:03:30.560> you<00:03:30.680> have

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
actual bare metal yes so then you have

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
this is like the 80s in everything I

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.460 
this is like the 80s in everything I
think<00:03:43.160> you're<00:03:43.280> not<00:03:43.370> mistaken<00:03:44.170> you<00:03:45.170> have<00:03:45.200> the

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
think you're not mistaken you have the

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.250 
think you're not mistaken you have the
left<00:03:45.650> engine<00:03:46.099> right<00:03:46.250> there<00:03:46.459> which<00:03:46.610> is<00:03:46.760> a<00:03:47.260> CFM

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
left engine right there which is a CFM

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:56.530 
left engine right there which is a CFM
engine<00:03:49.390> you<00:03:50.390> have<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.599> left<00:03:50.810> wing<00:03:51.140> and<00:03:55.540> tail

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
engine you have the left wing and tail

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.809 
engine you have the left wing and tail
section<00:03:57.130> now<00:03:58.130> you<00:03:58.190> see<00:03:58.370> there<00:03:58.519> right<00:03:58.610> there

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
section now you see there right there

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.620 
section now you see there right there
boeing<00:03:59.209> 757-300<00:04:00.140> ER<00:04:00.819> the<00:04:01.819> registration<00:04:02.480> once

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
boeing 757-300 ER the registration once

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.830 
boeing 757-300 ER the registration once
again<00:04:02.959> this<00:04:03.140> one<00:04:03.349> is<00:04:03.470> in<00:04:03.760> 984<00:04:04.760> am<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:05.420> i<00:04:05.660> guess

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
again this one is in 984 am and i guess

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.509 
again this one is in 984 am and i guess
it<00:04:05.959> in<00:04:06.079> the<00:04:06.200> in<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.799> meghana<00:04:07.220> aircraft<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.209> N

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
it in the in the meghana aircraft the N

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.069 
it in the in the meghana aircraft the N
makes<00:04:10.519> this<00:04:10.760> an<00:04:11.000> American<00:04:11.480> registered

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
makes this an American registered

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.780 
makes this an American registered
aircraft<00:04:12.260> so<00:04:12.860> again<00:04:13.069> I'm<00:04:13.220> assuming<00:04:13.340> that

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
aircraft so again I'm assuming that

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.349 
aircraft so again I'm assuming that
Avianca<00:04:14.389> least<00:04:15.380> this<00:04:15.829> aircraft<00:04:16.340> from<00:04:16.729> either
