that means is that the enemy did not

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.730 
that means is that the enemy did not
notice<00:01:56.490> right<00:01:57.299> away<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:58.380> was<00:01:58.530> shooting<00:01:58.770> it

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
there but that seemed to be

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.059 
there but that seemed to be
significantly<00:02:25.349> reducing<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.560> amount<00:02:26.800> of

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
significantly reducing the amount of

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.120 
significantly reducing the amount of
enemy<00:02:28.000> matchlock<00:02:28.360> educator<00:02:28.780> which<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.739> a<00:02:29.769> unit

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
enemy matchlock educator which is a unit

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.960 
enemy matchlock educator which is a unit
that<00:02:30.160> doesn't<00:02:30.550> have<00:02:30.819> much<00:02:31.680> defense<00:02:32.680> so<00:02:33.040> their

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
that doesn't have much defense so their

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.670 
that doesn't have much defense so their
number<00:02:34.330> is<00:02:34.620> significantly<00:02:35.620> reduced<00:02:37.500> at<00:02:38.500> the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
number is significantly reduced at the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.670 
number is significantly reduced at the
same<00:02:38.890> time<00:02:39.280> here<00:02:39.940> I<00:02:40.120> keep<00:02:40.510> my<00:02:40.750> formation<00:02:41.200> and

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
same time here I keep my formation and

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.289 
same time here I keep my formation and
the<00:02:41.830> fact<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.069> I<00:02:42.310> have<00:02:42.430> some<00:02:42.670> theories<00:02:42.850> some

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
the fact that I have some theories some

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:49.320 
the fact that I have some theories some
right<00:02:43.480> here<00:02:44.700> probably<00:02:46.080> would<00:02:48.150> reduce<00:02:49.150> the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
right here probably would reduce the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.270 
right here probably would reduce the
chance<00:02:49.569> of<00:02:49.750> being<00:02:50.049> attacked<00:02:50.230> by<00:02:50.590> covering<00:02:50.950> on

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
chance of being attacked by covering on

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.100 
chance of being attacked by covering on
the<00:02:51.310> right<00:02:51.700> side<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:54.100> my<00:02:54.489> bowmen<00:02:55.269> are<00:02:55.450> shooting

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
the right side so my bowmen are shooting

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.759 
the right side so my bowmen are shooting
the<00:02:56.200> enemy<00:02:56.560> now<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.040> enemy<00:02:57.400> is<00:02:57.549> moving<00:02:58.180> I'm

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
the enemy now the enemy is moving I'm

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.970 
the enemy now the enemy is moving I'm
changing<00:02:59.769> my<00:02:59.799> formation<00:03:00.400> here<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:02.260> face<00:03:02.500> an

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
changing my formation here to face an

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.940 
changing my formation here to face an
advance<00:03:03.790> which<00:03:04.000> comes<00:03:04.299> mostly<00:03:05.109> from<00:03:05.230> that

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
advance which comes mostly from that

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.729 
advance which comes mostly from that
side<00:03:06.540> some<00:03:07.540> time<00:03:07.720> here<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:08.019> have<00:03:08.200> some<00:03:08.290> very

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
side some time here I have some very

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.460 
side some time here I have some very
summery<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:09.730> now<00:03:10.329> the<00:03:10.390> enemy<00:03:10.780> cavalry<00:03:11.079> is

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
summery and now the enemy cavalry is

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.620 
summery and now the enemy cavalry is
actually<00:03:11.950> appearing<00:03:12.340> front<00:03:12.970> of<00:03:13.120> my<00:03:13.239> trips

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
actually appearing front of my trips

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.729 
actually appearing front of my trips
here<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:15.280> my<00:03:15.579> Yuri<00:03:16.359> samurai<00:03:17.140> are<00:03:17.530> engaging<00:03:17.980> and

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
here so my Yuri samurai are engaging and

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.979 
here so my Yuri samurai are engaging and
the<00:03:20.739> enemy<00:03:21.130> cover<00:03:21.340> was<00:03:21.670> actually<00:03:22.090> welcomed<00:03:22.540> by

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
the enemy cover was actually welcomed by

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.319 
the enemy cover was actually welcomed by
my<00:03:23.440> match<00:03:23.680> up<00:03:23.920> units<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:24.790> can<00:03:24.970> see<00:03:25.150> that

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
my match up units and you can see that

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.860 
my match up units and you can see that
they<00:03:25.480> didn't<00:03:25.810> manage<00:03:26.079> to<00:03:26.109> kill<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.530> few<00:03:26.940> so<00:03:27.940> that

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
they didn't manage to kill a few so that

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.210 
they didn't manage to kill a few so that
was<00:03:29.170> a<00:03:29.200> very<00:03:29.620> effective<00:03:29.980> way<00:03:30.130> to

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
was a very effective way to

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.200 
was a very effective way to
it<00:03:33.030> tries<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.600> enemy<00:03:33.840> flanking<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:35.210> same

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
it tries the enemy flanking the same

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.180

shooting me but they have a slow rate of
fire<00:05:07.389> so<00:05:08.080> I<00:05:08.260> don't<00:05:08.650> lose<00:05:08.889> much<00:05:09.250> from<00:05:09.550> that<00:05:09.960> and

attached that's MRI but it's probably

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.290 
attached that's MRI but it's probably
too<00:05:25.389> late<00:05:25.630> to<00:05:25.960> do<00:05:26.080> anything<00:05:26.530> anyway<00:05:27.060> and<00:05:28.060> I'm

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
too late to do anything anyway and I'm

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.620 
too late to do anything anyway and I'm
probably<00:05:28.510> too<00:05:28.900> busy<00:05:29.169> watching<00:05:29.500> over<00:05:29.979> here

that<00:05:31.630> the<00:05:31.840> enemy<00:05:31.960> are<00:05:32.380> playing<00:05:32.740> and<00:05:33.070> there<00:05:33.520> you

that the enemy are playing and there you

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.080 
that the enemy are playing and there you
go<00:05:33.729> close<00:05:34.300> victory<00:05:35.010> so<00:05:36.010> I<00:05:36.039> think<00:05:36.460> that's<00:05:36.880> a

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
go close victory so I think that's a

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.480 
go close victory so I think that's a
good<00:05:37.240> example<00:05:37.360> of<00:05:37.780> a<00:05:37.990> battle<00:05:38.740> where<00:05:39.100> you're

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
good example of a battle where you're

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.820 
good example of a battle where you're
actually<00:05:39.729> using<00:05:40.030> a<00:05:40.510> strategy<00:05:41.020> and<00:05:41.289> it<00:05:41.560> totally

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
actually using a strategy and it totally

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.120 
actually using a strategy and it totally
goes<00:05:42.130> as<00:05:42.580> you<00:05:42.610> plan<00:05:43.320> so<00:05:44.320> I<00:05:44.350> hope<00:05:44.530> you<00:05:44.830> enjoyed
