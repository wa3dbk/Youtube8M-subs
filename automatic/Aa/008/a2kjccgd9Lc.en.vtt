 outer leaves are very soft here and 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.890
 which can eaten safely 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.570

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.960

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:04.130
 Let's take the inner leaves out of that 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:09.259

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.890
 although you can eat the white because 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.110

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.950

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.440
 for filling the remaining then the 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:38.769
 we hunt so much we fill 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:40.840

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.430

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.430

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.300

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.729
 and china good 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:34.929
 that could be quiet and wait until the 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.169
 quietly collapsed 

00:04:34.929 --> 00:04:37.089
 is 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.419
 and then a nice mass 

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:39.419
 created 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.580
 fried at the inserts 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:51.300

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.300
 by the way speak 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.940
 and have to call a ferry by Porsche 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.589
 where I am 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.310
 if that is quite pleasantly slimmed down 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.450
 the cooling is already done and 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:31.190
 now the time has come 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:33.700
 probert in china tumble no one with 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.700
 a trowel 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.380
 now comes the beetle 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:59.819
 and the whole thing is going on with a bit 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.819
 green on 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.880
 now the whole thing comes in at 200 degrees 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.880
 the oven 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:24.169
