going to take your sewing machine and

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.690 
going to take your sewing machine and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
all you're going to do is you're going

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.030 
all you're going to do is you're going
to<00:01:50.820> stitch<00:01:51.119> around<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.500> can<00:01:52.680> use<00:01:52.829> either

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
to stitch around and you can use either

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.230 
to stitch around and you can use either
side<00:01:53.460> for<00:01:53.759> this

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.919 

around<00:01:57.500> for

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:12.880 

you're<00:02:03.929> going<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.380> turn<00:02:04.679> it<00:02:04.920> around

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.800 

and<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.040> stitch<00:02:14.340> around<00:02:14.519> again<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:17.599> I<00:02:18.599> really

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
and you stitch around again and I really

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.869 
and you stitch around again and I really
like<00:02:19.110> these<00:02:19.319> because<00:02:19.620> they<00:02:19.860> look<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.069> handmade

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
like these because they look so handmade

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.479 
like these because they look so handmade
in<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.330> wood<00:02:21.599> and<00:02:21.870> they're<00:02:22.080> totally<00:02:22.860> totally

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
in the wood and they're totally totally

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.729 
in the wood and they're totally totally
inexpensive<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.239> make<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:25.140> know<00:02:25.260> how<00:02:25.470> much

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
inexpensive to make you know how much

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:33.640 
inexpensive to make you know how much
many<00:02:26.370> others<00:02:26.879> are<00:02:27.060> very<00:02:27.390> expensive

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.680 

now<00:02:34.650> normally<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.640> would<00:02:36.060> stitch<00:02:36.269> around<00:02:36.390> this

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
now normally I would stitch around this

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.259 
now normally I would stitch around this
twice<00:02:37.080> but<00:02:37.950> since<00:02:38.400> we're<00:02:38.519> doing<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.760> video<00:02:38.909> and

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
twice but since we're doing a video and

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.330 
twice but since we're doing a video and
I<00:02:39.360> want<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.629> make<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.870> quick<00:02:40.230> I'm<00:02:41.010> just<00:02:41.129> going

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
I want to make it quick I'm just going

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.339 
I want to make it quick I'm just going
to<00:02:41.400> stitch<00:02:41.610> around<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:42.060> once<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:43.049> see<00:02:43.260> the

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
to stitch around it once and you see the

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.039 
to stitch around it once and you see the
stitching<00:02:43.769> here<00:02:44.010> now<00:02:44.640> here<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.239> stitch<00:02:45.870> around

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
stitching here now here I stitch around

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.050 
stitching here now here I stitch around
this<00:02:46.319> one<00:02:46.560> three<00:02:46.890> times<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.700> can<00:02:47.879> see<00:02:47.970> the

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
this one three times you can see the

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.850 
this one three times you can see the
three<00:02:48.269> stitches<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:49.260> made<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.560> kind<00:02:49.799> of

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
three stitches and I made it kind of

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.180 
three stitches and I made it kind of
wonky<00:02:50.040> because<00:02:50.489> I<00:02:50.580> wanted<00:02:50.849> it<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.090> be<00:02:51.209> that<00:02:51.390> way

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
wonky because I wanted it to be that way

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.559 
wonky because I wanted it to be that way
okay<00:02:53.190> so<00:02:53.459> after<00:02:53.610> you're<00:02:53.849> done<00:02:53.940> stitching<00:02:54.299> it

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
okay so after you're done stitching it

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.140 
okay so after you're done stitching it
around<00:02:55.129> you're<00:02:56.129> just<00:02:56.340> going<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:56.580> trim<00:02:56.790> off<00:02:56.849> the

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
around you're just going to trim off the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.220 
around you're just going to trim off the
rest<00:02:57.360> of<00:02:57.629> it<00:02:58.879> now<00:02:59.879> I<00:03:00.209> just<00:03:00.660> leave<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.019> like<00:03:01.049> that

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
rest of it now I just leave it like that

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.100 
rest of it now I just leave it like that
but<00:03:01.950> if<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.549> wanted<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.209> you<00:03:03.420> could<00:03:03.599> use<00:03:03.810> some

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
but if you wanted to you could use some

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.410 
but if you wanted to you could use some
drips<00:03:04.440> no<00:03:04.739> fray<00:03:05.099> on<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:05.879> it's<00:03:06.060> just<00:03:06.299> a

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
drips no fray on it and it's just a

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.970 
drips no fray on it and it's just a
clear<00:03:06.660> liquid<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:07.049> you<00:03:07.290> put<00:03:07.500> on<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:07.920> it

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
clear liquid that you put on it and it

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.430 
clear liquid that you put on it and it
would<00:03:08.099> keep<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.430> from<00:03:08.579> fraying<00:03:09.019> but<00:03:10.019> I<00:03:10.049> like

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
would keep it from fraying but I like

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.589 
would keep it from fraying but I like
the<00:03:10.470> homemade<00:03:11.340> kind<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:12.000> for<00:03:12.209> a<00:03:12.269> little<00:03:12.420> bit

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
the homemade kind of for a little bit

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.819 
the homemade kind of for a little bit
frayed<00:03:12.930> look<00:03:13.319> so<00:03:13.650> i<00:03:13.680> usually<00:03:13.980> leave<00:03:14.280> mine

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
and I covered the whole thing and I let

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.720 
and I covered the whole thing and I let
it<00:03:31.109> dry<00:03:31.319> and<00:03:31.620> then<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.890> cut<00:03:32.190> these<00:03:32.430> with

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
it dry and then I cut these with

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.030 
it dry and then I cut these with
mycricket<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.569> I<00:03:33.959> put<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.260> on<00:03:34.410> for<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.739> front

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
mycricket and I put it on for the front

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.430 
mycricket and I put it on for the front
and<00:03:35.310> then<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.760> made<00:03:36.090> four<00:03:36.420> pages<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:37.049> match<00:03:37.230> it

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
and then I made four pages that match it

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.589 
and then I made four pages that match it
to<00:03:37.470> go<00:03:37.709> inside<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.459> you<00:03:38.579> can<00:03:38.760> justify<00:03:39.030> am<00:03:39.329> just

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
to go inside and you can justify am just

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.440 
to go inside and you can justify am just
like<00:03:39.780> any<00:03:39.989> other<00:03:40.130> scrapbook<00:03:41.130> I<00:03:41.370> do<00:03:42.120> suggest

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
like any other scrapbook I do suggest

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.240 
like any other scrapbook I do suggest
you<00:03:42.720> use<00:03:42.810> liquid<00:03:43.079> adhesive<00:03:43.319> for<00:03:43.859> the<00:03:43.950> photos

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
you use liquid adhesive for the photos

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.110 
you use liquid adhesive for the photos
and<00:03:44.280> stuff<00:03:44.669> though<00:03:44.910> because<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.919> regular

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
and stuff though because the regular

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.580 
and stuff though because the regular
roller<00:03:48.120> adhesive<00:03:48.720> doesn't<00:03:49.019> quite<00:03:49.169> stick<00:03:49.440> to

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
roller adhesive doesn't quite stick to

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.009 
roller adhesive doesn't quite stick to
fabric<00:03:49.919> the<00:03:50.069> same<00:03:50.310> way<00:03:50.489> anyway<00:03:51.389> so<00:03:51.450> that's<00:03:51.810> my

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019
