00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.730
 period of hot summer and also tell about 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.980

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.930
 the suns must have a beautician each 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.540
 girls 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.970
 first we will look at the means 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.120
 which is protection from your skin and hair and 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.560
 from the summer sun and wind do not forget 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.560
 what face and body protection 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.840
 if you are the first time you go to the beach 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.650
 after a long winter I recommend such 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.140
 sunscreens like with at 50 or 30 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.870
 For face choose emulsions as they 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.860
 lighter and do not clog your pores in 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.129
 unlike creams 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.129
 I prefer sunscreen emulsion 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.129
 sagging 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.490
 she leaves no white marks 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.710
 my face with her does not shine also she 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.380
 serves as an excellent base for makeup 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.390
 if you need it in the city you can 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.580
 use the same sunscreen 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.580

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.800
 for a long time 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.800
 use oils to fix sunburn 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.080
 for example, such a butter from left-handed and 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.030
 oil is contraindicated to use over 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.010
 burning skin to soothe the skin 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.200
