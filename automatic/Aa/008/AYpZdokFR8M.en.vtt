hi guys today I'm going to talk to you
about<00:00:01.740> a<00:00:01.829> little<00:00:01.890> comparison<00:00:02.370> that<00:00:02.700> I've

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
about a little comparison that I've

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.970 
about a little comparison that I've
discovered<00:00:03.270> and<00:00:03.570> between<00:00:04.380> these<00:00:04.740> two

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
discovered and between these two

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.800 
discovered and between these two
products<00:00:05.339> we<00:00:05.460> have<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.670> MUA<00:00:06.000> intense<00:00:06.420> kisses

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
products we have the MUA intense kisses

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.290 
products we have the MUA intense kisses
gloss<00:00:07.319> high<00:00:07.740> intensity<00:00:08.189> gloss<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.639> then<00:00:09.120> the

gloss high intensity gloss and then the

gloss high intensity gloss and then the
Rimmel<00:00:09.599> apocalypse<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.349> in<00:00:10.469> my<00:00:10.650> opinion

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
Rimmel apocalypse and in my opinion

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.310 
Rimmel apocalypse and in my opinion
these<00:00:11.130> are<00:00:11.280> very<00:00:11.460> very<00:00:11.759> similar<00:00:12.210> products<00:00:12.960> now

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
these are very very similar products now

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.320 
these are very very similar products now
first<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.769> all<00:00:13.920> there<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.280> slightly<00:00:14.670> more<00:00:14.820> in

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
first of all there is slightly more in

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.779 
first of all there is slightly more in
the<00:00:15.450> MUA<00:00:15.690> anniversa<00:00:16.230> slightly<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.710> 5.1<00:00:17.490> mills

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
the MUA anniversa slightly is 5.1 mills

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.880 
the MUA anniversa slightly is 5.1 mills
in<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.150> anyway<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.779> there's<00:00:18.960> five<00:00:19.289> mills<00:00:19.650> in

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
in the anyway and there's five mills in

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.710 
in the anyway and there's five mills in
the<00:00:20.160> Rimmel<00:00:20.400> apocalypse<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.029> don't<00:00:21.330> think<00:00:21.420> that

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
the Rimmel apocalypse I don't think that

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.599 
the Rimmel apocalypse I don't think that
makes<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.230> tremendous<00:00:22.619> amount<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.369> difference

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
makes a tremendous amount of difference

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.060 
makes a tremendous amount of difference
but<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.390> know<00:00:24.510> while<00:00:24.779> we're<00:00:25.019> comparing<00:00:25.560> it's

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
but you know while we're comparing it's

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.279 
but you know while we're comparing it's
something<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.609> note<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.539> Rimmel<00:00:27.810> apocalypse

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
something to note the Rimmel apocalypse

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.160 
something to note the Rimmel apocalypse
is<00:00:28.410> six<00:00:28.680> pounds<00:00:28.980> 49<00:00:29.519> whereas<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.599> MUA<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.019> only

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
is six pounds 49 whereas the MUA is only

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.290 
is six pounds 49 whereas the MUA is only
2<00:00:31.560> pounds<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.279> think<00:00:32.489> that's<00:00:32.640> quite<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:33.000> big

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
2 pounds so I think that's quite a big

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.020 
2 pounds so I think that's quite a big
difference<00:00:33.690> for<00:00:34.620> essentially<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.489> my<00:00:35.670> opinion

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
difference for essentially in my opinion

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.950 
difference for essentially in my opinion
what<00:00:36.780> works<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.260> same<00:00:37.290> way<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.070> me<00:00:38.280> I

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
what works the same way and for me I

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.819 
what works the same way and for me I
can't<00:00:39.960> tell<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.350> prefer<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.649> more

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
can't tell you that I prefer the more

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.490 
can't tell you that I prefer the more
expensive<00:00:41.070> one<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:42.300> MUA<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.690> more<00:00:42.989> barneys

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
expensive one the MUA is more barneys

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.860 
expensive one the MUA is more barneys
not<00:00:43.920> got<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> high<00:00:44.340> shine<00:00:44.550> gloss<00:00:44.760> feel<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
not got the high shine gloss feel of the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.630 
not got the high shine gloss feel of the
apocalypse<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.680> apocalypse<00:00:46.890> has<00:00:47.309> definitely

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
apocalypse the apocalypse has definitely

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.420 
apocalypse the apocalypse has definitely
got<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.030> more<00:00:48.390> glossy<00:00:49.289> finish<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.160> but

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
got a more glossy finish to it but

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.650 
got a more glossy finish to it but
because<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.120> only<00:00:51.239> way<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.449> not

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
because of that the only way is not

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.760 
because of that the only way is not
quite<00:00:51.840> as<00:00:51.899> messy<00:00:52.320> you're<00:00:52.440> not<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.710> be

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
quite as messy you're not going to be

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.770 
quite as messy you're not going to be
worried<00:00:53.039> quite<00:00:53.250> as<00:00:53.399> much<00:00:53.550> about<00:00:54.149> smudging<00:00:54.510> it

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
worried quite as much about smudging it

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.380 
worried quite as much about smudging it
which<00:00:55.020> for<00:00:55.289> me<00:00:55.410> definitely<00:00:56.250> edges<00:00:57.030> out<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
which for me definitely edges out the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.670 
which for me definitely edges out the
apocalypse<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.960> little<00:00:58.140> bit<00:00:58.230> cuz<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.440> does

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
apocalypse a little bit cuz that does

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.139 
apocalypse a little bit cuz that does
bug<00:00:58.980> me<00:00:59.010> about<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.520> woman<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.820> never<00:01:00.000> really

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
bug me about this woman it never really

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.029 
bug me about this woman it never really
sets<00:01:00.539> although<00:01:01.109> they're<00:01:01.350> both<00:01:01.530> long<00:01:01.770> wearing

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
sets although they're both long wearing

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.880 
sets although they're both long wearing
this<00:01:02.670> one<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.210> always<00:01:03.660> kind<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.470> ready<00:01:04.799> to

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
this one is always kind of ready to

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.920 
this one is always kind of ready to
smudge<00:01:05.339> at<00:01:05.549> any<00:01:05.700> time<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.540> only<00:01:06.780> real

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
smudge at any time the only real

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.660 
smudge at any time the only real
downside<00:01:07.170> for<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.710> MUA<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.369> any<00:01:08.520> other

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
downside for the MUA is that any other

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.340 
downside for the MUA is that any other
seven<00:01:09.030> shades<00:01:09.270> whereas<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> apocalypse<00:01:10.200> has

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
seven shades whereas the apocalypse has

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.740 
seven shades whereas the apocalypse has
13<00:01:10.830> didn't<00:01:11.460> launch<00:01:11.640> with<00:01:11.909> 13<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.360> has<00:01:12.479> grown

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
13 didn't launch with 13 that has grown

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.810 
13 didn't launch with 13 that has grown
so<00:01:13.080> hopefully<00:01:13.920> be<00:01:14.070> anyway<00:01:14.310> we'll<00:01:14.490> get<00:01:14.640> more

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
so hopefully be anyway we'll get more

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.630 
so hopefully be anyway we'll get more
over<00:01:15.000> time<00:01:15.060> also<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.290> MUA<00:01:16.560> one<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.189> I

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
over time also the MUA one and I

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.760 
over time also the MUA one and I
wouldn't<00:01:18.000> say<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.180> every<00:01:18.540> single<00:01:18.840> one<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
wouldn't say that every single one is a

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.469 
wouldn't say that every single one is a
dupe<00:01:20.070> for<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.310> apocalypse<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.939> wouldn't<00:01:21.299> say

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
dupe for the apocalypse I wouldn't say

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.539 
dupe for the apocalypse I wouldn't say
that<00:01:21.509> every<00:01:22.500> single<00:01:22.650> one<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.890> them<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.189> really

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
that every single one of them is really

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.070 
that every single one of them is really
high<00:01:23.700> pigmentation<00:01:24.210> some<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.810> them<00:01:24.900> are<00:01:24.960> a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
high pigmentation some of them are a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.260 
high pigmentation some of them are a
little<00:01:25.200> bit<00:01:25.380> shimmery<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:26.430> not<00:01:26.670> across<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
little bit shimmery it's not across the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.999 
little bit shimmery it's not across the
board<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:28.259> i<00:01:28.290> would<00:01:28.500> say<00:01:28.710> they<00:01:28.890> are

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
board that i would say they are

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.950 
board that i would say they are
comparable<00:01:29.490> but<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> very<00:01:30.270> opaque<00:01:30.600> shades

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
comparable but the very opaque shades

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.660 
comparable but the very opaque shades
like<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.350> very<00:01:31.500> bright<00:01:31.890> shades<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:32.520> this

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
like this very bright shades like this

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
further price i would definitely

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.280 
further price i would definitely
recommend<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> few<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.240> these<00:01:48.479> over

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
recommend to have a few of these over

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.620 
recommend to have a few of these over
these<00:01:49.490> so<00:01:50.490> let<00:01:50.850> me<00:01:50.909> know<00:01:51.030> if<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.240> try<00:01:51.270> them

these so let me know if you try them
both<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.110> definitely<00:01:53.009> prefer<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.460> only<00:01:53.670> way

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
both I definitely prefer the only way

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.429 
both I definitely prefer the only way
one<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.210> like<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.899> have<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> couple<00:01:55.320> of

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
one I like that you can have a couple of

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.859 
one I like that you can have a couple of
shade<00:01:55.920> selections<00:01:56.579> over<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.479> one<00:01:57.719> that

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
shade selections over just the one that

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.090 
shade selections over just the one that
you<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.079> have<00:01:58.229> for<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.469> difference<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.890> price

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
you can have for the difference in price

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.969 
you can have for the difference in price
and<00:01:59.310> but<00:02:00.149> also<00:02:00.299> like<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.840> say<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.680> shiny

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and but also like I say this the shiny

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.249 
and but also like I say this the shiny
glossy<00:02:02.490> finish<00:02:02.969> definitely<00:02:03.810> makes<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.170> more

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
glossy finish definitely makes it more

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.520 
glossy finish definitely makes it more
messy<00:02:04.469> for<00:02:04.680> me<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.540> edges<00:02:06.540> out<00:02:06.689> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
messy for me and edges out the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.440 
messy for me and edges out the
apocalypse<00:02:08.160> I'm<00:02:08.399> sorry<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.819> know<00:02:08.940> people<00:02:09.300> love

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
apocalypse I'm sorry I know people love

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.410 
apocalypse I'm sorry I know people love
it<00:02:09.509> it's<00:02:09.840> really<00:02:10.170> nice

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
it it's really nice

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.970 
it it's really nice
product<00:02:10.780> but<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.319> last<00:02:11.560> thing<00:02:11.740> I'm<00:02:11.800> going<00:02:11.890> to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
product but the last thing I'm going to

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.949 
product but the last thing I'm going to
mention<00:02:12.130> is<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.490> bleeding<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.690> bleeds

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
mention is the bleeding it bleeds

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.110 
mention is the bleeding it bleeds
terribly<00:02:14.560> on<00:02:14.709> me<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.190> MUA<00:02:15.400> one<00:02:15.700> doesn't

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
terribly on me and the MUA one doesn't

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.360 
terribly on me and the MUA one doesn't
so<00:02:16.390> ultimately<00:02:16.810> this<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.830> definitely<00:02:18.250> the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
so ultimately this is definitely the

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.190 
so ultimately this is definitely the
winner<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:18.790> but<00:02:19.450> like<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.569> say<00:02:19.840> I'm<00:02:19.959> interested

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
winner and but like I say I'm interested

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.390 
winner and but like I say I'm interested

to see what you guys think if you've

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.800 
to see what you guys think if you've
tried<00:02:21.520> them<00:02:21.760> both<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.270> if<00:02:22.360> you<00:02:22.450> don't<00:02:22.569> try<00:02:22.750> and

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
tried them both and if you don't try and

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.420 
tried them both and if you don't try and
either<00:02:22.900> of<00:02:23.020> them<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.440> just<00:02:23.739> go<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.190> try<00:02:24.370> the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
either of them and just go and try the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.890 
either of them and just go and try the

anyway because if you love that you

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.809 
anyway because if you love that you
probably<00:02:26.080> don't<00:02:26.319> need<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.560> apocalypse<00:02:27.010> so
