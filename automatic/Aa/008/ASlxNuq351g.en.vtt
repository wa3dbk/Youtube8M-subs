connectors<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.979> don't<00:00:50.159> need<00:00:50.399> them<00:00:50.670> they're

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
connectors you don't need them they're

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.329 
connectors you don't need them they're
just<00:00:50.909> decoration<00:00:51.750> then<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.589> flip<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.100> blade

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339

grip upside down and then you flip the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.070 
grip upside down and then you flip the
blades<00:00:56.280> around<00:00:56.519> and<00:00:57.269> look<00:00:57.420> how<00:00:57.570> close<00:00:57.839> they

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
blades around and look how close they

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.070 
blades around and look how close they
are<00:00:58.110> to<00:00:58.290> the<00:00:58.559> canopy<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.759> had<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.360> make<00:01:00.540> new<00:01:00.780> hose

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
are to the canopy I had to make new hose

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.880 
are to the canopy I had to make new hose
for<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.769> canopy<00:01:02.339> because<00:01:03.080> now<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.140> blade<00:01:04.619> is

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
for the canopy because now the blade is

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.190 
for the canopy because now the blade is
so<00:01:05.159> low<00:01:05.460> look<00:01:05.909> how<00:01:06.060> close<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.360> comes<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
so low look how close it comes to the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.219 
so low look how close it comes to the
canopy<00:01:07.680> here<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.700> what<00:01:08.909> what<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.479> does<00:01:09.750> is

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
canopy here but what what that does is

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.130 
canopy here but what what that does is
that<00:01:10.439> increases<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:12.330> distance<00:01:12.540> from<00:01:12.930> these

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
that increases the distance from these

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.740 
that increases the distance from these
blades<00:01:13.560> see<00:01:14.400> now<00:01:14.579> the<00:01:14.670> blade<00:01:15.000> don't<00:01:15.240> come<00:01:15.570> down

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
blades see now the blade don't come down

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.050 
blades see now the blade don't come down
and<00:01:15.990> hit<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.799> was<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> only<00:01:17.280> flaw<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.939> this

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
and hit that was the only flaw in this

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.359 
and hit that was the only flaw in this
helicopter<00:01:18.570> look<00:01:19.320> at<00:01:19.439> all<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.740> dents<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.220> this

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
helicopter look at all the dents in this

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.580 
helicopter look at all the dents in this
blades<00:01:20.759> that's<00:01:21.570> because<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.140> was<00:01:22.259> blade

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
blades that's because it was blade

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.679 
blades that's because it was blade
slapping<00:01:23.159> now<00:01:23.640> I've<00:01:23.880> increased<00:01:24.299> this

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
slapping now I've increased this

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.039 
slapping now I've increased this
distance<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:26.039> put<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.429> 90<00:01:26.789> 104<00:01:27.420> towel<00:01:27.780> on

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
distance and I put the 90 104 towel on

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.099 
distance and I put the 90 104 towel on
it<00:01:28.350> with<00:01:29.039> just<00:01:29.429> 90<00:01:29.729> 104<00:01:30.329> tail<00:01:31.079> blade<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
it with just 90 104 tail blade and the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.309 
it with just 90 104 tail blade and the
double<00:01:34.109> are<00:01:34.859> yeah<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.819> 90<00:01:36.090> 104<00:01:36.600> toe<00:01:36.840> blade<00:01:37.139> on

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
double are yeah the 90 104 toe blade on

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.620 
double are yeah the 90 104 toe blade on
here<00:01:37.710> then<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.460> got<00:01:38.609> to<00:01:38.729> move<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.149> blade

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
here then you got to move this blade

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.190 
here then you got to move this blade
forward<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.950> it'll<00:01:41.369> have<00:01:41.579> clearance

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
forward so that it'll have clearance

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.620 
forward so that it'll have clearance
because<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.499> a<00:01:43.619> much<00:01:43.979> larger<00:01:44.520> toe<00:01:44.729> blade<00:01:45.060> so

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
because it's a much larger toe blade so

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:56.560 
because it's a much larger toe blade so
anyway<00:01:45.929> watch<00:01:46.619> my<00:01:46.950> flight<00:01:47.280> man<00:01:47.729> here<00:01:48.630> we<00:01:48.749> go

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:08.350 

this<00:01:57.110> is<00:01:57.320> a<00:01:57.350> really<00:01:57.710> smooth<00:01:58.190> helicopter

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:19.960 

hey<00:02:09.360> let's<00:02:09.690> take<00:02:09.900> it<00:02:10.140> here<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:11.700> set<00:02:11.880> my

power I'm going to flick it down to slow

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.990 
power I'm going to flick it down to slow
so<00:04:42.990> I<00:04:43.050> can<00:04:45.320> get<00:04:46.320> a<00:04:46.350> little<00:04:46.620> swipe<00:04:47.010> out<00:04:47.610> of<00:04:47.790> this

104<00:06:33.270> toe<00:06:33.540> blade<00:06:33.840> on<00:06:34.050> you<00:06:34.950> have<00:06:35.070> to<00:06:35.190> move<00:06:35.430> this

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:35.670 
104 toe blade on you have to move this

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.630 
104 toe blade on you have to move this
blade<00:06:36.450> right<00:06:36.690> here<00:06:37.020> let's<00:06:37.980> see<00:06:38.160> if<00:06:38.190> I<00:06:38.370> can<00:06:38.490> get

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640 
blade right here let's see if I can get

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.900 
blade right here let's see if I can get
this<00:06:38.790> to<00:06:38.970> balance<00:06:39.150> on<00:06:39.480> the<00:06:39.600> bike<00:06:39.810> seat<00:06:40.910> evil

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:41.910 
this to balance on the bike seat evil

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:48.890 
this to balance on the bike seat evil
there<00:06:42.840> we<00:06:42.960> go<00:06:43.340> yeah<00:06:45.860> you'll<00:06:46.860> see<00:06:47.160> where<00:06:47.900> these

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
there we go yeah you'll see where these

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.280 
there we go yeah you'll see where these
little<00:06:49.320> holes<00:06:49.850> that's<00:06:50.850> where<00:06:51.150> this<00:06:51.330> band<00:06:51.960> used

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.290 
little holes that's where this band used

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.680 
little holes that's where this band used
to<00:06:52.440> be<00:06:52.590> you<00:06:52.890> had<00:06:52.920> to<00:06:53.100> cut<00:06:53.310> the<00:06:53.460> nipple<00:06:53.820> off<00:06:53.940> this

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
to be you had to cut the nipple off this

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.270 
to be you had to cut the nipple off this
is<00:06:54.900> tight<00:06:55.200> enough<00:06:55.560> you<00:06:55.740> don't<00:06:55.830> have<00:06:55.980> to<00:06:56.100> worry

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 
is tight enough you don't have to worry

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.610 
is tight enough you don't have to worry
about<00:06:56.400> this<00:06:56.730> moving<00:06:57.240> and<00:06:57.480> slide<00:06:58.140> it<00:06:58.350> forward

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620 
about this moving and slide it forward

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.300 
about this moving and slide it forward
so<00:06:59.520> this<00:06:59.760> blade<00:07:00.090> will<00:07:00.330> clear<00:07:00.810> and<00:07:01.080> then<00:07:01.950> if<00:07:02.130> you

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310 
so this blade will clear and then if you

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.970 
so this blade will clear and then if you
flip<00:07:03.090> the<00:07:03.390> blade<00:07:03.660> grip<00:07:04.140> this<00:07:04.440> is<00:07:04.620> called<00:07:04.860> a

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:04.980 
flip the blade grip this is called a

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.910 
flip the blade grip this is called a
blade<00:07:05.250> grip<00:07:05.720> now<00:07:06.720> one<00:07:06.930> thing<00:07:07.170> I<00:07:07.290> did<00:07:07.530> have<00:07:07.740> to

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:07.920 
blade grip now one thing I did have to

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.510 
blade grip now one thing I did have to
do<00:07:08.160> is<00:07:08.460> you<00:07:09.060> see<00:07:09.270> where<00:07:09.480> the<00:07:09.600> hose<00:07:09.810> is<00:07:10.310> the<00:07:11.310> hole

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 
do is you see where the hose is the hole

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.900 
do is you see where the hose is the hole
is<00:07:11.700> a<00:07:11.730> little<00:07:12.120> bit<00:07:12.240> higher<00:07:13.400> for<00:07:14.400> this<00:07:14.520> screw

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:14.910 
is a little bit higher for this screw

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.530 
is a little bit higher for this screw
used<00:07:15.180> to<00:07:15.330> be<00:07:15.510> when<00:07:15.690> the<00:07:15.810> blade<00:07:16.020> grips<00:07:16.350> up<00:07:16.560> here

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:17.540 
used to be when the blade grips up here

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.350 
used to be when the blade grips up here
so<00:07:18.540> I<00:07:18.570> did<00:07:18.960> have<00:07:19.140> to<00:07:19.320> drill<00:07:19.950> a<00:07:20.190> little<00:07:20.520> hole<00:07:20.670> in

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 
so I did have to drill a little hole in

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.380 
so I did have to drill a little hole in
this<00:07:22.020> outer<00:07:22.350> shaft<00:07:22.890> and<00:07:23.250> you<00:07:23.820> can<00:07:23.970> only<00:07:24.120> put

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:24.390 
this outer shaft and you can only put

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.230 
this outer shaft and you can only put
the<00:07:24.540> screw<00:07:24.870> in<00:07:25.140> so<00:07:25.470> far<00:07:25.770> because<00:07:26.520> this<00:07:26.970> inner

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 
the screw in so far because this inner

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.070 
the screw in so far because this inner
shaft<00:07:27.600> runs<00:07:28.470> through<00:07:28.920> that
