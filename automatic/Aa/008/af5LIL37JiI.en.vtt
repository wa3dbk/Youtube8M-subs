house on to the next guy so this is
going<00:01:11.900> to<00:01:11.960> be<00:01:12.050> interesting<00:01:12.560> we<00:01:13.100> have

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
going to be interesting we have

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.920 
going to be interesting we have
different<00:01:13.580> slightly<00:01:14.060> different<00:01:14.480> styles<00:01:14.810> i

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
different slightly different styles i

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.750 
different slightly different styles i
guess<00:01:15.110> it's<00:01:15.500> gonna<00:01:15.620> be<00:01:15.680> quite<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.010> experiment

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
guess it's gonna be quite the experiment

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.790 
guess it's gonna be quite the experiment
now<00:01:17.360> to<00:01:17.420> keep<00:01:17.630> all<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:17.930> episodes<00:01:18.080> connected

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
now to keep all the episodes connected

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.290 
now to keep all the episodes connected
there<00:01:18.920> will<00:01:19.040> obviously<00:01:19.130> be<00:01:19.460> links<00:01:19.820> in<00:01:19.940> both<00:01:20.120> of

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
there will obviously be links in both of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.020 
there will obviously be links in both of
our<00:01:20.360> descriptions<00:01:21.080> if<00:01:21.310> there<00:01:22.310> is<00:01:22.460> no<00:01:22.640> link<00:01:22.880> it

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
our descriptions if there is no link it

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.190 
our descriptions if there is no link it
is<00:01:23.120> probably<00:01:23.510> because<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:23.960> other<00:01:24.080> person

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
is probably because the other person

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.870 
is probably because the other person
hasn't<00:01:24.620> uploaded<00:01:24.950> their<00:01:25.280> episode<00:01:25.670> yet

hasn't uploaded their episode yet

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.670 
hasn't uploaded their episode yet

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
obviously we're following a schedule so

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.200 
obviously we're following a schedule so
if<00:01:27.740> you<00:01:27.830> come<00:01:28.040> here<00:01:28.220> looking<00:01:28.520> for<00:01:28.580> a<00:01:28.730> video<00:01:29.000> on

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070

there<00:01:31.420> that<00:01:32.420> being<00:01:32.660> said<00:01:32.840> there<00:01:33.050> will<00:01:33.110> also<00:01:33.260> be

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
there that being said there will also be

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.140 
there that being said there will also be
links<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:33.800> all<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:33.950> playlists<00:01:34.520> so<00:01:34.940> that<00:01:35.060> you

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
links to all the playlists so that you

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.460

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
you will have no idea what's going on in

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.760 
you will have no idea what's going on in
this<00:01:38.150> series<00:01:38.390> if<00:01:38.630> you<00:01:38.720> only<00:01:38.870> watch<00:01:39.140> one<00:01:39.500> sides

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.660 
videos so you'll have to switch between
channels<00:01:41.750> to<00:01:41.990> get<00:01:42.140> all<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:42.380> episodes<00:01:42.670> that's

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
channels to get all the episodes that's

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.100 
channels to get all the episodes that's
right<00:01:43.910> I'll<00:01:44.090> be<00:01:44.210> doing<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.450> odd<00:01:44.660> numbers

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
right I'll be doing the odd numbers

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.860 
right I'll be doing the odd numbers
episode<00:01:45.890> 135<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.240> then<00:01:47.330> you'll<00:01:47.480> be<00:01:47.570> doing<00:01:47.750> all

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
episode 135 and then you'll be doing all

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.710 
episode 135 and then you'll be doing all
the<00:01:47.990> even<00:01:48.410> numbers<00:01:48.680> 246<00:01:49.520> so<00:01:49.940> I<00:01:50.300> don't<00:01:50.600> know

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
the even numbers 246 so I don't know

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.030 
the even numbers 246 so I don't know
this<00:01:50.900> is<00:01:51.020> kind<00:01:51.170> of<00:01:51.200> an<00:01:51.290> experiment<00:01:51.800> we'll<00:01:51.920> see

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
this is kind of an experiment we'll see

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.090 
this is kind of an experiment we'll see
how<00:01:52.190> it<00:01:52.250> works<00:01:52.520> we<00:01:53.240> have<00:01:53.390> a<00:01:54.100> customized

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
how it works we have a customized

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.610 
how it works we have a customized
texture<00:01:55.550> pack<00:01:55.730> for<00:01:55.760> this<00:01:56.120> as<00:01:56.360> well<00:01:56.470> which<00:01:57.470> you

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
texture pack for this as well which you

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.340 
texture pack for this as well which you
guys<00:01:57.740> can<00:01:57.950> actually<00:01:58.160> download<00:01:58.540> its<00:01:59.540> texture

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
guys can actually download its texture

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.130 
guys can actually download its texture
pack<00:02:00.530> which<00:02:00.890> was<00:02:01.159> based<00:02:01.610> on<00:02:01.820> flows<00:02:02.330> HD<00:02:02.870> and

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
pack which was based on flows HD and

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.560 
pack which was based on flows HD and
then<00:02:03.890> changed<00:02:04.430> quite<00:02:04.550> a<00:02:04.610> bit<00:02:04.700> by<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.030> Estill

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
then changed quite a bit by the Estill

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.360 
then changed quite a bit by the Estill
on<00:02:05.720> community<00:02:06.260> in<00:02:06.380> their<00:02:06.590> server<00:02:06.860> and<00:02:07.250> then

awesome<00:02:20.340> pack<00:02:20.730> now<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.720> land<00:02:22.020> will<00:02:22.200> be

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
awesome pack now the land will be

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.600 
awesome pack now the land will be
building<00:02:22.680> on<00:02:22.830> here's<00:02:23.130> there's<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.489> beautiful

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
building on here's there's a beautiful

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.290 
building on here's there's a beautiful
flat<00:02:24.680> surface<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.860> we<00:02:26.040> found<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.700> had<00:02:27.150> to

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
flat surface that we found and had to

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.089 
flat surface that we found and had to
modify<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.750> little<00:02:28.080> bit<00:02:28.230> but<00:02:28.470> we<00:02:28.560> decided<00:02:28.830> it

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
modify a little bit but we decided it

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.800 
modify a little bit but we decided it
would<00:02:29.190> give<00:02:29.310> us<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.580> ton<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.120> space<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.690> work

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
would give us a ton of space to work

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.900 
would give us a ton of space to work
with<00:02:30.870> we<00:02:31.230> have<00:02:31.380> this<00:02:31.500> beautiful<00:02:31.680> plateau<00:02:32.430> here

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
with we have this beautiful plateau here

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.059 
with we have this beautiful plateau here
in<00:02:33.060> which<00:02:33.510> we<00:02:33.630> can<00:02:33.720> build<00:02:33.870> our<00:02:34.020> house<00:02:34.200> we<00:02:34.950> have

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
in which we can build our house we have

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.550 
in which we can build our house we have
a<00:02:35.100> nice<00:02:35.310> crest<00:02:35.730> up<00:02:35.940> here<00:02:36.239> got<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.959> river<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.380> work

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
a nice crest up here got a river to work

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.870 
a nice crest up here got a river to work
with<00:02:37.709> down<00:02:37.890> there<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.220> another<00:02:38.400> river<00:02:38.700> to

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
with down there and another river to

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.430 
with down there and another river to
work<00:02:39.030> with<00:02:39.209> over<00:02:39.480> here<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:40.170> we're<00:02:40.260> going<00:02:40.350> to

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
work with over here so we're going to

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.830 
work with over here so we're going to
have<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.620> lot<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:40.950> fun<00:02:41.220> it's<00:02:42.030> going<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.239> be<00:02:42.360> quite
