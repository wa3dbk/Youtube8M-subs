German<00:00:16.199> volume<00:00:16.619> training<00:00:17.240> I'm<00:00:18.240> familiar<00:00:18.420> with

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
German volume training I'm familiar with

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.260 
German volume training I'm familiar with
it<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.830> give<00:00:20.039> me<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> link<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.670> muscle<00:00:21.150> and

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
it and I give me a link to muscle and

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.670 
it and I give me a link to muscle and
strength<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.840> basically<00:00:22.170> says<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.470> he's

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
strength and basically says that he's

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.450 
strength and basically says that he's
been<00:00:22.710> following<00:00:22.949> 5x5<00:00:23.640> for<00:00:25.039> quite<00:00:26.039> some<00:00:26.250> time

German<00:00:28.769> volume<00:00:28.980> training<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.730> can<00:00:30.029> tell<00:00:30.179> you

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
German volume training I can tell you

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.600 
German volume training I can tell you
what<00:00:30.420> you'll<00:00:31.170> probably<00:00:31.410> blow<00:00:31.890> up<00:00:32.130> you'll

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
what you'll probably blow up you'll

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.729 
what you'll probably blow up you'll
probably<00:00:32.880> gain<00:00:33.329> some<00:00:33.660> muscle<00:00:33.840> especially<00:00:34.530> if

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
probably gain some muscle especially if

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.190 
probably gain some muscle especially if
you've<00:00:35.280> been<00:00:35.430> following<00:00:35.550> 5x5<00:00:36.360> 5x5<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.020> great

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
you've been following 5x5 5x5 is a great

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.500 
you've been following 5x5 5x5 is a great
hybrid<00:00:38.160> type<00:00:38.340> routine<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.600> volume<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.489> is

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
hybrid type routine the volume is is

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.670 
hybrid type routine the volume is is
moderate<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> intensities<00:00:43.140> moderate<00:00:43.559> it's

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
moderate the intensities moderate it's

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.380 
moderate the intensities moderate it's
kind<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.950> in-between<00:00:44.219> that's<00:00:44.969> reason<00:00:45.270> why<00:00:45.360> I

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
kind of in-between that's reason why I

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.590 
kind of in-between that's reason why I
like<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:45.780> much<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:47.070> when<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.670> switch<00:00:48.360> from

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
like it so much but when you switch from

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.119 
like it so much but when you switch from
that<00:00:48.899> especially<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.590> can<00:00:49.680> following<00:00:50.039> it

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
that especially if you can following it

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.100 
that especially if you can following it
for<00:00:50.280> years<00:00:50.489> or<00:00:50.910> months<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.449> German<00:00:52.020> volume

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
for years or months to German volume

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.779 
for years or months to German volume
training<00:00:52.320> your<00:00:53.010> intensity<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.520> gonna<00:00:53.640> come

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
training your intensity is gonna come

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.459 
training your intensity is gonna come
down<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.149> your<00:00:54.270> volume<00:00:54.930> that's<00:00:55.230> why<00:00:55.350> they

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
down but your volume that's why they

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.200 
down but your volume that's why they
call<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.680> volume<00:00:56.160> training<00:00:56.430> they<00:00:56.940> call<00:00:57.120> it

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
call it volume training they call it

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.959 
call it volume training they call it
shock<00:00:57.600> muscle<00:00:58.260> growth<00:00:58.440> training<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.039> going<00:00:59.760> to

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
shock muscle growth training is going to

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.450 
shock muscle growth training is going to
be<00:01:00.059> shocking<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.140> mean<00:01:01.620> there's<00:01:01.770> shit<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.160> 10

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
be shocking I mean there's shit like 10

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.850 
be shocking I mean there's shit like 10
sets<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.879> 10<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.390> those<00:01:03.989> workouts<00:01:04.379> you're

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
sets of 10 in those workouts you're

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.990 
sets of 10 in those workouts you're
going<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.040> be<00:01:05.129> sore<00:01:05.430> as<00:01:05.549> fuck

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
going to be sore as fuck

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.120 
going to be sore as fuck
you're<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.420> mean<00:01:06.869> you're<00:01:07.260> really<00:01:07.439> you're<00:01:07.979> not

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
you're I mean you're really you're not

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.920 
you're I mean you're really you're not
training<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.580> nervous<00:01:08.880> system<00:01:09.180> as<00:01:09.330> much<00:01:09.750> as

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
training the nervous system as much as

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.289 
training the nervous system as much as
you<00:01:10.080> are<00:01:10.170> actually<00:01:10.439> training<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.790> muscle

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
you are actually training the muscle

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.109 
you are actually training the muscle
right<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.979> I've<00:01:14.070> often<00:01:14.310> talked<00:01:14.640> about<00:01:14.790> this

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
right and I've often talked about this

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.190 
right and I've often talked about this
so<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.890> sounds<00:01:17.189> going<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> happen

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
so the sounds going to happen

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.980 
so the sounds going to happen
right<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.130> as<00:01:20.090> I've<00:01:20.299> mentioned<00:01:20.330> in<00:01:20.840> other

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
right and as I've mentioned in other

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.590 
right and as I've mentioned in other
videos<00:01:21.080> I'm<00:01:21.590> not<00:01:21.770> attached<00:01:22.100> to<00:01:22.280> or<00:01:22.790> married<00:01:23.390> to

videos I'm not attached to or married to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.929 
videos I'm not attached to or married to
or<00:01:24.369> zealot

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.209 

for<00:01:28.509> any<00:01:28.689> one<00:01:29.200> particular<00:01:29.679> type<00:01:29.829> of<00:01:29.859> training

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
for any one particular type of training

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:31.889 
for any one particular type of training
for<00:01:30.369> German<00:01:30.819> volume<00:01:30.909> training<00:01:31.119> to<00:01:31.539> get<00:01:31.630> it's

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
for German volume training to get it's

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.450 
for German volume training to get it's
going<00:01:31.990> to<00:01:32.049> get<00:01:32.140> you<00:01:32.259> bigger<00:01:32.439> the<00:01:32.920> volume<00:01:33.100> is

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
going to get you bigger the volume is

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.190 
going to get you bigger the volume is
there<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:34.149> time<00:01:34.329> under<00:01:34.569> tension<00:01:34.600> is<00:01:34.990> there

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
there the time under tension is there

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.099 
there the time under tension is there
the<00:01:35.649> frequency<00:01:36.130> is<00:01:36.189> there<00:01:36.630> give<00:01:37.630> it<00:01:37.719> a<00:01:37.750> try

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
the frequency is there give it a try

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:39.359 
the frequency is there give it a try
but<00:01:38.259> I<00:01:38.469> think<00:01:38.560> actually<00:01:39.039> I<00:01:39.069> think<00:01:39.159> it's<00:01:39.340> a

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
but I think actually I think it's a

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.370 
but I think actually I think it's a
really<00:01:39.549> good<00:01:39.640> idea<00:01:39.759> shake<00:01:40.569> things<00:01:40.810> up<00:01:40.929> use

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
really good idea shake things up use

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.050 
really good idea shake things up use
that<00:01:41.560> for<00:01:41.740> six<00:01:41.950> weeks<00:01:42.189> and<00:01:42.459> then<00:01:42.729> go<00:01:42.880> back<00:01:43.030> to

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
that for six weeks and then go back to

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.809 
that for six weeks and then go back to
five<00:01:43.329> by<00:01:43.450> five<00:01:43.659> and<00:01:43.899> then<00:01:44.709> change<00:01:45.399> it<00:01:45.520> up<00:01:45.670> as

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
five by five and then change it up as

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:48.389 
five by five and then change it up as
long<00:01:46.359> as<00:01:46.479> you're<00:01:46.600> following<00:01:46.859> the<00:01:47.859> parameters

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
long as you're following the parameters

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.389 
long as you're following the parameters
of<00:01:48.579> strength<00:01:48.939> and<00:01:49.179> you<00:01:49.569> rotate<00:01:49.959> it<00:01:50.200> rotate<00:01:50.619> new

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
of strength and you rotate it rotate new

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.910 
of strength and you rotate it rotate new
programs<00:01:51.880> in<00:01:52.119> every<00:01:52.810> few<00:01:52.990> months<00:01:53.200> you're

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
programs in every few months you're

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.289 
programs in every few months you're
going<00:01:54.039> to<00:01:54.099> be<00:01:54.159> just<00:01:54.399> fine<00:01:54.579> and<00:01:54.849> the<00:01:55.179> other

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
going to be just fine and the other

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.459 
going to be just fine and the other
thing<00:01:55.479> is<00:01:55.569> that<00:01:55.599> experience<00:01:56.170> tells<00:01:56.380> you

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
thing is that experience tells you
