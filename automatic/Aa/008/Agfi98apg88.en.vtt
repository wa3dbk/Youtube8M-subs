image bullet design it also has a unique
bullet<00:01:59.380> design<00:01:59.710> which<00:02:00.009> is<00:02:00.130> quite<00:02:00.310> cool<00:02:00.579> it's

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
bullet design which is quite cool it's

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.029 
bullet design which is quite cool it's
not<00:02:01.060> like<00:02:01.210> a<00:02:01.270> normal<00:02:01.360> earbuds<00:02:02.079> it's<00:02:02.710> made<00:02:02.890> out

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
not like a normal earbuds it's made out

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.249 
not like a normal earbuds it's made out
of<00:02:03.070> metal<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.640> it's<00:02:04.060> also<00:02:04.240> it<00:02:04.689> also<00:02:04.750> had<00:02:05.110> some

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
of metal and it's also it also had some

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.380 
of metal and it's also it also had some
gold<00:02:05.590> finishes<00:02:06.070> on<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.399> outside<00:02:06.729> which<00:02:07.149> gives

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
gold finishes on the outside which gives

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.740 
gold finishes on the outside which gives
it<00:02:07.479> like<00:02:07.600> cool<00:02:07.929> luxe<00:02:08.560> design<00:02:09.239> so<00:02:10.239> I<00:02:10.269> take<00:02:10.720> it

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
it like cool luxe design so I take it

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.100 
it like cool luxe design so I take it

that's where gold chromo has come from

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.309 
that's where gold chromo has come from
everything<00:02:14.110> from<00:02:14.319> finishes<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.430> inspiration

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
everything from finishes to inspiration

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.380 
everything from finishes to inspiration
right<00:02:17.319> now<00:02:17.560> this<00:02:18.400> is<00:02:18.550> all<00:02:18.700> born<00:02:19.000> out<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.180> your

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
right now this is all born out of your

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.509 
right now this is all born out of your
love<00:02:19.540> for<00:02:19.690> electronics<00:02:20.230> but<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.650> am<00:02:21.190> almost

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
love for electronics but I am almost

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:22.920 
love for electronics but I am almost
sure<00:02:21.760> that<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:22.360> took<00:02:22.480> quite<00:02:22.630> a<00:02:22.720> bit<00:02:22.870> of

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
sure that it took quite a bit of

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.059 
sure that it took quite a bit of
patience<00:02:23.410> in<00:02:23.680> terms<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.100> trying<00:02:25.090> tasting

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
patience in terms of trying tasting

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.380 
patience in terms of trying tasting
manufacturing<00:02:27.069> focus<00:02:27.910> through<00:02:28.060> that<00:02:28.209> process

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
manufacturing focus through that process

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.500 
manufacturing focus through that process
we<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.799> has<00:02:30.010> been<00:02:30.160> conscious<00:02:30.640> meetings<00:02:31.180> back

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
we it has been conscious meetings back

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.600 
we it has been conscious meetings back
and<00:02:31.690> forth<00:02:31.840> unity<00:02:32.170> from<00:02:32.350> here<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.980> overseas

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
and forth unity from here and overseas

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.070 
and forth unity from here and overseas
just<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:34.060> separate<00:02:34.420> them<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:34.569> that<00:02:34.750> they<00:02:34.930> can

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
just to separate them so that they can

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.120 
just to separate them so that they can
see<00:02:35.290> who<00:02:35.470> i<00:02:35.500> am<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:37.269> we've<00:02:38.049> we<00:02:38.410> just<00:02:38.739> focused

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
see who i am and we've we just focused

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.309 
see who i am and we've we just focused
on<00:02:39.160> like<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.610> speaks<00:02:39.910> on<00:02:40.239> on<00:02:40.959> this<00:02:41.110> gold

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
on like the speaks on on this gold

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.440 
on like the speaks on on this gold
chrome<00:02:41.590> on<00:02:41.799> units<00:02:42.099> from<00:02:42.610> like<00:02:42.819> the<00:02:42.910> frequency

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
chrome on units from like the frequency

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.449 
chrome on units from like the frequency
so<00:02:43.720> now<00:02:43.870> with<00:02:44.049> frequencies<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:44.920> sound<00:02:45.280> is

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
so now with frequencies and sound is

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.059 
so now with frequencies and sound is
measured<00:02:45.880> enhance<00:02:46.299> so<00:02:47.080> what<00:02:47.290> so<00:02:47.590> I'm<00:02:47.860> there's

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
measured enhance so what so I'm there's

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.670 
measured enhance so what so I'm there's
like<00:02:48.220> two<00:02:48.459> sides<00:02:48.940> of<00:02:49.150> hurts<00:02:49.540> measurements<00:02:50.200> so

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
like two sides of hurts measurements so

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.490 
like two sides of hurts measurements so
it's<00:02:51.040> your<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.880> lower<00:02:52.269> their<00:02:52.540> hurts<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.380> more

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
it's your the lower their hurts the more

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.319 
it's your the lower their hurts the more
basic<00:02:53.739> ads<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.340> higher<00:02:54.549> the<00:02:54.760> hurts<00:02:54.940> the

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
basic ads and the higher the hurts the

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.599 
basic ads and the higher the hurts the
more<00:02:55.480> table<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:56.019> has<00:02:56.049> so<00:02:56.739> I've<00:02:56.859> went<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.430> a

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
more table it has so I've went to a

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.750 
more table it has so I've went to a
quite<00:02:58.030> low<00:02:58.390> hurt<00:02:58.690> level<00:02:59.590> which<00:02:59.829> is<00:02:59.859> at<00:03:00.250> six<00:03:00.519> and

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
quite low hurt level which is at six and

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.390 
quite low hurt level which is at six and
a<00:03:01.269> high<00:03:01.570> on<00:03:01.900> hearts<00:03:02.260> table<00:03:02.530> at<00:03:02.650> 31<00:03:03.070> in<00:03:03.160> between

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
a high on hearts table at 31 in between

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.479 
a high on hearts table at 31 in between
six<00:03:03.700> it's<00:03:03.940> a<00:03:04.150> deep<00:03:04.390> bass<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.840> 31<00:03:05.620> for<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.190> higher

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
six it's a deep bass and 31 for a higher

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.030 
six it's a deep bass and 31 for a higher
chaebol<00:03:07.060> saw<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:07.989> coming<00:03:08.319> out<00:03:08.380> of<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.650> you

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
chaebol saw it coming out of the you

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.099 
chaebol saw it coming out of the you
know<00:03:09.069> frequency<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:10.239> all<00:03:10.390> such<00:03:10.540> as<00:03:10.660> infinite

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
know frequency and all such as infinite

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.460 
know frequency and all such as infinite
so<00:03:11.290> impedance<00:03:11.709> is<00:03:12.400> basically<00:03:13.180> all

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
so impedance is basically all

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.630 
so impedance is basically all
electronics<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.590> all<00:03:14.709> earphones<00:03:15.160> work<00:03:15.430> with

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
electronics and all earphones work with

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.680 
electronics and all earphones work with
some<00:03:15.819> sort<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.180> time<00:03:16.690> not<00:03:16.870> electricity<00:03:17.530> so

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
some sort of time not electricity so

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.629 
some sort of time not electricity so
electricity<00:03:19.690> does<00:03:19.959> inmates<00:03:20.380> are<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:20.889> that

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
electricity does inmates are and that

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.460 
electricity does inmates are and that
sound<00:03:21.910> is<00:03:22.000> not<00:03:22.150> quite<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.480> chapter<00:03:22.959> it's<00:03:23.290> like<00:03:23.440> a

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
sound is not quite a chapter it's like a

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.770 
sound is not quite a chapter it's like a
hissing<00:03:23.709> song<00:03:24.100> so<00:03:24.639> what<00:03:24.819> impedance<00:03:25.239> does<00:03:25.510> is

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
hissing song so what impedance does is

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.440 
hissing song so what impedance does is
that<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.170> more<00:03:26.319> higher<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.829> impedance<00:03:27.220> level

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
that the more higher the impedance level

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.420 
that the more higher the impedance level
the<00:03:28.450> beta<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:29.049> yaya<00:03:29.290> means<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:29.950> you<00:03:30.130> saw<00:03:30.370> the

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
the beta you yaya means and you saw the

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.030 
the beta you yaya means and you saw the
impedance<00:03:31.269> navel<00:03:31.600> or<00:03:31.810> go<00:03:32.079> trauma<00:03:32.410> he<00:03:32.650> said<00:03:32.859> at

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
impedance navel or go trauma he said at

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.099 
impedance navel or go trauma he said at
18<00:03:33.519> which<00:03:33.730> means<00:03:33.970> it's<00:03:34.150> quite<00:03:34.359> high<00:03:34.600> and<00:03:34.930> it

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
18 which means it's quite high and it

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.129 
18 which means it's quite high and it
brings<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.440> clear<00:03:35.769> quality<00:03:36.069> music<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:37.660> onion

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
brings you clear quality music the onion

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.289 
brings you clear quality music the onion
is<00:03:38.230> also<00:03:38.560> your<00:03:38.709> sound<00:03:39.040> pressure<00:03:39.340> levels<00:03:39.790> which

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
is also your sound pressure levels which

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.690 
is also your sound pressure levels which
is<00:03:40.420> joining<00:03:40.600> like<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:40.959> know<00:03:41.049> sensitivity<00:03:41.829> and

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
is joining like you know sensitivity and

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.699 
is joining like you know sensitivity and
that's<00:03:42.970> basically<00:03:43.420> is<00:03:43.870> how<00:03:44.109> large<00:03:44.410> you<00:03:44.560> want

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
that's basically is how large you want

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.210 
that's basically is how large you want
your<00:03:44.889> music<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.400> sound<00:03:45.579> so<00:03:46.329> the<00:03:46.480> lowest<00:03:46.840> sound

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
your music to sound so the lowest sound

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.120 
your music to sound so the lowest sound
level<00:03:48.220> is<00:03:48.850> at<00:03:49.269> zero<00:03:49.600> decibels<00:03:50.139> and<00:03:50.530> obviously

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
level is at zero decibels and obviously

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.039 
level is at zero decibels and obviously
the<00:03:51.340> more<00:03:51.489> higher<00:03:51.760> you<00:03:52.000> go<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.450> more<00:03:52.630> louder

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
the more higher you go the more louder

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.170 
the more higher you go the more louder
you<00:03:53.290> will<00:03:53.410> miss<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.709> kids<00:03:53.920> and<00:03:54.220> I<00:03:54.489> wanted<00:03:54.850> to

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
you will miss the kids and I wanted to

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480

have a large sounding units so my you
know<00:03:58.599> sons<00:03:58.930> but<00:03:59.379> my<00:03:59.680> sound<00:03:59.950> pressure<00:04:00.159> level<00:04:00.489> is

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
know sons but my sound pressure level is

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.600 
know sons but my sound pressure level is
at<00:04:00.959> 125<00:04:01.959> decibels<00:04:02.500> which<00:04:02.739> means<00:04:03.250> it's<00:04:03.400> quite

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
at 125 decibels which means it's quite

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.369 
at 125 decibels which means it's quite
loud<00:04:03.879> but<00:04:04.569> the<00:04:04.720> good<00:04:04.870> thing<00:04:04.900> about<00:04:05.049> gold

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
loud but the good thing about gold

chrome oir phones is that it is also
noise<00:04:08.049> cancelling<00:04:08.650> which<00:04:08.830> means<00:04:09.040> you<00:04:09.939> can

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
noise cancelling which means you can

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.850
