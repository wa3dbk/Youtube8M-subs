00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:23.489 
of Davide there are four key points that

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.939 
of Davide there are four key points that
go<00:00:23.579> into<00:00:23.730> making<00:00:23.939> Belvedere<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:24.989> special<00:00:25.470> they

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
go into making Belvedere so special they

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.639 
go into making Belvedere so special they
are<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.399> grain<00:00:26.669> then<00:00:27.300> Koski<00:00:27.779> gold<00:00:27.989> wine<00:00:28.289> which

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:28.649 
are the grain then Koski gold wine which

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:32.720 
are the grain then Koski gold wine which
is<00:00:28.800> very<00:00:29.189> sweet<00:00:29.519> very<00:00:30.029> soft<00:00:30.589> water<00:00:31.589> we're<00:00:32.520> one

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
is very sweet very soft water we're one

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.460 
is very sweet very soft water we're one
of<00:00:32.880> very<00:00:33.090> few<00:00:33.180> distilleries<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.110> our<00:00:34.290> own

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
of very few distilleries to have our own

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.490 
of very few distilleries to have our own
artesian<00:00:35.190> well<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:36.750> unique<00:00:37.050> for

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
artesian well the unique for

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.410 
artesian well the unique for
distillation<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.190> give<00:00:38.610> our<00:00:38.790> vodka<00:00:38.970> its

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
distillation that give our vodka its

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.400 
distillation that give our vodka its
purity<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.850> finally<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.120> 33<00:00:42.840> causes<00:00:43.350> your

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
purity and finally the 33 causes your

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.920 
purity and finally the 33 causes your
control<00:00:43.800> checkpoint<00:00:44.370> all<00:00:44.700> these<00:00:45.000> things<00:00:45.300> go

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
control checkpoint all these things go

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.850 
control checkpoint all these things go
into<00:00:46.140> making<00:00:46.290> Belvedere<00:00:47.190> true<00:00:47.520> luxury<00:00:47.970> vodka

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.590 

so<00:00:52.860> we're<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.460> water<00:00:53.670> treatment<00:00:53.940> facility

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
so we're in the water treatment facility

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.420 
so we're in the water treatment facility
so<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.050> where<00:00:55.290> the<00:00:55.680> water<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.220> comes

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
so this is where the water that comes

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.370 
so this is where the water that comes
from<00:00:56.579> our<00:00:56.880> artesian<00:00:57.329> wells<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.720> first<00:00:58.170> brought

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
from our artesian wells is first brought

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.650 
from our artesian wells is first brought
here<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.829> water<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.220> very<00:00:59.280> important<00:00:59.940> because

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
here the water is very important because

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.290 
here the water is very important because
it<00:01:01.200> represents<00:01:01.350> 60%<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.579> what<00:01:02.730> makes<00:01:02.970> up<00:01:03.180> a

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
it represents 60% of what makes up a

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.369 
it represents 60% of what makes up a
bottle<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.630> Belvedere

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
bottle of Belvedere

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.069 
bottle of Belvedere
so<00:01:04.649> the<00:01:04.739> softness<00:01:05.219> the<00:01:05.609> purity<00:01:06.149> the

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:07.079 
so the softness the purity the

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:08.510 
so the softness the purity the
consistency<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.859> water<00:01:08.039> is<00:01:08.310> all

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
consistency of the water is all

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.480 
consistency of the water is all
incredibly<00:01:09.450> important<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.859> color-coding

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
incredibly important this color-coding

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.800 
incredibly important this color-coding
filtration<00:01:12.030> process<00:01:12.299> was<00:01:12.450> actually<00:01:12.689> designed

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
filtration process was actually designed

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.340 
filtration process was actually designed
specifically<00:01:13.560> for<00:01:13.679> Belvedere<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.960> we're<00:01:16.229> in

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
specifically for Belvedere so we're in

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.529 
specifically for Belvedere so we're in
the<00:01:16.499> distilling<00:01:16.829> room<00:01:17.069> and<00:01:17.999> this<00:01:18.179> is<00:01:18.389> where

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
the distilling room and this is where

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.270 
the distilling room and this is where
the<00:01:18.630> raw<00:01:18.780> spirit<00:01:19.139> will<00:01:19.259> come<00:01:19.289> to<00:01:19.710> for

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
the raw spirit will come to for

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.940 
the raw spirit will come to for
strengthening<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.030> purification<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.710> we

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
strengthening and purification and we

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.190 
strengthening and purification and we
have<00:01:23.189> four<00:01:23.520> columns<00:01:23.909> here<00:01:24.149> you<00:01:24.689> can<00:01:24.869> see<00:01:25.020> then

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
have four columns here you can see then

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.200 
have four columns here you can see then
the<00:01:25.319> right<00:01:25.499> all<00:01:25.799> which<00:01:26.369> really<00:01:26.549> helps<00:01:26.909> in

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the right all which really helps in

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.359 
the right all which really helps in
terms<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.749> producing<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.740> lighter<00:01:28.979> cleaner

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
terms of producing a lighter cleaner

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.830 
terms of producing a lighter cleaner
spirit<00:01:29.850> which<00:01:30.030> respectively<00:01:30.389> what<00:01:30.569> we<00:01:30.659> want

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
spirit which respectively what we want

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.180 
spirit which respectively what we want
from<00:01:30.929> Belvedere

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.800 

once<00:01:38.190> this<00:01:38.520> war<00:01:38.850> spirit<00:01:39.300> has<00:01:39.420> gone<00:01:39.570> through

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
once this war spirit has gone through

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.960 
once this war spirit has gone through
those<00:01:40.080> four<00:01:40.409> columns<00:01:40.710> we're<00:01:41.460> left<00:01:41.700> with

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
those four columns we're left with

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.820 
those four columns we're left with
rectifies<00:01:42.720> through<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.110> which<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.650> the

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
rectifies through it which is the

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.910 
rectifies through it which is the
Belvedere<00:01:44.400> but<00:01:44.610> full<00:01:44.880> strength<00:01:45.240> Belvedere

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
Belvedere but full strength Belvedere

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.190 
Belvedere but full strength Belvedere
this<00:01:46.920> then<00:01:47.190> goes<00:01:47.369> through<00:01:47.869> dilution<00:01:48.869> we're

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
this then goes through dilution we're

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.980 
this then goes through dilution we're
again<00:01:49.470> using<00:01:49.950> our<00:01:50.240> artisanal<00:01:51.240> water<00:01:51.509> to

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
again using our artisanal water to

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.080 
again using our artisanal water to
reduce<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.590> strength<00:01:52.800> of<00:01:52.979> Belvedere<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.759> 40

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
reduce the strength of Belvedere to 40

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.330 
reduce the strength of Belvedere to 40
percent<00:01:54.210> bottling<00:01:54.930> strength<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.979> at<00:01:56.190> this

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
percent bottling strength is at this

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.249 
percent bottling strength is at this
point<00:01:56.610> we<00:01:56.790> then<00:01:56.820> take<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.509> Belvedere<00:01:57.930> through

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
point we then take the Belvedere through

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.859 
point we then take the Belvedere through
a<00:01:58.500> filter<00:01:59.190> we<00:01:59.670> take<00:01:59.850> it<00:01:59.970> through<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.300> charcoal

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
a filter we take it through to charcoal

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.050 
a filter we take it through to charcoal
filters<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.890> does<00:02:02.070> lots<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.460> things<00:02:02.729> but

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
filters this does lots of things but

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.480 
filters this does lots of things but
predominately<00:02:03.570> removes<00:02:03.990> any<00:02:04.650> off<00:02:04.800> notes<00:02:05.190> and

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
predominately removes any off notes and

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.760 
predominately removes any off notes and
smells<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.149> might<00:02:06.360> still<00:02:06.660> be<00:02:06.899> left<00:02:07.410> over

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
smells that might still be left over

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.510 
smells that might still be left over
after<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.220> distillation<00:02:08.610> process<00:02:10.009> so<00:02:11.009> vodka

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
after the distillation process so vodka

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.430 
after the distillation process so vodka
is<00:02:11.670> really<00:02:11.910> broken<00:02:12.120> into<00:02:12.510> two<00:02:12.660> categories<00:02:12.870> you

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
is really broken into two categories you

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.220 
is really broken into two categories you
have<00:02:13.470> neutral<00:02:14.280> vodka<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:15.000> still<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.660> have<00:02:15.840> no

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
have neutral vodka that still to have no

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.770 
have neutral vodka that still to have no
taste<00:02:16.530> no<00:02:16.890> flavor<00:02:17.280> aroma<00:02:17.580> then<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.480> have<00:02:18.660> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
taste no flavor aroma then you have the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.140 
taste no flavor aroma then you have the
other<00:02:18.959> type<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.560> vodka<00:02:19.890> which<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:20.550> vodka<00:02:20.850> with

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
other type of vodka which is vodka with

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.660 
other type of vodka which is vodka with
character<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.320> Belvedere<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.040> this<00:02:23.459> is

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
character this is Belvedere and this is
