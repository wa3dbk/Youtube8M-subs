00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:19.620 
bit about actually getting your seeds

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.250 
bit about actually getting your seeds
from<00:00:20.040> the<00:00:20.190> fruit<00:00:20.630> because<00:00:21.630> what<00:00:21.960> I've<00:00:22.050> found

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
from the fruit because what I've found

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.020 
from the fruit because what I've found
is<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.530> all<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.070> fruits<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.850> buy

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.030 
is that all of the fruits that I buy

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.790 
is that all of the fruits that I buy
from<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.360> store<00:00:24.660> which<00:00:25.020> are<00:00:25.260> commercially

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
from the store which are commercially

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.950 
from the store which are commercially
grown<00:00:25.980> they<00:00:26.790> actually<00:00:27.090> have<00:00:27.210> no<00:00:27.420> seeds<00:00:27.780> in

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
grown they actually have no seeds in

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.560 
grown they actually have no seeds in
them<00:00:28.110> or<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.920> may<00:00:29.070> find<00:00:29.280> some<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.790> had<00:00:30.000> some

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
them or you may find some that had some

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.709 
them or you may find some that had some
very<00:00:30.870> tiny<00:00:31.230> black<00:00:31.590> seeds<00:00:32.329> but<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.600> know

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
very tiny black seeds but you know

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.270 
very tiny black seeds but you know
they're<00:00:33.960> undeveloped<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.890> they're<00:00:35.100> nowhere

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
they're undeveloped and they're nowhere

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.579 
they're undeveloped and they're nowhere
near<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.699> size<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.539> person<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.170> said<00:00:37.410> that

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:37.589 
near the size of a person and said that

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:40.069 
near the size of a person and said that
you<00:00:37.679> want<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.949> look<00:00:38.129> for<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:39.079> basically

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
you want to look for and basically

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.419 
you want to look for and basically
they're<00:00:40.320> not<00:00:40.350> going<00:00:40.589> to<00:00:40.649> germinate<00:00:41.039> for<00:00:41.280> you

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:41.429 
they're not going to germinate for you

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:43.849 
they're not going to germinate for you
so<00:00:42.359> what<00:00:42.659> I<00:00:42.690> did<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.109> went<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.440> our<00:00:43.649> local

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:43.859 
so what I did is went to our local

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:45.590 
so what I did is went to our local
market<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.550> someone<00:00:44.999> were<00:00:45.089> selling<00:00:45.420> some

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
market and someone were selling some

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.049 
market and someone were selling some
persimmons<00:00:46.100> that<00:00:47.100> they<00:00:47.219> grew<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.730> their<00:00:47.909> own

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
persimmons that they grew on their own

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.779 
persimmons that they grew on their own
tree<00:00:48.329> which<00:00:49.019> was<00:00:49.140> grown<00:00:49.409> locally<00:00:49.609> and<00:00:50.609> what<00:00:50.760> I

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
tree which was grown locally and what I

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.639 
tree which was grown locally and what I
found<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.269> that<00:00:51.390> all<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.600> those<00:00:51.929> fruits

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
found is that all of those fruits

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.369 
found is that all of those fruits
actually<00:00:52.890> had<00:00:53.280> decent<00:00:53.850> seeds<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.300> them<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.199> I

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
actually had decent seeds in them and I

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.439 
actually had decent seeds in them and I
managed<00:00:55.679> to<00:00:55.800> get<00:00:55.890> them<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> germinate<00:00:56.519> so<00:00:57.390> if

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
managed to get them to germinate so if

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.759 
managed to get them to germinate so if
you<00:00:57.569> guys<00:00:57.659> want<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.140> get<00:00:58.260> some<00:00:58.440> persimmons

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
you guys want to get some persimmons

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:04.399 
you guys want to get some persimmons
seeds<00:01:02.690> you<00:01:03.690> know<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.839> friend<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.290> has<00:01:04.379> a

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
seeds you know a friend that has a

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.770 
seeds you know a friend that has a
persimmon<00:01:04.800> tree<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:06.090> winter<00:01:06.360> when<00:01:06.690> they

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
persimmon tree and in winter when they

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.120 
persimmon tree and in winter when they
come<00:01:06.960> into<00:01:07.140> season<00:01:07.350> see<00:01:07.680> if<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:07.979> give

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
come into season see if you can give

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.289 
come into season see if you can give
some<00:01:08.159> fruit<00:01:09.229> some<00:01:10.229> seeds<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.880> these<00:01:15.060> are<00:01:15.210> my

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
some fruit some seeds so these are my

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.850 
some fruit some seeds so these are my
person<00:01:15.659> ones<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.049> grew<00:01:16.259> from<00:01:16.380> seed<00:01:16.649> and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
person ones that I grew from seed and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.039 
person ones that I grew from seed and
they're<00:01:17.159> looking<00:01:17.399> pretty<00:01:17.430> cool<00:01:17.840> they<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:18.869> a

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
they're looking pretty cool they have a

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.139 
they're looking pretty cool they have a
quite<00:01:19.320> interesting<00:01:19.710> way<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.310> growing<00:01:20.549> how<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
quite interesting way of growing how the

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.080 
quite interesting way of growing how the
seed<00:01:21.740> coating<00:01:22.740> gets<00:01:23.189> shoved<00:01:23.460> out<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.909> soil

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
seed coating gets shoved out of the soil

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.990 
seed coating gets shoved out of the soil
and<00:01:24.360> then<00:01:25.079> eventually<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:26.310> leaves<00:01:26.520> will<00:01:26.729> push

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
and then eventually the leaves will push

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.569 
and then eventually the leaves will push
that<00:01:27.210> open<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.780> come<00:01:28.590> out<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.159> one<00:01:29.369> has

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
that open and come out like this one has

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.300 
that open and come out like this one has
here<00:01:29.960> now<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:30.990> tried<00:01:31.469> two<00:01:31.710> methods<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> grow

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
here now I tried two methods to grow

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.149 
here now I tried two methods to grow
these<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:33.659> first<00:01:33.899> method<00:01:34.259> was<00:01:34.469> using<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
these the first method was using the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.550 
these the first method was using the
paper<00:01:35.369> towel<00:01:35.670> method<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.840> put<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> seeds

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
paper towel method so I put the seeds

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.520 
paper towel method so I put the seeds
inside<00:01:38.039> a<00:01:38.430> paper<00:01:39.000> towel<00:01:39.359> and<00:01:39.630> then<00:01:39.719> into<00:01:40.500> a

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
inside a paper towel and then into a

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.069 
inside a paper towel and then into a
ziplock<00:01:41.009> bag<00:01:41.810> now<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:44.270> put<00:01:45.270> four<00:01:45.539> seeds<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.049> here

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
ziplock bag now I put four seeds in here

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.109 
ziplock bag now I put four seeds in here
and<00:01:46.649> these<00:01:47.159> are<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.429> three<00:01:47.700> here<00:01:47.969> that

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
and these are the three here that

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.719 
and these are the three here that
germinated<00:01:48.689> there<00:01:49.679> was<00:01:49.770> one<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.399> did<00:01:50.609> not

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
germinated there was one that did not

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.370 
germinated there was one that did not
germinate<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.359> it<00:01:51.479> was<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.719> bit<00:01:51.929> smaller<00:01:52.229> than

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
germinate and it was a bit smaller than

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.200 
germinate and it was a bit smaller than
the<00:01:52.560> other<00:01:52.649> seeds<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.549> could<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:53.789> be<00:01:54.060> to

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
the other seeds so it could just be to

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.870 
the other seeds so it could just be to
do<00:01:54.359> with<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:55.890> know<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.280> seed<00:01:56.520> wasn't

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
do with you know that the seed wasn't

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.539 
do with you know that the seed wasn't
fully<00:01:57.119> developed<00:01:57.630> I'm<00:01:57.929> not<00:01:58.109> too<00:01:58.259> sure<00:01:58.530> but<00:01:58.560> you

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
fully developed I'm not too sure but you

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.800 
fully developed I'm not too sure but you
know<00:01:59.700> three<00:01:59.939> out<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.090> four<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.390> pretty<00:02:00.600> good<00:02:00.749> I

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
know three out of four is pretty good I

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.130 
know three out of four is pretty good I
reckon<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.920> was<00:02:02.490> quite<00:02:02.759> effective<00:02:03.020> now<00:02:04.020> two

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
reckon so it was quite effective now two

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.719 
reckon so it was quite effective now two
of<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.530> seeds<00:02:04.799> only<00:02:04.979> took<00:02:05.189> about<00:02:05.249> two<00:02:05.700> weeks

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
of the seeds only took about two weeks

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.999 
of the seeds only took about two weeks
to<00:02:06.270> germinate<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:07.109> I<00:02:07.229> let<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.439> photo<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.859> what

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
to germinate and I let a photo of what

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.529 
to germinate and I let a photo of what
they<00:02:08.100> look<00:02:08.220> like<00:02:08.280> after<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.970> couple<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.420> weeks

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
they look like after a couple of weeks

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.140 
they look like after a couple of weeks
of<00:02:10.140> being<00:02:10.740> in<00:02:10.920> their<00:02:11.069> ziplock<00:02:11.340> bag

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.089 

photo<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:16.780> transplanted<00:02:17.319> them<00:02:17.650> into<00:02:17.829> these

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
photo I transplanted them into these

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.970 
photo I transplanted them into these
pots<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:19.120> after<00:02:19.720> only<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:19.959> couple<00:02:20.200> of<00:02:20.379> days<00:02:20.590> I

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
pots and after only a couple of days I

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.860 
pots and after only a couple of days I
could<00:02:21.430> already<00:02:21.549> see<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:21.939> seed<00:02:22.180> coat<00:02:22.420> pushing

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
could already see the seed coat pushing

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.110 
could already see the seed coat pushing
its<00:02:22.989> way<00:02:23.049> out<00:02:23.349> of<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.590> soil<00:02:23.769> and<00:02:24.519> at<00:02:24.790> first<00:02:24.939> I

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
its way out of the soil and at first I

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.399 
its way out of the soil and at first I
thought<00:02:25.150> it<00:02:25.360> was<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.510> bit<00:02:25.720> weird<00:02:25.959> and<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.230> thought

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
thought it was a bit weird and I thought

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.309 
thought it was a bit weird and I thought
I<00:02:26.470> maybe<00:02:26.829> I<00:02:26.980> buried<00:02:27.879> it<00:02:27.970> too<00:02:28.209> shallow<00:02:28.569> but<00:02:29.170> um

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
I maybe I buried it too shallow but um

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.050 
I maybe I buried it too shallow but um
turns<00:02:29.650> out<00:02:29.829> it<00:02:29.950> was<00:02:30.069> just<00:02:30.099> a<00:02:30.400> shoving<00:02:30.760> its<00:02:30.909> way

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
turns out it was just a shoving its way

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.630 
turns out it was just a shoving its way
out<00:02:31.269> of<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.450> soil<00:02:31.659> and<00:02:32.370> doing<00:02:33.370> what<00:02:33.519> it's

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
out of the soil and doing what it's

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.530 
out of the soil and doing what it's
supposed<00:02:33.939> to<00:02:34.030> do

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
supposed to do

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.080 
supposed to do
now<00:02:35.439> this<00:02:35.650> little<00:02:35.859> guy<00:02:36.099> over<00:02:36.129> here<00:02:36.640> took<00:02:37.030> a

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
now this little guy over here took a

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.710 
now this little guy over here took a
further<00:02:37.480> two<00:02:37.810> weeks<00:02:38.079> to<00:02:38.620> actually<00:02:39.010> germinate

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
further two weeks to actually germinate

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.330 
further two weeks to actually germinate
so<00:02:40.720> he<00:02:40.870> took<00:02:41.049> about<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.319> month<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.950> start

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
so he took about a month to start

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.460 
so he took about a month to start
sprouting<00:02:42.849> roots<00:02:43.090> in<00:02:43.359> the<00:02:43.540> ziplock<00:02:43.870> bag

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
sprouting roots in the ziplock bag

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.960 
sprouting roots in the ziplock bag
so<00:02:46.470> what<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.770> want<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.040> do<00:02:47.190> is<00:02:47.490> be<00:02:47.760> patient

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
so what you want to do is be patient

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:48.500 
so what you want to do is be patient
with<00:02:48.330> it

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
with it

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.690 
with it
and<00:02:48.690> don't<00:02:48.960> give<00:02:49.110> up<00:02:49.230> too<00:02:49.440> soon<00:02:49.470> because<00:02:50.130> you

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
and don't give up too soon because you

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.760 
and don't give up too soon because you
know<00:02:50.820> they<00:02:51.000> can<00:02:51.300> take<00:02:51.600> longer<00:02:52.350> than<00:02:52.620> each

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
know they can take longer than each

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.250 
know they can take longer than each
other<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.250> germinate<00:02:54.030> so<00:02:54.600> I'm<00:02:54.810> guessing<00:02:55.110> it's

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
other to germinate so I'm guessing it's

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.800 
other to germinate so I'm guessing it's
all<00:02:55.560> just<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.890> matter<00:02:56.070> of<00:02:56.160> time<00:02:56.970> seed<00:02:57.360> strength

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
all just a matter of time seed strength

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.220 
all just a matter of time seed strength
or<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:58.920> know<00:02:59.040> something<00:02:59.310> like<00:02:59.550> that<00:03:00.230> so

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
or you know something like that so

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.900 
or you know something like that so
that's<00:03:01.440> that<00:03:01.590> method<00:03:01.980> now<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.430> second<00:03:02.820> method

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
that's that method now the second method

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.450 
that's that method now the second method
I<00:03:03.150> used<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.690> germinate<00:03:04.200> these<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.280> one

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
I used to germinate these is this one

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.280 
I used to germinate these is this one
here<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.910> planted<00:03:06.330> directly<00:03:06.540> into<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.080> soil

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
here I planted directly into the soil

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.710 
here I planted directly into the soil
and<00:03:07.710> it's<00:03:08.550> doing<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.850> really<00:03:09.060> good<00:03:09.240> job

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
and it's doing a really good job

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.570 
and it's doing a really good job
I<00:03:09.750> believe<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.380> one<00:03:10.590> here<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:10.980> about<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.400> week

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
I believe this one here is about a week

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.910 
I believe this one here is about a week
and<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.820> half<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:12.390> two<00:03:12.600> weeks<00:03:12.630> older<00:03:13.590> than<00:03:13.740> these

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
and a half to two weeks older than these

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.600 
and a half to two weeks older than these
ones<00:03:14.130> so<00:03:14.940> I<00:03:14.970> planted<00:03:15.420> it<00:03:15.510> beforehand<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.610> all

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
ones so I planted it beforehand and all

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.070 
ones so I planted it beforehand and all
I<00:03:17.640> did<00:03:17.790> was<00:03:17.940> just<00:03:18.210> shove<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:18.450> into<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.840> soil

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
I did was just shove it into the soil

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.500 
I did was just shove it into the soil
give<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.740> water<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.490> keep<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.180> in<00:03:21.270> a<00:03:21.300> warm

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
give it a water and keep it in a warm

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.660 
give it a water and keep it in a warm
spot<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.170> you<00:03:22.890> know<00:03:23.010> it's<00:03:23.220> doing<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.490> great<00:03:23.580> job

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
spot and you know it's doing a great job

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.610 
spot and you know it's doing a great job
it's<00:03:24.150> pushed<00:03:24.450> open<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.810> seed<00:03:25.050> coating<00:03:25.470> and

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
it's pushed open the seed coating and

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.949 
it's pushed open the seed coating and
they're<00:03:26.580> still<00:03:26.850> attached<00:03:27.209> onto<00:03:27.480> this<00:03:27.720> leaf

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
they're still attached onto this leaf

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.690 
they're still attached onto this leaf
and<00:03:28.410> I'm<00:03:28.770> just<00:03:28.920> leaving<00:03:29.070> it<00:03:29.280> there<00:03:29.430> cause<00:03:29.550> I

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
and I'm just leaving it there cause I

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.180 
and I'm just leaving it there cause I
reckon<00:03:29.850> it<00:03:30.030> looks<00:03:30.180> kind<00:03:30.390> of<00:03:30.450> cool<00:03:30.950> there<00:03:31.950> some

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
reckon it looks kind of cool there some

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.520 
reckon it looks kind of cool there some
what<00:03:32.550> I<00:03:32.580> found<00:03:32.970> is<00:03:33.300> that<00:03:33.570> if<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.900> plant<00:03:34.170> your

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
what I found is that if you plant your

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.860 
what I found is that if you plant your
persimmons<00:03:35.220> into<00:03:35.520> the<00:03:35.610> pot<00:03:35.850> make<00:03:36.510> sure<00:03:36.540> you

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
persimmons into the pot make sure you

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.770 
persimmons into the pot make sure you
use<00:03:37.080> quite<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.470> deep<00:03:37.800> pot<00:03:38.190> this<00:03:39.090> one<00:03:39.270> here<00:03:39.510> is<00:03:39.570> so

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
use quite a deep pot this one here is so

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.890 
use quite a deep pot this one here is so
shallow<00:03:40.110> and<00:03:40.470> already<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.970> roots<00:03:42.270> are<00:03:42.660> coming

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
shallow and already the roots are coming

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.650 
shallow and already the roots are coming
out<00:03:43.110> at<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.230> bottom<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:44.360> you<00:03:45.360> know<00:03:45.480> that's

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
out at the bottom and you know that's

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.360 
out at the bottom and you know that's
not<00:03:45.840> good<00:03:46.050> for<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.260> plant<00:03:46.500> that<00:03:46.680> root<00:03:46.920> beer<00:03:47.160> is

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
not good for the plant that root beer is

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.360 
not good for the plant that root beer is
now<00:03:47.610> well<00:03:48.209> it<00:03:48.330> looks<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.570> me<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.959> be<00:03:49.080> dead<00:03:49.370> so

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
now well it looks to me to be dead so

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.520 
now well it looks to me to be dead so
what<00:03:50.640> I'll<00:03:50.730> do<00:03:50.910> today<00:03:51.209> is<00:03:51.510> transplant<00:03:52.350> this

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
what I'll do today is transplant this

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.040 
what I'll do today is transplant this
into<00:03:52.769> a<00:03:52.800> larger<00:03:53.160> pot<00:03:53.340> so<00:03:53.640> he<00:03:53.820> can<00:03:54.090> get<00:03:54.840> some

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
into a larger pot so he can get some

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.930 
into a larger pot so he can get some
decent<00:03:55.170> roots<00:03:55.530> growing<00:03:55.860> okay<00:03:56.400> so<00:03:56.459> let's<00:03:56.850> check

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
decent roots growing okay so let's check

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:10.900 
decent roots growing okay so let's check
out<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.300> roots<00:03:57.480> of<00:03:57.690> this<00:03:57.870> guy

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.780 

so<00:04:11.910> check<00:04:12.360> that<00:04:12.390> out<00:04:12.890> it<00:04:13.890> basically<00:04:14.400> just<00:04:14.580> has

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
so check that out it basically just has

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.610 
so check that out it basically just has
one<00:04:14.819> tap<00:04:15.300> root<00:04:15.540> with<00:04:15.720> a<00:04:15.750> few<00:04:16.049> little<00:04:16.410> side

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
one tap root with a few little side

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.430 
one tap root with a few little side
shoots<00:04:16.919> on<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.250> but<00:04:18.180> yeah<00:04:18.750> that<00:04:18.989> just<00:04:19.169> proves

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
shoots on it but yeah that just proves

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.379 
shoots on it but yeah that just proves
that<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:19.799> do<00:04:19.980> want<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.250> put<00:04:20.459> it<00:04:20.549> in<00:04:20.639> a<00:04:20.790> nice

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
that you do want to put it in a nice

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.300 
that you do want to put it in a nice
deep<00:04:21.720> pot<00:04:22.019> when<00:04:22.200> you<00:04:22.230> plant<00:04:22.560> it<00:04:22.770> because<00:04:23.160> they

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
deep pot when you plant it because they

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.750 
deep pot when you plant it because they
do<00:04:23.370> have<00:04:23.639> quite<00:04:23.970> deep<00:04:24.240> tap<00:04:24.690> roots<00:04:25.010> so<00:04:26.010> you<00:04:26.520> know

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
do have quite deep tap roots so you know

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.480 
do have quite deep tap roots so you know
you<00:04:26.820> want<00:04:27.090> it<00:04:27.270> to<00:04:27.510> be<00:04:27.840> able<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:28.080> have<00:04:28.169> a<00:04:28.200> good

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
you want it to be able to have a good

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.420 
you want it to be able to have a good
area<00:04:29.490> of<00:04:29.639> room<00:04:29.880> to<00:04:30.180> grow<00:04:30.930> well<00:04:31.280> but<00:04:32.280> I<00:04:32.310> think

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
area of room to grow well but I think

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.770 
area of room to grow well but I think
that's<00:04:32.760> going<00:04:32.970> to<00:04:33.030> shoot<00:04:33.210> out<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:33.389> hit<00:04:33.600> more

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
that's going to shoot out a hit more

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.050 
that's going to shoot out a hit more
roots<00:04:33.990> when<00:04:34.200> I<00:04:34.230> planted<00:04:34.620> it<00:04:34.680> into<00:04:34.919> here<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:35.580> you

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
roots when I planted it into here so you

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.450 
roots when I planted it into here so you
should<00:04:36.240> do<00:04:36.389> a<00:04:36.419> good<00:04:36.570> job<00:04:40.010> now<00:04:41.010> I'm<00:04:41.130> using<00:04:41.310> the

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
should do a good job now I'm using the

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.670 
should do a good job now I'm using the
same<00:04:41.490> mix<00:04:41.910> of<00:04:42.060> soil<00:04:42.330> in<00:04:42.570> this<00:04:42.810> pot<00:04:43.080> that<00:04:43.110> I<00:04:43.350> used

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
same mix of soil in this pot that I used

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.190 
same mix of soil in this pot that I used
for<00:04:44.130> in<00:04:44.250> here<00:04:44.460> and<00:04:44.700> plus<00:04:45.450> I've<00:04:45.630> just<00:04:45.840> mixed<00:04:46.080> in

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
for in here and plus I've just mixed in

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.590 
for in here and plus I've just mixed in
the<00:04:46.320> original<00:04:46.710> soil<00:04:46.919> so<00:04:47.310> it<00:04:47.370> shouldn't<00:04:47.640> be<00:04:48.090> too

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
the original soil so it shouldn't be too

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
the original soil so it shouldn't be too
worried<00:04:49.470> about<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:50.160> transplant<00:04:53.930> like<00:04:54.930> so<00:04:55.290> and

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
worried about the transplant like so and

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.370 
worried about the transplant like so and
just<00:04:56.090> cover<00:04:57.090> them<00:04:57.300> up<00:04:57.480> with<00:04:57.660> a<00:04:57.900> little<00:04:58.200> bit

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
just cover them up with a little bit

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.860 
just cover them up with a little bit
more<00:04:58.620> soil

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.260 

so<00:05:02.870> there<00:05:03.200> we<00:05:03.290> go<00:05:03.560> and<00:05:04.040> he's<00:05:04.340> got<00:05:04.610> a<00:05:04.820> heap<00:05:05.120> of

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
so there we go and he's got a heap of

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.600 
so there we go and he's got a heap of
room<00:05:05.450> in<00:05:05.600> there<00:05:05.690> to<00:05:05.840> grow<00:05:06.130> he<00:05:07.130> looks<00:05:07.310> a<00:05:07.400> little

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
room in there to grow he looks a little

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.520 
room in there to grow he looks a little
bit<00:05:07.850> dwarf<00:05:08.240> in<00:05:08.450> there<00:05:08.630> growing<00:05:08.870> in<00:05:09.080> a<00:05:09.170> mess<00:05:09.380> of

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
bit dwarf in there growing in a mess of

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.400 
bit dwarf in there growing in a mess of
pot<00:05:09.770> but<00:05:10.070> he's<00:05:11.000> going<00:05:11.210> to<00:05:11.270> take<00:05:11.510> off<00:05:11.660> and<00:05:12.080> the

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
pot but he's going to take off and the

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.860 
pot but he's going to take off and the
spring<00:05:12.740> I<00:05:12.860> reckon<00:05:13.160> and<00:05:13.450> you<00:05:14.450> know<00:05:14.600> there's

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
spring I reckon and you know there's

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.300 
spring I reckon and you know there's
lots<00:05:15.020> of<00:05:15.200> nutrients<00:05:15.620> in<00:05:15.800> there<00:05:15.950> for<00:05:16.100> him<00:05:16.190> to

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
lots of nutrients in there for him to

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.520 
lots of nutrients in there for him to
grow<00:05:16.490> so<00:05:17.390> of<00:05:17.510> course<00:05:17.690> the<00:05:17.900> last<00:05:18.050> thing<00:05:18.170> I'll<00:05:18.350> do

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
grow so of course the last thing I'll do

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:30.280 
grow so of course the last thing I'll do
is<00:05:18.680> just<00:05:18.710> give<00:05:19.070> them<00:05:19.220> a<00:05:19.400> bit<00:05:19.580> of<00:05:19.610> a<00:05:19.760> water<00:05:29.290> and

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
is just give them a bit of a water and

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.890 
is just give them a bit of a water and
there<00:05:30.650> we<00:05:30.770> have<00:05:30.920> it<00:05:31.040> one<00:05:31.510> transplanted<00:05:32.510> so

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
there we have it one transplanted so

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.540 
there we have it one transplanted so
probably<00:05:33.230> within<00:05:33.380> the<00:05:33.530> next<00:05:33.620> week<00:05:33.950> or<00:05:34.190> so<00:05:34.370> I'll

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
probably within the next week or so I'll

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.370 
probably within the next week or so I'll
transplant<00:05:35.030> these<00:05:35.150> three<00:05:35.450> as<00:05:35.570> well<00:05:35.780> and<00:05:36.080> then

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
transplant these three as well and then

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.230 
transplant these three as well and then
hopefully<00:05:36.620> they'll<00:05:36.950> have<00:05:37.070> a<00:05:37.130> chance<00:05:37.400> to<00:05:37.700> catch

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
hopefully they'll have a chance to catch

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.840 
hopefully they'll have a chance to catch
up<00:05:38.360> to<00:05:38.420> this<00:05:38.600> one<00:05:38.780> anyway<00:05:39.650> before<00:05:39.830> I<00:05:40.040> go<00:05:40.280> little
