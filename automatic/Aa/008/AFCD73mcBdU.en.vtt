00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
few cables I like the power cable is

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.760 
few cables I like the power cable is
pretty<00:00:37.950> sick<00:00:38.160> one<00:00:38.370> that's<00:00:38.610> good<00:00:39.739> what<00:00:40.739> I

didn't like is on the PCI Express
connectors<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.050> get<00:00:43.789> you<00:00:44.789> get<00:00:44.940> six<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.420> total

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
connectors you get you get six in total

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.410 
connectors you get you get six in total
the<00:00:45.930> three<00:00:46.230> are<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.860> one<00:00:47.550> length<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.149> other

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
three are another length that I didn't

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.590 
three are another length that I didn't
like<00:00:52.760> because<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:54.000> wish<00:00:54.149> there<00:00:54.300> were<00:00:54.360> all<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
like because I wish there were all the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.040 
like because I wish there were all the
same<00:00:54.629> length<00:00:55.020> but<00:00:55.430> you<00:00:56.430> know<00:00:56.579> because<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.840> my

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
same length but you know because in my

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.830 
same length but you know because in my
case<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.410> do<00:00:58.469> SLI<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.070> need<00:00:59.550> these<00:01:00.210> are<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:00.600> long

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
case I do SLI I need these are for long

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.889 
case I do SLI I need these are for long
cables<00:01:01.289> or<00:01:01.500> for<00:01:01.739> short<00:01:01.770> cables<00:01:02.629> but<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.750> this

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
cables or for short cables but in this

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.329 
cables or for short cables but in this
case<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.619> know<00:01:04.710> you're<00:01:04.830> going<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.040> get<00:01:05.100> three

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
case you know you're going to get three

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.850 
case you know you're going to get three
of<00:01:05.460> each<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.990> got<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.229> use<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.500> short<00:01:07.740> in

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
of each so you got to use to short in

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.789 
of each so you got to use to short in
too<00:01:08.010> long<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.520> know<00:01:08.670> depending<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.540> how<00:01:09.799> you

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
too long you know depending on how you

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.940 
too long you know depending on how you
need<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.100> route<00:01:11.340> them<00:01:11.580> or<00:01:11.760> whatever<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:14.070> molex

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
need to route them or whatever the molex

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.340 
need to route them or whatever the molex
cables

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
cables

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.810 
cables
and<00:01:18.439> the<00:01:19.159> power<00:01:19.460> SATA<00:01:19.909> cables<00:01:21.460> again<00:01:22.460> I<00:01:22.490> didn't

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
and the power SATA cables again I didn't

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.429 
and the power SATA cables again I didn't
really<00:01:22.939> like<00:01:23.119> them<00:01:23.360> either<00:01:23.450> because<00:01:23.960> in<00:01:24.290> my

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
really like them either because in my

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.740 
really like them either because in my
case<00:01:24.740> I<00:01:25.100> only<00:01:25.970> use<00:01:26.330> one<00:01:28.119> money<00:01:29.119> using<00:01:29.299> one<00:01:29.509> hard

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
case I only use one money using one hard

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.090 
case I only use one money using one hard
drive<00:01:30.369> it's<00:01:31.369> a<00:01:31.640> ciggy<00:01:32.180> Barracuda<00:01:32.780> 7200<00:01:33.710> RPM

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
drive it's a ciggy Barracuda 7200 RPM

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.719 
drive it's a ciggy Barracuda 7200 RPM
one<00:01:34.520> terabyte<00:01:35.170> but<00:01:36.170> obviously<00:01:36.740> I<00:01:37.040> would

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
one terabyte but obviously I would

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.430 
one terabyte but obviously I would
expect<00:01:38.030> them<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:38.360> release<00:01:38.570> make<00:01:38.810> a<00:01:38.840> cable<00:01:39.259> for

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
expect them to release make a cable for

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.620 
expect them to release make a cable for
two<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:40.070> in<00:01:40.820> this<00:01:40.940> case<00:01:41.149> you<00:01:41.299> only<00:01:41.360> make

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
two and in this case you only make

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.070 
two and in this case you only make
cables<00:01:42.020> for<00:01:42.320> three<00:01:42.710> at<00:01:42.920> a<00:01:42.950> time<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:44.810> for<00:01:45.049> the

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
cables for three at a time and for the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.130 
cables for three at a time and for the
mole<00:01:45.320> lakes<00:01:45.590> they<00:01:45.799> make<00:01:46.070> either<00:01:46.930> they<00:01:47.930> have

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
mole lakes they make either they have

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.919 
mole lakes they make either they have
one<00:01:48.380> for<00:01:48.590> either<00:01:48.710> three<00:01:49.159> mullets<00:01:49.549> and<00:01:52.780> one<00:01:53.780> for

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
one for either three mullets and one for

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.300 
one for either three mullets and one for
three<00:01:54.140> mullets<00:01:54.350> another<00:01:54.830> one<00:01:55.009> with<00:01:55.130> three

mullets and one floppy powered after I

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.919 
mullets and one floppy powered after I
don't<00:01:58.520> like<00:01:58.610> you<00:01:58.819> them<00:01:59.149> because<00:01:59.420> i<00:01:59.509> only<00:01:59.659> use

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
don't like you them because i only use

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.980 
don't like you them because i only use
two<00:02:00.140> molex<00:02:00.560> for<00:02:00.800> two<00:02:00.979> DVD<00:02:01.399> hard<00:02:01.580> drives<00:02:01.990> but

third molex I'll see if I snip it off

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.999 
third molex I'll see if I snip it off
just<00:02:08.539> to<00:02:08.690> have<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:09.110> because<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:09.619> know<00:02:09.739> I'm
