approximately 75% of your maximal
intensity<00:02:28.560> now<00:02:29.560> we're<00:02:29.710> warmed<00:02:29.980> up<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:30.220> ready

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
intensity now we're warmed up and ready

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.280 
intensity now we're warmed up and ready
take<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:30.760> minute<00:02:31.030> break<00:02:31.210> now<00:02:31.450> we're<00:02:32.110> ready<00:02:32.230> to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
take a minute break now we're ready to

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.619 
take a minute break now we're ready to
hit<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.410> workout

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.390 

there's<00:02:36.629> endless<00:02:36.870> variations<00:02:37.799> of<00:02:38.010> different

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
there's endless variations of different

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.550 
there's endless variations of different
set<00:02:38.849> and<00:02:39.000> rep<00:02:39.180> schemes<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.900> different

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
set and rep schemes and different

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.899 
set and rep schemes and different
patterns<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:41.099> you<00:02:41.189> can<00:02:41.220> do<00:02:41.430> with<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.640> feet

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
patterns that you can do with the feet

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:43.580 
patterns that you can do with the feet
so<00:02:42.510> I'm<00:02:42.599> keep<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.900> simple<00:02:43.200> for<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.439> guys

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
so I'm keep it simple for you guys

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.380 
so I'm keep it simple for you guys

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
because be impossible to cover all them

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.300 
because be impossible to cover all them
today<00:02:45.569> I'm<00:02:46.409> going<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.620> tell<00:02:46.709> you<00:02:46.769> to<00:02:46.860> do<00:02:46.950> 20

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
today I'm going to tell you to do 20

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.770 
today I'm going to tell you to do 20
minutes<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.819> workouts<00:02:48.120> going<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.329> last<00:02:48.450> 20

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
minutes the workouts going to last 20

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.149 
minutes the workouts going to last 20
minutes<00:02:49.019> are<00:02:49.110> going<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.290> run<00:02:49.500> up<00:02:49.709> at<00:02:49.950> maximum

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
minutes are going to run up at maximum

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.880 
minutes are going to run up at maximum
intensity<00:02:50.549> so<00:02:50.939> it's<00:02:51.090> 100%<00:02:51.569> speed<00:02:52.140> up<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:52.530> then

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
intensity so it's 100% speed up and then

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.860 
intensity so it's 100% speed up and then
going<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.099> walk<00:02:53.340> down<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.879> stairs<00:02:54.090> I'm<00:02:54.659> gonna

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
going to walk down the stairs I'm gonna

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.089 
going to walk down the stairs I'm gonna
demonstrate<00:02:54.989> a<00:02:55.319> few<00:02:55.439> different<00:02:55.739> patterns

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
demonstrate a few different patterns

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.289 
demonstrate a few different patterns
that<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.370> guys<00:02:56.519> could<00:02:56.760> start<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.090> integrate

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
that you guys could start to integrate

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.220 
that you guys could start to integrate
into<00:02:57.599> your<00:02:57.689> workout

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.119 

we're<00:03:03.230> going<00:03:03.349> to<00:03:03.409> start<00:03:03.590> with<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.739> basic

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
we're going to start with the basic

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.250 
we're going to start with the basic
pattern<00:03:04.519> basic<00:03:05.299> pattern<00:03:05.629> essentially<00:03:06.080> means

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
pattern basic pattern essentially means

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.559 
pattern basic pattern essentially means
every<00:03:06.830> step<00:03:07.099> will<00:03:07.340> get<00:03:07.549> touched<00:03:07.790> by<00:03:08.150> opposite

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
every step will get touched by opposite

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.600 
every step will get touched by opposite
feet<00:03:08.750> step<00:03:09.470> one<00:03:09.739> is<00:03:09.860> going<00:03:09.980> to<00:03:10.040> be<00:03:10.190> left<00:03:10.370> foot

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
feet step one is going to be left foot

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.119 
feet step one is going to be left foot
step<00:03:10.940> two<00:03:11.209> right<00:03:11.569> foot<00:03:11.840> step<00:03:12.530> three<00:03:12.890> is<00:03:13.010> going

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
step two right foot step three is going

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:14.289 
step two right foot step three is going
to<00:03:13.190> be<00:03:13.310> left<00:03:13.519> foot<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:13.819> we're<00:03:14.120> going<00:03:14.180> to

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
to be left foot and we're going to

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:15.640 
to be left foot and we're going to
continue<00:03:14.450> that<00:03:14.750> pattern<00:03:14.930> all<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.260> way<00:03:15.349> up<00:03:15.500> to

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
continue that pattern all the way up to

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.710 
continue that pattern all the way up to
the<00:03:15.739> top<00:03:15.940> want<00:03:16.940> to<00:03:17.000> make<00:03:17.090> sure<00:03:17.120> you<00:03:17.269> focus<00:03:17.510> on

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
the top want to make sure you focus on

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.660 
the top want to make sure you focus on
your<00:03:17.870> arm<00:03:18.080> swing<00:03:18.319> as<00:03:18.590> well<00:03:18.769> when<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.310> left<00:03:19.489> leg

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
your arm swing as well when the left leg

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.539 
your arm swing as well when the left leg
is<00:03:19.849> up<00:03:19.879> the<00:03:20.540> right<00:03:20.750> hand<00:03:21.019> will<00:03:21.200> be<00:03:21.230> up<00:03:21.549> once

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
is up the right hand will be up once

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:23.619 
is up the right hand will be up once
we're<00:03:22.730> setting<00:03:22.970> this<00:03:23.030> position<00:03:23.420> we're<00:03:23.599> going

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
we're setting this position we're going

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.240 
we're setting this position we're going
to<00:03:23.750> sprint<00:03:24.019> maximal<00:03:24.530> intensity<00:03:24.980> all<00:03:25.099> the<00:03:25.190> way

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
to sprint maximal intensity all the way

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:34.900 
to sprint maximal intensity all the way
to<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.489> top<00:03:33.129> so<00:03:34.129> once<00:03:34.250> we<00:03:34.340> get<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:34.579> top<00:03:34.760> and

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
to the top so once we get to the top and

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:42.530 
to the top so once we get to the top and
we're<00:03:35.060> going<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.209> a<00:03:35.299> walk<00:03:35.540> down<00:03:35.780> pattern

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.610 

the<00:03:43.540> next<00:03:43.810> technique<00:03:44.110> I'm<00:03:44.260> going<00:03:44.319> to<00:03:44.439> show<00:03:44.530> you

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
the next technique I'm going to show you

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.360 
the next technique I'm going to show you
is<00:03:45.010> more<00:03:45.280> intense<00:03:45.579> it<00:03:45.849> doubles<00:03:46.750> stair<00:03:46.959> running

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
is more intense it doubles stair running

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.149 
is more intense it doubles stair running
so<00:03:48.370> now<00:03:48.579> essentially<00:03:49.260> step<00:03:50.260> one<00:03:50.500> has<00:03:50.650> no<00:03:50.890> foot

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
so now essentially step one has no foot

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.569 
so now essentially step one has no foot
on<00:03:51.310> it

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
on it

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.330 
on it
step<00:03:51.939> two<00:03:52.209> left<00:03:52.810> step<00:03:53.290> three<00:03:53.620> has<00:03:53.799> no<00:03:53.980> foot<00:03:54.220> on

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
step two left step three has no foot on

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.550 
step two left step three has no foot on
it<00:03:54.489> step<00:03:54.970> four<00:03:55.269> right<00:03:55.629> so<00:03:56.230> I'm<00:03:56.290> going<00:03:56.409> to<00:03:56.439> take

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
it step four right so I'm going to take

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.649 
it step four right so I'm going to take
two<00:03:56.739> steps<00:03:56.950> at<00:03:57.159> a<00:03:57.189> time<00:03:57.250> all<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.670> way<00:03:57.760> up<00:03:57.939> the

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:58.659 
two steps at a time all the way up the

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:06.720 
two steps at a time all the way up the
arm<00:03:58.689> movement<00:03:59.290> remains<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.769> same<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:06.280> again

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
arm movement remains the same and again

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:13.820 
arm movement remains the same and again
I'm<00:04:06.790> going<00:04:06.879> to<00:04:06.939> use<00:04:07.060> a<00:04:07.090> walk<00:04:07.299> down<00:04:07.480> recovery

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.130 

and<00:04:14.000> the<00:04:15.000> last<00:04:15.240> technique<00:04:15.600> I'm<00:04:15.780> going<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.990> show

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
and the last technique I'm going to show

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.410 
and the last technique I'm going to show
you<00:04:16.170> is<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.440> crossover<00:04:16.920> technique<00:04:17.250> be<00:04:18.239> sure

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
you is a crossover technique be sure

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.120 
you is a crossover technique be sure
when<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.690> do<00:04:18.810> a<00:04:18.840> crossover<00:04:19.260> technique<00:04:19.560> they

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
when you do a crossover technique they

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.430 
when you do a crossover technique they
do<00:04:20.190> equal<00:04:20.700> repetitions<00:04:21.420> on<00:04:21.600> each<00:04:21.630> side<00:04:22.170> so

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
do equal repetitions on each side so

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.900 
do equal repetitions on each side so
we're<00:04:23.100> going<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.280> start<00:04:23.520> with<00:04:23.640> the<00:04:23.730> right

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
we're going to start with the right

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.200 
we're going to start with the right
crossing<00:04:24.900> over<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.260> left<00:04:25.610> however<00:04:26.610> many<00:04:26.940> sets

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
crossing over the left however many sets

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.790 
crossing over the left however many sets
I<00:04:27.330> do<00:04:27.390> with<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:27.690> right<00:04:27.840> over<00:04:28.080> left<00:04:28.230> I'm<00:04:28.560> going

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
I do with the right over left I'm going

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.990 
I do with the right over left I'm going
to<00:04:28.890> alternate<00:04:29.220> with<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.460> left<00:04:29.670> over<00:04:29.910> the

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
to alternate with the left over the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.990 
to alternate with the left over the
right<00:04:30.980> the<00:04:31.980> patterns<00:04:32.400> will<00:04:32.520> look<00:04:32.670> similar

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
right the patterns will look similar

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.340 
right the patterns will look similar
very<00:04:33.330> similar<00:04:33.600> to<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.780> warm<00:04:34.020> up<00:04:34.170> we're<00:04:34.260> going

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
very similar to the warm up we're going

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.220 
very similar to the warm up we're going
to<00:04:34.410> step<00:04:34.620> over<00:04:34.830> and<00:04:35.820> up<00:04:36.030> over<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:36.930> up<00:04:37.020> and

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
to step over and up over and up and

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.560 
to step over and up over and up and
continue<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:37.680> all<00:04:37.890> the<00:04:37.980> way<00:04:38.070> up<00:04:38.360> this<00:04:39.360> one

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
continue that all the way up this one

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.450 
continue that all the way up this one
will<00:04:39.780> have<00:04:40.350> less<00:04:40.620> speed<00:04:40.980> they'll<00:04:41.220> have<00:04:41.310> less

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
will have less speed they'll have less

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.400 
will have less speed they'll have less
of<00:04:41.610> a<00:04:41.670> speed<00:04:41.970> element<00:04:42.420> than<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:42.990> first<00:04:43.200> two<00:04:43.380> I

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
of a speed element than the first two I

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.980 
of a speed element than the first two I
showed<00:04:43.770> you<00:04:43.980> but<00:04:44.490> it<00:04:44.580> does<00:04:44.700> work<00:04:44.940> your<00:04:45.540> glute

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
showed you but it does work your glute

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.750 
showed you but it does work your glute
medius<00:04:46.140> and<00:04:46.560> all<00:04:47.100> your<00:04:47.220> abductors<00:04:47.640> is<00:04:47.700> a

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
medius and all your abductors is a

00:04:47.760 --> 00:05:00.500 
medius and all your abductors is a
different<00:04:48.090> way<00:04:59.060> again<00:05:00.060> we'll<00:05:00.180> use<00:05:00.210> a<00:05:00.300> walk

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
different way again we'll use a walk

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:07.129 
different way again we'll use a walk
down<00:05:00.690> recovery

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:08.629 

so<00:05:07.620> there<00:05:07.740> you<00:05:07.830> have<00:05:07.889> it<00:05:08.009> you<00:05:08.159> have<00:05:08.189> some<00:05:08.400> great

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
so there you have it you have some great

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.369 
so there you have it you have some great
