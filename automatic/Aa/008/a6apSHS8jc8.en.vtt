00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.250
 good evening from la in the king blacksmiths shell 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.410
 the new site that is ready for the stars 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.390
 in exchange and bakers are about to open 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.230
 and that will sell mobile phones 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:19.960
 regenerated but really like new if the 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:21.970
 my operator approaches you show 1 the 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.070
 first model we decided to 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.770
 put up for sale on the site that will be 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.960

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.720
 fantastic motorola v3 will come in 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.890
 three different colors black like this 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.290
 gray and gold color 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.570
 I wanted to show you this video because 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.450
 probably one who hears about 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.399
 phone and make you so it is regenerated yes 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.160
 imagine a ruined phone i used 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.840
 scratched that doesn't work but actually 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.500
 may be the phone in question there 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.840
 see 13 perfect mounting only 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.480
 original pieces with electronics 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.430
 regenerated certified phones that 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.559
 we sell are all tried one by one 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.490
 but really seriously 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.380
 so either the various sims and yes they are 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.200
 they present so perfectly new 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.929
 see me from below with the films for 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.450
 the first time you look at 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:20.249
 protection back 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.249
 then we find the front film 

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:31.060
 this is clearly the film on 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:34.599
 slide that lives by removing this for 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.700
 show you the accuracy if you check 

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:42.969
 on the keyboard and on the display 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.810
 film here too no and this is the 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.659
 teramo 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.299
 look this is a boot king I am not there 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:53.049
 non-original pieces the phone is everything 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:57.959
 original motorola and electronic parts 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:02:00.840
 regenerated comes with 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:05.529
 battery charger clearly 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.379
 earphone cable cd data with programs 

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:10.119
 to connect it to the PC 

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:11.250
 this is a br50 battery that with the 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.250
 equipment 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:19.349
 this is the back cover that that 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:22.450
 clearly protected from the film 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:26.709
 remove that you see this is a bit 3 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.329
 true does not feed fake 13 made with pieces 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.219
 doubts this is a three to all 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.250
 effects that the only thing used 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:35.019
 let's say regenerated tested that has 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.640
 electronic we turn it on we've seen 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.560
 a tim card 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.420
 clearly the 3 cards inside the route 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.909
 and they don't work because they 've only been for two years 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.500
 ts therefore can use with the various 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:49.329
 classic tim wind vodafone managers i 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.480
 operators even if they are not 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:55.989
 umts operators the phone turns on 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.670
 that if our search number of the 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.109
 network in progress the battery of charity 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.700
 even the batteries are absolutely 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:05.379
 new minor generated here the tim is a bit 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.659
 low signal so will do some 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:11.200
 difficulty catching the net but the 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:14.099
 phone is coming soon into the network e 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.379
 we will make a phone call to show you 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.780
 how it works I move for a moment 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:22.680
 to look for the network in the qua team 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.680
 it is what it is 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.430
 a moment yet here it is here but arrived 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.560
 I really repeat my sector not here 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.960
 neither does the network take the prize 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.520
 laboratory we make a call to 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:53.050
 number of our office for example 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:58.600
 0341 or wrong 0341 28 16 30 call 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.600
 of a heard voice 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:08.280
 everything works perfectly is the 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:09.900
 classic motorola menu so all two 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.010
 settings then all that 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.940

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.170

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:35.130
 that we sell for a little price 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.170
