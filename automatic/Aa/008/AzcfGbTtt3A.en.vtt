00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.990 
disappointing for us and so you know it
was<00:00:36.840> kind<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.800> time<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.370> just<00:00:38.520> sit<00:00:38.730> back<00:00:38.940> and

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
was kind of a time to just sit back and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.590 
was kind of a time to just sit back and
try<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.680> you<00:00:40.680> know<00:00:40.770> think<00:00:41.070> about<00:00:41.270> you<00:00:42.270> know<00:00:42.390> why

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
try to you know think about you know why

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.720 
try to you know think about you know why
we<00:00:42.809> do<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.200> why<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.620> skate<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.190> try<00:00:44.670> to

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
we do this why we skate and try to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.040 
we do this why we skate and try to
remember<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.950> know<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.250> kind<00:00:47.489> of

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
remember that and so you know it kind of

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.180 
remember that and so you know it kind of
maybe<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.230> was<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> little<00:00:49.620> bit<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.010> good

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
maybe it was a little bit of a good

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.010 
maybe it was a little bit of a good
thing<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.520> be<00:00:50.640> off<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.969> ice<00:00:51.000> too<00:00:51.420> because<00:00:51.840> then

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
thing to be off the ice too because then

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.750
