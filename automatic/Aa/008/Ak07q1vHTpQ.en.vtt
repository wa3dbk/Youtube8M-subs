be<00:04:07.860> a<00:04:08.010> on<00:04:08.100> unfortunately<00:04:09.060> even<00:04:09.270> though<00:04:09.480> I

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
be a on unfortunately even though I

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.180 
be a on unfortunately even though I
would<00:04:09.690> love<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:09.900> see<00:04:10.170> that<00:04:10.200> monster<00:04:10.770> take<00:04:10.980> him

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
would love to see that monster take him

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.520 
would love to see that monster take him
down<00:04:11.490> but<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:12.030> think<00:04:12.810> he's<00:04:12.990> going<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.290> get<00:04:13.380> him

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
down but I think he's going to get him

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.080 
down but I think he's going to get him
next<00:04:13.680> Chaplin<00:04:14.100> any<00:04:14.280> seals<00:04:14.640> gonna<00:04:14.820> have<00:04:14.970> to

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
next Chaplin any seals gonna have to

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.760 
next Chaplin any seals gonna have to
step<00:04:15.300> in<00:04:15.480> because<00:04:15.510> he's<00:04:16.200> probably<00:04:16.410> just<00:04:16.590> gonna

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
step in because he's probably just gonna

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.430 
step in because he's probably just gonna
annihilate<00:04:17.250> those<00:04:17.760> three<00:04:18.090> girls<00:04:18.270> and<00:04:18.959> the

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
annihilate those three girls and the

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.289 
annihilate those three girls and the
next<00:04:19.830> chapter<00:04:20.100> cuz<00:04:20.430> if<00:04:20.549> he<00:04:20.670> already<00:04:20.820> defeated

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
next chapter cuz if he already defeated

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.330 
next chapter cuz if he already defeated
them<00:04:21.540> before<00:04:21.960> he<00:04:22.440> just<00:04:22.710> didn't<00:04:22.919> kill<00:04:23.130> them

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
them before he just didn't kill them

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.580 
them before he just didn't kill them
then<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:23.790> mean<00:04:24.510> second<00:04:24.990> breath<00:04:25.140> you<00:04:25.260> never<00:04:25.470> know

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
then I mean second breath you never know

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.150 
then I mean second breath you never know
they<00:04:25.740> might<00:04:25.950> be<00:04:26.100> able<00:04:26.160> to<00:04:26.280> do<00:04:26.400> some<00:04:26.610> damage

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
they might be able to do some damage

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.450 
they might be able to do some damage
but<00:04:27.280> I<00:04:27.310> see<00:04:27.700> either<00:04:27.910> or<00:04:28.240> a<00:04:29.070> second<00:04:30.070> possibility

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
but I see either or a second possibility

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.250 
but I see either or a second possibility
as<00:04:30.790> he<00:04:30.940> might<00:04:31.090> retreat<00:04:31.630> because<00:04:31.780> it's<00:04:32.080> too

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
as he might retreat because it's too

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.890 
as he might retreat because it's too
many<00:04:32.410> people<00:04:32.800> you<00:04:33.220> know<00:04:33.340> got<00:04:33.760> Ichigo<00:04:34.240> got<00:04:34.570> the

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
many people you know got Ichigo got the

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.290 
many people you know got Ichigo got the
monster<00:04:35.440> you<00:04:35.470> got<00:04:35.710> three<00:04:36.040> girls<00:04:36.520> and<00:04:36.940> not<00:04:37.150> to

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
monster you got three girls and not to

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.300 
monster you got three girls and not to
mention<00:04:37.390> Chad<00:04:37.840> an<00:04:38.020> order<00:04:38.260> he<00:04:38.410> made<00:04:38.620> you<00:04:39.190> know

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
mention Chad an order he made you know

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.130 
mention Chad an order he made you know
things<00:04:39.580> could<00:04:39.760> get<00:04:39.880> crazy<00:04:40.030> so<00:04:40.480> it's<00:04:40.930> possible

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
things could get crazy so it's possible

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.020 
things could get crazy so it's possible
that<00:04:41.470> he<00:04:41.680> might<00:04:41.830> stand<00:04:42.190> down<00:04:42.430> and<00:04:42.700> you<00:04:42.940> know

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
that he might stand down and you know

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.490 
that he might stand down and you know
retreat<00:04:43.480> and<00:04:43.630> why<00:04:43.720> not<00:04:43.900> I<00:04:43.930> don't<00:04:44.110> think<00:04:44.380> he

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
retreat and why not I don't think he

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.710 
retreat and why not I don't think he
will<00:04:44.710> because<00:04:45.160> a<00:04:45.370> buck<00:04:46.030> beard<00:04:46.300> wouldn't<00:04:46.630> like

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
will because a buck beard wouldn't like

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.060 
will because a buck beard wouldn't like
that<00:04:46.900> at<00:04:46.960> all<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:47.440> I'm<00:04:47.530> sure<00:04:47.680> but<00:04:47.890> beer

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
that at all and I'm sure but beer

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.470 
that at all and I'm sure but beer
probably<00:04:48.460> kill<00:04:48.640> him<00:04:48.850> if<00:04:48.970> he<00:04:49.000> does<00:04:49.240> return

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
probably kill him if he does return

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.720 
probably kill him if he does return
without<00:04:49.840> completing<00:04:50.590> the<00:04:50.770> mission<00:04:50.800> so<00:04:51.340> he

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
without completing the mission so he

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.030 
without completing the mission so he
