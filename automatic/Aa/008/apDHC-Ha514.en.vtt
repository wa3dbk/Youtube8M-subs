the genuine article because Australia's
four-wheel<00:00:19.590> drive<00:00:19.859> tracks<00:00:20.250> are<00:00:20.430> such<00:00:20.640> that

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
four-wheel drive tracks are such that

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.660 
four-wheel drive tracks are such that
they<00:00:21.330> will<00:00:21.510> rip<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.990> tear<00:00:22.230> apart<00:00:22.619> just<00:00:23.400> about

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
they will rip and tear apart just about

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.070 
they will rip and tear apart just about
any<00:00:24.029> four-wheel<00:00:24.720> drive<00:00:24.960> product<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.560> tires

any four-wheel drive product and tires

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.660 
any four-wheel drive product and tires
certainly<00:00:28.080> one<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.680> most<00:00:28.859> common<00:00:29.460> that

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
certainly one of the most common that

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.609 
certainly one of the most common that
they<00:00:29.820> will<00:00:30.029> damage<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:31.170> thought<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.500> was

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
they will damage so I thought it was

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.770 
they will damage so I thought it was
time<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:31.980> had<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> look<00:00:32.309> at<00:00:32.460> our<00:00:32.579> cooper<00:00:32.969> st<00:00:33.420> max

time we had a look at our cooper st max
these<00:00:34.440> are<00:00:34.500> attire<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:34.920> we<00:00:35.219> put<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.700> at<00:00:36.030> the

these are attire that we put on at the
start<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.780> season<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.460> let's<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.579> a

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
start of this season and let's have a

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.760 
start of this season and let's have a
look<00:00:38.790> at<00:00:38.879> how<00:00:39.000> they've<00:00:39.180> gone<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:40.320> tracks<00:00:40.649> that

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
look at how they've gone the tracks that

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.470 
look at how they've gone the tracks that
we've<00:00:40.950> been<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.399> certainly<00:00:42.000> haven't<00:00:42.390> been

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
we've been on certainly haven't been

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.750 
we've been on certainly haven't been
easy<00:00:42.870> probably<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.710> toughest<00:00:44.190> has<00:00:44.370> been<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
easy probably the toughest has been the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.209 
easy probably the toughest has been the
give<00:00:44.969> River<00:00:45.270> Road<00:00:45.480> but<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.289> also<00:00:46.440> took<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.920> bunch

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
give River Road but we also took a bunch

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.729 
give River Road but we also took a bunch
of<00:00:47.340> diversions<00:00:47.969> off<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.539> up<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:49.170> Columba<00:00:49.680> row

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739

cape<00:00:50.430> leveque<00:00:50.610> these<00:00:51.480> are<00:00:51.750> sort<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:51.989> locations

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
cape leveque these are sort of locations

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.760 
cape leveque these are sort of locations
that<00:00:53.190> will<00:00:53.399> seriously<00:00:54.090> kill<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.629> tire<00:00:54.960> they've

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
that will seriously kill a tire they've

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.189 
that will seriously kill a tire they've
also<00:00:56.039> been<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.789> morton<00:00:57.390> island<00:00:57.510> well<00:00:58.050> that's

also been to morton island well that's

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.869 
also been to morton island well that's
an<00:00:58.320> easy<00:00:58.410> one<00:00:58.739> for<00:00:58.770> tires<00:00:59.160> but<00:00:59.699> they've

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
an easy one for tires but they've

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.029 
an easy one for tires but they've
traveled<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.480> glasshouse<00:01:00.719> mountains<00:01:01.039> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
traveled to the glasshouse mountains the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.189 
traveled to the glasshouse mountains the
rocks<00:01:02.340> have<00:01:02.550> Mount<00:01:02.820> Hotham<00:01:03.120> down<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.629> Victoria

different Road miles in between now what

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.370 
different Road miles in between now what
I'm<00:01:11.970> probably<00:01:12.119> most<00:01:12.420> impressed<00:01:12.960> about<00:01:13.080> with

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
I'm probably most impressed about with

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.800 
I'm probably most impressed about with
these<00:01:13.560> tires<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.310> their<00:01:14.670> lack<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:14.939> chipping<00:01:15.689> a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
these tires is their lack of chipping a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.080 
these tires is their lack of chipping a
lot<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.409> four-wheel<00:01:16.710> drive<00:01:16.979> tires<00:01:17.369> really

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
lot of four-wheel drive tires really

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.929 
lot of four-wheel drive tires really

problem that you can have with tires on
rocky<00:01:37.110> roads<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:38.159> rocks<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.640> stones<00:01:38.939> can

rocky roads is that rocks and stones can

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.840 
rocky roads is that rocks and stones can
actually<00:01:39.570> burrow<00:01:39.960> their<00:01:40.320> way<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:41.009> between<00:01:41.400> the

actually burrow their way in between the
lugs<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.240> your<00:01:42.360> tires<00:01:42.630> now<00:01:42.990> once<00:01:43.500> they<00:01:43.680> get<00:01:43.890> in

lugs of your tires now once they get in

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.789 
lugs of your tires now once they get in
there<00:01:44.280> they'll<00:01:44.729> cause<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:44.970> slow<00:01:45.329> leak<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.899> if

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
there they'll cause a slow leak and if

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.310 
there they'll cause a slow leak and if
that<00:01:47.009> pressure<00:01:47.340> goes<00:01:47.640> down<00:01:47.840> then<00:01:48.840> you're

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
that pressure goes down then you're

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.719 
that pressure goes down then you're
going<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.500> have<00:01:49.619> all<00:01:49.770> sorts<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:50.159> problems<00:01:50.340> with

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
going to have all sorts of problems with

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.819 
going to have all sorts of problems with
tires<00:01:51.060> exploding<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.990> all<00:01:52.350> sorts<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.680> nasty

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
tires exploding and all sorts of nasty

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.950 
tires exploding and all sorts of nasty
stuff<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:53.520> what<00:01:54.000> Cooper<00:01:54.390> have<00:01:54.509> done<00:01:54.689> with<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
stuff but what Cooper have done with the

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.649 
stuff but what Cooper have done with the
St<00:01:55.290> max<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.770> actually<00:01:56.130> build<00:01:56.700> these<00:01:56.969> raised

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
St max is actually build these raised

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.230 
St max is actually build these raised
lugs<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.380> between<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.280> actually<00:01:59.610> prevents

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
lugs in between that actually prevents

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.630 
lugs in between that actually prevents
that<00:02:00.420> happening<00:02:00.930> not<00:02:01.619> only<00:02:01.920> does<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.100> do<00:02:02.369> that

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
that happening not only does it do that

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.170 
that happening not only does it do that
it<00:02:03.090> also<00:02:03.149> helps<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.079> mud<00:02:04.350> be<00:02:05.070> ejected<00:02:05.610> really

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
it also helps the mud be ejected really

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.690 
it also helps the mud be ejected really
quickly<00:02:06.630> from<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.079> tire<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.890> helps<00:02:08.369> itself

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
quickly from the tire so it helps itself

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.300 
quickly from the tire so it helps itself
clean<00:02:09.119> not<00:02:09.750> just<00:02:09.989> from<00:02:10.140> rocks<00:02:10.440> but<00:02:10.920> from<00:02:11.129> mud

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
clean not just from rocks but from mud

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
clean not just from rocks but from mud
as<00:02:11.430> well

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
as well

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330 
as well
something<00:02:13.050> else<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.290> really<00:02:13.740> look<00:02:13.920> for<00:02:14.160> in<00:02:14.280> a

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
something else to really look for in a

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.820 
something else to really look for in a
four-wheel-drive<00:02:14.700> tire<00:02:15.390> it's<00:02:16.050> not<00:02:16.320> just<00:02:16.620> all

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
four-wheel-drive tire it's not just all

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.740 
four-wheel-drive tire it's not just all
about<00:02:16.860> tread<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:17.850> about<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.330> construction

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
about tread it is about the construction

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.410 
about tread it is about the construction
of<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.620> tire<00:02:19.890> or<00:02:20.160> what's<00:02:20.460> under<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:20.970> tread

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
of the tire or what's under that tread

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.020 
of the tire or what's under that tread
I'm<00:02:21.810> talking<00:02:22.290> sidewalls<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.610> complete

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
I'm talking sidewalls and the complete

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.420 
I'm talking sidewalls and the complete
carcass<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:25.110> tire<00:02:25.440> because<00:02:25.980> it's<00:02:26.310> those

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
carcass of that tire because it's those

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.760 
carcass of that tire because it's those
things<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.850> we<00:02:27.060> don't<00:02:27.240> see<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.840> actually

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
things that we don't see that actually

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.790 
things that we don't see that actually
keep<00:02:29.070> our<00:02:29.280> tires<00:02:29.640> together<00:02:30.380> over<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.530> rough

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
keep our tires together over that rough

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.970 
keep our tires together over that rough
terrain<00:02:32.190> now<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.880> cooper<00:02:33.240> st<00:02:33.570> max<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.500> runs<00:02:34.770> a

terrain now the cooper st max it runs a
very<00:02:35.220> similar<00:02:35.610> construction<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.020> cooper

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
very similar construction to the cooper

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.920 
very similar construction to the cooper
st<00:02:37.950> t<00:02:38.250> which<00:02:38.460> is<00:02:38.490> a<00:02:38.640> very<00:02:38.910> serious<00:02:39.330> off-road

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
st t which is a very serious off-road

st t which is a very serious off-road
mud<00:02:40.320> terrain<00:02:40.680> tire<00:02:41.040> now<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.360> what's

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
mud terrain tire now this is what's

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.540 
mud terrain tire now this is what's
considered<00:02:42.810> an<00:02:43.260> all-terrain<00:02:43.710> tire<00:02:44.160> but<00:02:44.370> it's

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
considered an all-terrain tire but it's

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.640 
considered an all-terrain tire but it's
more<00:02:44.730> for<00:02:44.970> people<00:02:45.330> who<00:02:45.690> are<00:02:45.840> getting<00:02:46.020> into<00:02:46.440> the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
more for people who are getting into the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.680 
more for people who are getting into the
serious<00:02:47.100> bush<00:02:47.400> as<00:02:47.610> well<00:02:47.820> and<00:02:48.090> getting<00:02:48.510> in

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
serious bush as well and getting in

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.570 
serious bush as well and getting in
there<00:02:48.840> pretty<00:02:49.050> frequently<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:49.950> what<00:02:50.430> you've

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
there pretty frequently so what you've

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.690 
there pretty frequently so what you've
got<00:02:50.790> here<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.480> very<00:02:51.660> tough<00:02:52.260> tire<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:53.190> also

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
got here is a very tough tire that also

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.420 
got here is a very tough tire that also
has<00:02:54.150> great<00:02:54.510> manners<00:02:54.780> on-road<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.710> is<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.190> lot

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
has great manners on-road and is a lot

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.940 
has great manners on-road and is a lot
quieter<00:02:56.760> than<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.510> mud<00:02:57.810> terrain<00:02:58.140> tire<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:58.770> it

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
quieter than a mud terrain tire so it

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.500 
quieter than a mud terrain tire so it
really<00:02:59.460> does<00:02:59.760> give<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.150> best<00:03:00.330> of<00:03:00.450> both

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
really does give you the best of both

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.830 
really does give you the best of both
worlds<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.520> certainly<00:03:02.520> in<00:03:02.730> all<00:03:03.120> conditions<00:03:03.720> I

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
worlds and certainly in all conditions I

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.290 
worlds and certainly in all conditions I
can't<00:03:04.260> pull<00:03:04.710> these<00:03:05.070> tires<00:03:05.490> when<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.880> comes<00:03:06.090> to

can't pull these tires when it comes to

got for your fall drive make sure you

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.790 
got for your fall drive make sure you

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
on a lot of people will only adjust

on a lot of people will only adjust
their<00:03:26.520> tire<00:03:26.730> pressures<00:03:27.180> if<00:03:27.420> they're<00:03:27.840> driving

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
their tire pressures if they're driving

their tire pressures if they're driving
on<00:03:28.380> soft<00:03:28.709> sand<00:03:29.070> but<00:03:29.610> not<00:03:30.030> so<00:03:30.390> when<00:03:30.840> you're

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
on soft sand but not so when you're

driving on these rough dirt rocky roads

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.690 
driving on these rough dirt rocky roads
that's<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:33.959> great<00:03:34.290> time<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.590> lower<00:03:35.280> your<00:03:35.459> tire

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
that's a great time to lower your tire

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.580 
that's a great time to lower your tire
pressures<00:03:36.180> you'll<00:03:36.750> get<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:36.990> much<00:03:37.320> more

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590
