00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.600
 today on the occasion of the vi of 200 we prepare chocolate qulan 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.450
 The first thing we are going to do is separate the yolks from the egg whites 

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:13.319
 you can do it like that but with the same shell but eye, other, other 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.959
 in other previous videos 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:18.699
 we put a dash of baking 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.939
 and we started like that until we had it on the verge of snow I accelerated it 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.970
 so you can see 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.499
 that stay 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:29.009
 percent 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.169
 to the point of snow but once we turn around it does not fall 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.690
 but I wanted you to see everything the whole process at triple the speed 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.680
 of normal 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.990
 so approximately in 1 or 50 seconds 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.870
 you are right 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.680
 you would have as you see 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.680
 kaplan until you turn the container does not fall 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.770
 they call it we're going to beat it together with a spoonful the icing sugar 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.900
 until blanket 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.610
 bestial as we love beating 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.510
 they are taking a more ironic tone 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.630
 we put the rest of the sugar glas pedraza 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.570
 clear counted because we would have a meringue 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.670
 and we add life to no one else and we mix it well 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.060
 once we have everything well mixed 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.460
 we incorporated the meringue 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.460
 to the egg yolks 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.070
 and we mix it well let's melt the chocolate and the butter in the 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.980
 microwave oven 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.030
 at half power in about two and a half minutes 3 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.540
 notice the gun 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.830
 stir well to mix 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.970
 and once we have it well mixed 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.150
 we add it to it will not happen 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.900
 we are gradually removing a more or less enveloping movement for 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.380
 Do not let us down 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.560
 our mass 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.000
 and we will remove it until everything is perfectly integrated 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.920
 we went to a pastry bag 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.800
 to make it easier 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.040
 put in the molds 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.079
 i in loans to remove molds 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:11.319
 we left approximately firefighters from and a half 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.809
 in before reaching the edge because they will grow and if we are not made 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.939
 once we have the molds filled 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.039
 this is how it is 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:25.109
 with the oven preheated to 180 degrees 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.989
 I had it for five minutes 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.850
 but with I recommend 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.969
 and before that is only a test because each one is a world 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:34.689
 and this is the result that is how to have and egeda 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.689
 to the party as you see inside the coast 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:42.459
 delicious 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.360
 I hope you liked it until another
