00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
um you know this this first appeared in

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.019 
um you know this this first appeared in
the<00:00:22.980> Zelda<00:00:23.189> series<00:00:23.220> for<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.609> most<00:00:23.850> part

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
the Zelda series for the most part

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.310 
the Zelda series for the most part
anyway<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.539> wind<00:00:24.750> waker<00:00:24.840> although<00:00:25.289> i

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
anyway in the wind waker although i

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.839 
anyway in the wind waker although i
think<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.680> takes<00:00:25.980> some<00:00:26.279> elements<00:00:26.670> out<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.760> the

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
think it takes some elements out of the

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.179 
think it takes some elements out of the
previous<00:00:27.150> games<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:28.619> appearing<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.039> lot

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
previous games and it's appearing a lot

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.500 
previous games and it's appearing a lot
of<00:00:29.279> games<00:00:29.519> since<00:00:29.880> then<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.179> that's<00:00:30.300> kind<00:00:30.480> of

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
of games since then and that's kind of

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.370 
of games since then and that's kind of
what<00:00:30.630> i<00:00:30.660> want<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.869> talk<00:00:31.019> about<00:00:31.050> this

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
what i want to talk about this

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.819 
what i want to talk about this
prevalence<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.550> i<00:00:32.700> think<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.450> made<00:00:33.570> no

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
prevalence of it i think it made no

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.900 
prevalence of it i think it made no
secret<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> fact<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.370> i<00:00:35.489> didn't<00:00:35.790> really

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
secret of the fact that i didn't really

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.220 
secret of the fact that i didn't really
like<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.239> overworld<00:00:36.570> nonlinear<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.200> I

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
like the overworld nonlinear and I

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.510 
like the overworld nonlinear and I
thought<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.469> was<00:00:37.530> improved<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.340> some<00:00:38.460> of

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
thought it was improved on and some of

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.610 
thought it was improved on and some of
the<00:00:38.610> following<00:00:38.910> games<00:00:39.239> but<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.870> think<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.500> that

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the following games but I think it that

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.080 
the following games but I think it that
there<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> still<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> bigger<00:00:41.550> problem<00:00:41.790> with

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
there I still have a bigger problem with

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.729 
there I still have a bigger problem with
the<00:00:42.180> concept<00:00:42.570> overall<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.260> how<00:00:43.559> it's

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the concept overall and how it's

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.139 
the concept overall and how it's
executed<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.309> Zelda<00:00:44.670> though<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.820> don't<00:00:45.000> think

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
executed in Zelda though I don't think

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.510 
executed in Zelda though I don't think
it's<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.329> bad<00:00:45.450> concept<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.140> itself<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.219> just

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
it's a bad concept in itself and just

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.160 
it's a bad concept in itself and just
let<00:00:47.820> me<00:00:47.879> get<00:00:48.000> into<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.239> video<00:00:48.539> goes<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:48.870> um

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
let me get into this video goes on um

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.869

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
here is the fact that how many games

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.770 
here is the fact that how many games
have<00:00:52.770> used<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.160> because<00:00:53.390> after<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> winwaker

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.290 
series to really use it um you had games

that did not but they're only really
three<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.790> at<00:01:08.880> least<00:01:09.090> unless<00:01:09.270> I'm

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
three that at least unless I'm

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.670 
three that at least unless I'm

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.480 
was really a side game in a very big way
it's<00:01:15.540> not<00:01:15.720> really<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> major<00:01:16.350> zelda<00:01:16.770> game<00:01:16.920> uh

the minish cap which despite being very

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.990 
the minish cap which despite being very
similar<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.100> those<00:01:20.250> other<00:01:20.400> zelda<00:01:20.700> games<00:01:20.850> is

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
similar to those other zelda games is

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.789 
similar to those other zelda games is
also<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> sighting<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.049> twilight<00:01:22.680> princess

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
also a sighting in and twilight princess

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.120 
also a sighting in and twilight princess
which<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> only<00:01:23.549> major<00:01:24.150> release<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.770> all

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
which is the only major release of all

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.789 
which is the only major release of all
of<00:01:26.430> them<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.270> that's<00:01:27.450> two<00:01:28.140> major<00:01:28.439> games

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
of them and so that's two major games

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.560 
of them and so that's two major games
and<00:01:29.070> two<00:01:29.520> side<00:01:29.820> games<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.390> use<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
and two side games to use the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.850 
and two side games to use the
transportation<00:01:31.110> overall<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.680> there's

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
transportation overall so there's

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.810 
transportation overall so there's
definitely<00:01:31.920> no<00:01:32.189> denying<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.549> there's

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
definitely no denying that there's

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.940 
definitely no denying that there's
serious<00:01:33.329> prevalence<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.650> i<00:01:34.710> guess<00:01:34.860> i

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
serious prevalence of it and i guess i

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.770 
serious prevalence of it and i guess i
just<00:01:34.979> i<00:01:35.280> really<00:01:35.610> don't<00:01:35.759> get<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:35.939> i<00:01:36.210> mean<00:01:36.750> even

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
just i really don't get it i mean even

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.899 
just i really don't get it i mean even
if<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.110> don't<00:01:37.409> mind<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.430> really<00:01:38.579> think

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
if you don't mind it do you really think

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.020 
if you don't mind it do you really think
that<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.119> fits<00:01:39.360> zelda<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> long<00:01:40.200> haul<00:01:41.030> my

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
that it fits zelda in the long haul my

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.310 
that it fits zelda in the long haul my
opinion<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.630> conflicts<00:01:43.320> with

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
opinion is that it conflicts with

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.990 
opinion is that it conflicts with
exploration<00:01:43.860> even<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.670> wind<00:01:44.909> waker

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
exploration even in the wind waker

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.240 
exploration even in the wind waker
because<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:46.350> actually<00:01:46.710> very<00:01:46.740> similar<00:01:47.100> to

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
because it's actually very similar to

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.710 
because it's actually very similar to
the<00:01:47.340> hallway<00:01:47.759> problem<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.180> have<00:01:48.299> locked<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.659> a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the hallway problem we have locked in a

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.389 
the hallway problem we have locked in a
time<00:01:48.930> often<00:01:49.140> times<00:01:49.500> over<00:01:49.710> world<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.070> mostly

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
time often times over world is mostly

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.880 
time often times over world is mostly
like<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.970> big<00:01:51.299> empty<00:01:51.659> hub<00:01:51.930> with<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.500> bunch<00:01:52.740> of

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
like a big empty hub with a bunch of

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.620 
like a big empty hub with a bunch of
branching<00:01:53.369> hallways<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> problem

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
branching hallways and this is a problem

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.420 
branching hallways and this is a problem
I've<00:01:54.899> had<00:01:54.930> with<00:01:55.110> most<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.530> 3d<00:01:55.829> games<00:01:56.100> and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
I've had with most of the 3d games and

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.069 
I've had with most of the 3d games and
on<00:01:56.850> my<00:01:56.969> opinion<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> lot<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.689> handheld

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
on my opinion is a lot of the handheld

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.139 
on my opinion is a lot of the handheld
2d<00:01:58.439> games<00:01:58.619> really<00:01:59.070> did<00:01:59.430> better<00:01:59.579> with<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.909> the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
2d games really did better with this the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.330 
2d games really did better with this the
the<00:02:00.390> area's<00:02:00.689> didn't<00:02:00.960> feel<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.229> always<00:02:01.799> um

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
the area's didn't feel like always um

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.310 
the area's didn't feel like always um
and<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.509> think<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.840> while<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.079> wind<00:02:04.229> waker

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
and I think that while the wind waker

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.859 
and I think that while the wind waker
does<00:02:04.619> have<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.920> very<00:02:05.100> open<00:02:05.579> overworld<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
does have that very open overworld the

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.229 
does have that very open overworld the
opening<00:02:07.290> part<00:02:07.530> before<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:08.099> get<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:08.849> what

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
opening part before you get to like what

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.110 
opening part before you get to like what
was<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.509> forbidden<00:02:09.869> woods<00:02:10.020> was<00:02:10.890> very<00:02:11.580> very

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
was it the forbidden woods was very very

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.200 
was it the forbidden woods was very very
little<00:02:12.540> you're<00:02:12.690> only

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
little you're only

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.120 
little you're only
out<00:02:13.300> to<00:02:13.450> sail<00:02:13.660> down<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.840> long<00:02:14.110> specific<00:02:14.620> path<00:02:14.830> to

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
out to sail down a long specific path to

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.970 
out to sail down a long specific path to
get<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.310> dragon<00:02:16.270> roost<00:02:16.450> island<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.990> then<00:02:17.140> the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
get to dragon roost island and then the

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.460 
get to dragon roost island and then the
four<00:02:18.580> statements<00:02:18.850> respectively<00:02:19.510> but<00:02:20.260> after

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
four statements respectively but after

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.860 
four statements respectively but after
that<00:02:20.740> it<00:02:20.920> opened<00:02:21.160> up<00:02:21.220> but<00:02:21.400> even<00:02:21.610> then<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:22.720> me

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
that it opened up but even then to me

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.900 
that it opened up but even then to me
the<00:02:23.050> overworld<00:02:23.410> was<00:02:23.590> restricted<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.490> it

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
the overworld was restricted and it

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.400 
the overworld was restricted and it
didn't<00:02:25.180> make<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.480> want<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:26.050> free<00:02:26.230> gramma

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
didn't make you want to free gramma

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.840 
didn't make you want to free gramma
didn't<00:02:26.620> make<00:02:26.770> you<00:02:26.920> feel<00:02:27.190> like<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.550> were<00:02:27.670> free

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
didn't make you feel like you were free

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.610 
didn't make you feel like you were free
it<00:02:27.970> felt<00:02:28.240> like<00:02:28.390> if<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.660> wanted<00:02:29.020> to<00:02:29.140> explore

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
it felt like if you wanted to explore

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.560 
it felt like if you wanted to explore
you<00:02:30.100> had<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.340> commit<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:31.030> something<00:02:31.270> that<00:02:31.390> you

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
you had to commit to something that you

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.090 
you had to commit to something that you
were<00:02:31.660> forced<00:02:32.020> into<00:02:32.200> which<00:02:32.530> was<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:32.830> long

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
were forced into which was this long

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.160 
were forced into which was this long
period<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.610> waiting<00:02:33.850> and<00:02:34.180> I<00:02:34.750> think<00:02:34.930> that<00:02:35.050> for

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
period of waiting and I think that for

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.230 
period of waiting and I think that for
that<00:02:35.290> reason<00:02:35.500> when<00:02:35.890> mike<00:02:36.010> rizzo<00:02:36.280> really<00:02:36.910> isn't

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
that reason when mike rizzo really isn't

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.580 
that reason when mike rizzo really isn't
as<00:02:37.300> open<00:02:37.570> as<00:02:37.660> people<00:02:37.870> make<00:02:37.960> it<00:02:38.020> out<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.260> be<00:02:38.410> at

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
as open as people make it out to be at

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.260 
as open as people make it out to be at
least<00:02:38.770> not<00:02:38.950> in<00:02:39.100> terms<00:02:39.310> of<00:02:39.580> how<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:39.910> players

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
least not in terms of how the players

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.390 
least not in terms of how the players
going<00:02:40.570> to<00:02:40.690> approach<00:02:40.990> it<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.350> i<00:02:41.950> really<00:02:41.980> think

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
going to approach it and i really think

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.550 
going to approach it and i really think
that<00:02:42.520> it<00:02:42.820> in<00:02:43.120> general<00:02:43.870> though<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:44.410> this

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
that it in general though that this

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.380 
that it in general though that this
overworld<00:02:45.010> style<00:02:45.340> really<00:02:45.580> hampers<00:02:46.060> free<00:02:46.240> more

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
overworld style really hampers free more

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.180 
overworld style really hampers free more
like<00:02:46.780> free<00:02:47.020> roaming<00:02:47.320> gameplay<00:02:47.740> because<00:02:47.890> you

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
like free roaming gameplay because you

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.280 
like free roaming gameplay because you
really<00:02:48.490> have<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.910> buckle<00:02:49.630> down<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:49.960> do<00:02:50.260> a

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
really have to buckle down and do a

gave<00:04:19.330> you<00:04:19.480> the<00:04:19.930> more<00:04:20.230> fulfilling<00:04:20.950> land<00:04:21.430> areas

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
gave you the more fulfilling land areas

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.670 
gave you the more fulfilling land areas
to<00:04:22.060> mess<00:04:22.210> around<00:04:22.390> it<00:04:22.690> but<00:04:22.990> everything<00:04:23.380> else

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
to mess around it but everything else

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.480 
to mess around it but everything else
about<00:04:23.890> this<00:04:24.070> guy's<00:04:24.310> was<00:04:24.910> not<00:04:25.660> non<00:04:25.900> fulfilling

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
about this guy's was not non fulfilling

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.469 
about this guy's was not non fulfilling
and<00:04:26.550> again<00:04:26.819> it<00:04:26.940> was<00:04:27.030> pretty<00:04:27.210> much<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.360> same

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
and again it was pretty much the same

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.390 
and again it was pretty much the same
thing<00:04:27.630> over<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.020> over<00:04:28.169> again<00:04:28.349> the<00:04:29.069> levee<00:04:29.280> is

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
thing over and over again the levee is

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.400 
thing over and over again the levee is
battle<00:04:29.819> is<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.000> only<00:04:30.180> time<00:04:30.720> you<00:04:30.750> change<00:04:31.229> up

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
battle is the only time you change up

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.809 
battle is the only time you change up
the<00:04:31.530> pace<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:31.949> that's<00:04:32.099> just<00:04:32.220> for<00:04:32.400> one<00:04:32.580> fight

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:32.819 
the pace and that's just for one fight

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.779 
the pace and that's just for one fight
now<00:04:33.389> I<00:04:33.419> didn't<00:04:33.810> mind<00:04:34.050> aqua<00:04:34.530> timez<00:04:34.919> hallways<00:04:35.520> or

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
now I didn't mind aqua timez hallways or

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.689 
now I didn't mind aqua timez hallways or
the<00:04:36.240> one<00:04:36.389> with<00:04:36.479> your<00:04:36.660> sailing<00:04:37.039> once<00:04:38.039> you<00:04:38.550> know

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
the one with your sailing once you know

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.089 
the one with your sailing once you know
I<00:04:38.940> don't<00:04:39.360> think<00:04:39.539> this<00:04:39.780> l<00:04:39.960> series<00:04:40.199> despite<00:04:40.710> its

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
I don't think this l series despite its

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.400 
I don't think this l series despite its
like<00:04:41.340> core<00:04:41.699> tenancy<00:04:42.479> or<00:04:42.539> whatever<00:04:42.750> I<00:04:42.960> don't

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
like core tenancy or whatever I don't

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.930 
like core tenancy or whatever I don't
think<00:04:43.710> that<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:44.099> Zelda<00:04:44.340> series<00:04:44.370> is<00:04:44.729> core

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
think that the Zelda series is core

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.300 
think that the Zelda series is core
aspects<00:04:45.360> need<00:04:45.780> to<00:04:45.990> stay<00:04:46.319> that<00:04:46.349> way<00:04:46.680> for<00:04:47.039> every

occasional<00:04:49.710> deviation<00:04:50.310> as<00:04:50.430> long<00:04:50.580> as<00:04:50.759> the

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
occasional deviation as long as the

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.659 
occasional deviation as long as the
score<00:04:51.630> idea<00:04:51.930> is<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.380> main<00:04:52.770> idea<00:04:53.039> for<00:04:53.460> most

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
score idea is the main idea for most

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.120 
score idea is the main idea for most
games<00:04:54.139> but<00:04:55.139> what<00:04:55.259> I<00:04:55.289> don't<00:04:55.380> like<00:04:55.530> is<00:04:55.680> that<00:04:55.889> it's

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
games but what I don't like is that it's

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.980 
games but what I don't like is that it's
so<00:04:56.280> prevalent<00:04:56.610> with<00:04:56.940> this<00:04:57.120> and<00:04:57.389> for<00:04:57.810> both

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
so prevalent with this and for both

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.740 
so prevalent with this and for both
really<00:04:58.349> the<00:04:58.500> hallway<00:04:58.919> thing<00:04:59.190> is<00:04:59.460> in<00:05:00.240> spirits

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
really the hallway thing is in spirits

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.240 
really the hallway thing is in spirits
still<00:05:01.020> displayed<00:05:01.470> in<00:05:01.650> these<00:05:01.800> games<00:05:01.979> the

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
still displayed in these games the

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.339 
still displayed in these games the
transportation<00:05:02.880> /<00:05:02.970> worlds<00:05:03.449> and<00:05:03.630> then<00:05:04.229> the

transportation<00:05:04.889> of<00:05:04.949> worlds<00:05:05.310> themselves<00:05:05.849> have

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
transportation of worlds themselves have

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.879 
transportation of worlds themselves have
appeared<00:05:06.210> for<00:05:06.300> like<00:05:06.449> 4<00:05:06.750> games<00:05:06.960> now<00:05:07.139> well<00:05:07.830> the

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
appeared for like 4 games now well the

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.020 
appeared for like 4 games now well the
problem<00:05:08.250> i<00:05:08.340> have<00:05:08.490> here<00:05:08.729> is<00:05:08.819> that<00:05:08.909> i<00:05:08.970> don't

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
problem i have here is that i don't

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.960 
problem i have here is that i don't
think<00:05:09.360> that<00:05:09.419> this<00:05:09.659> is<00:05:10.069> does<00:05:11.069> this<00:05:11.250> this

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
think that this is does this this

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.210 
think that this is does this this
transportation<00:05:12.690> thing<00:05:12.990> is<00:05:13.349> a<00:05:13.650> good<00:05:13.979> fit<00:05:14.190> for

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
transportation thing is a good fit for

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.070 
transportation thing is a good fit for
what<00:05:14.580> i<00:05:14.759> consider<00:05:15.210> to<00:05:15.240> be<00:05:15.389> the<00:05:15.419> core<00:05:15.690> aspects

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
what i consider to be the core aspects

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.050 
what i consider to be the core aspects
the<00:05:16.199> series<00:05:16.470> that<00:05:16.560> may<00:05:16.680> excel<00:05:16.949> the<00:05:17.099> zelda<00:05:17.520> but

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
the series that may excel the zelda but

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.580 
the series that may excel the zelda but
i<00:05:18.090> don't<00:05:18.240> mind<00:05:18.360> it<00:05:18.569> just<00:05:18.599> once<00:05:19.020> but<00:05:19.199> it's<00:05:19.380> just

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
i don't mind it just once but it's just

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.469 
i don't mind it just once but it's just
too<00:05:19.800> much<00:05:19.830> of<00:05:20.220> it<00:05:20.310> i<00:05:20.430> don't<00:05:20.580> get<00:05:20.880> why<00:05:21.150> there's

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
too much of it i don't get why there's

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.140 
too much of it i don't get why there's
so<00:05:21.630> much<00:05:21.780> of<00:05:21.960> it<00:05:22.020> now<00:05:22.860> I'm<00:05:23.130> arguably<00:05:23.729> Nintendo

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
so much of it now I'm arguably Nintendo

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.469 
so much of it now I'm arguably Nintendo
needed<00:05:24.389> to<00:05:24.479> take<00:05:24.659> a<00:05:24.720> break<00:05:24.870> from<00:05:25.650> the<00:05:26.360> you<00:05:27.360> know

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
needed to take a break from the you know

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.529 
needed to take a break from the you know
the<00:05:27.599> free-roaming<00:05:28.139> land<00:05:28.680> travel<00:05:29.490> as<00:05:29.610> well<00:05:29.669> but

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
the free-roaming land travel as well but

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.800 
the free-roaming land travel as well but
if<00:05:30.870> that's<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.199> case<00:05:31.530> then<00:05:31.969> they<00:05:32.969> totally

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
if that's the case then they totally

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.560 
if that's the case then they totally
have<00:05:34.130> like<00:05:35.130> we<00:05:35.699> haven't<00:05:35.940> seen<00:05:36.060> that<00:05:36.210> a<00:05:36.240> long

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
have like we haven't seen that a long

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.270 
have like we haven't seen that a long
time<00:05:36.599> except<00:05:37.289> maybe<00:05:37.469> in<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:37.680> handheld<00:05:38.099> games

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
time except maybe in the handheld games

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.040 
time except maybe in the handheld games
so<00:05:38.820> I<00:05:38.849> think<00:05:39.000> it's<00:05:39.270> really<00:05:39.570> time<00:05:39.719> to<00:05:39.810> get<00:05:39.930> some

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
so I think it's really time to get some

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.540 
so I think it's really time to get some
of<00:05:40.080> that<00:05:40.139> bath<00:05:40.409> and<00:05:40.770> I<00:05:41.009> thought<00:05:41.130> that<00:05:41.280> scared

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
of that bath and I thought that scared

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.279 
of that bath and I thought that scared
sword<00:05:41.789> did<00:05:42.030> a<00:05:42.060> bit<00:05:42.389> but<00:05:42.570> only<00:05:43.050> with<00:05:43.169> the

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
sword did a bit but only with the

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:44.870 
sword did a bit but only with the
surface<00:05:43.680> gameplay<00:05:44.070> and<00:05:44.250> it's<00:05:44.370> still<00:05:44.639> the

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
surface gameplay and it's still the

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.029 
surface gameplay and it's still the
hallway<00:05:45.210> problem<00:05:45.690> but<00:05:46.110> I<00:05:46.139> felt<00:05:46.380> like<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.680> idea

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
hallway problem but I felt like the idea

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.430 
hallway problem but I felt like the idea
of<00:05:47.099> having<00:05:47.490> some<00:05:48.270> fulfilling<00:05:48.719> land<00:05:48.960> areas<00:05:49.289> was

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
of having some fulfilling land areas was

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.200 
of having some fulfilling land areas was
sort<00:05:49.710> of<00:05:49.770> brought<00:05:49.979> back<00:05:50.130> in<00:05:50.340> part<00:05:50.729> they<00:05:51.030> just

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
sort of brought back in part they just

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.149 
sort of brought back in part they just
need<00:05:51.300> to<00:05:51.330> open<00:05:51.630> it<00:05:51.719> up<00:05:51.870> more<00:05:52.110> and<00:05:52.289> make<00:05:52.500> you

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:53.159 
need to open it up more and make you

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:55.040 
need to open it up more and make you
know<00:05:53.280> that<00:05:53.520> the<00:05:53.699> game<00:05:53.909> instead<00:05:54.719> of<00:05:54.780> throwing

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
know that the game instead of throwing

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.680 
know that the game instead of throwing
in<00:05:55.229> this<00:05:55.349> guy<00:05:55.530> that<00:05:55.710> made<00:05:55.979> no<00:05:56.099> sense<00:05:56.130> um<00:05:56.789> so

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
in this guy that made no sense um so

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.029 
in this guy that made no sense um so
bottom<00:05:57.840> line<00:05:57.930> is<00:05:58.169> I<00:05:58.259> think<00:05:58.530> that<00:05:58.710> they<00:05:58.860> have

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
bottom line is I think that they have

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.499 
bottom line is I think that they have
taken<00:05:59.400> a<00:05:59.580> break<00:05:59.699> from<00:05:59.849> that<00:05:59.940> they<00:06:00.150> need<00:06:00.300> it<00:06:00.419> and

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:00.509 
taken a break from that they need it and

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:03.320 
taken a break from that they need it and
I<00:06:00.599> do<00:06:00.659> think<00:06:01.050> that<00:06:01.199> it<00:06:01.469> was<00:06:02.130> the<00:06:02.430> more<00:06:02.729> like<00:06:03.180> the

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
I do think that it was the more like the

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.600 
I do think that it was the more like the
finally<00:06:03.780> Zelda<00:06:04.319> experience<00:06:04.979> because<00:06:05.400> you

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
finally Zelda experience because you

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.820 
finally Zelda experience because you
really<00:06:05.909> were<00:06:06.449> travel<00:06:06.810> on<00:06:06.960> ground<00:06:07.409> and<00:06:07.650> you

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
really were travel on ground and you

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.499 
really were travel on ground and you
were<00:06:07.979> exploring<00:06:08.639> the<00:06:08.880> areas<00:06:09.240> and<00:06:09.360> your

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:09.509 
were exploring the areas and your

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:11.570 
were exploring the areas and your
adventuring<00:06:10.229> in<00:06:10.440> a<00:06:10.620> very<00:06:10.800> real<00:06:10.979> way<00:06:11.039> you<00:06:11.219> just

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
adventuring in a very real way you just

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.670 
adventuring in a very real way you just
checking<00:06:12.180> on<00:06:12.360> the<00:06:12.389> landscape<00:06:12.960> and<00:06:13.139> you<00:06:13.469> would

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
checking on the landscape and you would

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.140 
checking on the landscape and you would
find<00:06:14.099> stuff<00:06:14.400> and<00:06:14.610> you<00:06:14.699> would<00:06:14.819> fight<00:06:15.000> enemies

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
find stuff and you would fight enemies

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.999 
find stuff and you would fight enemies
and<00:06:15.389> whatnot<00:06:15.659> and<00:06:16.020> I<00:06:16.110> think<00:06:16.289> that's<00:06:16.530> much<00:06:16.770> more

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:17.009 
and whatnot and I think that's much more

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:19.879 
and whatnot and I think that's much more
clearly<00:06:17.759> a<00:06:17.909> Zelda<00:06:18.240> experience<00:06:18.750> and<00:06:19.050> I<00:06:19.080> also

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
clearly a Zelda experience and I also

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:21.110 
clearly a Zelda experience and I also
just<00:06:20.009> think<00:06:20.310> it's<00:06:20.400> betting<00:06:20.669> better<00:06:20.849> it's

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
just think it's betting better it's

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.879 
just think it's betting better it's
better<00:06:21.210> in<00:06:21.479> general<00:06:21.509> because<00:06:22.080> it's<00:06:22.560> much<00:06:22.740> more

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
better in general because it's much more

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:24.230 
better in general because it's much more
diverse<00:06:23.039> there's<00:06:23.490> a<00:06:23.580> lot<00:06:23.819> you<00:06:23.849> can<00:06:24.060> do<00:06:24.210> with

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
diverse there's a lot you can do with

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.520 
diverse there's a lot you can do with
that<00:06:24.389> when<00:06:24.630> there's<00:06:24.780> limitations<00:06:25.199> of<00:06:25.500> what

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
that when there's limitations of what

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.870 
that when there's limitations of what
you<00:06:25.740> can<00:06:25.830> do<00:06:25.949> with<00:06:26.039> the<00:06:26.099> transportation<00:06:26.699> stuff

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
you can do with the transportation stuff

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.370 
you can do with the transportation stuff
although<00:06:27.150> admittedly<00:06:27.330> they<00:06:27.870> haven't<00:06:28.169> really
