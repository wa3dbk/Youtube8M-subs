and a quarter wheel spacers on it today
these<00:00:10.210> are<00:00:10.510> the<00:00:10.650> g2<00:00:12.000> wheel<00:00:13.000> spacers<00:00:13.450> they're

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:13.630 
these are the g2 wheel spacers they're

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.510 
these are the g2 wheel spacers they're
made<00:00:13.810> of<00:00:13.930> aluminum<00:00:14.380> and<00:00:15.100> they<00:00:15.220> are<00:00:15.250> hub

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
wheel spacer and where it's going to be

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.690 
wheel spacer and where it's going to be
bolted<00:01:05.259> to<00:01:05.560> that<00:01:05.920> way<00:01:06.039> it's<00:01:06.159> nice<00:01:06.249> and<00:01:06.460> smooth

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
installing the wheel spacer is put

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.080 
installing the wheel spacer is put
Loctite<00:01:11.829> which<00:01:12.009> these<00:01:12.249> ones<00:01:12.460> came<00:01:12.729> with<00:01:12.850> it<00:01:12.969> on

they're just going to go into those

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.399 
they're just going to go into those
holes<00:01:21.069> right<00:01:21.219> there<00:01:21.280> and<00:01:21.670> bolt<00:01:22.030> on<00:01:22.179> to<00:01:22.359> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
holes right there and bolt on to the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.910 
holes right there and bolt on to the
factory<00:01:23.759> studs<00:01:24.759> on<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.179> wheel<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.530> we<00:01:26.619> got<00:01:26.770> the

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
factory studs on the wheel so we got the

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.590 
factory studs on the wheel so we got the
wheel<00:01:27.369> spacer<00:01:27.729> on<00:01:27.880> that's<00:01:28.240> what<00:01:28.420> it<00:01:28.479> looks

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
wheel spacer on that's what it looks

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.349 
wheel spacer on that's what it looks
like<00:01:28.749> and<00:01:29.319> now<00:01:29.639> what<00:01:30.639> you<00:01:30.729> want<00:01:30.850> to<00:01:30.909> do<00:01:31.060> for

like and now what you want to do for
these<00:01:31.450> inside<00:01:32.049> nuts<00:01:32.319> is<00:01:32.499> you<00:01:32.619> want<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:32.829> torque

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
these inside nuts is you want to torque

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.239 
these inside nuts is you want to torque
them<00:01:33.219> to<00:01:33.429> the<00:01:33.549> proper<00:01:33.990> specifications<00:01:34.990> and

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:35.249 
them to the proper specifications and

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:37.889 
them to the proper specifications and
for<00:01:36.249> this<00:01:36.340> vehicle<00:01:36.909> and<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.389> size<00:01:37.630> of<00:01:37.780> these

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
for this vehicle and the size of these

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:44.580 
for this vehicle and the size of these
nuts<00:01:38.109> it<00:01:38.319> says<00:01:38.499> 90<00:01:38.859> pounds<00:01:43.170> all<00:01:44.170> right<00:01:44.289> so<00:01:44.469> that

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
nuts it says 90 pounds all right so that

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.879 
nuts it says 90 pounds all right so that
just<00:01:44.799> shows<00:01:45.009> that<00:01:45.240> torque<00:01:46.240> into<00:01:46.389> the<00:01:46.600> right

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:46.889 
just shows that torque into the right

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:49.590 
just shows that torque into the right
poundage<00:01:47.889> and<00:01:48.189> then<00:01:49.119> you're<00:01:49.240> going<00:01:49.329> to<00:01:49.389> do<00:01:49.479> the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
poundage and then you're going to do the

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.719 
poundage and then you're going to do the

00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:54.459 
the front wheels so we'll go ahead and

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:55.620 
the front wheels so we'll go ahead and
get<00:01:54.549> all<00:01:54.579> that<00:01:54.789> done<00:01:55.060> and<00:01:55.209> then<00:01:55.270> once<00:01:55.479> they're

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
get all that done and then once they're

they're<00:01:59.889> all<00:01:59.979> installed<00:02:00.279> and<00:02:00.399> one<00:02:00.880> thing<00:02:01.090> you

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
they're all installed and one thing you

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.029 
they're all installed and one thing you
need<00:02:01.359> to<00:02:01.420> know<00:02:01.689> about<00:02:01.869> when<00:02:02.590> you<00:02:02.649> space<00:02:02.859> your

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
need to know about when you space your

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.010 
need to know about when you space your

rubbing<00:02:05.469> so<00:02:06.279> we<00:02:06.429> had<00:02:06.549> to<00:02:06.729> cut<00:02:07.359> these<00:02:07.600> little

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
rubbing so we had to cut these little

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.979 
rubbing so we had to cut these little
pieces<00:02:09.310> out<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:09.970> can<00:02:10.269> see<00:02:10.569> like<00:02:10.689> the<00:02:10.840> rough

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
pieces out you can see like the rough

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.280 
pieces out you can see like the rough
edge<00:02:11.140> right<00:02:11.319> there<00:02:11.530> but<00:02:12.340> what<00:02:12.670> we<00:02:12.760> did

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
edge right there but what we did

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.380 
edge right there but what we did
it'd<00:02:13.469> look<00:02:13.620> nice<00:02:13.860> on<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.579> other<00:02:14.700> side<00:02:15.000> which

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
it'd look nice on the other side which

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.720 
it'd look nice on the other side which
we'll<00:02:15.540> do<00:02:15.659> on<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.810> other<00:02:15.930> side<00:02:16.200> too<00:02:16.430> we<00:02:17.430> put

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
we'll do on the other side too we put

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.699
