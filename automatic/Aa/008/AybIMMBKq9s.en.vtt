I<00:02:42.520> think<00:02:42.940> that's<00:02:43.060> all<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.390> years<00:02:43.630> it's<00:02:44.290> got<00:02:44.410> a

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
I think that's all the years it's got a

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.100 
I think that's all the years it's got a
little<00:02:44.560> in<00:02:44.800> out<00:02:45.220> board<00:02:45.490> here<00:02:45.850> for<00:02:46.090> all<00:02:46.210> your<00:02:46.420> no

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
little in out board here for all your no

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.470 
little in out board here for all your no
trackball<00:02:47.620> buttons<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.850> think<00:02:49.360> there's

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
trackball buttons I think there's

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.730 
trackball buttons I think there's
speakers<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.050> everything<00:02:50.260> or<00:02:50.380> plugged<00:02:50.590> in

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
speakers and everything or plugged in

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.350 
speakers and everything or plugged in
here<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.820> think<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.270> little

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
here and I think this is a little

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.550 
here and I think this is a little
antenna<00:02:52.990> it's<00:02:53.740> supposed<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.100> connect<00:02:54.550> live

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560

antenna it's supposed to connect live
you<00:02:56.560> know<00:02:56.650> so<00:02:56.830> you<00:02:56.860> can<00:02:57.100> compete<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:57.820> keep

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
you know so you can compete and keep

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.680 
you know so you can compete and keep
your<00:02:58.470> keep<00:02:59.470> your<00:02:59.530> stats<00:02:59.980> up<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.480> think<00:03:01.480> that's

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
your keep your stats up I think that's

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.450 
your keep your stats up I think that's
the<00:03:01.780> wireless<00:03:02.320> antenna<00:03:02.740> right<00:03:02.950> there<00:03:03.190> for

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
the wireless antenna right there for

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.510 
the wireless antenna right there for
your<00:03:03.670> wireless<00:03:04.630> networks<00:03:05.200> but<00:03:05.500> I'm<00:03:06.340> going<00:03:06.460> to
