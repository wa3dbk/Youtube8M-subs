is<00:00:22.949> indeed<00:00:23.400> any<00:00:23.699> history<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:24.840> can

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
is indeed any history that we can

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.750 
is indeed any history that we can
recover<00:00:25.369> archaeologically<00:00:26.369> from<00:00:26.609> these

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
recover archaeologically from these

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.279 
recover archaeologically from these
stories<00:00:27.180> as<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.510> have<00:00:27.689> them<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.019> Hebrew

Bible and at the end we'll have time
perhaps<00:00:30.390> for<00:00:30.660> some<00:00:30.810> questions<00:00:31.199> or<00:00:31.380> two<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:32.070> let

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
perhaps for some questions or two so let

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.080 
perhaps for some questions or two so let
us<00:00:32.520> go<00:00:32.880> now<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.180> some<00:00:34.140> illustrations<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:35.130> want

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
us go now to some illustrations I want

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.549 
us go now to some illustrations I want

Babylonian flood account which is very

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.220 
Babylonian flood account which is very

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
similar to the flood story we have in

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.500 
similar to the flood story we have in
the<00:04:34.320> Hebrew<00:04:34.620> Bible<00:04:35.030> astonishingly<00:04:36.030> similar

and yet it has to be at least a thousand
years<00:04:39.419> older<00:04:40.020> so<00:04:40.830> we're<00:04:41.070> dealing<00:04:41.250> with<00:04:41.400> a

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550
