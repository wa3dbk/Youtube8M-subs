00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
we use it for checking the signals that

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.380 
we use it for checking the signals that
line<00:03:41.989> up<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.230> aircraft<00:03:42.560> with<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:42.890> runway

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
line up the aircraft with the runway

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.479 
line up the aircraft with the runway
centerline<00:03:44.390> and<00:03:44.600> bring<00:03:45.500> down<00:03:45.739> a<00:03:45.769> proper<00:03:46.250> slope

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
centerline and bring down a proper slope

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.310 
centerline and bring down a proper slope
so<00:03:46.640> if<00:03:46.760> they<00:03:46.880> cross<00:03:47.090> over<00:03:47.299> the<00:03:47.989> end<00:03:48.170> of<00:03:48.260> the

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
so if they cross over the end of the

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.100 
so if they cross over the end of the
runway<00:03:48.500> at<00:03:48.830> about<00:03:49.010> 50<00:03:49.430> feet<00:03:49.480> we<00:03:50.480> also<00:03:50.630> check

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
runway at about 50 feet we also check

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.289 
runway at about 50 feet we also check
the<00:03:51.310> navigational<00:03:52.310> aids<00:03:52.489> that<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.970> airplanes

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
the navigational aids that the airplanes

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.420 
the navigational aids that the airplanes
use<00:03:53.510> for<00:03:53.750> point-to-point<00:03:54.019> navigation<00:03:54.860> going

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
use for point-to-point navigation going

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.160 
use for point-to-point navigation going
across<00:03:55.640> the<00:03:55.940> country

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
across the country

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.930 
across the country
so<00:03:57.380> brand<00:03:57.860> new<00:03:57.980> system<00:03:58.340> we've<00:03:58.459> just<00:03:58.670> had<00:03:58.790> it

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
so brand new system we've just had it

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.300 
so brand new system we've just had it
online<00:03:59.090> for<00:03:59.510> about<00:03:59.630> two<00:03:59.870> years<00:04:00.080> now<00:04:00.200> and<00:04:00.590> it's

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
online for about two years now and it's

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.910 
online for about two years now and it's
about<00:04:01.459> to<00:04:01.730> undergo<00:04:02.270> a<00:04:02.420> new<00:04:02.989> software<00:04:03.349> revision

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
about to undergo a new software revision

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.880 
about to undergo a new software revision
with<00:04:04.130> a<00:04:04.459> whole<00:04:05.180> new<00:04:05.209> display<00:04:06.170> to<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.410> operator

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
with a whole new display to the operator

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.460 
with a whole new display to the operator
it'll<00:04:07.610> still<00:04:07.819> do<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.060> same<00:04:08.239> function<00:04:08.720> it'll

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
it'll still do the same function it'll

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.100 
it'll still do the same function it'll
just<00:04:09.500> have<00:04:09.860> more<00:04:10.580> features<00:04:10.849> to<00:04:11.060> it<00:04:11.480> the

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
just have more features to it the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.229 
just have more features to it the
display<00:04:12.830> we<00:04:13.010> can<00:04:13.160> set<00:04:13.370> up<00:04:13.489> the<00:04:13.520> screens<00:04:14.030> to

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
display we can set up the screens to

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.530 
display we can set up the screens to
show<00:04:14.420> us<00:04:14.600> different<00:04:15.940> looks<00:04:16.940> at<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.209> signals

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
show us different looks at the signals

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.300 
show us different looks at the signals
from<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.810> ground<00:04:18.019> we<00:04:18.680> could<00:04:18.829> also<00:04:18.950> post

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
from the ground we could also post

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.600 
from the ground we could also post
process<00:04:19.760> a<00:04:19.790> lot<00:04:20.510> of<00:04:20.630> the<00:04:20.720> reports<00:04:21.410> and<00:04:21.620> look<00:04:22.460> at

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
process a lot of the reports and look at

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.780 
process a lot of the reports and look at
different<00:04:23.300> parameters<00:04:23.860> if<00:04:24.860> engineering<00:04:25.610> is

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
different parameters if engineering is

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.420 
different parameters if engineering is
looking<00:04:26.150> to<00:04:27.080> solve<00:04:27.470> a<00:04:27.620> problem<00:04:28.100> with<00:04:28.250> them

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
looking to solve a problem with them

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.040 
looking to solve a problem with them
they<00:04:28.760> may<00:04:28.940> have<00:04:29.060> found<00:04:29.210> with<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:29.479> other

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
they may have found with the other

00:04:30.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
they may have found with the other
equipment

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070
