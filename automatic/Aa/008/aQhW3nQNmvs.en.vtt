00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
out of the spawn you know then maybe you

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.460 
out of the spawn you know then maybe you
deserve<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.360> get<00:01:12.479> spawn<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:12.960> what's<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.320> bad

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
deserve to get spawn so what's so bad

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.200 
deserve to get spawn so what's so bad
about<00:01:13.530> what<00:01:13.770> these<00:01:14.040> guys<00:01:14.310> are<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.090> be

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
boosters there is a difference between

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.730 
boosters there is a difference between
spawn<00:01:20.729> trapping<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.390> spawn<00:01:21.689> trap<00:01:22.110> boosting

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
spawn trapping and spawn trap boosting

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.249 
spawn trapping and spawn trap boosting
and<00:01:23.030> spawn<00:01:24.030> trapping<00:01:24.299> again<00:01:24.930> like<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.229> said

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
and spawn trapping again like you said

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.749 
and spawn trapping again like you said
it<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.650> legitimate<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:26.520> you're<00:01:26.640> good

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
it is legitimate and if you're good

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:27.800 
it is legitimate and if you're good
enough<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.030> should<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.299> able<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.450> get<00:01:27.570> out<00:01:27.659> of

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
enough you should be able to get out of

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.800 
enough you should be able to get out of
it<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.740> spawn<00:01:29.460> shot<00:01:29.640> boosting<00:01:30.060> imagine<00:01:30.659> this

playing against these same boosters and

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.680 
playing against these same boosters and
we're<00:03:27.410> looking<00:03:27.920> at<00:03:28.010> right<00:03:28.340> now<00:03:28.400> this<00:03:28.520> is<00:03:28.940> Zeebo

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
we're looking at right now this is Zeebo

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.090 
we're looking at right now this is Zeebo
he's<00:03:29.930> another<00:03:30.140> random<00:03:30.440> who<00:03:30.620> just<00:03:30.800> happened<00:03:31.070> to

he's another random who just happened to

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.500 
he's another random who just happened to
join<00:03:31.310> this<00:03:31.430> game<00:03:31.610> he<00:03:31.910> managed<00:03:32.210> to<00:03:32.270> get<00:03:32.330> out<00:03:32.450> of

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
join this game he managed to get out of

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.870 
join this game he managed to get out of
the<00:03:32.600> spawn<00:03:32.810> track<00:03:33.050> for<00:03:33.260> a<00:03:33.290> second<00:03:33.680> but<00:03:34.520> right

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
the spawn track for a second but right

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.260 
the spawn track for a second but right
back<00:03:35.060> in<00:03:35.300> it<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:36.250> again<00:03:37.250> this<00:03:37.520> is<00:03:37.730> not<00:03:37.850> your

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
back in it and again this is not your

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.540 
back in it and again this is not your
typical<00:03:38.600> everyday<00:03:39.020> spawn<00:03:39.530> trap<00:03:39.830> because<00:03:40.400> he

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
typical everyday spawn trap because he

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.010 
typical everyday spawn trap because he
has<00:03:40.670> teammates<00:03:41.030> that<00:03:41.210> aren't<00:03:41.480> helping<00:03:41.900> them

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
has teammates that aren't helping them

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.860 
has teammates that aren't helping them
that's<00:03:42.260> making<00:03:42.650> it<00:03:42.830> impossible<00:03:43.100> to<00:03:43.340> get<00:03:43.490> out

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
that's making it impossible to get out

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.960 
that's making it impossible to get out
so<00:03:44.870> how<00:03:45.170> do<00:03:45.230> these<00:03:45.650> guys<00:03:45.890> keep<00:03:46.280> from<00:03:46.730> getting

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
so how do these guys keep from getting

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.640 
so how do these guys keep from getting
caught<00:03:47.150> because<00:03:47.510> I<00:03:47.540> thought<00:03:47.900> that<00:03:47.960> I<00:03:48.230> was

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
caught because I thought that I was

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.770 
caught because I thought that I was
reading<00:03:48.950> where<00:03:49.100> black<00:03:49.310> ops<00:03:49.520> 2<00:03:49.730> was<00:03:50.240> getting<00:03:50.540> so

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
reading where black ops 2 was getting so

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.780 
reading where black ops 2 was getting so
much<00:03:51.080> stronger<00:03:51.500> as<00:03:51.830> far<00:03:52.280> as<00:03:52.400> being<00:03:52.580> able<00:03:52.670> to

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
much stronger as far as being able to

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.430 
much stronger as far as being able to
take<00:03:53.000> out<00:03:53.150> boosters<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:53.840> keep<00:03:54.020> a<00:03:54.140> really<00:03:54.320> good

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
take out boosters and keep a really good

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.710 
take out boosters and keep a really good
eye<00:03:54.590> on<00:03:55.160> what's<00:03:55.730> going<00:03:56.000> on<00:03:56.090> how<00:03:56.300> do<00:03:56.360> these<00:03:56.510> guys

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
eye on what's going on how do these guys

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.800 
eye on what's going on how do these guys
avoid<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:58.370> banhammer<00:03:58.580> well<00:03:59.180> they<00:03:59.420> they<00:03:59.450> are

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
avoid the banhammer well they they are

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.510 
avoid the banhammer well they they are
smart<00:04:00.380> about<00:04:00.530> it<00:04:00.650> these<00:04:00.740> guys<00:04:00.950> are<00:04:01.220> not<00:04:01.370> your

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
smart about it these guys are not your

smart about it these guys are not your
everyday<00:04:01.670> boosters<00:04:02.390> they<00:04:02.660> have<00:04:02.930> methods<00:04:03.560> that

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
everyday boosters they have methods that

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.830 
everyday boosters they have methods that
make<00:04:03.980> it<00:04:04.160> very<00:04:04.190> hard<00:04:04.550> to<00:04:04.640> detect<00:04:05.090> them<00:04:05.270> what

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
make it very hard to detect them what

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.510 
make it very hard to detect them what
they're<00:04:06.020> doing<00:04:06.380> is<00:04:06.560> you<00:04:06.860> know<00:04:06.890> obviously<00:04:07.400> by

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
they're doing is you know obviously by

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.460 
they're doing is you know obviously by
getting<00:04:08.240> games<00:04:08.420> like<00:04:08.630> this<00:04:08.810> they<00:04:09.080> have<00:04:09.230> very

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
getting games like this they have very

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.800 
getting games like this they have very
high<00:04:09.709> scores<00:04:10.130> permitted<00:04:10.640> but<00:04:11.390> when<00:04:11.660> they're

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
high scores permitted but when they're

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.420 
high scores permitted but when they're
done<00:04:11.840> boosting<00:04:12.440> what<00:04:12.590> they<00:04:12.709> do<00:04:12.770> is<00:04:13.040> and<00:04:13.250> if<00:04:13.310> you

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
done boosting what they do is and if you

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.800 
done boosting what they do is and if you
look<00:04:13.459> at<00:04:13.700> their<00:04:13.850> game<00:04:14.000> stats<00:04:14.270> you<00:04:14.450> see<00:04:14.660> they're

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
look at their game stats you see they're

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.030 
look at their game stats you see they're
doing<00:04:15.080> this<00:04:15.200> they're<00:04:15.410> going<00:04:15.770> into

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
doing this they're going into

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.840 
doing this they're going into
free-for-alls

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
free-for-alls

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.180 
free-for-alls
they<00:04:17.479> enter<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:17.930> game<00:04:18.080> for<00:04:18.260> 15<00:04:18.560> seconds<00:04:19.010> and

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
they enter the game for 15 seconds and

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.470 
they enter the game for 15 seconds and
quit<00:04:19.489> out<00:04:19.520> so<00:04:20.299> there

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
quit out so there

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.300 
quit out so there
scored<00:04:20.750> per<00:04:20.900> minute<00:04:21.170> drops<00:04:21.470> and<00:04:21.860> their

win-loss<00:04:22.700> drops<00:04:23.270> and<00:04:23.570> that<00:04:23.630> lowers<00:04:24.170> them<00:04:24.380> on

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
win-loss drops and that lowers them on

win-loss drops and that lowers them on
the<00:04:24.590> leaderboards<00:04:25.070> it<00:04:25.190> lowers<00:04:25.460> our<00:04:25.610> score<00:04:25.820> for

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
the leaderboards it lowers our score for

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.190 
the leaderboards it lowers our score for
minutes<00:04:26.210> you<00:04:26.360> can't<00:04:26.630> find<00:04:26.900> them<00:04:27.020> on<00:04:27.140> the

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.850 
minutes you can't find them on the
leaderboards<00:04:28.630> so<00:04:29.630> they<00:04:29.930> these<00:04:30.440> guys<00:04:30.650> are

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
leaderboards so they these guys are

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.920 
leaderboards so they these guys are
going<00:04:31.100> through<00:04:31.130> such<00:04:32.090> great<00:04:32.360> links<00:04:32.720> in<00:04:32.810> order

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
going through such great links in order

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.660 
going through such great links in order
to<00:04:33.140> keep<00:04:33.290> from<00:04:33.500> getting<00:04:33.770> caught<00:04:33.920> it<00:04:34.310> someone's

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
to keep from getting caught it someone's

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.820 
to keep from getting caught it someone's
like<00:04:34.790> a<00:04:34.820> Lance<00:04:35.390> Armstrong<00:04:35.900> doping<00:04:36.170> session<00:04:36.740> or

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
like a Lance Armstrong doping session or

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.520 
like a Lance Armstrong doping session or
something<00:04:37.600> they<00:04:38.600> are<00:04:38.630> coming<00:04:39.110> for<00:04:39.290> great

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
something they are coming for great

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.440 
something they are coming for great
lengths<00:04:39.890> I<00:04:39.980> mean<00:04:40.130> like<00:04:40.790> I<00:04:40.880> said<00:04:41.060> I<00:04:41.090> have<00:04:41.270> to<00:04:41.360> do

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
lengths I mean like I said I have to do

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.270 
lengths I mean like I said I have to do
is<00:04:41.540> look<00:04:41.660> at<00:04:41.780> there<00:04:41.930> are<00:04:42.020> recent<00:04:42.200> games<00:04:42.560> you'll

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
is look at there are recent games you'll

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.860 
is look at there are recent games you'll
see<00:04:43.490> all<00:04:43.670> these<00:04:43.820> boosting<00:04:44.240> matches<00:04:44.690> then

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
see all these boosting matches then

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.980 
see all these boosting matches then
you'll<00:04:44.990> see<00:04:45.200> 10<00:04:45.440> or<00:04:45.470> 20<00:04:46.390> 15-second<00:04:47.390> long<00:04:47.600> free

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
you'll see 10 or 20 15-second long free

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.660 
you'll see 10 or 20 15-second long free
Fras<00:04:48.290> and<00:04:48.650> that's<00:04:48.800> how<00:04:49.010> they<00:04:49.190> remain

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
Fras and that's how they remain

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.700 
Fras and that's how they remain
undetected<00:04:50.800> so<00:04:52.300> what<00:04:53.300> how<00:04:54.230> do<00:04:54.290> you<00:04:54.410> know<00:04:54.530> that

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
undetected so what how do you know that

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.410 
undetected so what how do you know that
these<00:04:54.830> guys<00:04:54.890> just<00:04:55.400> aren't<00:04:55.640> like<00:04:55.940> maybe

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
these guys just aren't like maybe
