00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:05.079
 well i am baby and i am working for this him functional materials in corner of holland 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.190
 know 

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:17.429
 So you are stuck that process that he can say against because I am not saying in 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:18.989
 were the technology 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.989
 and I prefer a combination of chemistry 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.980
 and just tinkering a bit 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.429
 the cities of the process 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.599
 I am the last to know that and after two months it may take a while for you 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.090
 he says 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.990
 9 the boys from the team are also involved 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.080
 yes not so strong 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.910
 and I still used it as I have just been out of it for two months 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.580
 know a while ago 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.820
 they can make for tot 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.940
 well we are behind you 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.340
 and they were right and I got the job 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.630
 so they are the challenges for me as a leader 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.020
 the team has really stolen that 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.890
 And yes, because I have a new band and you have had a long one for twenty years 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.600
 yes and then the occasional moments were wrong decisions but they 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.760
 do point out to klaasen that next time would be resolute that the man runs it 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.250
 process easier 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.230
 doing this year one learns 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.110
 he did you help me they also opt I can just go for it 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.170
 take when you step in if I want 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.580
 and the consultation with everyone 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.140
 that his team 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.240
 the worrying development in this and is very important 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.900
 I started right away when they were not on a hot one 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.790
 and it is in sweden 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.200
 and I am supported by my coach 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.200
 and I am training for middle management 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.420
 I am with this and ended up until I drive into the car working environment 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.740
 against at5 requirements if you don't meet them 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.119
 I could not live anymore I want a safe and healthy home 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.900
 it became the same for my colleagues 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.049
 and this year the company has a rose 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.610
 and this is very important 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.349
 and that really appealed to me 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.349
 this and is therefore present 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.579
 yesterday and and a suspect stayed behind and killed animals 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.669
 we will dive again in the next while 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:20.899
 m separating waste that are things together there 

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:24.729
 fully engaged and continue to develop 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:26.989

 and that had the other world 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.639
 improve their products 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.600
 for example, let a fire be heard 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.669
 with a 3d this printer 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:45.669
 that these taste 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.329
