attaching the power connector to the
video<00:01:43.180> card<00:01:43.360> first<00:01:43.630> it's<00:01:44.020> like<00:01:44.140> right<00:01:44.560> here

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
video card first it's like right here

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.280 
video card first it's like right here
it's<00:01:45.010> kind<00:01:45.159> of<00:01:45.190> hard<00:01:45.369> to<00:01:45.400> find<00:01:45.729> but<00:01:46.270> once<00:01:47.200> you

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
it's kind of hard to find but once you

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.289 
it's kind of hard to find but once you
do<00:01:47.409> that<00:01:47.440> you<00:01:47.860> connect<00:01:48.460> it<00:01:48.600> locked<00:01:49.600> in<00:01:50.040> hi<00:01:51.040> this

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
do that you connect it locked in hi this

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.420 
do that you connect it locked in hi this
table<00:01:52.299> somewhere<00:01:52.510> and<00:01:53.380> with<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:53.920> only<00:01:54.100> other

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.350 
exhaust air where it blows it out right
here<00:06:29.800> on<00:06:29.949> this<00:06:30.069> side<00:06:30.339> you<00:06:30.370> see<00:06:30.699> how<00:06:30.849> it's<00:06:31.180> open

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
here on this side you see how it's open

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.809 
here on this side you see how it's open
there's<00:06:32.020> nothin<00:06:32.379> oh<00:06:32.469> nothing<00:06:33.189> in<00:06:33.310> the<00:06:33.400> way<00:06:33.550> is

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:33.819 
there's nothin oh nothing in the way is

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:36.149 
there's nothin oh nothing in the way is
just<00:06:33.969> to<00:06:34.060> open<00:06:34.270> up<00:06:34.599> it's<00:06:34.870> open<00:06:35.259> but<00:06:35.889> on<00:06:35.979> this

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:36.159 
just to open up it's open but on this

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:37.980 
just to open up it's open but on this
side<00:06:36.400> you<00:06:36.430> see<00:06:36.789> there's<00:06:37.000> like<00:06:37.029> a<00:06:37.120> plastic<00:06:37.449> part

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
side you see there's like a plastic part

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.809 
side you see there's like a plastic part
or<00:06:38.199> whatever<00:06:38.500> back<00:06:38.800> here<00:06:39.159> see<00:06:40.120> this<00:06:41.110> and<00:06:41.819> up

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:42.819 
or whatever back here see this and up

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.200 
or whatever back here see this and up
here<00:06:42.849> it<00:06:43.330> doesn't<00:06:43.599> have<00:06:43.719> that<00:06:43.779> so<00:06:44.560> the<00:06:44.680> air

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
here it doesn't have that so the air

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.600 
here it doesn't have that so the air
pulls<00:06:46.210> in<00:06:46.479> from<00:06:46.719> this<00:06:46.870> side<00:06:47.139> and<00:06:47.500> pushes<00:06:48.459> the

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610 
pulls in from this side and pushes the

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:49.530 
pulls in from this side and pushes the
air<00:06:48.759> out<00:06:48.969> this

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
air out this

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.660 
air out this
so<00:06:49.990> basically<00:06:50.380> where<00:06:50.680> we<00:06:50.710> see<00:06:51.070> the<00:06:51.100> plastic

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:51.670 
so basically where we see the plastic

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.030 
so basically where we see the plastic
part<00:06:51.700> right<00:06:52.210> here<00:06:52.260> in<00:06:53.260> case<00:06:53.560> it<00:06:53.710> doesn't<00:06:53.860> have

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:54.040 
part right here in case it doesn't have

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.120 
part right here in case it doesn't have
arrows<00:06:54.400> with<00:06:54.580> 28<00:06:54.790> points<00:06:55.740> usually<00:06:56.740> where<00:06:57.520> the

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.130 
arrows with 28 points usually where the

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.350 
arrows with 28 points usually where the
most<00:07:00.130> of<00:07:00.310> time<00:07:00.430> is<00:07:00.640> where<00:07:00.790> you<00:07:00.910> see<00:07:01.090> all<00:07:01.240> the

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 
most of time is where you see all the

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.630 
most of time is where you see all the
cables<00:07:01.720> behind<00:07:01.870> there<00:07:02.320> so<00:07:02.950> remember<00:07:03.190> it<00:07:03.460> in

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:03.640 
cables behind there so remember it in

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.270 
cables behind there so remember it in
takes<00:07:03.940> air<00:07:04.150> this<00:07:04.420> way<00:07:04.690> whether<00:07:05.080> it's<00:07:05.380> open<00:07:05.830> but

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:06.280 
takes air this way whether it's open but

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.860 
takes air this way whether it's open but
right<00:07:06.460> here<00:07:06.640> where<00:07:06.820> they<00:07:06.880> got<00:07:07.000> stuff<00:07:07.540> in<00:07:07.720> their

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870 
right here where they got stuff in their

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.700 
right here where they got stuff in their
way<00:07:08.340> that's<00:07:09.340> where<00:07:09.610> it<00:07:09.910> blows<00:07:10.480> air<00:07:10.660> out<00:07:10.900> so<00:07:11.440> in

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:11.710 
way that's where it blows air out so in

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.090 
way that's where it blows air out so in
out<00:07:12.340> so<00:07:12.970> fall<00:07:13.480> in<00:07:13.570> the<00:07:13.630> back<00:07:13.780> of<00:07:13.960> the<00:07:14.020> case<00:07:14.230> you

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.100 
out so fall in the back of the case you

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.880 
out so fall in the back of the case you
want<00:07:15.280> to<00:07:15.340> have<00:07:15.520> this<00:07:16.110> pulling<00:07:17.110> air<00:07:17.290> from<00:07:17.860> the

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:17.890 
want to have this pulling air from the

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.220 
want to have this pulling air from the
inside<00:07:18.520> to<00:07:18.880> the<00:07:19.210> outside<00:07:19.330> the<00:07:19.810> case<00:07:19.960> on<00:07:20.140> the

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:20.230 
inside to the outside the case on the

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.440 
inside to the outside the case on the
back<00:07:20.440> but<00:07:21.010> on<00:07:21.130> the<00:07:21.250> front<00:07:21.550> you<00:07:21.970> want<00:07:22.150> to<00:07:22.210> have

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:22.450 
back but on the front you want to have

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.470 
back but on the front you want to have
it<00:07:22.570> blowing<00:07:22.930> in<00:07:23.110> so<00:07:23.890> hopefully<00:07:24.880> that<00:07:25.300> would<00:07:25.390> be

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:25.480 
it blowing in so hopefully that would be

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.090 
it blowing in so hopefully that would be
less<00:07:25.660> confusion<00:07:26.050> well<00:07:26.560> in<00:07:26.650> case<00:07:26.830> you<00:07:26.890> don't

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:27.100 
less confusion well in case you don't

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.130 
less confusion well in case you don't
know<00:07:27.220> which<00:07:27.460> way<00:07:27.700> it<00:07:27.850> goes<00:07:27.880> you<00:07:28.870> can<00:07:29.020> always

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:29.140 
know which way it goes you can always

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.260 
know which way it goes you can always
plug<00:07:29.650> it<00:07:29.830> in<00:07:29.980> and<00:07:30.190> feel<00:07:30.490> which<00:07:30.700> way<00:07:30.880> the<00:07:31.030> air<00:07:31.150> is

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:31.270 
plug it in and feel which way the air is

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:47.110 
plug it in and feel which way the air is
coming<00:07:31.450> so<00:07:32.140> anyways<00:07:33.040> that's<00:07:33.700> it

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.180
