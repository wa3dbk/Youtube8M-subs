00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.530
 quite requested on my channel that is 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.510

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.340

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.590

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.810
 carnal let's see what ingredients 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.960
 We are going to need 2 medium carrots 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.630
 three medium potatoes a can of 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.230
 beet or if you prefer a beet 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.899
 large one and a half cup of mayonnaise three 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.649
 boiled eggs a spoonful of vinegar 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.530
 white salt and pepper to taste for 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.200
 start we should serve the potatoes the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.000
 carrots and beets all for 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.000
 separated until they are soft 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.990
 we cut into small squares the potatoes 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.080
 we do the same with the carrot 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.240
 also with the beet in my case 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.629
 You may be using canned beets 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.180
 because it's already boiled 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.079
 and finally we cut into squares the 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.079
 eggs served 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:20.299
 in a deep bowl we put the potato 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.299
 carrots and beets 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.329
 now we add the mayonnaise 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.220
 and the spoonful of white vinegar 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.880
 we also add salt and pepper 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.880
 and we mix it very well 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.630
 Y 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.060
 finally we add the eggs 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.060
 boiled and we mix everything 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:55.230
