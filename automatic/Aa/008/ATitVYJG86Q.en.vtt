I<00:01:16.680> love<00:01:17.010> the<00:01:17.160> idea<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.580> presets<00:01:18.119> because<00:01:18.210> it

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
I love the idea of presets because it

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.210 
I love the idea of presets because it
kind<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.660> reads<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.020> idea<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.860> plug<00:01:20.070> in

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
kind of reads that idea of a plug in

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.680 
kind of reads that idea of a plug in
world<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.580> we<00:01:20.670> all<00:01:20.790> know<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.150> love

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
world that we all know and love

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.460 
world that we all know and love
yeah<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.210> ability<00:01:24.660> of<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:25.050> analog

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
yeah and and the ability of the analog

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.350 
yeah and and the ability of the analog
like<00:01:25.830> okay<00:01:26.190> let<00:01:26.580> me<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.700> listen<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.240> this

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
like okay let me just listen to this

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.120 
like okay let me just listen to this
until<00:01:27.690> I<00:01:27.750> feel<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.140> right<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.710> we<00:01:28.830> started

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
until I feel it's right so we started

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.340 
until I feel it's right so we started
off<00:01:29.250> with<00:01:29.310> pretty<00:01:29.880> much<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.119> microphone<00:01:30.960> dead

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
off with pretty much the microphone dead

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.219 
off with pretty much the microphone dead
center<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:33.180> code<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.690> I<00:01:33.750> saved<00:01:34.020> that

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
center on on the code and I saved that

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:43.399 
center on on the code and I saved that
as<00:01:34.440> preset<00:01:34.890> 1<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:36.020> play<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.050> little<00:01:37.290> bit<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.470> that

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.010 

then<00:01:44.409> I<00:01:44.440> moved<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:46.210> microphone<00:01:46.600> a<00:01:46.690> little<00:01:46.720> bit

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
then I moved the microphone a little bit

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.890 
then I moved the microphone a little bit
more<00:01:47.190> off-axis<00:01:48.190> I<00:01:48.700> probably<00:01:48.940> will<00:01:49.720> fighter

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
more off-axis I probably will fighter

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.410 
more off-axis I probably will fighter
went<00:01:50.140> this<00:01:50.380> way<00:01:50.590> and<00:01:50.619> down<00:01:51.070> a<00:01:51.100> little<00:01:51.340> bit<00:01:51.549> and

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
went this way and down a little bit and

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:01.940 
went this way and down a little bit and
I<00:01:52.509> save<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:52.960> as<00:01:53.110> -<00:01:54.990> no<00:01:55.990> go<00:01:56.110> ahead<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:56.409> play

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.850 

pretty<00:02:02.880> pretty<00:02:03.360> rad<00:02:03.600> what's<00:02:04.530> really

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
pretty pretty rad what's really

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.770 
pretty pretty rad what's really
fascinating<00:02:05.399> about<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.630> can

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
fascinating about this is you can

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.990 
fascinating about this is you can
actually<00:02:07.039> have<00:02:08.039> one<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.459> these<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.910> a

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
actually have one of these on a

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.759 
actually have one of these on a
microphone<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.989> have<00:02:10.140> another<00:02:10.379> microphone

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
microphone and have another microphone

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.190 
microphone and have another microphone
fixed<00:02:11.280> already<00:02:11.519> under<00:02:11.730> guitar<00:02:12.000> cabinet<00:02:12.450> for

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
instance if you wanted to get two mics

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.979 
instance if you wanted to get two mics
in<00:02:14.730> phase<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.269> is<00:02:15.330> where<00:02:15.569> it<00:02:15.629> really<00:02:15.780> comes

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
in phase this is where it really comes

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.869 
in phase this is where it really comes
in<00:02:16.170> handy<00:02:16.379> you<00:02:16.620> could<00:02:16.769> just<00:02:17.010> get<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.610> great

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
in handy you could just get a great

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.259 
in handy you could just get a great
sound<00:02:18.120> on<00:02:18.360> your<00:02:18.450> one<00:02:18.660> mic<00:02:18.900> fixed<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.650> then<00:02:20.640> put

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
sound on your one mic fixed and then put

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:22.940

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
able to move it in and out especially on

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.509 
able to move it in and out especially on
a<00:02:24.720> kick<00:02:24.959> drum<00:02:24.989> or<00:02:25.349> a<00:02:25.380> guitar<00:02:25.530> cabinet<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.220> want

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
a kick drum or a guitar cabinet I want

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.220 
a kick drum or a guitar cabinet I want
to<00:02:26.580> be<00:02:26.700> able<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:27.060> move<00:02:27.209> things<00:02:27.480> in<00:02:27.720> very<00:02:27.930> small

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
to be able to move things in very small

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.990 
to be able to move things in very small
increments<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:29.040> like<00:02:29.160> if<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.280> see<00:02:29.430> one<00:02:29.760> nudge

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
increments so like if you see one nudge

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.050 
increments so like if you see one nudge
that's<00:02:30.690> how<00:02:30.870> much<00:02:31.019> it<00:02:31.200> moves<00:02:31.349> oh<00:02:31.709> well<00:02:32.250> there's

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
that's how much it moves oh well there's

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:40.600 
that's how much it moves oh well there's
plenty<00:02:33.360> of<00:02:33.420> definition<00:02:33.930> in<00:02:34.019> there<00:02:34.200> then

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.670 

I<00:02:42.820> mean<00:02:43.820> my<00:02:43.970> placement<00:02:44.240> is<00:02:44.510> everything<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:45.200> if

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
I mean my placement is everything and if

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.220 
I mean my placement is everything and if
you're<00:02:45.890> in<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.070> control<00:02:46.430> room<00:02:46.480> how<00:02:47.480> can<00:02:47.510> you<00:02:47.870> I

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
you're in the control room how can you I

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.540 
you're in the control room how can you I
mean<00:02:48.650> if<00:02:48.770> you're<00:02:48.890> out<00:02:48.980> in<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.100> library<00:02:49.310> I'm

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
mean if you're out in the library I'm

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.130 
mean if you're out in the library I'm
moving<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.820> micro<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:50.330> it's<00:02:50.450> hard<00:02:50.630> to<00:02:50.690> know

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
moving a micro and it's hard to know

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.290 
moving a micro and it's hard to know
what<00:02:51.380> your<00:02:51.500> name<00:02:51.590> is<00:02:51.740> it's<00:02:52.610> on<00:02:52.730> some<00:02:53.030> tapes

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
what your name is it's on some tapes

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.360 
what your name is it's on some tapes
unscientifically<00:02:54.110> we<00:02:54.320> didn't<00:02:54.620> like<00:02:54.740> a<00:02:54.950> lot

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
unscientifically we didn't like a lot

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.760 
unscientifically we didn't like a lot
more<00:02:55.580> like<00:02:55.760> okay<00:02:56.750> we<00:02:57.110> know<00:02:57.230> what<00:02:57.320> we're<00:02:57.440> doing

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
more like okay we know what we're doing

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.500 
more like okay we know what we're doing
obviously<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.700> diamond<00:02:59.000> is<00:02:59.090> great<00:02:59.300> for<00:02:59.450> the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
obviously the diamond is great for the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.270 
obviously the diamond is great for the
