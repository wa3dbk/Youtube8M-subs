know we see others doing him go look at

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.830 
know we see others doing him go look at
that<00:00:44.700> guy<00:00:44.850> he<00:00:44.940> didn't<00:00:45.120> even<00:00:45.180> take<00:00:45.420> his<00:00:45.570> time

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.970 
that guy he didn't even take his time
and<00:00:46.020> then<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.379> do<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.739> same<00:00:47.039> thing<00:00:47.399> why<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.420> it

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
and then we do the same thing why is it

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.290 
and then we do the same thing why is it
well<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.309> directly<00:00:50.760> connected<00:00:50.850> with

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
well it's directly connected with

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.840 
well it's directly connected with
anxiety<00:00:52.129> you<00:00:53.129> know<00:00:53.160> when<00:00:53.460> you're<00:00:53.579> really

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
anxious to get a good serve in and you

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.160 
anxious to get a good serve in and you
miss<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:57.180> almost<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.600> brain<00:00:57.809> can't

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
miss it it's almost like the brain can't

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.349 
miss it it's almost like the brain can't
wait<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.620> try<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.859> again<00:00:59.070> immediately<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.239> it

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
wait to try it again immediately so it

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.139 
wait to try it again immediately so it
goes<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.260> you're<00:01:01.530> yeah<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.670> mistake

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
goes in but you're yeah it's a mistake

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.870 
goes in but you're yeah it's a mistake
to<00:01:03.930> think<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.379> if<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.680> do<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.979> fast<00:01:05.369> then

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
to think that if you do it fast then

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.609 
to think that if you do it fast then
it's<00:01:06.060> gonna<00:01:06.180> go<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:07.260> actually<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
it's gonna go in it's actually the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.310 
it's gonna go in it's actually the
opposite<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.280> take<00:01:08.520> your<00:01:08.670> time<00:01:09.290> or<00:01:10.290> your

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
opposite if you take your time or your

but I double fault a lot what's what's
that<00:02:02.530> it's<00:02:02.679> intriguing<00:02:03.099> isn't<00:02:03.610> it<00:02:03.670> well<00:02:04.209> the

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
that it's intriguing isn't it well the

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.609 
that it's intriguing isn't it well the
reason<00:02:04.750> is<00:02:04.869> probably<00:02:05.140> because<00:02:05.259> you're<00:02:05.530> not

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
reason is probably because you're not

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:06.929 
reason is probably because you're not
taking<00:02:05.979> your<00:02:06.069> time<00:02:06.280> in<00:02:06.429> between<00:02:06.549> serves

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
taking your time in between serves

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:08.609 
taking your time in between serves
therefore<00:02:07.929> most<00:02:08.110> of<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.319> time<00:02:08.470> you're

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
therefore most of the time you're

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.620 
therefore most of the time you're
rushing<00:02:08.950> them<00:02:09.099> your<00:02:09.729> rhythm<00:02:10.030> is<00:02:10.119> not<00:02:10.269> the<00:02:10.390> same

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
rushing them your rhythm is not the same

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.300 
rushing them your rhythm is not the same
that<00:02:10.840> past<00:02:11.110> quality<00:02:11.620> is<00:02:11.709> not<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.010> same<00:02:12.280> the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
that past quality is not the same the

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.910 
that past quality is not the same the
consistency<00:02:13.209> is<00:02:13.330> not<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.599> same<00:02:13.920> everything

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920
