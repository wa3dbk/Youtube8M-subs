00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.980
 you play with your favorite team on foot 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.470
 2013 is open for the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.720
 Brazilian clubs now only teams 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.399
 Brazilians if you want to see the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.960
 training your team 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.910

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.399
 make sure beauty 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.860
 Let's start with the Saints in the team . 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.870
 here and you do the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.100
 comments to ips the country if you want 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.050
 what are we going to do with others? 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.550
 times saw galera 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.320
 so come on let's start with the team 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.820
 the holy one of the strongest teams here 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.239
 from Brazil in the country, right? 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.520
 Let's see and comment the cast 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.670
 in the new update package does not 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.280
 Montijo viriam but I have voted here 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.470
 because in knowing that he was hired 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.570
 by the cruise so let's go 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.430
 the formation that will come in the saints is this 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.689
 This one with you is watching us 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.330
 Let's just make some adaptations. 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.860
 will not have a very drastic change 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.000
 first you will bring the arouca a 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.170
 a little more to the middle 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.119
 centered here and the Adrian you go 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.610
 back a little more then we'll go 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.470
 take the adriano andré will not play and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.270
 left behind the laurel steering wheel which is a 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.280
 excellent steering wheel will give an exit 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.650
 much better ball for your team 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.439
 later and replaced adriano of course by the 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.770
 montijo motive appear 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.200
 If you attacker here, it 's better than 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.780
 it is used with the attacking midfielder here 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.520
 what are you going to let those that line 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.909
 of three here offensive 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.619
 already felipe anderson we replace 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.530
 changes right side with the party Roberts 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.710
 leaves the party rodrigues of 6 right 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.020
 Felipe left half anderson 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.360
 after that if you prefer you can 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.310
 to replace felipe anderson and gerson 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.130
 skinny he will be going to be a little 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.330
 better but for me I prefer felipe 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.790
 anderson even here in that position 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.210
 but you can also vote montijo and 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.590
 do Felipe Anderson for 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.640
 attacking midfielder may be one of those two 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.230
 options 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.260
 but the saints only have practically the 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.700
 he is good owner 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.810
 We're going to make a big change. 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.360
 important 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.300
 I do not like using the andré I do not know 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.400
 You, but I'd rather use Vitor. 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.200
 andrade because he is a much better player 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.180
 faster than Andrew for more Canaveral 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.860
 of being only 57 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.960
 you see that has a blast 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.700
 maximum maximum speed 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.880
 but if you like to play more like this 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.800
 crossing the area and you want a 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.530
 completion is little more refined 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.120
 really andré is better at this but if 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.490
 You play at speed as they were. 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.860
 usually the style of saints 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.870
 I recommend Vitor Andrade as well. 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.790
 we have here miralles a good player and the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.120
 bill I no longer think so good player 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.040
 So we're going to mess around a bit now. 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.250
 on our back and kick right here Victor 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.560
 Andrade said to you. 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.660
 neymar looks only neymar you take a 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.340
 A little further and a little bit 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.180
 more to the left will get a little 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.530
 more open 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.050
 Then you can advance vitor andrade. 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.690
 so a little with that you retreat 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.700
 felipe abe more he will be able to have a 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.230
 space and cover a 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.610
 the defense because otherwise there will be a 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.590
 empty too big here 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.570
 but do not worry because you only have one 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.050
 steering wheel does not worry about this because 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.700
 The Saints plays with two two sides well 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.800
 early as you are looking bruno 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.739
 peres and in case the street and we'll 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.330
 substitute for the oil botto a place of the 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.860
 ranking is much better 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.780
 so it will not play with both sides 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.269
 that will cover the 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.769
 Steering wheel however I do not recommend you 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.300
 to advance is very arouca 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.459
 if you get the arouca you have to leave soon 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.310
 playing do not take and much to taxi her 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.420
 a big gap here in this 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.310
 beauty area 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.950
 So these are the changes that I 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.560
 I propose to you, you replace a 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.959
 fan swap the party rodrigues 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.239
 and felipe anderson and replaces an andré 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.799
 by vitor andrade you can even leave vitor 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.720
 andrade how he is here second 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.239
 attacker but I really like to use 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.130
 with the striker even as a forward 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.750
 beauty 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.930
 We also have some good ones. 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.859
 players here I 'd rather play with edu 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.479
 dracena and 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.159
 val I do not like to play very well with 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.990
 bruno rodrigo but they are practically 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:27.849
 of the same level that we are seeing 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.340
 that's dracena and bruno rodrigo 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:32.139
 now bruno rodrigo and may even be a 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.419
 little better because not a defender more 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.960
 fast but it is that the edu dracena they are 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.430
 really is already a brand in the team of 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.729
 santos has been there for a long time and I 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.699
 I like playing with it because the 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:48.789
 tradition even think that's why so 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:52.629
 guys this training that I point to 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:55.120
 you are a 4 4 2 with three more players 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:57.729
 offensive that are a case the party 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.009
 rodrigues the reason felipe 40 years in the 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.319
 coverage that is two light attackers 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:05.860
 neymar and vitor andrade and what's the 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:08.020
 way to play for sure. 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.969
 touch neymar touch neymar 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.400
 because neymar really is a player 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:14.529
 out of series that in this team of saints and 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.289
 that pulls the whole team has a very dribble 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:18.159
 Good, and I recommend you play in 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.509
 against attacks 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:22.270
 so now we'll shake a little 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:24.250
 here the tactics of the team soon we see 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.279
 who is in retention of ball in attack 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.050
 In this case we will switch to the 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:30.759
 fast attack beauty guys the saints 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.849
 plays very well on counterattacks and has 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:36.009
 fast simmons players in your team 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:39.610
 support the player leaving 16 same 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.569
 reach of destination destination 1010 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.699
 attention 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:44.589
 this because it is very important that 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:47.500
 players they will spend a little more 

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:50.139
 open in this case the exchange of position 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.449
 also destined 10 style of attack 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:56.169
 same destination of this also almost 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:59.289
 all of this pressure leaving at least 14 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:01.300
 here defensive line 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:06.490
 in this defensive line I recommend the 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:08.830
 you leave at 15 and in density 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.110
 Let's leave in the new beauty so these 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.050
 are the tactics I recommend to 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.240
 you the first support to the player 16 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.349
 second range of support 10 3rd exchange of 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.409
 position 10 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:23.110
 this type of attack 10 pressure 14 line 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:24.520
 defensive 15 new identity 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.860
 So people, I hope I have.
