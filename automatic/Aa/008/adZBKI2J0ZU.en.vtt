00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
position without having to worry about

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.080 
position without having to worry about
pulling<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:34.049> lot<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> other<00:01:34.680> cables<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.430> also

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
pulling a lot of the other cables I also

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.120 
pulling a lot of the other cables I also
pulled<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.689> cable<00:01:37.200> out<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.740> pull<00:01:37.950> this

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
pulled this cable out and pull this

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.490 
pulled this cable out and pull this
cable<00:01:38.369> out<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.939> took<00:01:39.509> photographs<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.470> make

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
cable out I took photographs to make

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.170 
cable out I took photographs to make
sure<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.860> put<00:01:41.369> them<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.790> proper

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
sure I put them in the proper

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.130 
sure I put them in the proper
orientation<00:01:44.149> so<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.299> when<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.479> put<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.930> back

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
orientation so that when I put that back

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.319 
orientation so that when I put that back
it's<00:01:46.350> easier<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:46.799> me<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.909> was<00:01:48.299> very

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
it's easier for me and I it was very

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.830 
it's easier for me and I it was very
helpful<00:01:48.930> as<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.680> reference<00:01:50.280> guide<00:01:50.520> for<00:01:50.970> me<00:01:51.180> and

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
helpful as a reference guide for me and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.710 
helpful as a reference guide for me and
then<00:01:52.229> what<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.130> do<00:01:53.340> after<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.970> did<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.479> as<00:01:54.689> I

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
then what we do after I did that as I

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.600 
then what we do after I did that as I
tested<00:01:55.290> at<00:01:55.409> first<00:01:55.649> before<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:56.040> started<00:01:56.399> putting

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
tested at first before I started putting

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.219 
tested at first before I started putting
everything<00:01:57.030> back<00:01:57.329> together<00:01:57.540> again

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
everything back together again

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.399 
everything back together again
hopefully<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.040> helps
