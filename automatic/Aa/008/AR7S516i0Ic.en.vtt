00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
the videos that i have this particular

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.800 
the videos that i have this particular
shoe<00:04:28.099> in<00:04:28.280> general<00:04:28.759> i'll<00:04:29.240> let<00:04:29.419> you<00:04:29.539> know<00:04:29.599> right

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:34.879 
this won't be a true to size so probably

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:37.300

could rock like in nine and a half and
be<00:04:43.970> fine<00:04:44.240> I<00:04:45.050> do<00:04:45.289> have<00:04:45.620> a<00:04:45.680> flyknit<00:04:46.639> trainer<00:04:46.669> ones

that<00:04:48.620> I<00:04:48.650> got<00:04:48.830> in<00:04:48.949> size<00:04:49.129> 10<00:04:49.400> and<00:04:49.430> they<00:04:49.610> feel<00:04:49.819> a

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849 
that I got in size 10 and they feel a

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:51.999 
that I got in size 10 and they feel a
little<00:04:50.060> bit<00:04:50.210> big<00:04:50.479> so<00:04:50.509> I'm<00:04:51.319> thinking<00:04:51.710> with<00:04:51.889> the

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:52.009 
little bit big so I'm thinking with the

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:54.730 
little bit big so I'm thinking with the
way<00:04:52.129> that<00:04:52.280> these<00:04:52.430> look<00:04:53.020> just<00:04:54.020> kind<00:04:54.349> of<00:04:54.379> a<00:04:54.500> mid

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
way that these look just kind of a mid

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.950 
way that these look just kind of a mid
top<00:04:55.039> version<00:04:55.400> of<00:04:55.789> what<00:04:56.000> those<00:04:56.240> shoes<00:04:56.509> are<00:04:56.750> I

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
top version of what those shoes are I

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.629 
top version of what those shoes are I
think<00:04:57.530> I<00:04:57.620> might<00:04:57.770> run<00:04:57.889> into<00:04:58.069> the<00:04:58.190> same<00:04:58.370> thing

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
think I might run into the same thing

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.399 
think I might run into the same thing
here<00:04:59.060> so<00:04:59.090> I<00:04:59.479> would<00:04:59.659> actually<00:04:59.720> go<00:04:59.960> a<00:04:59.990> half<00:05:00.169> size

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:00.409 
here so I would actually go a half size

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:01.450 
here so I would actually go a half size
down<00:05:00.680> in<00:05:00.830> here<00:05:00.979> that<00:05:01.130> would<00:05:01.250> be<00:05:01.340> my

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
down in here that would be my

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.820 
down in here that would be my
recommendation<00:05:01.490> for<00:05:02.270> flying<00:05:02.509> at<00:05:02.659> chukkas<00:05:03.020> as

recommendation for flying at chukkas as

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.350 
recommendation for flying at chukkas as

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
get a more snug fit obviously it's going
