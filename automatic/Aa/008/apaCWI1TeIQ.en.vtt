about<00:02:27.849> this<00:02:28.000> thing<00:02:28.120> is<00:02:28.239> if<00:02:28.810> you're<00:02:29.019> using<00:02:29.409> this

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
about this thing is if you're using this

for your microphone and you're using

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.330 
for your microphone and you're using
this<00:02:32.140> for<00:02:32.200> something<00:02:32.530> else<00:02:32.799> you<00:02:32.980> can<00:02:33.099> actually

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
this for something else you can actually

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.509 
this for something else you can actually
input<00:02:33.700> more<00:02:34.510> than<00:02:35.110> one<00:02:35.379> audio<00:02:35.950> into<00:02:36.400> your

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
input more than one audio into your

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:37.649 
input more than one audio into your
computer<00:02:36.790> because<00:02:37.000> this<00:02:37.120> is<00:02:37.239> completely

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659 
computer because this is completely

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.149 
computer because this is completely
separate<00:02:38.140> if<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:38.560> already<00:02:38.680> have<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:38.980> video

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
separate if you already have a video

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.949 
separate if you already have a video
card<00:02:39.519> or<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:39.970> already<00:02:40.150> have<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:40.269> mic<00:02:40.480> in<00:02:40.659> the

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
card or you already have a mic in the

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.630 
card or you already have a mic in the
USB<00:02:41.409> is<00:02:41.500> completely<00:02:41.920> separate<00:02:42.220> from<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.459> rest

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
USB is completely separate from the rest

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.699 
USB is completely separate from the rest
of<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.849> audio<00:02:43.209> so<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:44.049> could<00:02:44.200> actually<00:02:44.349> add

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
of the audio so this could actually add

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.430 
of the audio so this could actually add
a<00:02:44.739> lot<00:02:45.099> of<00:02:45.250> utility<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.879> your<00:02:46.299> computer<00:02:46.840> now

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
a lot of utility to your computer now

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.300 
a lot of utility to your computer now
