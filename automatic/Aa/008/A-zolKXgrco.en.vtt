 Can already had an appearance and 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.210
 Although as a playable character for the 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.520
 second player of any time ins 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.770
 could get started the automat 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.200
 became a hit and also ran outside 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.909
 from japan very successful no wonder 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.280
 so that the game on home 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.810
 computer and consoles were ported to the 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.740
 Perhaps the most famous version is

 heiting street for pc engine civil rom 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.070
 amazingly, the first video game 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.659
 at all in the cd format 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.610
 has been published 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.490
 after some mostly failed 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.600
 experiments like street fighter 2010 for 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:43.270
 the one it appeared in 1991 the first 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.610
 true continuation the game that well 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.800

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.560
 startschuss the series was the talk is 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.330
 of course street fighter 2 the world 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.190
 courier the player were namely 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.990
 first time with several fighters 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.120
 different skills and attacks 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.730
 provided the choice between 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.120
 different characters like today 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.920
 be self-evident 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.020
 At that time, she was completely new and 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.170
 made for some vertebrae like that 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.160
 finally allowed themselves substantially 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.440
 more varied fights everyone 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.470
 character had a unique 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.150
 martial arts and where 30 or more attacks 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.090
 including handles and throws 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.650
 At the time also an absolute novum 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.530
 no wonder then that the street fighter 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.450
 2 automat a huge success was exactly 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.120
 like the home console version for super 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.319
 nintendo and mega drive 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.379
 in fact, street fighter 2 became like that 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.420
 popular that even hollywood coal week 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.819

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.120
 decisive battle among other things 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.150
 nobody lesser 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.830
 if the himself as cool 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.489
 kylie minogue as carrie &amp; rau julia as 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.440
 bite 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.599
 However, the stripes does not hold 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.430
 Really to his submission and is everything 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.519
 not really recommended in all 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.640
 except for trasch fans mainly because 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.680
 bite the chaos of the popularity of 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.450
 street fighter second does not have that 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.909
 crash on the contrary it followed 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.209
 numerous versions portals and 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:12.670
 updates from street fighter 2 to 1995 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.920

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.319
 row appeared street fighter alpha 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.629
 russia stream did not just bring one 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.750
 new doctor part with himself but built 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.609
 also the kombo system continues from street 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.859
 fighter alpha became its own 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.319
 series with a total of two continuations 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.629
 the same applies to street fighter ex 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.000
 a 3ds'm living on the known 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.400
 street fighter characters also own 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.890
 In addition, fighter includes sat 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.209
 capcom also plays crossover games like 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.160
 x-men stock market street fighter from the years 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.500
 1996 an idea from the finally the 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.049
 versus row and especially the course 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.560
 Three marvel vs. capcom titles emerge 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.750
 should 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.950
 the third main part of the street fighter 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.829
 row finally appeared in 1997 street 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.139
 fighter 3 new generation stands out 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.879
 especially because of that capcom on 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.280
 set completely new characters 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.470
 only view and canon appeared in the 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.239
 first version of the game followed on it 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.790
 however, two more versions of the 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.129
 game second impact and third strike 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.989
 but all in all, street could go on 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.299
 three his predecessor not the water 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.310
 and then it became something 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.710
 quieter around street fighter after the 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.530
 release of hurts war took more 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.229
 as eight years to the 17th 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.150
 october 2007 to another 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.370
 was announced 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.860
 Street Fighter 4 solved under beating 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.080
 fans a veritable hype 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.510
 the return of the well-known characters 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.150
 paired with the three-dimensional optics 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.490
 in the chic cel shading look that alone 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.440
 was a pleasure for many fans 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.810
 but also the great combination system 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.090
 since street fighter 2 super turbo 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.310
 solid component of the series marked 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.070
 back to joined with new ones 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.230
 ultra combos and counterattacks called 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.880
 focus text and some new ones 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.070
 but also characterize fresh elements 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.830
 the entire package certainly convinces them 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.080
 and capcom not only earned a lot of praise 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.699
 by fans and critics but was allowed 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.660
 also about very good sales figures 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.120
 looking forward 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.350

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.270
 an xbox community around the game 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.860
 build 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.960
 after the two updates super street
