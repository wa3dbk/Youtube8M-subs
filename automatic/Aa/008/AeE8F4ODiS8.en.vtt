00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
pegs and this little piece right here

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.399 
pegs and this little piece right here
get<00:01:56.670> your<00:01:56.820> 1<00:01:57.000> by<00:01:57.180> 3<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:58.130> start<00:01:59.130> by<00:01:59.909> attaching

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
get your 1 by 3 and start by attaching

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.679 
get your 1 by 3 and start by attaching
one<00:02:01.409> black<00:02:01.979> peg<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.520> end<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.540> should

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
look like this and put the grade on get

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.380 
look like this and put the grade on get
your<00:02:06.060> 1<00:02:06.270> by<00:02:06.420> 4<00:02:06.829> i'll<00:02:07.829> give<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.160> 10<00:02:08.910> seconds<00:02:09.300> to

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
your 1 by 4 i'll give you 10 seconds to

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.009 
your 1 by 4 i'll give you 10 seconds to
memorize<00:02:09.629> this

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.300 

all<00:02:15.019> right<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.170> think<00:02:15.349> that's<00:02:15.409> enough<00:02:15.590> not<00:02:16.129> ten

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
all right I think that's enough not ten

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.059 
all right I think that's enough not ten
seconds<00:02:16.610> but<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:17.510> put<00:02:17.750> this<00:02:18.200> like<00:02:18.590> they're<00:02:18.860> so

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
seconds but you put this like they're so

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.789 
seconds but you put this like they're so
it<00:02:19.189> looks<00:02:19.400> like<00:02:19.459> this<00:02:20.049> then<00:02:21.049> you<00:02:21.379> get<00:02:21.530> your<00:02:21.560> 1

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
it looks like this then you get your 1

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.100 
it looks like this then you get your 1
