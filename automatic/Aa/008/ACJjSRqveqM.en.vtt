get so many questions about how to find
middle<00:00:20.720> C<00:00:20.840> and<00:00:21.259> the<00:00:21.380> reason<00:00:21.710> why<00:00:21.829> I<00:00:21.860> get<00:00:22.369> this

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:22.579 
middle C and the reason why I get this

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.510 
middle C and the reason why I get this
question<00:00:22.790> is<00:00:23.239> because<00:00:23.419> everyone<00:00:24.050> now<00:00:24.770> has

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
question is because everyone now has

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.690 
question is because everyone now has
different<00:00:26.149> sized<00:00:26.470> keyboards<00:00:27.470> keyboards<00:00:28.399> come

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
way to find middle C is to find the C

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.850 
way to find middle C is to find the C
that's<00:00:39.440> closest<00:00:40.130> to<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:40.550> very<00:00:40.820> middle<00:00:41.560> now<00:00:42.560> if

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
that's closest to the very middle now if

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.810 
that's closest to the very middle now if
you<00:00:42.980> don't<00:00:43.220> know<00:00:43.370> yet

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
you don't know yet

your piano or game or there's several
C's<00:00:58.060> middle<00:00:59.060> C<00:00:59.329> would<00:00:59.570> be<00:00:59.720> the<00:00:59.870> one<00:01:00.140> that's

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
C's middle C would be the one that's

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.850 
C's middle C would be the one that's
closest<00:01:01.130> to<00:01:01.250> you<00:01:01.610> when<00:01:01.850> you<00:01:01.970> sit<00:01:02.470> right<00:01:03.470> in<00:01:03.829> the

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
and what I say by the closest to the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.550 
and what I say by the closest to the
middle<00:01:09.500> is<00:01:09.860> it's<00:01:10.310> not<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.820> exact<00:01:11.270> middle<00:01:11.659> but

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
middle is it's not the exact middle but

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.450 
middle is it's not the exact middle but

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
if you went to the right you're getting

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.790

that's<00:02:09.739> not<00:02:10.009> middle<00:02:10.340> C<00:02:10.580> middle<00:02:11.450> C<00:02:11.630> will<00:02:12.080> be

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
that's not middle C middle C will be

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.320 
that's not middle C middle C will be
comfortable<00:02:14.769> and<00:02:15.769> if<00:02:16.069> I<00:02:16.190> went<00:02:16.430> down<00:02:16.700> to<00:02:17.209> the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
comfortable and if I went down to the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.500 
comfortable and if I went down to the
left

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
left

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.479 
left
like<00:02:20.510> I<00:02:20.959> can't<00:02:21.200> match<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.650> at<00:02:21.769> all<00:02:21.920> so<00:02:22.160> I'm<00:02:22.340> not

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
like I can't match it at all so I'm not

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.420 
like I can't match it at all so I'm not
going<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.090> try<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.390> further<00:02:24.019> but<00:02:24.830> so<00:02:25.130> you<00:02:25.280> have

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
going to try and further but so you have

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.160 
going to try and further but so you have
three<00:02:25.700> ways<00:02:25.880> to<00:02:25.940> know<00:02:26.330> if<00:02:26.510> it's<00:02:26.660> middle<00:02:26.900> C

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
three ways to know if it's middle C

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.550 
three ways to know if it's middle C
number<00:02:27.920> one<00:02:28.370> again<00:02:29.239> it<00:02:29.599> is<00:02:29.810> closest<00:02:30.349> to<00:02:30.440> the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
number one again it is closest to the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.280 
number one again it is closest to the
middle<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.400> your<00:02:31.670> instrument<00:02:32.390> number<00:02:32.900> two

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
you're sitting at the middle and number

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.900 
you're sitting at the middle and number
three<00:02:38.030> it<00:02:38.299> is<00:02:38.360> though<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.440> is<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:40.099> tone<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.459> the

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
seed that you can match the easiest with

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.030 
seed that you can match the easiest with
your<00:02:43.280> voice<00:02:43.810> okay<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:45.230> hope<00:02:45.560> that<00:02:45.739> will<00:02:45.890> help
