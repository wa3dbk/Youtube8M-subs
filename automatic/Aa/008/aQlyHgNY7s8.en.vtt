00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Kukayev guys with you resman and today I 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.450
 tell you how to make a minion in 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.370
 minecraft without any mods when 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.290
 using only one command Well 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.480
 let's go first thing we need 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.490
 install the command block then it 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.619
 openings insert a command link into it 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.660
 which left under the video well and 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.449
 of course activate it now 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.279
 just waiting for the construction of the machine but 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.689
 now we will start crafting from ours 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.210
 minion for this we need 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.519
 stone slab fence rod and slab and 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.679
 red torch 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.870
 we throw down the stone slab and 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.480
 fence in one place we got this 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.430
 luminous armor stand then and 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.250
 throw off the eaves and red 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.719
 torch we get such a treasured fishing pole 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.000
 thanks to which we can manage 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.629
 our minions now we need 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.950
 install our armor stand and how 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.270
 would throw in her 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.190
 bait the sound of our minion 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.050
 appeared and now we can follow him 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.440
 invoke by right clicking on 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.309
 earth push and now minion can 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.600
 for us to walk he moves enough 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.689
 quick it is now i have a little bit 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.540
 podlagivaet and so he move in 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.229
 principle smoothly knocking a fishing rod on the ground 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.180
 once again we can change its functionality 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.670
 and now we will even have to lift 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.350
 items that are lying on the ground 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.630
 there is now I took off a little wool he her 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.820
 all raised to us to pick it up 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.729
 we need to take his place under 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.110
 he will have such a little chest and 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.500
 try to open it and how we see 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.140
 here is all our wool is also our minion 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.250
 can dig mine for that we choose 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.610
 in the next mode and our minion 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.930
 goes underground and starts 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.299
 digging up a mine while mining 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.450
 resources he will dig so until 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.079
 reach from the minimum and all resources 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.090
 will be selected in his inventory and either 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.890
 the case if the inventory and it will be hammered 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.890
 already hammered in as I threw him too 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.049
 a lot of trash he starts to issue on 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.170
 the surface all the resources that he 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.539
 digs out after just a minute 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.380
 our minion has just dug a lot 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.720
 resources 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.660
 the foundation of course is the cobblestone i don't need 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.050
 but still, after all 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.540
 he dug it and of course 18 coal 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.920
 Well, the next useful feature of ours 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.180
 point menu is that it can 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.160
 place the torch instead of us but for 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.209
 this he will need coal, well 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.100
 let's choose this mode that's fine i 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:40.560
 you can throw some coal let's 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:44.040
 We also throw him when he comes after us 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.610
 he is after some distance 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.650
 torch 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.360
 It is very convenient for traveling on 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.910
 caves let's try to go down 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.150
 let's say in this cave as you can see 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.640
 traveling the sword in the caves and goes for 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.040
 me and sets the torch for me 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.900
 which I was supposed to arrange but if 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.299
 your minion you are fed up then 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.470
 you can stop it next 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.810
 stand still function 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.560
 and as you see, he doesn't have anywhere 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.180
 moves but if he is in principle you don't 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.750
 need him on the map you can just 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.880
 take down 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.380

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.390
