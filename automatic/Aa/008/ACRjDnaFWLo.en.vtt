00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.110
 Hi everyone this guitar lecture about the differences between 7th and major seventh Contact 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.410
 I hope to talk about it 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.850
 Even if it is the same one, 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.710
 That 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:24.980
 There is a big difference here, but I can actually tell if you try to pull that action 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.490
 If it explains with the usual that c 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.060
 You are a child of God 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:37.739
 When I play it, I try to throw some glue c 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.739
 I think you were a little urban chic stylish feeling to go Yeah it is a major 7 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.980
 This difference 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.290
 There is a difference in how the scale has become, but it also 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:52.260
 That opposite version of the diagram 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:54.600
 This doing your description but is usually in the diagram'm doing, which began One of the five input from previous 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:01.589
 I will continue 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:07.680
 So if this is a 7th chord like this, the flat sound of this child will be sunk 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:12.900
 In the case of chord c Major 7 In this case, the index finger is released and it becomes an open string. 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:16.760
 The sound of the child is added, but this is the sound of that open string 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.540
 Upon exiting is a difference of only there 4 Kaide of all of the chromatic scale 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:24.000
 This one 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:28.670
 Is a translation called strikes in such as the one-base hit from the road and counting from the soil in the code of the c 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.860
 It means that this one is long and so on 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.860
 It it is will be such form 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:42.550
 The thing of super is that it includes one half-tone scale etc. 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:46.080
 Tanga etc. add two chromatic scales 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:52.260
 You say things such as including 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:55.340
 Become 7th and issue such as one-base hit in this way to become super-such as not to major number 7 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:02:01.250
 It will be said that 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:06.140
 In the scale of Doremi's scale, the story that gas moves between 8 mi and fa 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:11.780
 Even though seems structure of the scale I was your story at the time of the 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:17.930
 I used to do the days of Dore Mifa Solaride and also how to find that scale . 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:22.459
 That kind of knowledge comes to live in this kind of behavioral theory, right? 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:27.290
 And that kind of music theory that there is no waste anymore 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:29.400
 I think it might have been understood this time, so I hope this opportunity 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.780
 Structure of the guitar scale 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:37.260
 Or to 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:39.630
 Also do good to try to remember while playing the structure because music Oso little by little of this code 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.459
 I think it might be like, but how is it? 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:47.090
 Thank you for watching this time was about the difference in the structure of 7th and major 7th 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.090
 There was
