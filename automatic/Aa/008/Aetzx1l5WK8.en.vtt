start off with the exhaust so what we
have<00:00:16.230> here<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.890> engine<00:00:17.430> Super<00:00:18.080> SES<00:00:19.080> system

reason<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:31.920> went<00:00:32.099> with<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.340> system<00:00:32.790> is

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
reason I went with this system is

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.139 
reason I went with this system is
engines<00:00:33.390> really<00:00:33.719> good<00:00:34.050> at<00:00:34.739> building<00:00:35.370> high

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
engines really good at building high

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.700 
engines really good at building high
performance<00:00:36.690> products<00:00:37.170> their<00:00:37.380> quality

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
performance products their quality

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.560 
performance products their quality
control<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.160> really<00:00:38.430> good<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.969> it's<00:00:39.300> made

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
control is really good and it's made

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.459 
control is really good and it's made
right<00:00:39.780> here<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.260> USA<00:00:41.960> biggest<00:00:42.960> reason<00:00:43.290> I

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
right here in the USA biggest reason I

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.200 
right here in the USA biggest reason I
went<00:00:43.770> with<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.160> system<00:00:44.579> versus<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:44.940> other

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
went with this system versus the other

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.860 
went with this system versus the other
is<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.050> CNC<00:00:46.710> machine<00:00:47.280> flanges<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.180> I

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
is I like the CNC machine flanges and I

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.450 
is I like the CNC machine flanges and I
like<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.260> four<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> half<00:00:49.620> inch<00:00:49.980> tips<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
like the four and a half inch tips the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.920 
like the four and a half inch tips the
four<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> half<00:00:50.820> inch<00:00:51.120> tips<00:00:51.390> are<00:00:51.539> gonna<00:00:51.660> fill

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
four and a half inch tips are gonna fill

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.439 
four and a half inch tips are gonna fill
up<00:00:52.050> all<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.410> space<00:00:52.680> we<00:00:52.980> have<00:00:53.129> here<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.730> the

good<00:01:59.370> this<00:02:00.370> flange<00:02:00.670> is<00:02:01.600> not<00:02:03.150> CNC<00:02:04.150> machine<00:02:04.570> this

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
good this flange is not CNC machine this

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.510 
good this flange is not CNC machine this
is<00:02:04.900> what's<00:02:05.200> gonna<00:02:05.410> hook<00:02:05.680> up<00:02:05.860> to<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:06.130> back<00:02:06.310> of

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
is what's gonna hook up to the back of

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.740 
is what's gonna hook up to the back of
your<00:02:06.640> catalytic<00:02:07.150> converter<00:02:07.750> and<00:02:09.570> it's<00:02:10.570> gonna

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
your catalytic converter and it's gonna

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.670 
your catalytic converter and it's gonna
go<00:02:10.960> down<00:02:11.170> here<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:12.840> this<00:02:13.840> end<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.380> then<00:02:14.470> that's

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
go down here to this end and then that's

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.240 
go down here to this end and then that's
what<00:02:14.950> your<00:02:15.390> CNC<00:02:16.390> flange<00:02:17.230> looks<00:02:17.650> like<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.160> then

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
what your CNC flange looks like and then

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.690 
what your CNC flange looks like and then
that's<00:02:18.430> gonna<00:02:18.610> hook<00:02:18.910> up<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.680> back<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:20.710> this
