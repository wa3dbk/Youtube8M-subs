 space 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.050
 m 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.230
 August 3, 2011 it goes on 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.589
 uribe with that and lenses of water only door 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.600
 lorient shop in the series that he draws because after a rome episode 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.910
 comines that had truly been disappointing 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.740
 it must be said the sarre really comes to racing turned out a lot rhythm 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.210
 slower than a resident TV 5 for example at least to be press% 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.680
 it is 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.790
 the atmosphere and atmosphere of the city the hostile one 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.440
 then the team also play the role of a character strictly speaking 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.110
 so for this time and well in gives power% the entire city has been 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.350
 mobilized to model you will be able to moved you how 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.990
 that goes on and of course you walk a trust a little long sony was going to take 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.549
 Damascus metro and I do not understand the metro train ahead 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.550
 teleports between two waters in the areas 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.580
 what's important is that the character you play is one 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.300
 fugitive he apparently a history these troubles for now the driver 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.150
 I met did not want to reveal too much, but obviously 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.490
 the compromise with the type of man for who means 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.540
 indeed 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.659
 May 30 the heaviest 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:26.740
 and the absent 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.030
 water will have 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.030
 an importance 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.030
 gaillard is a whole system of weather that has been better in motion in the 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.020
 game and depending on the weather conditions and well your enemies get 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.909
 in a slightly different way, which links it globally 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.960
 it was precisely that he did not want to focus at all on the 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.330
 fighting but rather on the escape once again to the image of chÃ¢teauroux 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.670
 said malek remember what episode was out on wii the fights that's 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.820
 part of its lens but it's clearly not the essential the 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.940
 psychology the orbit handles the atmosphere the much more with her among the 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.700
 things that I was given to see some pretty surprising visuals 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.440
 like for example but well aware to chase them by the species 2 I 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.750
 screws without too much how to describe plasma that advance behind 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:14.649
 in front of you blackberries 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:18.259
 before this one and suddenly you go without pressure that never finally 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:22.259
 to reach the goal to break surprising all they have passages one makes very dark 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:23.729
 totally to the tours 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:26.629
 and then the trademark of her lenses cease elected green 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.399
 alternatives this world that opens in front of you there is rather good products 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:33.239
 and quite different from past episodes 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.299
 the music she is no longer made by akira yamaoka you know leave them 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.120
 konami 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.489
 well it will be the composer of the musics of experts the series 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.489
 so another atmosphere 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.659
 % 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.450
 frankly it can not first for now with it's not bad 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.309
 from what I saw the semolina 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:02.639
 see a little bit behind 1 is his version in 3d relief doxa parents well 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:03.300
 pink orange 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.819
 but if we played pretty handsome 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.249
 e rather well done for the moment the fights one must dream again a 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:10.059
 little bit a few things 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:12.459
 it is still a little bad state of wastewater just now 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.769
 not at all the case of these lenses the game is planned on ps3 sony and xbox 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.149
 360 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:20.019
 for the end of the year no precise date yet 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.129
 but in any case it looks pretty good I can not wait to play this 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.949
 psychology this character 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:28.529
 and to make envy go very quickly to his organs a point fr for others 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:29.849
 the pressure of other games 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:30.599
 to each other in 2011
