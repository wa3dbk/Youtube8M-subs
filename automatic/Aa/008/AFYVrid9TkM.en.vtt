 vitality and good I told myself the micro 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.620

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.840
 if it is on the other hand you hear the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.900
 sound records there are the two companions and 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.600
 shooting each other with gain and 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.489
 well I also have deficient 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.730
 gameplay that this was the game that 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.350
 I said the other day that the ipc what 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.900

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.500
 At the end of the day, I did not say I was losing 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.500

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.080
 try to put in portillo because 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.820

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.560

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.090
 burst in fish and if we exaggerate but what 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.640
