of the muscle paralysis good and for

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.900 
of the muscle paralysis good and for
that<00:03:00.600> we<00:03:00.810> use<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.620> medication<00:03:02.250> point<00:03:02.640> in<00:03:02.760> your

statement a combination of music we know

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:18.640 
statement a combination of music we know
naturally<00:03:05.610> this<00:03:14.810> will<00:03:15.810> start<00:03:16.080> a<00:03:16.230> bit<00:03:16.470> strong

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
naturally this will start a bit strong

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:25.160 
naturally this will start a bit strong
and<00:03:22.670> after<00:03:23.670> that<00:03:23.820> we<00:03:24.030> are<00:03:24.120> very<00:03:24.300> sure<00:03:24.900> that

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
and after that we are very sure that

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.630 
and after that we are very sure that
you'll<00:03:25.410> be<00:03:25.590> able<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.920> break<00:03:26.130> on<00:03:26.310> its<00:03:26.459> own

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
you'll be able to break on its own

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.840 
you'll be able to break on its own
because<00:03:27.390> if<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:28.050> muscle<00:03:28.740> paralysis<00:03:28.950> is<00:03:29.580> not

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
because if the muscle paralysis is not

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.240 
because if the muscle paralysis is not
reversed<00:03:30.270> then<00:03:30.900> we<00:03:31.140> will<00:03:31.320> not<00:03:31.470> breathe<00:03:31.740> on<00:03:32.100> its

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
reversed then we will not breathe on its

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.710 
reversed then we will not breathe on its
own<00:03:32.870> so<00:03:33.870> when<00:03:34.050> you<00:03:34.140> are<00:03:34.230> sure<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:34.470> you
