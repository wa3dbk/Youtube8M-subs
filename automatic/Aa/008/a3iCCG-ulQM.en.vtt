00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.490 
mean in the beginning at first yeah but
it<00:01:27.390> wasn't<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.780> tight<00:01:27.960> game<00:01:28.110> where<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.380> could

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
it wasn't a tight game where you could

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.469 
it wasn't a tight game where you could
say<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> game<00:01:29.430> winner<00:01:29.640> was<00:01:29.850> coming<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.240> but

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
say a game winner was coming on but

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.030 
say a game winner was coming on but
obviously<00:01:30.810> those<00:01:30.990> five<00:01:31.200> kicks<00:01:31.500> help<00:01:31.740> me<00:01:31.829> for

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
obviously those five kicks help me for

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.950 
obviously those five kicks help me for
in<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.310> future<00:01:32.460> maybe<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.939> might<00:01:33.180> need<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> long

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
in the future maybe I might need a long

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.230 
in the future maybe I might need a long
game<00:01:34.170> winner<00:01:34.409> whatever<00:01:35.400> has<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:36.210> I

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
game winner whatever has to be but I
