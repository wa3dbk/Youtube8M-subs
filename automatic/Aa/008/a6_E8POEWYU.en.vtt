00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
pretty much I pretty much you guys see

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.860 
pretty much I pretty much you guys see
exactly<00:02:09.929> like<00:02:10.739> all<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.190> complain<00:02:11.580> about

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
exactly like all of you complain about

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.700 
exactly like all of you complain about
how<00:02:12.870> Android<00:02:13.410> gets

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
how Android gets

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.950 
how Android gets
updates<00:02:14.010> before<00:02:14.250> iOS<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:15.270> all<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:15.750> and

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
updates before iOS and all of this and

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.040 
updates before iOS and all of this and
as<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.650> see<00:02:16.830> this<00:02:16.980> update<00:02:17.400> was<00:02:17.580> pretty<00:02:17.820> much

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
as you see this update was pretty much

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.810 
as you see this update was pretty much
released<00:02:19.050> as<00:02:19.320> soon<00:02:19.650> as<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:19.980> was<00:02:20.160> on<00:02:20.340> Android

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
released as soon as it was on Android

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.900 
released as soon as it was on Android
and<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:22.650> believe<00:02:23.010> that<00:02:23.430> if<00:02:23.520> they<00:02:23.670> would<00:02:23.820> have

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
and I believe that if they would have

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.410 
and I believe that if they would have
taken<00:02:24.030> their<00:02:24.240> time<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.810> really<00:02:26.270> really<00:02:27.270> took

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
taken their time and really really took

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.770 
taken their time and really really took
their<00:02:27.630> time<00:02:27.810> with<00:02:28.050> this<00:02:28.170> update<00:02:29.660> instead<00:02:30.660> of

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
their time with this update instead of

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.710 
their time with this update instead of
releasing<00:02:31.020> it<00:02:31.350> like<00:02:31.530> immediately<00:02:32.480> there<00:02:33.480> it

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
releasing it like immediately there it

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.370 
releasing it like immediately there it
would<00:02:33.840> have<00:02:33.930> been<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.050> lot<00:02:34.170> better<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:37.020> I

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
would have been a lot better and so I

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.110 
would have been a lot better and so I
don't<00:02:38.040> know<00:02:38.100> that's<00:02:38.280> my<00:02:38.400> thought<00:02:38.610> on<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:38.880> I

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
don't know that's my thought on it I

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.760 
don't know that's my thought on it I
believe<00:02:39.450> they<00:02:39.600> could<00:02:39.660> have<00:02:39.840> fixed<00:02:40.050> a<00:02:40.230> lot<00:02:40.290> of

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
believe they could have fixed a lot of

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.870 
believe they could have fixed a lot of
the<00:02:40.830> bugs<00:02:41.010> if<00:02:41.190> they<00:02:41.280> would<00:02:41.430> have<00:02:41.460> just<00:02:41.550> taken

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
the bugs if they would have just taken

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.950 
the bugs if they would have just taken
their<00:02:42.090> time<00:02:42.210> with<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:43.530> um<00:02:44.660> by<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.690> way<00:02:45.780> I'm

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
their time with it so um by the way I'm

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.170 
their time with it so um by the way I'm
terrible<00:02:46.290> with<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.730> prototype<00:02:47.730> as<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.030> guys

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
terrible with the prototype as you guys

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.650 
terrible with the prototype as you guys
see<00:02:48.710> but<00:02:49.710> i<00:02:50.010> believe<00:02:50.400> they<00:02:50.880> if<00:02:51.150> they<00:02:51.570> would

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
see but i believe they if they would

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
see but i believe they if they would
have<00:02:51.750> taken<00:02:51.870> their<00:02:52.050> time<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.440> would<00:02:52.530> have<00:02:52.620> been

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
have taken their time it would have been

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.830 
have taken their time it would have been
a<00:02:52.740> lot<00:02:52.770> better<00:02:52.920> most<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.210> most<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.720> bug

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
a lot better most of the most of the bug

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.300 
a lot better most of the most of the bug
fixes<00:02:55.200> if<00:02:55.380> not<00:02:55.560> all<00:02:55.770> could<00:02:56.100> have<00:02:56.130> been

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
fixes if not all could have been

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.110 
fixes if not all could have been
prevented<00:02:57.270> so<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.920> know<00:02:59.040> in<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.250> future<00:02:59.460> if

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
prevented so you know in the future if

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.830 
prevented so you know in the future if
they<00:03:00.330> take<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.540> long<00:03:00.750> time<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:02.330> update<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.630> game

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
they take a long time to update the game

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.490 
they take a long time to update the game

on<00:04:18.989> that<00:04:19.170> the<00:04:20.540> just<00:04:21.540> crazy<00:04:22.140> amount<00:04:22.470> of<00:04:22.590> lag

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
on that the just crazy amount of lag

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.140 
on that the just crazy amount of lag
and<00:04:23.810> primary<00:04:24.810> being<00:04:25.050> broken<00:04:25.319> and<00:04:25.940> then<00:04:26.940> some

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
of those some of those weapons so I

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.580 
of those some of those weapons so I
believe<00:04:29.639> these<00:04:30.060> could<00:04:30.270> have<00:04:30.300> been<00:04:30.590> completely

believe these could have been completely

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.409 
believe these could have been completely

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
prevented if they would have just taken

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:34.879 
prevented if they would have just taken
their<00:04:33.720> time<00:04:33.870> with<00:04:34.139> it<00:04:34.289> instead<00:04:34.409> of<00:04:34.590> releasing

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
their time with it instead of releasing

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.159 
their time with it instead of releasing
it<00:04:35.190> as<00:04:35.280> soon<00:04:35.400> as<00:04:35.520> Android<00:04:35.940> was<00:04:36.120> released<00:04:36.479> or

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
it as soon as Android was released or

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.869 
it as soon as Android was released or
like<00:04:37.349> the<00:04:37.500> day<00:04:37.650> after<00:04:37.860> Android<00:04:38.400> was<00:04:38.580> released
