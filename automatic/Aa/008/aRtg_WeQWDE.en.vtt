a<00:00:00.110> couple<00:00:01.110> of<00:00:01.290> days<00:00:01.500> ago<00:00:01.770> one<00:00:02.220> of<00:00:02.250> my

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
a couple of days ago one of my

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.960 
a couple of days ago one of my
subscribers<00:00:02.730> was<00:00:03.600> asking<00:00:04.140> me<00:00:04.259> for<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.670> more

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
subscribers was asking me for a more

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.909 
subscribers was asking me for a more
detailed<00:00:06.450> view<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:07.140> brakes<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.740> the

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
detailed view of the brakes and the

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.370 
detailed view of the brakes and the
shocks<00:00:08.220> on<00:00:08.610> my<00:00:08.820> go-kart<00:00:09.240> so<00:00:10.080> I'm<00:00:10.170> going<00:00:10.200> to

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
shocks on my go-kart so I'm going to

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.200 
shocks on my go-kart so I'm going to
show<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:11.750> so<00:00:13.549> the<00:00:14.549> brake<00:00:14.820> linkage<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.780> just

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
show you so the brake linkage is just

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.130 
show you so the brake linkage is just
mowing<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.300> lawn<00:00:18.449> across<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.840> street<00:00:20.060> hinge

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
mowing the lawn across the street hinge

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.890 
mowing the lawn across the street hinge
and<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.320> just<00:00:22.970> hit<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.060> brakes<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.510> just<00:00:24.660> pushes

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
and I just hit the brakes it just pushes

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.670 
and I just hit the brakes it just pushes
in<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:26.210> this<00:00:28.070> master<00:00:29.070> cylinder<00:00:29.519> here

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
in on this master cylinder here

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.440 
in on this master cylinder here
and<00:00:31.040> then<00:00:31.250> I<00:00:32.200> have<00:00:33.200> solid<00:00:33.770> brake<00:00:33.980> lines<00:00:34.450> just

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
and then I have solid brake lines just

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.260 
and then I have solid brake lines just
solid<00:00:35.930> tubing<00:00:36.410> because<00:00:37.400> the<00:00:37.730> rubber<00:00:37.940> tube

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
solid tubing because the rubber tube

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.350 
solid tubing because the rubber tube
wouldn't<00:00:38.660> go<00:00:38.840> all<00:00:39.080> the<00:00:39.290> way<00:00:39.320> to<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:39.560> back<00:00:40.360> but

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
wouldn't go all the way to the back but

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.410 
wouldn't go all the way to the back but
to<00:00:41.480> do<00:00:41.600> that<00:00:41.630> I<00:00:41.810> had<00:00:41.989> to<00:00:42.140> get<00:00:42.290> these<00:00:42.440> uh<00:00:43.420> banjo

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
to do that I had to get these uh banjo

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.210 
to do that I had to get these uh banjo
bolt<00:00:44.660> to<00:00:45.110> a<00:00:45.140> standard<00:00:46.040> brake<00:00:46.520> line<00:00:46.760> converters

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
bolt to a standard brake line converters

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.400 
bolt to a standard brake line converters
and<00:00:49.540> then<00:00:50.540> I<00:00:50.989> go<00:00:51.440> through<00:00:52.190> a<00:00:52.280> solid<00:00:52.550> brake<00:00:52.910> line

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
and then I go through a solid brake line

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.700 
and then I go through a solid brake line
that<00:00:54.410> comes<00:00:54.620> all<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:54.920> way<00:00:55.340> back<00:00:56.379> goes<00:00:57.379> across

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
that comes all the way back goes across

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.110 
that comes all the way back goes across
over<00:00:58.190> that<00:00:58.400> side<00:00:58.730> and<00:00:59.920> it<00:01:00.920> comes<00:01:01.100> all<00:01:01.340> way<00:01:01.760> back

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
over that side and it comes all way back

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.990 
over that side and it comes all way back
to<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:02.960> back<00:01:03.110> here<00:01:03.410> and<00:01:04.369> I<00:01:04.430> have<00:01:04.550> another<00:01:04.729> one

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
to the back here and I have another one

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.990 
to the back here and I have another one
of<00:01:05.089> those<00:01:05.149> banjo<00:01:05.630> bolt<00:01:05.869> converters<00:01:06.380> there<00:01:06.710> and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
of those banjo bolt converters there and

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.290 
of those banjo bolt converters there and
then<00:01:08.649> this<00:01:09.649> is<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:10.540> caliper<00:01:11.540> off<00:01:11.750> of<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.740> old

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
then this is the caliper off of a old

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.249 
then this is the caliper off of a old
Yamaha<00:01:14.300> motorcycle<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:16.840> then<00:01:17.840> they<00:01:18.050> just

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
Yamaha motorcycle and then they just

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.830 
Yamaha motorcycle and then they just
have<00:01:18.970> this<00:01:19.970> right<00:01:20.360> here<00:01:20.720> it<00:01:20.960> folds<00:01:21.560> down<00:01:21.820> and

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
have this right here it folds down and

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.620 
have this right here it folds down and
then<00:01:23.840> i<00:01:23.930> have<00:01:24.110> this<00:01:24.259> supporting<00:01:24.830> bracket<00:01:25.220> and

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
then i have this supporting bracket and

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.210 
then i have this supporting bracket and
then<00:01:26.630> it's<00:01:26.840> just<00:01:26.990> welded<00:01:27.470> in<00:01:27.560> place<00:01:27.590> and

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
then it's just welded in place and

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.540 
then it's just welded in place and
bolted<00:01:28.910> there<00:01:29.830> so<00:01:30.830> that's<00:01:31.009> how<00:01:31.160> my<00:01:31.310> brake

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
bolted there so that's how my brake

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.260 
bolted there so that's how my brake
system<00:01:32.060> works<00:01:33.160> just<00:01:34.160> a<00:01:34.369> master<00:01:34.729> cylinder<00:01:35.180> up

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
system works just a master cylinder up

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.930 
system works just a master cylinder up
front<00:01:36.010> solid<00:01:37.010> line<00:01:37.159> all<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.400> way<00:01:37.520> to<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.760> back

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
front solid line all the way to the back

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.390 
front solid line all the way to the back
to<00:01:39.700> motorcycle<00:01:40.700> caliper<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:42.350> disc

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
to motorcycle caliper and the disc

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.780 
to motorcycle caliper and the disc
so<00:01:44.940> that's<00:01:45.090> my<00:01:45.210> braking<00:01:45.600> system<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.790> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
so that's my braking system and the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.399 
so that's my braking system and the
shocks

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
shocks

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.760 
shocks
what<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:49.950> did<00:01:50.280> was<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:51.450> actually<00:01:51.869> cut<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.409> frame

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
what I did was I actually cut the frame

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.239 
what I did was I actually cut the frame
in<00:01:53.009> half<00:01:53.689> right<00:01:54.689> down<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.020> middle<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.679> I

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:56.249 
in half right down the middle and I

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:59.899 
in half right down the middle and I
extended<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.869> square<00:01:58.259> frame<00:01:58.619> with<00:01:59.609> a<00:01:59.640> little

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
extended to square frame with a little

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.959 
extended to square frame with a little
bit<00:02:00.030> bigger<00:02:00.929> square<00:02:01.500> frame<00:02:01.859> and<00:02:02.130> then<00:02:02.880> I

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
bit bigger square frame and then I

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.059 
bit bigger square frame and then I
drilled<00:02:03.299> holes<00:02:03.569> in<00:02:04.170> each<00:02:04.289> side<00:02:04.649> would<00:02:04.979> have

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
drilled holes in each side would have

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:09.080 
drilled holes in each side would have
bolt<00:02:05.310> through<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:06.350> so<00:02:07.350> those<00:02:07.979> were<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.940> go

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
bolt through it so those were to go

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.639 
bolt through it so those were to go
those<00:02:09.420> two<00:02:09.629> nuts<00:02:09.840> are<00:02:10.019> tightened<00:02:10.349> against

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
those two nuts are tightened against

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.740 
those two nuts are tightened against
each<00:02:10.739> other<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.069> they<00:02:11.190> won't<00:02:11.370> come<00:02:11.519> off

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
each other so they won't come off

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.050 
each other so they won't come off
there's<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.840> washroom<00:02:13.319> between<00:02:13.739> same<00:02:14.730> thing<00:02:14.940> on

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
there's a washroom between same thing on

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.990 
there's a washroom between same thing on
that<00:02:15.209> side<00:02:16.430> so<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.640> whole<00:02:17.849> frame<00:02:18.920> can<00:02:19.920> bend<00:02:20.730> in

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
that side so the whole frame can bend in

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.869 
that side so the whole frame can bend in
the<00:02:21.090> middle<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:22.010> then<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.190> just<00:02:23.459> took<00:02:23.640> these

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
the middle and then I just took these

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.069 
the middle and then I just took these
shocks<00:02:24.349> Mike<00:02:25.349> smuts<00:02:25.739> them<00:02:25.950> horizontally

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
shocks Mike smuts them horizontally

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:32.979 
shocks Mike smuts them horizontally
across<00:02:28.079> the<00:02:28.379> pivot<00:02:28.650> point<00:02:29.660> so<00:02:31.640> when<00:02:32.640> there's

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
across the pivot point so when there's

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.740 
across the pivot point so when there's
weight<00:02:33.989> on<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:34.560> just<00:02:34.879> folds

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
weight on it it just folds

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.420 
weight on it it just folds
so<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.350> only<00:02:38.500> thing<00:02:38.590> connecting<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.190> front

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
so the only thing connecting the front

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.640 
so the only thing connecting the front
to<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.580> rear<00:02:39.850> are<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.900> shocks<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.560> those

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
to the rear are the shocks and those
