00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.130
 or after three weeks we return to 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.320
 talk about on parma channel we have 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.759
 we saw I saw good yesterday too 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.190
 I'm a three-man defense is played 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.780
 center your first impressions of 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.730
 field on the parma after we have 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.650
 interviewed with the rapids arrive not 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.170
 there had still been official matches 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:32.850
 a very aggressive team the ball is 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:37.290
 always very tactically very fit 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:42.480
 organization still are learning the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:45.360
 tactic is that we want to wait 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.890
 a future good for Parma 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.750
 meanwhile the parma has not yet taken a 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.610
 in other words, goals in these friendly matches 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.870
 the beginning is encouraging for you too 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.739
 as a defense department 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:00.809
 if all day I worked, look 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:03.539
 defensive is always improving all 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.470
 days we do it well taken up by 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.240
 mesh number 23 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.950
 you are a fan of michael jordan i ask you 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.710
 because he knows you have the historical number 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.040
 taken because when he arrived at the real 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.360
 madrid and my first first issue of tea 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.860
 champions is taken this last 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.659
 question regarding your role 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.490
 within a three-man defense and that 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.390
 center-right or you can also play 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.579
 centered center left no me first 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.340
 my whole life is played with four 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.500
 defenders 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.970
 now this is a 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.280
 new a new tactic i can play in 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.860
 center right 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.810
 also last year I played 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.310
 if the center left play in three though 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.780
 according to me quite suitable for you 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.430
 because it allows you to play a little more 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.320
 on the advance you are defended enough 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.970
 aggressive so you should succeed well 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.680
 playing so yes yes it is a portugal if 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.050
 very much the team and play with 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.790
 four I don't ride with with three 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:14.860
 defenders and last year it's me who that 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:18.500
 goes up stronger but these years 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:22.370
 you want to learn what mister wants 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.950
 field me but I said you were playing 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.420
 in the sporting team b but there 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.770
 they are such strong defenders in the 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:36.750
 team played because direction 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:41.610
 I contracted company I said that 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:45.630
 does not renew and bring me second team 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.760
 of mobbing has arrived is played in 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.490
 champions league and mothers when arrived 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.240
 at sporting they didn't do it to me 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:57.060
 signing up 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:00.630
 so I think that sporty doesn't hold 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.890
 interest m had no question 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.290
 in short, a technical opportunity 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.470
 yes yes you played in team b also 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.240
 of real madrid is something else 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.490
 there I think he understood that it is a bit 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:16.080
 mourinho protégé or if it is true 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:22.020
 because he is Portuguese I am Portuguese 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:27.090

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:29.810
 mismo of the deminaine are at all like 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:35.070
 I worked in Switzerland fared well 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:41.190
 award for evolution and mothers branches 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:42.030
 mourinho said ok take whoever has him 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.709
 done well 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.330
 you know, however, that the degree for a 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.840
 defender take a series in 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.990

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.080
 for defenders ex series c fine here since 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.880

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:02.050

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:17.860
 after working day by day and 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:19.570
 wait for it to arrive well e 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.430
 play you played with higuain and your real 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.820

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.720
 advancing on set pieces made

 some goals in the career of successes 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.070

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.220
