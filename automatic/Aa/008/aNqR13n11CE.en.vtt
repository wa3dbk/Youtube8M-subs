and that kind of stopped me from

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:54.740 
and that kind of stopped me from
exercising<00:03:53.069> as<00:03:53.400> much<00:03:53.609> as<00:03:53.760> I'd<00:03:53.909> like<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.180> and

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
exercising as much as I'd like to and

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.800 
exercising as much as I'd like to and
going<00:03:55.709> out<00:03:55.950> as<00:03:56.159> much<00:03:56.340> as<00:03:56.400> I'd<00:03:56.700> like<00:03:56.909> to<00:03:57.150> do<00:03:57.599> to

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
going out as much as I'd like to do to

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.670 
going out as much as I'd like to do to
that<00:03:57.989> pain<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:59.299> I<00:04:00.299> take<00:04:00.750> muscle<00:04:00.959> relaxers

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.940 
that pain and I take muscle relaxers
wood<00:04:02.069> which<00:04:02.579> actually<00:04:03.230> sometimes<00:04:04.230> makes<00:04:04.799> me

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
wood which actually sometimes makes me

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.140 
wood which actually sometimes makes me
gain<00:04:05.189> weight<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:05.760> retain<00:04:06.750> water<00:04:07.049> so<00:04:08.150> that's

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
gain weight and retain water so that's

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.080 
gain weight and retain water so that's
why<00:04:09.629> the<00:04:10.230> water<00:04:10.769> pools<00:04:11.099> are<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:11.939> know<00:04:12.060> pretty

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
why the water pools are you know pretty

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.270 
why the water pools are you know pretty
helpful<00:04:12.629> for<00:04:13.019> me<00:04:14.810> but<00:04:15.810> if<00:04:16.019> I<00:04:16.139> do<00:04:16.199> do<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.680> 800

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
helpful for me but if I do do the 800

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.129 
helpful for me but if I do do the 800
calories<00:04:17.789> that<00:04:18.060> 800<00:04:18.630> calories<00:04:18.959> without

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
calories that 800 calories without

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.279 
calories that 800 calories without
exercising<00:04:20.009> and<00:04:20.519> that's<00:04:21.329> probably<00:04:21.750> going<00:04:22.199> to

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
exercising and that's probably going to

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.170 
exercising and that's probably going to
be<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.440> majority<00:04:22.650> at<00:04:23.009> the<00:04:23.099> time<00:04:23.340> just<00:04:23.729> based
