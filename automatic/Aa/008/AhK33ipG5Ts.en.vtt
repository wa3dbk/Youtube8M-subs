the<00:05:28.990> Rice's<00:05:29.470> were<00:05:29.680> like<00:05:29.890> mixed<00:05:30.460> together<00:05:30.670> so

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
the Rice's were like mixed together so

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.010 
the Rice's were like mixed together so
it<00:05:31.450> was<00:05:31.600> like<00:05:31.780> the<00:05:32.380> same<00:05:33.180> thing<00:05:34.210> it<00:05:34.480> might<00:05:34.780> even

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
it was like the same thing it might even

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:48.429 
it was like the same thing it might even
it<00:05:35.290> out<00:05:35.460> no<00:05:36.460> probably<00:05:36.880> not

00:05:48.429 --> 00:05:48.439 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:53.199

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:00.739 
the other one even but there they need

00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:04.209

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:37.909 
closer than a teriyaki in two in the

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:47.450 
closer than a teriyaki in two in the
description<00:06:38.449> so<00:06:38.779> let's<00:06:39.019> try<00:06:39.379> the<00:06:39.439> other<00:06:39.529> one

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:54.620 

that<00:06:48.060> was<00:06:48.180> pretty<00:06:48.420> bad<00:06:53.090> the<00:06:54.090> rice<00:06:54.330> isn't

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630 
that was pretty bad the rice isn't

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.220 
that was pretty bad the rice isn't
really<00:06:55.080> rice<00:06:55.320> either<00:06:56.720> it's<00:06:57.720> kind<00:06:57.990> of<00:06:58.020> more

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:58.230 
really rice either it's kind of more

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.790 
really rice either it's kind of more
like<00:06:58.260> couscous<00:06:59.330> sort<00:07:00.330> of<00:07:00.480> bigger<00:07:00.660> grains<00:07:01.050> than

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 
like couscous sort of bigger grains than

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.450 
like couscous sort of bigger grains than
couscous<00:07:02.460> maybe<00:07:03.620> but<00:07:04.620> that<00:07:04.650> kind<00:07:04.980> of<00:07:05.040> texture

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.460 
couscous maybe but that kind of texture

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.090 
couscous maybe but that kind of texture
and<00:07:05.610> I<00:07:05.670> don't<00:07:05.730> mind<00:07:06.210> that<00:07:06.450> texture<00:07:07.100> except

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.100 
and I don't mind that texture except

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.250 
and I don't mind that texture except
it's<00:07:08.250> definitely<00:07:08.730> not<00:07:09.240> rice<00:07:09.540> it's<00:07:09.840> definitely

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.260 
it's definitely not rice it's definitely

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.740

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 
honestly two thumbs down on this

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.650 
honestly two thumbs down on this
both<00:07:32.010> of<00:07:32.190> these<00:07:32.310> are<00:07:32.520> awful<00:07:34.670> okay<00:07:35.670> well<00:07:36.300> this
