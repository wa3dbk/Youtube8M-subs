 days that was true I will tell you that only 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.719
 It was a lie if life gives me another 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.090
 opportunity I will tell you that I do not want another

 for us the rhymes in the trash and 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.909
 stopped being what I was looking for the

 blurred memory of a heart that already 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.240
 I was going out I was that fell from 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:14.389
