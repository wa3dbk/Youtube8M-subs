00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.830 
this to sketch out where I want my black
to<00:02:14.410> be<00:02:14.560> so<00:02:15.490> instead<00:02:15.880> of<00:02:15.970> putting<00:02:16.210> it<00:02:16.420> where<00:02:16.630> are

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
to be so instead of putting it where are

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.780 
to be so instead of putting it where are
the<00:02:17.050> black<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.709> put<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:17.980> underneath<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.640> so

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
the black you put it underneath it so

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.690 
the black you put it underneath it so
you<00:02:18.880> can<00:02:19.060> kind<00:02:19.209> of<00:02:19.330> curve<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.720> block<00:02:19.900> around

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
you can kind of curve the block around

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:32.330 
you can kind of curve the block around
so<00:02:21.700> if<00:02:21.850> I<00:02:21.940> look<00:02:22.090> straight<00:02:22.570> in

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.449 

now<00:02:33.180> I'm<00:02:33.420> clearing<00:02:33.780> with<00:02:33.959> some<00:02:34.200> black<00:02:34.650> gel

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
now I'm clearing with some black gel

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.750 
now I'm clearing with some black gel
