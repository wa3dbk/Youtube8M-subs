Darrell from Brighton and Sussex Medical
School<00:00:06.130> please<00:00:06.340> welcome

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:15.749 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:19.019 

now<00:00:16.749> how<00:00:17.619> many<00:00:17.679> parts<00:00:18.189> does<00:00:18.400> the<00:00:18.519> brain<00:00:18.730> have

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
now how many parts does the brain have

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.499 
now how many parts does the brain have
first<00:00:19.419> -<00:00:20.019> about<00:00:20.230> -<00:00:20.529> has<00:00:21.099> three<00:00:21.519> dollar<00:00:21.849> bill<00:00:22.239> at

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
first - about - has three dollar bill at

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.540 
first - about - has three dollar bill at
the<00:00:22.570> front<00:00:22.810> for<00:00:23.499> brain<00:00:23.769> built<00:00:24.130> in<00:00:24.249> middle

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
the front for brain built in middle

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.759 
the front for brain built in middle
midbrain<00:00:25.089> and<00:00:25.419> hindbrain<00:00:25.659> at<00:00:26.079> the<00:00:26.140> back<00:00:26.319> okay

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:26.769 
midbrain and hindbrain at the back okay

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.290 
midbrain and hindbrain at the back okay
but<00:00:27.039> their<00:00:27.159> loads<00:00:27.550> of<00:00:27.640> little<00:00:27.819> parts<00:00:28.119> within

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
but their loads of little parts within

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.790 
but their loads of little parts within
it<00:00:28.509> so<00:00:28.749> they<00:00:28.869> all<00:00:28.960> interconnect<00:00:29.259> with<00:00:29.649> one

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
it so they all interconnect with one

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.380 
it so they all interconnect with one
another<00:00:30.009> and<00:00:30.159> I'm<00:00:30.220> a<00:00:30.249> silly<00:00:30.550> used<00:00:30.849> to<00:00:30.999> use<00:00:31.179> all

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
another and I'm a silly used to use all

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.180 
another and I'm a silly used to use all
of<00:00:31.419> it<00:00:31.659> we<00:00:31.960> all<00:00:31.989> think<00:00:32.349> that<00:00:32.380> we<00:00:32.500> only<00:00:32.649> use<00:00:32.739> 10%

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
of it we all think that we only use 10%

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.009 
of it we all think that we only use 10%
we've<00:00:33.670> heard<00:00:33.850> that<00:00:33.969> myth<00:00:34.180> we<00:00:34.359> only<00:00:34.449> use<00:00:34.600> 10%<00:00:34.809> of

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
we've heard that myth we only use 10% of

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:36.599 
we've heard that myth we only use 10% of
em<00:00:35.140> but<00:00:35.410> we<00:00:35.530> use<00:00:35.710> all<00:00:35.980> of<00:00:36.129> our<00:00:36.219> brain<00:00:36.430> but<00:00:36.579> not

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:36.609 
em but we use all of our brain but not

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:39.150 
em but we use all of our brain but not
all<00:00:36.789> at<00:00:36.910> the<00:00:36.969> same<00:00:37.149> time<00:00:37.420> okay<00:00:37.930> now<00:00:38.109> these<00:00:38.890> what

your brain yes yeah yeah so I wanna

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:45.209 
your brain yes yeah yeah so I wanna
picture<00:00:43.809> the<00:00:43.929> inside<00:00:44.320> of<00:00:44.500> your<00:00:44.590> brain<00:00:44.769> now<00:00:45.070> if

picture the inside of your brain now if

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.189 
picture the inside of your brain now if
you've<00:00:45.309> got<00:00:45.339> a<00:00:45.429> few<00:00:45.640> tests<00:00:46.059> for<00:00:46.239> me<00:00:46.420> indeed<00:00:47.079> I

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
you've got a few tests for me indeed I

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.650 
you've got a few tests for me indeed I
do<00:00:47.260> I'm<00:00:47.920> not<00:00:48.070> gonna<00:00:48.190> get<00:00:48.339> sued<00:00:48.609> I'll<00:00:49.089> pinch<00:00:49.480> you

first<00:00:49.899> of<00:00:50.050> all<00:00:50.170> oh<00:00:51.210> way<00:00:52.210> that<00:00:52.449> hurt<00:00:52.719> so<00:00:52.749> much<00:00:54.660> so

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
first of all oh way that hurt so much so

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.590 
first of all oh way that hurt so much so
this<00:00:55.749> is<00:00:56.019> Paul's<00:00:56.379> parietal<00:00:57.370> lobe<00:00:57.850> speaking

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
this is Paul's parietal lobe speaking

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.840 
this is Paul's parietal lobe speaking
now<00:00:58.749> that<00:00:59.199> was<00:00:59.350> James<00:01:00.659> is<00:01:01.659> inside<00:01:02.050> you<00:01:02.199> here<00:01:02.850> so

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
now that was James is inside you here so

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.520 
now that was James is inside you here so
that's<00:01:03.999> a<00:01:04.089> bit<00:01:04.239> that<00:01:04.390> gives<00:01:04.660> sensation<00:01:05.320> so

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
that's a bit that gives sensation so

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.110 
that's a bit that gives sensation so
when<00:01:05.710> we<00:01:05.800> touch<00:01:06.070> something<00:01:06.100> or<00:01:06.640> we<00:01:06.790> feel

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
when we touch something or we feel

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.000 
when we touch something or we feel
something<00:01:07.510> so<00:01:08.140> in<00:01:08.260> that<00:01:08.350> particular<00:01:08.560> case<00:01:08.860> a

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
something so in that particular case a

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.490 
something so in that particular case a
bit<00:01:09.220> of<00:01:09.310> pain<00:01:09.580> or<00:01:09.940> if<00:01:10.060> it's<00:01:10.210> temperature<00:01:10.840> but<00:01:11.140> a

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
bit of pain or if it's temperature but a

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.440 
bit of pain or if it's temperature but a
hand<00:01:11.770> on<00:01:11.890> a<00:01:11.920> hot<00:01:11.980> plate<00:01:12.250> or<00:01:12.370> something<00:01:12.850> and<00:01:13.390> you

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
hand on a hot plate or something and you

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.850 
hand on a hot plate or something and you
put<00:01:13.480> it<00:01:13.720> away<00:01:13.810> very<00:01:14.110> quickly<00:01:14.320> it's<00:01:14.620> all<00:01:14.680> that

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
put it away very quickly it's all that

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.400 
put it away very quickly it's all that
sensation<00:01:15.520> where's<00:01:15.910> mine<00:01:16.390> it's<00:01:16.900> about<00:01:17.050> here

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
sensation where's mine it's about here

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.950 
sensation where's mine it's about here
the<00:01:17.740> parietal<00:01:18.040> means<00:01:18.370> walls<00:01:18.640> so<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.540> sides<00:01:19.780> of

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
the parietal means walls so the sides of

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.730 
the parietal means walls so the sides of
our<00:01:20.080> heads<00:01:20.110> here<00:01:20.590> okay<00:01:21.220> now<00:01:21.460> what's<00:01:21.670> this<00:01:22.740> not

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
our heads here okay now what's this not

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.140 
our heads here okay now what's this not
quiet<00:01:24.070> but<00:01:24.190> you<00:01:24.280> could<00:01:24.430> walk<00:01:24.580> along<00:01:24.850> will<00:01:25.030> do

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
quiet but you could walk along will do

quiet but you could walk along will do
any<00:01:25.300> or<00:01:25.450> Bassett<00:01:28.530> okay<00:01:29.560> so<00:01:30.070> I<00:01:30.100> taught<00:01:30.280> me

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
any or Bassett okay so I taught me

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.100 
any or Bassett okay so I taught me
pseudo<00:01:30.730> to<00:01:30.940> just<00:01:31.120> literally<00:01:31.510> walk<00:01:31.690> along<00:01:31.960> it

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
pseudo to just literally walk along it

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.180 
pseudo to just literally walk along it
we're<00:01:32.200> gonna<00:01:32.290> use<00:01:32.440> a<00:01:32.470> different<00:01:32.560> part<00:01:33.010> of<00:01:33.040> your

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
we're gonna use a different part of your

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.540 
we're gonna use a different part of your
brain

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
brain

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.600 
brain
pretty<00:01:34.240> easy<00:01:34.390> far<00:01:35.080> too<00:01:35.440> easy<00:01:35.680> do<00:01:36.040> it<00:01:36.130> again

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
pretty easy far too easy do it again

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.480 
pretty easy far too easy do it again
but<00:01:36.730> it's<00:01:36.850> only<00:01:36.970> a<00:01:37.150> back<00:01:38.100> will<00:01:39.100> tell<00:01:39.340> you<00:01:39.400> the

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
but it's only a back will tell you the

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.100 
but it's only a back will tell you the
other<00:01:39.610> way<00:01:39.790> that's<00:01:40.090> making<00:01:40.330> me<00:01:40.420> Olga<00:01:40.690> Korbut

okay so so this time you're using this
bit<00:01:49.070> of<00:01:49.159> brain<00:01:49.340> down<00:01:49.549> here<00:01:49.850> that<00:01:49.970> looks<00:01:50.150> a<00:01:50.210> bit

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
bit of brain down here that looks a bit

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.630 
bit of brain down here that looks a bit
like<00:01:50.360> a<00:01:50.479> cauliflower<00:01:51.010> it's<00:01:52.010> called<00:01:52.250> the

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.340 
like a cauliflower it's called the
cerebellum<00:01:53.150> which<00:01:53.390> basically<00:01:53.750> means<00:01:54.049> small

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
cerebellum which basically means small

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.539 
cerebellum which basically means small
brains<00:01:54.650> used<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.009> think<00:01:55.130> it<00:01:55.190> was<00:01:55.250> a<00:01:55.310> little

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
brains used to think it was a little

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.399 
brains used to think it was a little
brain<00:01:55.700> sat<00:01:56.360> underneath<00:01:56.690> so<00:01:57.259> it's<00:01:57.380> a

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
brain sat underneath so it's a

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:58.899 
brain sat underneath so it's a
cauliflower<00:01:57.710> but<00:01:58.190> it's<00:01:58.280> making<00:01:58.610> you<00:01:58.700> walk

we're standing here Jonah and I posture
disabled<00:02:05.060> to<00:02:05.149> enable<00:02:05.750> us<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:05.840> do<00:02:06.110> that<00:02:06.259> without

do<00:02:09.140> what<00:02:09.470> does<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.770> brain<00:02:09.920> do<00:02:10.100> when<00:02:10.340> we<00:02:10.459> see

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
do what does the brain do when we see

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.190

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.190 
the limbic system okay Joan have you got
a<00:02:54.280> question<00:02:54.430> yes<00:02:55.209> I<00:02:55.450> used<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.720> have<00:02:55.900> a

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
a question yes I used to have a

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.570 
a question yes I used to have a
photographic<00:02:56.770> memory<00:02:56.890> at<00:02:57.220> least<00:02:57.370> what<00:02:57.520> I

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
photographic memory at least what I

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.770 
photographic memory at least what I
called<00:02:57.820> first<00:02:58.000> graphic<00:02:58.330> memory<00:02:58.540> in<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:58.750> I

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
called first graphic memory in that I

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.690 
called first graphic memory in that I
seem<00:02:59.050> to<00:02:59.170> be<00:02:59.260> able<00:02:59.350> to<00:02:59.470> just<00:02:59.680> read<00:03:00.160> a<00:03:00.220> page<00:03:00.489> of

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
seem to be able to just read a page of

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.010 
seem to be able to just read a page of
something<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.209> it<00:03:01.270> would<00:03:01.390> stick<00:03:01.660> right<00:03:01.840> in

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
something and it would stick right in

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.350 
something and it would stick right in
how<00:03:02.560> does<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:02.890> happen<00:03:03.130> so<00:03:03.730> people<00:03:04.060> think

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
how does that happen so people think

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.729 
how does that happen so people think
that<00:03:04.570> they've<00:03:04.690> got<00:03:04.840> photographic<00:03:05.320> memories

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
that they've got photographic memories

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.170 
that they've got photographic memories
everyone<00:03:06.040> wants<00:03:06.340> one<00:03:06.400> yeah<00:03:06.820> that's<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.150> thing

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
everyone wants one yeah that's the thing

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.840 
everyone wants one yeah that's the thing
there's<00:03:07.750> no<00:03:07.989> scientific<00:03:08.770> basis<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.489> have<00:03:09.640> one

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
there's no scientific basis to have one

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.190 
there's no scientific basis to have one
it's<00:03:10.000> more<00:03:10.239> about<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.750> way<00:03:10.870> we<00:03:11.020> make

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
it's more about the way we make

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.810 
it's more about the way we make
connections<00:03:11.500> so<00:03:12.070> if<00:03:12.130> we've<00:03:12.280> seen<00:03:12.310> something

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
connections so if we've seen something

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.430 
connections so if we've seen something
that<00:03:12.940> makes<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.300> bit<00:03:13.450> quite<00:03:13.630> an<00:03:13.750> impact<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.320> us

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
that makes a bit quite an impact to us

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.260 
that makes a bit quite an impact to us
we<00:03:14.800> can<00:03:14.980> somehow<00:03:15.100> make<00:03:15.520> those<00:03:15.700> connections<00:03:15.880> a

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
we can somehow make those connections a

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.060 
we can somehow make those connections a
chess<00:03:16.510> player<00:03:16.720> can<00:03:17.200> see<00:03:17.380> which<00:03:17.500> pieces<00:03:17.770> are<00:03:17.890> on

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
chess player can see which pieces are on

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.710 
chess player can see which pieces are on
the<00:03:18.220> board<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.610> and<00:03:18.850> try<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.270> remember<00:03:19.510> that

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
the board and and try and remember that

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.229 
the board and and try and remember that
but<00:03:20.350> we<00:03:20.440> can't<00:03:20.680> all<00:03:20.890> do<00:03:21.370> that<00:03:21.580> so<00:03:21.730> I<00:03:21.760> understand

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
but we can't all do that so I understand

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.330 
but we can't all do that so I understand

from memory again it's all in that part
of<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.709> limbic<00:03:35.860> system<00:03:36.040> because<00:03:36.430> it's<00:03:36.519> all

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
of the limbic system because it's all

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.250 
of the limbic system because it's all
about<00:03:36.670> memories<00:03:37.209> and<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.780> creating
