00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
can continue the pattern or I can get

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.790 
can continue the pattern or I can get
out<00:01:52.759> of<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:55.660> now<00:01:56.660> a<00:01:56.690> cool<00:01:57.170> way<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.380> get<00:01:57.619> out<00:01:57.770> of
