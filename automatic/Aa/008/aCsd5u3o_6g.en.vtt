I'm guessing something should be like

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.130 
I'm guessing something should be like
sparking<00:02:31.820> in<00:02:31.910> your<00:02:32.060> minds<00:02:32.390> right<00:02:32.660> now<00:02:32.720> that

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
sparking in your minds right now that

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.650 
sparking in your minds right now that
