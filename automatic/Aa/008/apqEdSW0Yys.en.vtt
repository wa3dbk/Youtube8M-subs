different I think you charge anything
off<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.829> it's<00:02:05.159> whatever<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.729> now<00:02:06.390> I've<00:02:06.540> got

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
off it so it's whatever and now I've got

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.020 
off it so it's whatever and now I've got
a<00:02:06.719> six<00:02:07.020> not<00:02:07.290> five<00:02:07.320> anyway<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.039> does<00:02:08.160> matter<00:02:08.310> so

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
a six not five anyway it does matter so

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.940 
a six not five anyway it does matter so
all<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.509> do<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.810> kind<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.080> find<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.440> plug<00:02:10.679> so

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
all you do is kind of find a plug so

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.589 
all you do is kind of find a plug so
like<00:02:11.129> on<00:02:11.280> your<00:02:11.400> normal<00:02:11.640> iphone<00:02:11.760> charger<00:02:12.390> and

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
like on your normal iphone charger and

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.680 
like on your normal iphone charger and
then

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
then

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.420 
then
you<00:02:13.720> just<00:02:13.960> plug<00:02:14.200> this<00:02:14.440> little<00:02:14.740> cable<00:02:14.920> in<00:02:15.220> and

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.760 
you just plug this little cable in and
then<00:02:15.850> this<00:02:16.120> basically<00:02:16.720> goes<00:02:16.990> into<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.380> actual

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
then this basically goes into the actual

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.920 
then this basically goes into the actual
thing<00:02:17.980> itself<00:02:18.010> this<00:02:18.700> way<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.210> then<00:02:19.660> you<00:02:19.750> just

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
thing itself this way and then you just

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.360 
thing itself this way and then you just
charge<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.320> up<00:02:20.410> sort<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.740> over<00:02:21.220> night<00:02:21.340> or
