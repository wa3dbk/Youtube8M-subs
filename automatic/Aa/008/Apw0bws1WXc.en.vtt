six inch tail on this blade answer it

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.450 
six inch tail on this blade answer it
would<00:01:00.600> overpower<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.410> metal<00:01:01.710> part<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.250> it

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
would overpower the metal part and it

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.490 
would overpower the metal part and it
wouldn't<00:01:02.699> swim<00:01:02.940> properly<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.199> a

wouldn't swim properly this is a

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.250 
wouldn't swim properly this is a
five-inch<00:01:05.100> jerk<00:01:05.430> shad<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.510> other<00:01:06.750> setup

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
five-inch jerk shad on this other setup

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.380 
five-inch jerk shad on this other setup
which<00:01:07.409> has<00:01:07.560> been<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:08.189> hot<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:08.850> big<00:01:09.030> fish

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
which has been really hot for big fish

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.690 
which has been really hot for big fish
and<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.380> see<00:01:10.619> look<00:01:11.010> at<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.159> tooth<00:01:11.369> marks

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
and you can see look at the tooth marks

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.179 
and you can see look at the tooth marks
I<00:01:11.880> mean<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.689> thing<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.770> looks<00:01:14.010> like

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
I mean this thing is just it looks like

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.469 
I mean this thing is just it looks like
it's<00:01:14.369> gone<00:01:14.580> through<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.909> war<00:01:15.650> essentially<00:01:17.479> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
it's gone through a war essentially the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.429 
it's gone through a war essentially the
tail<00:01:18.720> itself<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.830> very<00:01:20.670> simple<00:01:21.240> but<00:01:22.080> when<00:01:22.290> you

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
tail itself is very simple but when you

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.770 
tail itself is very simple but when you
put<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> water<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.820> tail<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.450> this

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
put this in the water the tail and this

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.399 
put this in the water the tail and this
whole<00:01:25.080> thing<00:01:25.409> comes<00:01:25.680> alive<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> real<00:01:26.580> fish

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
whole thing comes alive like a real fish

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.399 
whole thing comes alive like a real fish
essentially<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:29.369> rigged<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.759> with<00:01:30.000> a

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
essentially you rigged this with a

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.620 
essentially you rigged this with a
12-inch<00:01:31.409> leader<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.299> here<00:01:33.299> we've<00:01:33.420> got<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
12-inch leader and here we've got the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.020 
12-inch leader and here we've got the
three<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.990> saw<00:01:34.400> blade<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.430> answer<00:01:35.850> with<00:01:36.000> a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
three a saw blade to answer with a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.719 
three a saw blade to answer with a
five-inch<00:01:36.740> tail<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.100> end<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.310> it

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
five-inch tail on the end of it

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.050 
five-inch tail on the end of it
the<00:01:39.570> most<00:01:39.780> popular<00:01:40.320> way<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.770> we<00:01:40.920> found<00:01:41.189> to

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
the most popular way that we found to

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.770 
the most popular way that we found to
use<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.649> use<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> cast<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.780> a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
use this is just to use a cast and a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.569 
use this is just to use a cast and a
straight<00:01:46.049> retrieve<00:01:46.619> now<00:01:46.890> there's<00:01:47.100> other<00:01:47.340> ways

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
straight retrieve now there's other ways

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.490 
straight retrieve now there's other ways
to<00:01:47.880> do<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:48.360> with<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> straight<00:01:48.990> retrieve

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
to do it but with a straight retrieve

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.789 
to do it but with a straight retrieve
you<00:01:50.009> literally<00:01:50.520> will<00:01:51.149> feel<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:52.229> dancer

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
you literally will feel the dancer

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.440 
you literally will feel the dancer
working<00:01:53.399> back<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.759> forth<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.149> it'll<00:01:54.360> go

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
working back and forth and it'll go
