00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.160
 In the end, so we keep going 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.170
 los angeles is yes you are vice master 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.079
 many German champions have become 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.630
 any doors open until now 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.400
 not yet 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.660
 we're waiting for a sample that's why 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.650
 actually that's my question 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.230
 that was 0 exactly then 1 jannik 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.890
 Hi hello people like the German 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.840
 Master but you are waiting for me to wait 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.700
 of course, but I'm now 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.320
 not so long on the me 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.970
 so have been thinking for three years 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.250
 but I do drive to five years 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.040
 I have now got a problem 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.560
 is not there after the year goes to the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.760
 farid in my opinion after the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.810
 most blatant or one of the most blatant 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.210
 German driver of course not 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.710
 but here are a few too 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.080
 congratulate very very well there said 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.650
 the red bull pott comes out of you 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.710
 incredible skating 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.440
 how was the resonance good? 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.890
 So I do not think so much now 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.290
 seen 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.759
 I heard I was told 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.170
 was very good in any case was right 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.000
 bayerischer forest again put 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.680
 how sad you were to be second 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.360
 So you were really winning 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.479
 have the contest the service cup and 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.250
 you will first recognize who actually 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.580
 unfair if I had won 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.170
 So yes, double score and alex know 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.270
 if she deserves a fortune then they are 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.130
 play but alex earned 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.170
 then we start doing this 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.220
 year and then you will 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.220
 probably german master or 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.490
 Masters would be German this year 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.120
 master 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.610
 yes, one says christoph racky believes 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.020
 no christoph okay we have it 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.400
 arrested here on video christoph 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.120
 German champion which 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.250
 Placement what you all clear we have 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.350
 the effort now if that is not true 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.370
 There is definitely this here 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.020
 then in the end everything clear 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.370
 Thanks for the interviews and we 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.370
