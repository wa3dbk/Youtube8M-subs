00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.260
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.380
 agriculture practice tip today we are on 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.730
 a strike with waiting greening 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.650
 as soon as the conditions will fit here 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.660
 mulchsaat method grown 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.019
 but before that is still the mood 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.850
 this time on our topic 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:38.489
 Phosphorus is often called and funny kind 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.069
 applied kali mostly before doing 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.149
 also for the slurry application is now 

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:44.850
 the best time 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.139
 What is this time I brought came 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.659
 A little hard to estimate 

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:51.149
 late frosts and humid conditions in the 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.219
 april can continue beyond time 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.690
 to move it back 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.609
 the surfaces could just as well 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.239
 but also faster in good weather 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:59.670
 to warm 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.760
 because they would be under the snow 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.470
 usually not frozen very deep 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.659
 The good news is that despite the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.820
 late not vegetation beginning 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.070
 Playful is most stalls can 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.060
 even at late amba dates still 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.280
 develop very well 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.869
 The Chamber of Agriculture of Styria has 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.530
 also time trials 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.869
 carried out 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.909
 they showed that the earnings as well 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.100
 at late cultivation until the end of april constant 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.929
 stay high 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.609
 In any case, it usually reacts very much 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.640
 sensitive to a lack of supply 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:31.530
 of main and trace nutrients one 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.770
 the plants have high demands 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.240
 all of phosphorus potassium and magnesium 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.890
 It is specially in youth development 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.549
 usually needs a good phosphor 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.039
 care 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.350
 that's why phosphorus is the reason 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.810
 often as under foot fertilization during sowing 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.759
 is applied depending on the soil 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.189
 Supply and earnings level is one 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.460
 Dilution from 40 to 80 kilograms 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.869
 to recommend phosphate projects 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.490
 Above all else, potassium and magnesium need 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.859
 then be available if the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.439
 maize plant strongly increases in mass 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:03.740
 potassium requires a total of 25 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.389
 kilograms per hectare per ton of income 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.700
 with the grain corn however remain of 

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:11.250
 20 kilograms of potash with the straw on the 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.280
 field later they are available again 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.819
 that means the net withdrawal is approx 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.849
 5 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.310
 per hectare and ton yield would be included 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.099
 twelve tons yield 60 kilograms per 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.930
 hectare of deprivation of magnesium lies 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.659
 at about six kilograms per hectare per 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.409
 Tons yield the pure grain deprivation at 2 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.900
 kilogram 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:33.450
 that's what we're going to do with grain corn 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.819
 twelve tons dry yield at 24 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.530
 kilogram withdrawal per hectare many 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.569
 companies supply their fields 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.730
 Potassium and magnesium in the form of a 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.739
 swing fertilization in these cases becomes 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.169
 usually once per fruitful cycle 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.689
 fertilized and in the amount of withdrawal 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:50.489
 the entire crop 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:52.829
 that has the advantage that the single 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.209
 nutrient things that come into question 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.569
 are usually cheaper than 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.250
 You can also use multipurpose fertilizers 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.680
 year-related price jumps 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.989
 fertilizer to avoid something when you 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.079
 the mood for less expensive years 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.989
 misplaced the withdrawal values ​​of ours 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:13.019
 they find common cultures 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:15.090
 www.land is spot comes basha katz on 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.030
 cheapest you bring kali and 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.269
 magnesium in the form of potassium chloride 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:25.019
 Calli still in front of the master from Korntal 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:27.409
 ii contains 40 potassium oxide 6 magnesium 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.269
 oxide and 4 percent sulfur 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.250
 alternatively, they can also 60 kali with 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.680
 60% potassium share 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.590
 however, it does not contain magnesium 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.389
 still sulfur as far as the most important 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.280
 Basic fertilization I wish you good 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.889
 conditions of the basic fertilizer and the 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.239
 sowing but until then we see and hear 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.310
 us still if it at one of the 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.780
 next agriculture practice tips around the 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.780
 corn cultivation is gone
