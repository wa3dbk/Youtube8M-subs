grass here real quick you're going
really<00:00:38.340> fast<00:00:38.640> by<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.000> way<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.360> know<00:00:39.420> right

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
really fast by the way I know right

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.700 
really fast by the way I know right
mainly<00:00:40.770> because<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.129> sped<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.460> video<00:00:41.700> up<00:00:41.910> what

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
mainly because I sped the video up what

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.619 
mainly because I sped the video up what
just<00:00:43.710> sayin<00:00:43.950> okay<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:45.000> there's<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.270> theory<00:00:45.600> here

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
just sayin okay so there's a theory here

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.430 
just sayin okay so there's a theory here
so<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:45.989> cut<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> grass<00:00:46.620> right<00:00:47.450> and<00:00:48.450> then<00:00:49.289> you

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
so you cut the grass right and then you

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.229 
so you cut the grass right and then you
saved<00:00:49.940> yes<00:00:50.940> okay<00:00:51.829> because<00:00:52.829> there<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:54.090> very

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
saved yes okay because there it's very

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.720 
saved yes okay because there it's very
key<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:54.960> say<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.469> saved<00:00:55.860> right<00:00:56.430> and

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
key that we say that you saved right and

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.670 
key that we say that you saved right and
then<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.570> hit<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.719> tractor<00:00:57.960> too<00:00:58.260> yeah<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.500> think

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
then I hit a tractor too yeah I think

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.709 
then I hit a tractor too yeah I think

all<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.970> oh<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.420> think<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.780> cut<00:01:06.990> six<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.560> could

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
all this in oh I think I cut six I could

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.080 
all this in oh I think I cut six I could
have<00:01:07.950> gone<00:01:08.130> back<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.520> trimmed<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.820> down<00:01:08.850> later

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
have gone back and trimmed it down later
