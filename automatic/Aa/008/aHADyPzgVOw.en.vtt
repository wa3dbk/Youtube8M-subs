00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
hair is cornrowed but it's not so this

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.030 
hair is cornrowed but it's not so this
is<00:02:43.600> perfect<00:02:43.990> if<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.200> don't<00:02:44.380> know<00:02:44.770> how<00:02:44.980> to

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
is perfect if you don't know how to

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.980 
is perfect if you don't know how to
cornrow<00:02:45.340> if<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:45.940> can't<00:02:46.180> corn<00:02:46.420> while<00:02:46.570> going<00:02:46.750> up

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
cornrow if you can't corn while going up

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:53.570 
cornrow if you can't corn while going up
this<00:02:47.800> is<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:48.220> perfect<00:02:48.490> alternative

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.910

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.620 
move it is very very loosely wrapped and
this<00:02:59.100> is<00:02:59.250> how<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.490> want<00:02:59.790> it<00:02:59.910> if<00:03:00.090> not<00:03:00.330> it's
