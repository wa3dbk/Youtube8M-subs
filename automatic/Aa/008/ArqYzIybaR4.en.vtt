00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
this whole setup now I have a redstone

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.540 
this whole setup now I have a redstone
energy<00:00:58.890> a<00:01:00.320> redstone<00:01:01.320> energy<00:01:01.649> redstone<00:01:02.190> engine

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
energy a redstone energy redstone engine

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.119 
energy a redstone energy redstone engine
that<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.449> uses<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.870> wooden<00:01:04.379> transport<00:01:04.949> pipe

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
that it uses a wooden transport pipe

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.700 
that it uses a wooden transport pipe
what<00:01:05.489> wooden<00:01:05.760> transport<00:01:06.210> pipes<00:01:06.420> do<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.930> they

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
what wooden transport pipes do is they

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.770 
what wooden transport pipes do is they
extract<00:01:08.280> things<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:08.820> if<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.030> put<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> wooden

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
extract things so if you put a wooden

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.020 
extract things so if you put a wooden
transport<00:01:10.260> pipe<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.799> power<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.880> will

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
transport pipe with power to it will

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.039 
transport pipe with power to it will
pull<00:01:12.360> things<00:01:12.810> out<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.229> chests<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.720> start<00:01:15.720> to

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
pull things out of chests and start to

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.600 
pull things out of chests and start to
move<00:01:16.259> them<00:01:16.530> then<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.100> your<00:01:17.130> two<00:01:17.400> most

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
move them then you have your two most

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.429 
move them then you have your two most
basic<00:01:18.590> do<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:20.030> your<00:01:21.030> two<00:01:21.210> most<00:01:21.420> basic<00:01:22.110> types

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
basic do this your two most basic types

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.530 
basic do this your two most basic types
of<00:01:22.619> pipes<00:01:22.860> are<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.159> cobblestone<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.210> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
of pipes are the cobblestone and the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.020 
of pipes are the cobblestone and the
stone<00:01:25.080> transport<00:01:25.770> pipe<00:01:25.979> now<00:01:26.549> as<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.880> can<00:01:26.970> see

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
stone transport pipe now as you can see

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.330 
stone transport pipe now as you can see
basic<00:01:27.509> pipe<00:01:27.720> medium<00:01:28.110> drag<00:01:28.470> won't<00:01:28.920> connect

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
basic pipe medium drag won't connect

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.730 
basic pipe medium drag won't connect
which<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> best<00:01:30.540> part<00:01:30.930> about<00:01:31.079> them<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
which is the best part about them and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.840 
which is the best part about them and
what<00:01:32.040> makes<00:01:32.250> them<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.700> handy<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.740> as<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.640> one

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
what makes them so handy so as this one

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.490 
what makes them so handy so as this one
here<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.210> cobblestone<00:01:36.659> pipe<00:01:37.020> if<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.259> put<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
here is a cobblestone pipe if I put a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.499 
here is a cobblestone pipe if I put a
trance<00:01:37.770> don't<00:01:38.100> transport<00:01:38.460> pipe<00:01:38.759> doesn't

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
trance don't transport pipe doesn't

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.960 
trance don't transport pipe doesn't
connect<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.960> goes<00:01:40.110> all<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.470> its<00:01:40.619> own<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.790> that

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
connect it goes all on its own so that

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.060 
connect it goes all on its own so that
is<00:01:42.210> what<00:01:42.570> makes<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.899> really<00:01:43.140> nice<00:01:43.290> now<00:01:43.740> if

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
is what makes that really nice now if

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.130 
is what makes that really nice now if
you're<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.369> tighter<00:01:44.610> space<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.869> can<00:01:45.960> have

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
you're in a tighter space you can have

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.109 
you're in a tighter space you can have
pipes<00:01:46.380> going<00:01:46.590> up<00:01:46.799> side<00:01:47.040> by<00:01:47.070> side<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.880> another

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
pipes going up side by side to another

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.749 
pipes going up side by side to another
chest<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.990> don't<00:01:49.619> have<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.799> setup<00:01:50.100> because<00:01:50.310> I

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
chest I don't have that setup because I

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.940 
chest I don't have that setup because I
built<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.780> house<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.680> big<00:01:52.829> enough

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
built this house just a big enough

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.350 
built this house just a big enough
square<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.549> be<00:01:53.670> able<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.970> few<00:01:54.149> chests

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
square to be able to have a few chests

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.420 
square to be able to have a few chests
to<00:01:54.479> sort<00:01:54.890> so<00:01:55.890> first<00:01:56.130> thing<00:01:56.250> you'll<00:01:56.340> notice

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
to sort so first thing you'll notice

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.219 
to sort so first thing you'll notice
then<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.119> got<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.360> gold<00:01:57.600> transport<00:01:58.079> pipe

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
then is that I got a gold transport pipe

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.690 
then is that I got a gold transport pipe
and<00:01:58.380> what<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.649> does<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.860> speeds<00:01:59.310> up<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
and what that does is speeds up the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.760 
and what that does is speeds up the
process<00:01:59.729> of<00:02:00.270> things<00:02:00.630> moving<00:02:00.990> though<00:02:01.110> I'll<00:02:01.560> go

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
process of things moving though I'll go

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.289 
process of things moving though I'll go
outside<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.159> i'll<00:02:02.250> show<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:03.060> real

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
outside and i'll show you the real

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.920 
outside and i'll show you the real
differences<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:04.020> make<00:02:05.180> real<00:02:06.180> quick<00:02:06.540> here

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
differences can make real quick here

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.270 
differences can make real quick here
let's<00:02:08.750> diamond<00:02:09.750> transport<00:02:10.259> pipe<00:02:11.239> or

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
let's diamond transport pipe or

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.470 
let's diamond transport pipe or
so<00:02:14.060> here<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:15.770> quarry<00:02:16.459> it's<00:02:17.120> just<00:02:17.270> powered

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
so here is the quarry it's just powered

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.130 
so here is the quarry it's just powered
by<00:02:17.569> steam<00:02:17.780> dynamo<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:20.120> have<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.630> so<00:02:20.870> it's

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
by steam dynamo and I have it so it's

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.800 
by steam dynamo and I have it so it's
set<00:02:21.319> up<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.440> sort<00:02:21.860> coal<00:02:22.670> out<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.480> go<00:02:23.600> to<00:02:23.660> the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
set up to sort coal out to go to the

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.410 
set up to sort coal out to go to the
steam<00:02:24.020> dynamo<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.590> keep<00:02:24.770> this<00:02:24.920> full<00:02:25.330> you'd<00:02:26.330> be

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
steam dynamo to keep this full you'd be

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.670 
steam dynamo to keep this full you'd be
surprised<00:02:26.690> how<00:02:26.750> much<00:02:26.900> coal<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.290> sing<00:02:27.470> actually

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
surprised how much coal to sing actually

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.040 
surprised how much coal to sing actually
finds<00:02:28.250> oops<00:02:28.940> that's<00:02:29.510> not<00:02:29.630> what<00:02:29.750> I<00:02:29.780> wanted<00:02:29.989> to

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
finds oops that's not what I wanted to

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.850 
finds oops that's not what I wanted to
do<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:30.709> this<00:02:31.520> is<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:32.239> diamond<00:02:33.080> transport<00:02:33.680> pipe

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
do so this is the diamond transport pipe

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.699 
do so this is the diamond transport pipe
what<00:02:34.430> it<00:02:34.520> does<00:02:34.700> is<00:02:34.880> it<00:02:34.910> sorts<00:02:35.300> things<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:36.500> what

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
what it does is it sorts things so what

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.820 
what it does is it sorts things so what
I<00:02:36.739> have<00:02:37.040> done<00:02:37.190> here<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.900> I've<00:02:38.900> put<00:02:39.140> coal<00:02:39.410> to

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
I have done here is I've put coal to

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.130 
I have done here is I've put coal to
come<00:02:40.010> out<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.310> green<00:02:40.580> connector<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:41.930> read

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
come out the green connector it is read

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.010 
come out the green connector it is read
out<00:02:42.350> is<00:02:42.620> blue<00:02:42.860> out<00:02:43.160> is<00:02:43.340> green<00:02:43.610> now<00:02:44.480> as<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:44.750> saw

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
out is blue out is green now as you saw

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.870 
out is blue out is green now as you saw
if<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:45.230> can<00:02:45.410> act<00:02:45.530> other<00:02:45.650> pipes<00:02:46.100> they'll<00:02:46.400> go<00:02:46.640> that

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
if I can act other pipes they'll go that

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.280 
if I can act other pipes they'll go that
way<00:02:47.030> as<00:02:47.150> well<00:02:47.180> but<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.570> don't<00:02:47.780> want<00:02:48.019> that<00:02:48.080> to

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
way as well but I don't want that to

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.380 
way as well but I don't want that to
happen<00:02:48.320> I<00:02:48.650> just<00:02:48.680> want<00:02:48.950> things<00:02:49.070> to<00:02:49.220> go<00:02:49.310> out<00:02:50.000> this

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
happen I just want things to go out this

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:58.030 
happen I just want things to go out this
way<00:02:50.660> so<00:02:53.230> if<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:54.590> throw<00:02:55.489> a<00:02:56.170> diamond<00:02:57.170> white<00:02:57.739> or

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
way so if I throw a diamond white or

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.580 
way so if I throw a diamond white or
gold<00:02:58.610> pipe<00:02:58.880> there<00:02:59.180> another<00:03:00.110> gold<00:03:00.380> pipe<00:03:00.590> there

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
gold pipe there another gold pipe there

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.920 
gold pipe there another gold pipe there
and<00:03:03.590> now<00:03:04.100> look<00:03:04.310> at<00:03:04.430> how<00:03:04.640> quickly<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.480> items

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
and now look at how quickly the items

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.290 
and now look at how quickly the items
are<00:03:06.110> moving<00:03:06.530> their<00:03:07.340> come<00:03:07.610> think<00:03:07.880> I'm<00:03:08.060> just

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
are moving their come think I'm just

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.020 
are moving their come think I'm just
rocketing<00:03:09.170> out<00:03:09.290> of<00:03:09.440> there<00:03:09.590> I'll<00:03:10.489> put<00:03:10.760> a<00:03:10.790> third

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
rocketing out of there I'll put a third

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.820 
rocketing out of there I'll put a third
one<00:03:11.180> inside<00:03:11.600> it<00:03:11.690> gives<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:11.959> speed<00:03:12.290> all<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.500> way

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
one inside it gives it speed all the way

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.270 
one inside it gives it speed all the way
to<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.130> house<00:03:14.769> comes<00:03:15.769> all<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.010> way<00:03:16.370> back<00:03:16.610> now

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
to the house comes all the way back now

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.949 
to the house comes all the way back now
put<00:03:19.280> another<00:03:19.519> one<00:03:19.850> now<00:03:20.269> the<00:03:20.329> best<00:03:20.570> thing<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.840> do

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
put another one now the best thing to do

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:21.970 
put another one now the best thing to do
with<00:03:21.079> this<00:03:21.200> too<00:03:21.440> when<00:03:21.530> you<00:03:21.650> got<00:03:21.769> a<00:03:21.799> big

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
with this too when you got a big

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.970 
with this too when you got a big
distance<00:03:22.190> that<00:03:22.430> your<00:03:22.549> core<00:03:22.730> is<00:03:22.760> going<00:03:22.880> is<00:03:23.269> to

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
distance that your core is going is to

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.509 
distance that your core is going is to
check<00:03:24.980> out<00:03:25.250> um<00:03:26.650> how<00:03:27.650> fast<00:03:27.980> things<00:03:28.190> are<00:03:28.280> coming

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
check out um how fast things are coming

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.060 
check out um how fast things are coming
and<00:03:28.820> uh<00:03:28.850> just<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:29.840> shorter<00:03:30.200> distance<00:03:30.350> away<00:03:30.739> and

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
and uh just a shorter distance away and

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.020 
and uh just a shorter distance away and
i<00:03:31.700> find<00:03:32.060> that<00:03:32.209> every<00:03:32.510> eight<00:03:32.810> to<00:03:33.170> ten<00:03:33.680> or<00:03:34.030> maybe

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
i find that every eight to ten or maybe

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.150 
i find that every eight to ten or maybe
even<00:03:35.120> 15<00:03:35.660> blocks<00:03:35.900> it's<00:03:36.530> probably<00:03:36.799> the<00:03:36.890> best

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
even 15 blocks it's probably the best

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.509 
even 15 blocks it's probably the best
place<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.850> put<00:03:38.299> one<00:03:38.920> now<00:03:39.920> that's<00:03:40.100> well<00:03:40.489> that's

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
place to put one now that's well that's

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.370 
place to put one now that's well that's
going<00:03:40.820> to<00:03:40.880> be<00:03:40.940> a<00:03:41.540> ton<00:03:41.690> of<00:03:41.750> speed<00:03:42.049> to<00:03:42.230> get

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
going to be a ton of speed to get

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.740 
going to be a ton of speed to get
things<00:03:42.650> go<00:03:42.859> and<00:03:43.040> see<00:03:43.220> one<00:03:44.209> speed<00:03:44.510> them<00:03:44.630> up<00:03:44.660> a

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
things go and see one speed them up a

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.410 
things go and see one speed them up a
little<00:03:44.780> bit<00:03:45.019> too<00:03:45.470> gold<00:03:45.829> pipes<00:03:46.400> makes<00:03:46.850> a<00:03:46.940> huge

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
little bit too gold pipes makes a huge

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.319 
little bit too gold pipes makes a huge
difference<00:03:48.640> alright<00:03:49.640> so<00:03:49.790> let's<00:03:50.030> go<00:03:50.150> back<00:03:50.299> down

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
difference alright so let's go back down

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.030 
difference alright so let's go back down
in<00:03:50.690> here<00:03:50.900> now<00:03:50.989> that<00:03:51.140> you've<00:03:51.230> seen<00:03:51.470> that<00:03:51.709> and

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
in here now that you've seen that and

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.569 
in here now that you've seen that and
things<00:03:52.970> will<00:03:53.120> keep<00:03:53.239> coming<00:03:53.390> in<00:03:53.630> here<00:03:54.579> I've

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
things will keep coming in here I've

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.390 
things will keep coming in here I've
used<00:03:55.880> gold<00:03:56.600> pipes<00:03:56.870> here<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.769> speed<00:03:58.130> up<00:03:58.280> the

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
used gold pipes here to speed up the

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.310 
used gold pipes here to speed up the
sorting<00:03:58.760> process<00:03:58.790> let<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.510> dirt<00:03:59.720> go<00:03:59.930> shooting

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
sorting process let the dirt go shooting

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.319 
sorting process let the dirt go shooting
in<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:00.890> goes<00:04:01.370> right<00:04:01.549> up<00:04:01.670> into<00:04:01.760> this<00:04:01.970> chest

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
in and goes right up into this chest

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.000 
in and goes right up into this chest
fills<00:04:02.600> it<00:04:02.750> up<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:03.049> stopped<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.590> cobblestone

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
fills it up I stopped the cobblestone

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.080 
fills it up I stopped the cobblestone
from<00:04:04.160> coming<00:04:04.400> in<00:04:04.519> because<00:04:04.670> otherwise<00:04:04.910> you<00:04:05.060> end

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
from coming in because otherwise you end

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.610 
from coming in because otherwise you end
up<00:04:05.239> with<00:04:05.299> an<00:04:05.450> insane<00:04:05.840> amount<00:04:06.019> of<00:04:06.170> cobblestone

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
up with an insane amount of cobblestone

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.610 
up with an insane amount of cobblestone
what<00:04:09.620> I've<00:04:09.739> done<00:04:09.890> here<00:04:09.950> is<00:04:10.510> I<00:04:11.510> have<00:04:11.540> too<00:04:12.500> many

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
what I've done here is I have too many

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.710 
what I've done here is I have too many
types<00:04:13.310> of<00:04:13.459> words<00:04:13.730> to<00:04:13.910> sort<00:04:14.209> sorted<00:04:14.570> it<00:04:14.630> was

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
types of words to sort sorted it was

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.390 
types of words to sort sorted it was
just<00:04:14.870> pulled<00:04:15.049> into<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.260> pipe<00:04:15.440> off<00:04:15.680> put<00:04:16.160> it<00:04:16.190> on

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
just pulled into the pipe off put it on

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.630 
just pulled into the pipe off put it on
here<00:04:16.789> and<00:04:16.940> how<00:04:17.359> it<00:04:17.510> so<00:04:17.660> it<00:04:17.720> goes<00:04:17.870> up<00:04:18.079> into<00:04:18.640> this

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
here and how it so it goes up into this

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.789 
here and how it so it goes up into this
chest<00:04:20.090> well<00:04:20.780> these<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.260> Turks<00:04:21.470> snuck<00:04:21.650> in

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
chest well these the Turks snuck in

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:22.990 
chest well these the Turks snuck in
there<00:04:21.890> before<00:04:22.010> had<00:04:22.310> things<00:04:22.490> officially

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
there before had things officially

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.630 
there before had things officially
sorted<00:04:23.330> now<00:04:23.950> what<00:04:24.950> you'll<00:04:25.130> notice<00:04:25.340> is<00:04:25.580> that

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
sorted now what you'll notice is that

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.100 
sorted now what you'll notice is that
there<00:04:25.880> are<00:04:25.909> different<00:04:26.330> pipes<00:04:26.539> here<00:04:26.840> and

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
there are different pipes here and

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.800 
there are different pipes here and
here<00:04:27.289> now<00:04:27.620> those<00:04:27.889> are<00:04:28.250> iron<00:04:28.759> pipes<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:29.599> what

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
here now those are iron pipes and what

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.350 
here now those are iron pipes and what
an<00:04:29.930> iron<00:04:30.080> pipe<00:04:30.349> does<00:04:30.680> is<00:04:30.979> it<00:04:31.219> controls<00:04:32.060> the

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
an iron pipe does is it controls the

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.779 
an iron pipe does is it controls the
direction<00:04:32.840> of<00:04:33.110> them<00:04:33.319> it<00:04:33.439> routes<00:04:33.680> them<00:04:33.979> so<00:04:34.490> by

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
direction of them it routes them so by

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:36.580 
direction of them it routes them so by
having<00:04:35.419> a<00:04:35.659> wrench<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:35.960> right-clicking<00:04:36.379> on<00:04:36.500> I

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
having a wrench and right-clicking on I

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
having a wrench and right-clicking on I
change<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:36.949> direction<00:04:37.419> so<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:40.400> open<00:04:40.789> end<00:04:41.060> of

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
change the direction so the open end of

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.990 
change the direction so the open end of
the<00:04:43.610> pipe<00:04:44.330> is<00:04:44.569> the<00:04:45.500> direction<00:04:45.710> it<00:04:45.979> will<00:04:46.069> go<00:04:46.280> so

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
the pipe is the direction it will go so

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.179 
the pipe is the direction it will go so
things<00:04:47.360> come<00:04:47.539> in<00:04:47.659> here<00:04:47.840> sort<00:04:48.169> and<00:04:48.349> go<00:04:48.469> up<00:04:48.680> come

00:04:49.179 --> 00:04:49.189 
things come in here sort and go up come

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:50.529 
things come in here sort and go up come
out<00:04:49.310> here<00:04:49.639> sort<00:04:49.969> and<00:04:50.090> go<00:04:50.180> up<00:04:50.389> because

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
out here sort and go up because

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.029 
out here sort and go up because
otherwise<00:04:50.870> they<00:04:51.169> have<00:04:51.289> an<00:04:51.379> option<00:04:51.530> to<00:04:51.680> go<00:04:51.830> down

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
otherwise they have an option to go down

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.640 
otherwise they have an option to go down
or<00:04:52.280> up<00:04:52.310> and<00:04:52.819> it<00:04:53.599> alternates<00:04:54.080> every<00:04:54.409> other<00:04:54.439> time

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
or up and it alternates every other time

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.469 
or up and it alternates every other time
and<00:04:55.219> so<00:04:55.520> you<00:04:55.610> want<00:04:55.759> everything<00:04:55.849> to<00:04:56.120> always<00:04:56.300> go

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
and so you want everything to always go

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.869 
and so you want everything to always go
up<00:04:56.509> obviously<00:04:57.319> and<00:04:57.500> now<00:04:58.009> I've<00:04:58.219> done<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.669> same

00:04:58.869 --> 00:04:58.879 
up obviously and now I've done the same

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:04.990 
up obviously and now I've done the same
thing<00:04:58.939> here<00:04:59.599> with<00:04:59.810> actual<00:05:00.319> ingots<00:05:01.840> now<00:05:04.000> so

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
thing here with actual ingots now so

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.760 
thing here with actual ingots now so
those<00:05:05.150> are<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.300> basic<00:05:05.599> pipes<00:05:05.810> so<00:05:06.409> yeah<00:05:06.590> so

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
those are the basic pipes so yeah so

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.559 
those are the basic pipes so yeah so
that's<00:05:07.129> that<00:05:07.340> covers<00:05:07.610> the<00:05:07.729> diamond<00:05:08.060> pipe<00:05:08.240> the

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569 
that's that covers the diamond pipe the

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:11.260 
that's that covers the diamond pipe the
stone<00:05:08.840> pipe<00:05:09.169> the<00:05:09.439> cobblestone<00:05:10.009> pipe<00:05:10.279> the<00:05:10.969> gold

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
stone pipe the cobblestone pipe the gold

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.490 
stone pipe the cobblestone pipe the gold
pipe<00:05:11.689> the<00:05:12.469> iron<00:05:12.800> pipe<00:05:13.250> and<00:05:13.520> you<00:05:14.449> wouldn't<00:05:14.779> also

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
pipe the iron pipe and you wouldn't also

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.869 
pipe the iron pipe and you wouldn't also
wouldn't<00:05:15.740> won't<00:05:15.919> even<00:05:16.099> connect<00:05:16.400> to<00:05:16.490> itself<00:05:16.789> so

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:16.879 
wouldn't won't even connect to itself so

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:18.640 
wouldn't won't even connect to itself so
that<00:05:16.969> you<00:05:17.270> just<00:05:17.479> put<00:05:17.629> one<00:05:17.840> wooden<00:05:18.169> one<00:05:18.319> next<00:05:18.560> to

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
that you just put one wooden one next to

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.649 
that you just put one wooden one next to
a<00:05:18.680> chest<00:05:18.949> and<00:05:19.159> you're<00:05:19.460> done<00:05:19.580> that<00:05:20.360> stuff<00:05:20.569> was

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
a chest and you're done that stuff was

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:21.909 
a chest and you're done that stuff was
all<00:05:20.840> in<00:05:20.930> here<00:05:21.080> before<00:05:21.199> I<00:05:21.379> had<00:05:21.500> a<00:05:21.529> chance<00:05:21.590> to<00:05:21.860> get

is it or is it it sucks up items so what

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:05.050 
is it or is it it sucks up items so what
you're<00:06:00.500> gonna<00:06:00.620> do<00:06:00.889> is<00:06:01.189> just<00:06:01.849> go<00:06:02.120> like<00:06:04.060> right

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
you're gonna do is just go like right

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:18.630 
you're gonna do is just go like right
here<00:06:05.300> let's<00:06:05.479> go<00:06:05.900> like<00:06:07.240> this

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:25.690 

and<00:06:19.640> as<00:06:20.210> I<00:06:20.270> swip<00:06:20.450> them<00:06:20.600> all<00:06:20.720> out<00:06:24.370> open<00:06:25.370> up<00:06:25.400> put

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
and as I swip them all out open up put

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:34.420 
and as I swip them all out open up put
them<00:06:25.850> close<00:06:26.060> enough<00:06:29.500> damn<00:06:30.500> it<00:06:33.220> there's<00:06:34.220> a<00:06:34.310> way

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
them close enough damn it there's a way

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:43.240 
them close enough damn it there's a way
to<00:06:34.460> upgrade<00:06:35.030> it<00:06:36.100> there<00:06:41.410> now<00:06:42.410> you<00:06:42.470> can<00:06:42.800> see<00:06:43.070> that

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250 
to upgrade it there now you can see that

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.540 
to upgrade it there now you can see that
it's<00:06:43.400> sucking<00:06:44.360> them<00:06:44.630> up<00:06:45.160> that<00:06:46.160> works<00:06:46.340> better

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
it's sucking them up that works better

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.420 
it's sucking them up that works better
so<00:06:47.480> I<00:06:47.510> never<00:06:47.960> really<00:06:48.260> use<00:06:48.470> obsidian<00:06:48.980> pipes<00:06:49.220> I

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
so I never really use obsidian pipes I

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.190 
so I never really use obsidian pipes I
never<00:06:49.940> really<00:06:50.240> had<00:06:50.390> a<00:06:50.419> use<00:06:50.630> for<00:06:50.810> them<00:06:50.930> although

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:51.200 
never really had a use for them although

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.050 
never really had a use for them although
I<00:06:51.860> could<00:06:52.070> think<00:06:52.220> about<00:06:52.370> a<00:06:52.520> use<00:06:52.700> for<00:06:52.940> them

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.060 
I could think about a use for them

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.670 
I could think about a use for them
before<00:06:53.240> I<00:06:53.690> actually<00:06:53.930> have<00:06:54.230> a<00:06:54.260> quarry

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 
before I actually have a quarry

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.040 
before I actually have a quarry
especially<00:06:55.640> map<00:06:56.390> like<00:06:56.570> this<00:06:56.600> I'll<00:06:56.840> to<00:06:56.930> show

especially map like this I'll to show
you<00:06:57.110> really<00:06:57.560> quick<00:06:58.780> when<00:06:59.780> you<00:07:00.140> start<00:07:00.919> out<00:07:01.070> and

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:12.850 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.930 

this<00:07:13.850> warren<00:07:14.510> there<00:07:14.870> was<00:07:14.990> a<00:07:15.020> big<00:07:15.290> hole<00:07:15.650> I<00:07:16.010> spin

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:16.940 
this warren there was a big hole I spin

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:17.950 
this warren there was a big hole I spin
on<00:07:17.000> the<00:07:17.060> other<00:07:17.150> side<00:07:17.330> of<00:07:17.360> helps<00:07:17.600> oh<00:07:17.750> well

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 
on the other side of helps oh well

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.710 
on the other side of helps oh well
anyway<00:07:18.740> so<00:07:18.890> it<00:07:19.490> would<00:07:19.610> be<00:07:19.729> handy<00:07:20.090> before<00:07:20.630> you

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 
anyway so it would be handy before you

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.210 
anyway so it would be handy before you
have<00:07:20.840> a<00:07:20.870> quarry<00:07:21.229> and<00:07:21.470> while<00:07:21.650> you're<00:07:21.830> down<00:07:21.979> on

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:22.220 
have a quarry and while you're down on

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.800 
have a quarry and while you're down on
the<00:07:22.310> ground<00:07:22.490> having<00:07:22.940> pipes<00:07:23.150> coming<00:07:23.360> up<00:07:23.600> to<00:07:23.720> you

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:23.810 
the ground having pipes coming up to you

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.040 
the ground having pipes coming up to you
but<00:07:24.590> again<00:07:24.830> not<00:07:25.550> really<00:07:25.790> necessary<00:07:26.240> so<00:07:26.840> I<00:07:26.900> hope

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.050 
but again not really necessary so I hope

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.620 
but again not really necessary so I hope
