00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.049
 Christoph has one again 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.049
 interesting book found 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.040
 and since it was super interesting like 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.500
 you can win in the desert water 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.420
 a pit in sand plastic wrap over it 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.170
 A stone in the middle of the water too 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.240
 Collect and put down a glass in the field 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.410
 great idea that we christoph times 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:29.859
 Try and where in the desert 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:33.190
 of course, find water in the desert 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:36.340
 that would be really fantastic the sun 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:43.590
 it seems hot as it is in the 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:51.129
 Desert has to be almost everything 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:52.990
 In his backpack a shovel for the 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.560
 pit 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:59.950
 I greet the plastic wrap your glass 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:05.880
 stones are there well then it can 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:07.810
 start digging digging shovels 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.550
 but there are already the first 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.380
 difficulty not so easy 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.680
 to dig a hole in the loose sand 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.030
 KÃ¶sel always everything to maybe 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:26.040
 look elsewhere where the land 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:26.040
 a little lester is here is better 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:35.130
 well, the glass in the pit 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:38.670
 put over the transparent 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.290
 plastic sheer windy good 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.400
 mooring with the stones at the corner 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.400
 The joke does not blow away the wind 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.990
 seal a bit with sand 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.160
 and at the end still the stone in the 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.820
 center 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:04.960
 Susanne's your turn, it may have to 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.960
 wait until something does 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.250
 if what does inschallah says in 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.870
 the desert 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.549
 if allah as want after three hours 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:25.689
 Christoph now finds enough to wait 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.689
 after that, though , is glass of water 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:34.400
 So nothing 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:37.719
 not a single drop so that 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.719
 the next one seems to work though 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.000
 in the evening as clouds come on 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.820
 a thunderstorm 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.740
 that it is quite rare in the desert and 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.110
 then it rains as if someone showered 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.190
 hired in such quantities that 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.570
 I form small streams right away 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.450
 after half a day christoph 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:06.950
 of course in wonderful and he feels 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.970
 as if drinking water under the shower 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.970
 Of course you will get it too 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.180
 the next morning the sand is still from 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.930
 Christoph can easily rain a lot 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.510
 run better 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.200
 he does not want to give up and he tries 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.200
 once again 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.630
 since that is a good place there could be 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:48.070
 you try it 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:48.070
 backpack on run out what's up 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.140
 with the wet sand is the same 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.540
 The group is much better 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.540
 finish drilling the glass in the sand 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:06.480
 the thick film about it now where the 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.530
 is sand wet he can be quite well 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.060
 to complain 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.060
 the film will not look away 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:20.340
 Everything now announces the stone in 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:24.690
 the middle the sun shines again 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.370
 strong on christophs folie and there 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.040
 small ones are formed at once 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.230
 the water droplets when more and 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.240
 getting fatter and they unite 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.490
 thick drops along the film 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.680
 flow to the lowest point namely 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.510
 there or stone lies there dripping then 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.370
 into the glass after three hours blowing 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.290
 Christoph the sand from the film down 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.500
 Now he wants to know if water is in the glass 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.180
 is and how much more 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.570
 little knock so but the last 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.500
 drops still falling into the grass 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.900
 But now we are looking forward to it 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.199
 christoph 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.199
 n / A 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.460
 actually the water in it and even 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.460
 not so little 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.490
 tried christoph 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.740
 yes it tastes a pity but 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.980
 Water as better than no water in 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.980
 the desert 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.100
 so it's true what in the book you stood 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.230
 can win water in the desert though 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.630
 only when the sand is wet enough must 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.810
 previously rained for example and that 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.220
 is in the desert yes number very rare 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.390
 well 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.590
 if you really care about this 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.920
 Should leave through the 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.480
 desert i wander christoph 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.150
 had better trick against the doors in 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.430
 the desert take plenty of water 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:54.650
 that deletes the thirst and there you were 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.650
 Also what is there is great christoph
