00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
booth at NAB 2013 we're sitting here

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.530 
booth at NAB 2013 we're sitting here
with<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.130> Blackmagic<00:00:14.670> Cinema<00:00:14.700> Camera<00:00:15.089> at<00:00:15.330> 4k

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
with the Blackmagic Cinema Camera at 4k

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.939 
with the Blackmagic Cinema Camera at 4k
actually<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.440> Blackmagic<00:00:16.859> production

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
actually the Blackmagic production

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.519 
actually the Blackmagic production
camera<00:00:17.460> 4k<00:00:18.270> we<00:00:18.869> called<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.199> production

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
camera 4k we called it the production

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.689 
camera 4k we called it the production
camera<00:00:19.740> because<00:00:19.980> actually<00:00:20.220> we<00:00:20.310> can<00:00:20.460> use<00:00:20.580> it

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
camera because actually we can use it

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.000 
camera because actually we can use it
for<00:00:20.730> live<00:00:21.150> with<00:00:21.510> our<00:00:21.660> new<00:00:21.869> 8m<00:00:22.500> productions

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
for live with our new 8m productions

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.580 
for live with our new 8m productions
which<00:00:23.160> are<00:00:23.310> 4k<00:00:23.550> we've<00:00:24.480> got<00:00:24.660> new<00:00:24.810> 60<00:00:25.230> SDI

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
which are 4k we've got new 60 SDI

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.490 
which are 4k we've got new 60 SDI
technology<00:00:26.340> which<00:00:26.609> allows<00:00:26.730> us<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.180> do<00:00:27.330> 4k<00:00:28.109> over

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
technology which allows us to do 4k over

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.500 
technology which allows us to do 4k over
a<00:00:28.529> or<00:00:28.800> extra<00:00:29.189> day<00:00:29.340> Ultra<00:00:29.609> HD<00:00:29.699> over<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> single

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
a or extra day Ultra HD over a single

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.630 
a or extra day Ultra HD over a single
SDI<00:00:30.900> cable<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.769> can<00:00:31.920> actually<00:00:32.160> be<00:00:32.250> used<00:00:32.430> as

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
SDI cable so it can actually be used as

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.310 
SDI cable so it can actually be used as
a<00:00:32.669> live<00:00:32.910> production<00:00:33.210> camera<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.140> course

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
a live production camera but of course

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.959 
a live production camera but of course
it's<00:00:34.469> still<00:00:34.680> got<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.190> same<00:00:35.430> heart<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.880> a

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
it's still got the same heart of a

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.459 
it's still got the same heart of a
cinema<00:00:36.270> camera<00:00:36.600> like<00:00:36.750> our<00:00:36.899> Blackmagic<00:00:37.440> Cinema

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
cinema camera like our Blackmagic Cinema

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.680 
cinema camera like our Blackmagic Cinema
Camera<00:00:37.910> obviously<00:00:38.910> what<00:00:39.180> we've<00:00:39.300> added<00:00:39.510> here

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
Camera obviously what we've added here

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.260 
Camera obviously what we've added here
is<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> new<00:00:40.860> sensor<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.579> 35-millimeter

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
is a new sensor it's a 35-millimeter

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.529 
is a new sensor it's a 35-millimeter
sensor<00:00:42.930> capable<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.680> recording<00:00:43.920> at<00:00:44.160> 4k<00:00:44.539> still

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
sensor capable of recording at 4k still

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.959 
sensor capable of recording at 4k still
an<00:00:45.660> EF<00:00:45.989> based<00:00:46.379> mount<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.370> form<00:00:47.579> factor<00:00:47.940> of

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
an EF based mount and the form factor of

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.970 
an EF based mount and the form factor of
the<00:00:48.090> camera<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.480> actually<00:00:48.870> still<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> same<00:00:49.469> so

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the camera is actually still the same so

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.040 
the camera is actually still the same so
we<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.219> still<00:00:50.489> use<00:00:50.520> all<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.910> same<00:00:51.120> mounts

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
we can still use all the same mounts

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.740 
we can still use all the same mounts
cages<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.309> peripherals<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.570> with

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
cages and peripherals that you have with

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.290 
cages and peripherals that you have with
the<00:00:54.840> current<00:00:55.110> Blackmagic<00:00:55.829> Cinema<00:00:55.860> Camera<00:00:56.300> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
the current Blackmagic Cinema Camera the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.729 
the current Blackmagic Cinema Camera the
couple<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.600> things<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:58.079> changed<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.710> it

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
couple of things that have changed on it

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.880 
couple of things that have changed on it
internally<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.609> it<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> 12<00:01:00.899> stop<00:01:01.320> camera<00:01:01.739> as

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
internally is it is a 12 stop camera as

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.830 
internally is it is a 12 stop camera as
opposed<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.309> 13<00:01:02.699> stop<00:01:02.969> camera<00:01:03.420> doesn't

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
opposed to a 13 stop camera doesn't

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.210 
opposed to a 13 stop camera doesn't
sound<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.199> lot<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:04.439> every<00:01:04.559> stop<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.979> twice

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
sound like a lot but every stop is twice

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.609 
sound like a lot but every stop is twice
as<00:01:05.250> much<00:01:05.519> color<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.720> 12<00:01:06.960> stop<00:01:07.229> camera

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
as much color so it is a 12 stop camera

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.210 
as much color so it is a 12 stop camera
it<00:01:07.710> does<00:01:07.890> give<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:09.140> global<00:01:10.140> shutter<00:01:10.619> so

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
it does give you the global shutter so

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.130 
it does give you the global shutter so
we<00:01:11.580> did<00:01:11.790> get<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.390> there<00:01:12.570> with<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.780> 35

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
we did get that in there with the 35

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.300 
we did get that in there with the 35
millimeter<00:01:13.350> camera<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:13.950> if<00:01:14.010> you're<00:01:14.100> looking

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
millimeter camera so if you're looking

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.270 
millimeter camera so if you're looking
for<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.460> big<00:01:14.670> forte<00:01:15.439> wide-angle<00:01:16.439> shot<00:01:16.710> this

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
for a big forte wide-angle shot this

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.200 
for a big forte wide-angle shot this
camera<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.640> great<00:01:17.759> for<00:01:18.060> that

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
camera is great for that

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.770 
camera is great for that
it<00:01:18.540> does<00:01:18.750> record<00:01:19.110> as<00:01:19.259> ProRes<00:01:19.920> for<00:01:20.850> K<00:01:21.090> or<00:01:21.360> as<00:01:21.630> a

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
it does record as ProRes for K or as a

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.320 
it does record as ProRes for K or as a
visually<00:01:22.530> lossless<00:01:23.100> cinema<00:01:23.549> DNG<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.299> a

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
visually lossless cinema DNG so it is a

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.109 
visually lossless cinema DNG so it is a
compressed<00:01:24.930> cinema<00:01:25.439> DNG<00:01:25.979> file<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.970> there

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
compressed cinema DNG file in there

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.390 
compressed cinema DNG file in there
otherwise<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.290> looks<00:01:28.320> much<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.860> same<00:01:29.130> as<00:01:29.310> our

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
otherwise it looks much the same as our

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.340 
otherwise it looks much the same as our
current<00:01:29.520> Blackmagic<00:01:30.119> Cinema<00:01:30.150> Camera<00:01:30.570> and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
current Blackmagic Cinema Camera and

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.399 
current Blackmagic Cinema Camera and
they<00:01:31.619> should<00:01:31.829> be<00:01:31.950> shipping<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.640> july<00:01:33.030> and

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
they should be shipping in july and

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.319 
they should be shipping in july and
we're<00:01:34.409> really<00:01:34.560> excited<00:01:34.710> about<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:36.150> might

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
we're really excited about this we might

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.020 
we're really excited about this we might
be<00:01:36.420> able<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.600> do<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> 60<00:01:37.200> p<00:01:37.350> at<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> core

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
be able to do a 60 p at the core

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.030 
be able to do a 60 p at the core
yeah<00:01:38.690> we<00:01:38.870> keep<00:01:39.050> looking<00:01:39.380> at<00:01:39.530> trying<00:01:39.800> to<00:01:39.920> get

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
yeah we keep looking at trying to get

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.650 
yeah we keep looking at trying to get
more<00:01:40.190> frame<00:01:40.520> rates<00:01:40.730> in<00:01:40.940> there<00:01:41.090> problem<00:01:41.450> is<00:01:41.540> we

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
more frame rates in there problem is we

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.150 
more frame rates in there problem is we
have<00:01:41.750> two<00:01:41.960> problems<00:01:42.140> we<00:01:42.320> have<00:01:42.410> heat<00:01:42.680> which

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
have two problems we have heat which

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.620 
have two problems we have heat which
becomes<00:01:43.430> a<00:01:43.490> real<00:01:43.640> big<00:01:43.850> problem<00:01:43.970> and<00:01:44.390> then<00:01:44.540> the

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
becomes a real big problem and then the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.420 
becomes a real big problem and then the
quality<00:01:45.110> starts<00:01:45.440> really<00:01:45.680> going<00:01:45.920> down<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:46.310> we

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
quality starts really going down so we

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.070 
quality starts really going down so we
haven't<00:01:46.700> been<00:01:46.820> able<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:47.060> get<00:01:47.150> beyond<00:01:47.420> 30<00:01:47.720> P<00:01:47.930> on

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
haven't been able to get beyond 30 P on

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.260 
haven't been able to get beyond 30 P on
any<00:01:48.350> of<00:01:48.530> our<00:01:48.680> cameras<00:01:49.040> yet<00:01:49.250> so<00:01:49.490> with<00:01:50.000> something

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
any of our cameras yet so with something

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.670 
any of our cameras yet so with something
we<00:01:50.330> like<00:01:50.479> to<00:01:50.540> do<00:01:50.780> we<00:01:50.930> don't<00:01:51.020> love<00:01:51.140> to<00:01:51.380> see<00:01:51.560> it

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
we like to do we don't love to see it

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.800 
we like to do we don't love to see it
but<00:01:51.920> you<00:01:52.190> know<00:01:52.430> it<00:01:52.729> would<00:01:53.120> end<00:01:53.300> up<00:01:53.390> becoming<00:01:53.660> a

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
but you know it would end up becoming a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.080 
but you know it would end up becoming a
much<00:01:54.110> more<00:01:54.140> expensive<00:01:54.740> camera<00:01:55.670> not<00:01:56.060> a

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
much more expensive camera not a

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.590 
much more expensive camera not a
firmware<00:01:56.390> upgradeable<00:01:57.050> things<00:01:57.320> ya<00:02:00.850> know<00:02:01.850> it's

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
firmware upgradeable things ya know it's

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.510 
firmware upgradeable things ya know it's
basically<00:02:03.050> functionally<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.800> same<00:02:03.830> as<00:02:04.280> the

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
basically functionally the same as the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.609 
basically functionally the same as the
so<00:02:04.850> same<00:02:05.030> quarter-inch<00:02:05.540> extra<00:02:05.990> audio<00:02:06.110> same

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
so same quarter-inch extra audio same

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.949 
so same quarter-inch extra audio same
non-removable<00:02:07.160> battery<00:02:07.369> so<00:02:08.060> any<00:02:08.539> of<00:02:08.810> the

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
non-removable battery so any of the

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.120 
non-removable battery so any of the
things<00:02:09.110> that<00:02:09.320> people<00:02:09.380> were<00:02:09.619> doing<00:02:09.800> with

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
things that people were doing with

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.280 
things that people were doing with
external<00:02:10.910> monitors<00:02:11.360> or<00:02:11.720> anton<00:02:12.110> bauer

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
external monitors or anton bauer

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.020 
external monitors or anton bauer
batteries<00:02:12.800> all<00:02:13.220> going<00:02:13.459> to<00:02:13.550> be<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.700> same<00:02:13.880> on

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
batteries all going to be the same on

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.270 
batteries all going to be the same on
the<00:02:14.120> 4k<00:02:14.450> camera<00:02:17.830> yeah<00:02:18.830> we're<00:02:19.010> certainly

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
the 4k camera yeah we're certainly

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.160 
the 4k camera yeah we're certainly
hoping<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:19.940> obviously<00:02:20.450> we<00:02:20.660> learned<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:21.020> lot

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
hoping so obviously we learned a lot

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.890 
hoping so obviously we learned a lot
from<00:02:21.440> last<00:02:21.620> time<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.280> sensors<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:23.450> quality

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
from last time the sensors the quality

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.210 
from last time the sensors the quality
assurance<00:02:24.320> that<00:02:24.470> we<00:02:24.590> need<00:02:24.739> to<00:02:24.800> have<00:02:24.980> in<00:02:25.190> place

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
assurance that we need to have in place

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.820 
assurance that we need to have in place
with<00:02:25.670> our<00:02:25.820> vendor<00:02:26.270> that<00:02:26.300> supplies<00:02:26.630> so<00:02:27.470> you

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
with our vendor that supplies so you

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.680 
with our vendor that supplies so you
know<00:02:27.920> we<00:02:28.070> feel<00:02:28.250> like<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:29.030> camera<00:02:29.390> itself

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
know we feel like the camera itself

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.330 
know we feel like the camera itself
obviously<00:02:29.900> most<00:02:30.770> of<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.100> same<00:02:31.310> components

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
obviously most of the same components

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.610 
obviously most of the same components
are<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.209> same<00:02:32.239> as<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:33.080> currently<00:02:33.440> shipping

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
are the same as the currently shipping

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.830 
are the same as the currently shipping
which<00:02:34.220> aren't<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.520> problem<00:02:34.820> for<00:02:34.970> us<00:02:35.030> really<00:02:35.450> the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
which aren't a problem for us really the

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.180 
which aren't a problem for us really the
sensor<00:02:36.200> change<00:02:36.440> is<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.709> only<00:02:36.860> really<00:02:37.040> big

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
sensor change is the only really big

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.770 
sensor change is the only really big
thing<00:02:37.370> so<00:02:37.610> you<00:02:38.090> know<00:02:38.120> we<00:02:38.300> feel<00:02:38.450> good<00:02:38.690> about

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
thing so you know we feel good about

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.690 
thing so you know we feel good about
July<00:02:39.200> obviously<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.739> meteor<00:02:40.100> can<00:02:40.310> strike<00:02:40.580> the

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
July obviously a meteor can strike the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.280 
July obviously a meteor can strike the
factory<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.300> things<00:02:41.720> could<00:02:41.930> go<00:02:42.019> out<00:02:42.140> the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
factory and things could go out the

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.780 
factory and things could go out the
window<00:02:42.380> but<00:02:42.830> you<00:02:43.010> know<00:02:43.160> we're<00:02:43.489> going<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.700> do

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
window but you know we're going to do

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.380 
window but you know we're going to do
our<00:02:43.910> best<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.180> try<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.390> get<00:02:44.510> these<00:02:44.660> out<00:02:44.840> in<00:02:44.989> July

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390
