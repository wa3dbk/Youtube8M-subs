00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 there are good guys and girls welcome to 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.470
 my channel your ps4 overheats 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.630
 a lot of noise because in this video I'm going to 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.190
 give my opinion of some tips but 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.570
 before I start I have to say hello to 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.849
 some of my subscribers that I what 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.550
 they asked for it we call it ramón santana 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.369
 Agustín Ávila Luis Mario Dale Scott and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.500
 his cousin josé erick is 13 and david 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.990
 moral greetings are you now 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.519
 we started with the video the problem that 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.470
 has ps4 with the theme of 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.689
 overheating and the issue of you doing 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.210
 noise the theme of the fan is that as 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.430
 you see if we compare it with the xbox one the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.190
 ps4 is smaller and is more compact 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.050
 worth the xbox one is bigger than it happens 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.750
 that has a much bigger fan 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.600
 that the dps 4 that makes it more 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.730
 silent that the ps4 then also 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.579
 tell you that the xbox one has the theme of 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.280
 the separate feed the console thing 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.770
 that the ps4 has it integrated that makes 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.320
 that the ps4 overheats much more 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.809
 that the xbox one the theme of for example 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.500
 what happens that on the ps4 when we are 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.620
 when a demanding game 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.200
 like disasters or the batman arkham nine 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.660
 what happens that are demanding games worth 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.500
 that's what is going to make the ps4 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.320
 hot 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.680
 before then what happens that the ps4 to 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.670
 heat is worth overheating 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.950
 then that makes the fans 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.410
 go strong, because the issue of 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.510
 fan of the ps4 good and all 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.310
 the consoles and all the devices 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.070
 electronic is that they have several 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.710
 levels the hotter this device 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.170
 electronic the fan is uploaded from 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.080
 level was already much more noise and that's what 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.210
 what happens to the ps4 then what 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.119
 we can do so that it does not get hot 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.860
 so fast the ps4 is to imagine that 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.540
 the xbox one is the furniture of the 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.600
 TV where you have the ps4 on 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.810
 so then a piece of advice that I give you 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.020
 is that you buy some vinyls and the 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.969
 put on each corner 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.700
 for 4 rubber and in each corner 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.399
 then that will make the ps4 is not 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.009
 attached to the property or will be elevated 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.590
 a few centimeters and that will make it run 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.080
 the air and it does not heat up so fast the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.019
 ps4 that's good advice I give you 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.200
 It is also valid if you do not have the ps4 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.599
 even if you are thinking of buying an os 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.510
 I advise you to wait for the month of 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:27.060
 September is worth the model that 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.410
 will come out the ps 4 8200 in that model is going 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.360
 fix the noise issue of 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.110
 fan is worth or will be made much less 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.200
 noise 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.079
 then the ps4 weighs two kilos less and 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.709
 then apart it will also spend less light and 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.090
 that will be noticed in the receipt of kids 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.680
 good and this up here the video 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.900
 If you liked it, please give it to him 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.910
 I share and subscribe for more come 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.910
