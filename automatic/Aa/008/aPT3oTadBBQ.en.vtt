00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.110
 hello meet today for a 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.400
 new street 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.840
 to be today it's going to be a recipe 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.920
 really very very simple you will me 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.959
 to say that I often make recipes 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.129
 simple but sometimes the simplest 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.750
 are the best and then it's mostly 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.430
 that I think it's good to have a 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.020
 range of a lot of small recipes 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.640
 easy to do with 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.590
 ingredients are always there at home 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.099
 and history to vary a little bit 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.140
 pleasure 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.219
 so there I do not shop my 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.899
 fridge is empty that's why it's 

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:31.130
 a simple recipe next week 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.119
 I'll have something I'll try to 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.790
 offer you something a little 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.410
 at most elaborate in the sense that I 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.870
 use ingredients that I use 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.100
 not necessarily ingredients 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.810
 a little bit more specific 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.790
 I have a lot of recipes that you have me 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.440
 sent recipes that I found 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.970
 myself things that I have already tested 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.340
 so I have to do my job 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.450
 selection that I think well and that 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.000
 I'm trying to offer you something 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.480
 nice so here we are going to do 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.560
 a vegan bolognese sauce 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.750
 revisited my way 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.220
 so I've already cut every 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.489
 ingredients must see together what one has 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.530
 need then you will need to 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.259
 onions or shallot as you 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.409
 want with garlic so I put 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.040
 a nice onion and then a big one 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.070
 cloves of garlic 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.780
 so everything is finely chopped then 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.360
 you will need peeled tomatoes so 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.950
 I have them I boiled them 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.170
 with a small cross on the top for 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.360
 able to peel them easily so 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.380
 here I have them a little bit crushed with 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.900
 thyme on it and here you have tofu 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.810
 that I diced quite a bit 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.000
 you see for this to be actually the 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.220
 minced meat found in the 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.380
 usual Bolognese so I decided 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.390
 to do it a little bit to Creole 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.290
 so that's why I'm going to add 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.200
 turmeric in and I'm going to add 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.280
 also a little fight will you if 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.440
 you do not have what we are going to see what 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.120
 I suggest you according to what I 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.250
 suggest to do it is to put milk 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.080
 coconut instead you go to me 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.480
 to say it has nothing to do but it's just 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.630
 that it adds a different purpose and that 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.430
 I love it frankly the mixture of 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.630
 turmeric with super composition milk 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.890
 good so we will do it 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.270
 finally I'm going to do it with 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.580
 fight goes since I have it at hand 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.770
 but really invites you to try with 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.880
 coconut milk and if you do not have any 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.610
 you are two shots because 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.990
 it's just as good so it's gone I 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.280
 I get bored the light heat but a 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.250
 little bit of oil to heat in a 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.640
 pan he could take a rock and 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.670
 you will grill your club 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.220
 voodoo tofu in it camps 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.540
 it is well gilded you put back in your 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.230
 plate and then I find myself 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.230
 afterwards for the rest 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.250
 So here it is, I'm done 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:47.710
 extinguish the frozen fire put everything in the 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.710
 week like that jumps on the camera 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.030
 so here I could not do them too much 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.570
 too golden because my question is 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.680
 not terrible but then you see 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.280
 you will give a little oil 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.720
 olive equivalent day coffee stone and 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.530
 half about I would say or a 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.239
 teaspoon 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:13.640
 you will take onions and garlic and 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:17.240
 you will leave you scorched and you go 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.870
 wait for it to become well his suicide 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.220
 for but well and it has to be 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.280
 very translucent you will be able 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.090
 add your tomatoes with thyme and I 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.890
 find you at this moment so here 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.900
 now I have a golden color 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.380
 was called well to be able to created the 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.900
 tomatoes 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.100
 we will not try to break the juice 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.060
 because I did not take the best 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.060
 plate to do that 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:50.370
 we pour the complexion with you but so much 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:51.860
 we say it's the same taste and 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.910
 teil 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.350
 it's also not time 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.840
 I like it's really bread 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.340
 because it comes from here so you 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.420
 mix well and there you can go 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.060
 add turmeric 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.920
 I already put the sky to see the 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.850
 dosage you do as we wanted so 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.350
 I 'll put a little bit of 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.310
 turmeric so I'm going to put about 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.370
 this amount 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.430
 you see to cauterets memic on the coffee 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.669
 shave up do not be afraid to put some 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.910
 we must not fight because otherwise we 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.620
 will have a taste too pronounced so there 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.820
 you mix well and that's when 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.260
 where you will be able to add your 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.730
 coconut milk you can put some by 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.290
 example one or two tablespoons 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.380
 and I will go get my fight 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.370
 and I want to be in and then since 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.370
 last night it's almost done 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.300
 my milk cow 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.050
 yes that's the fight goes frozen 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.610
 since in fact I did it is that 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.260
 as I went to the meeting at my house 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.330
 parents I have family we could 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.560
 recover full of fight so I go this 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.820
 that I did what I took away all 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.680
 the east of all fights 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.810
 I put them in the blender so he 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.280
 either chop finely and then I put 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.350
 that in a box in the freezer and that 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.370
 can be kept alive at home 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.160
 I okay because we knew all of the 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.340
 life because given the pace with which 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.650
 I eat it must leave you a little 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.720
 little evaporate he plays tomato and 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.910
 once you like it you 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.270
 can add to tofu so to the whole 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.580
 end 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.200
 otherwise you can simply tone 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.750
 show it all separately 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.430
 ie to make your pasta is well 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.410
 can even serve it with rice 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.550
 could serve it is with quinoa 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.710
 what else can you do 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.330
 zucchini spaghetti from 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.430
 raw zucchini for example or 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.690
 anything could be used on this 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.190
 that you actually want even on 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.130
 potatoes I did not think but that 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.120
 can also be on potatoes 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.580
 that's what you want you can 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.370
 present your tomato sauce on it with 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.960
 tofu dice on the top and a 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.390
 little bit of parsley for example it can 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.980
 to be a very nice presentation and if 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.600
 you want to mix everything with 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.880
 the sauce you can also me I'm going 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.070
 present on top I think the 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.330
 pieces of torfou like that that makes them 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.880
 different colors of the textures 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.350
 different and it's nice so here 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.970
 I hope you enjoyed this recipe 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.350

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.670

 and then I'm not going to do that 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:23.119
