00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
have building constructors we have

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.500 
have building constructors we have
multimedia<00:00:47.290> designers<00:00:48.100> who<00:00:48.700> are<00:00:48.730> learning<00:00:49.360> a

working<00:00:55.030> quite<00:00:55.270> hard<00:00:55.300> to<00:00:55.870> try<00:00:56.050> and<00:00:56.079> combine

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
working quite hard to try and combine

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.569 
working quite hard to try and combine
their<00:00:57.160> ideas<00:00:57.640> to<00:00:58.540> create<00:00:58.720> a<00:00:59.110> cohesive<00:00:59.710> design

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
their ideas to create a cohesive design

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.469 
their ideas to create a cohesive design
solution<00:01:01.239> so<00:01:01.480> we<00:01:01.630> have<00:01:01.810> six<00:01:02.110> empty<00:01:02.440> sites<00:01:02.800> and

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
solution so we have six empty sites and

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.510 
solution so we have six empty sites and
we<00:01:04.479> have<00:01:04.659> six<00:01:04.960> groups<00:01:05.259> consisting<00:01:05.920> about<00:01:06.219> ten

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
we have six groups consisting about ten

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.510 
we have six groups consisting about ten
students<00:01:07.259> the<00:01:08.259> students<00:01:08.679> look<00:01:08.979> at<00:01:09.100> each<00:01:09.219> site

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
students the students look at each site

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.840 
students the students look at each site
and<00:01:09.850> they<00:01:10.539> try<00:01:10.869> to<00:01:11.219> consider<00:01:12.219> the<00:01:12.399> site<00:01:12.640> in

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
and they try to consider the site in

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.609 
and they try to consider the site in
relation<00:01:13.390> to<00:01:14.039> circulation<00:01:15.210> connectivity<00:01:16.619> and

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
relation to circulation connectivity and

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.940 
relation to circulation connectivity and
also<00:01:18.189> how<00:01:18.700> this<00:01:19.119> site<00:01:19.420> might<00:01:19.719> be<00:01:19.869> working<00:01:20.289> when

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
also how this site might be working when

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.999 
also how this site might be working when
the<00:01:21.240> city<00:01:22.240> ringed<00:01:22.539> the<00:01:22.780> new<00:01:22.929> Metro<00:01:23.380> actually

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
the city ringed the new Metro actually

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.190 
the city ringed the new Metro actually
starts<00:01:24.549> to<00:01:24.700> arrive<00:01:24.999> here<00:01:25.420> in<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.840> north<00:01:26.020> of

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
starts to arrive here in the north of

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.410 
starts to arrive here in the north of
the<00:01:26.289> city<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.619> idea<00:01:27.549> is<00:01:27.759> that<00:01:27.789> the<00:01:28.030> students

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
the city the idea is that the students

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.870 
the city the idea is that the students
will<00:01:28.539> develop<00:01:28.600> a<00:01:29.200> concept<00:01:29.649> that<00:01:30.159> will<00:01:30.579> really

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
will develop a concept that will really

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.539 
will develop a concept that will really
try<00:01:31.149> to<00:01:31.179> take<00:01:31.509> advantage<00:01:31.630> of<00:01:32.259> some<00:01:32.950> of<00:01:33.399> these

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
try to take advantage of some of these

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.300 
try to take advantage of some of these
new<00:01:34.359> opportunities<00:01:34.899> that<00:01:35.740> will<00:01:35.829> come<00:01:36.100> with

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
new opportunities that will come with

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.120 
new opportunities that will come with
this<00:01:36.759> new<00:01:36.969> level<00:01:37.329> of<00:01:37.450> connectivity<00:01:37.929> and<00:01:38.499> then

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
this new level of connectivity and then

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.849 
this new level of connectivity and then
we'll<00:01:39.399> have<00:01:39.670> a<00:01:39.729> judging<00:01:40.600> panel<00:01:40.929> who<00:01:41.499> will<00:01:41.740> be

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:41.859 
we'll have a judging panel who will be

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:43.319 
we'll have a judging panel who will be
able<00:01:41.920> to<00:01:42.130> look<00:01:42.280> at<00:01:42.459> these<00:01:42.579> ideas<00:01:43.060> and

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
able to look at these ideas and

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.239 
able to look at these ideas and
hopefully<00:01:43.779> we'll<00:01:43.990> be<00:01:44.139> able<00:01:44.170> to<00:01:44.439> find<00:01:44.799> one<00:01:45.130> or

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:45.249 
hopefully we'll be able to find one or

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:47.969 
hopefully we'll be able to find one or
two<00:01:45.459> that<00:01:46.060> seem<00:01:46.329> to<00:01:46.479> stick<00:01:46.719> out<00:01:46.899> a<00:01:47.170> bit<00:01:47.259> more

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
two that seem to stick out a bit more

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.410 
two that seem to stick out a bit more
from<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:48.249> crowd<00:01:48.490> than<00:01:48.700> some<00:01:48.969> of<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.149> others

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
from the crowd than some of the others

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.599 
from the crowd than some of the others
and<00:01:49.630> we<00:01:50.619> would<00:01:50.770> like<00:01:50.950> to<00:01:50.979> of<00:01:51.399> course
