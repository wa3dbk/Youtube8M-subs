00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
weird architecture design and you know

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.230 
weird architecture design and you know
and<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:31.860> blue<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.369> glows<00:01:32.579> blue<00:01:32.939> and

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
and it's blue and it glows blue and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.760 
and it's blue and it glows blue and
we've<00:01:33.450> seen<00:01:33.689> different<00:01:34.170> stuff<00:01:34.380> but<00:01:34.560> we<00:01:34.680> have

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
we've seen different stuff but we have

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.100 
we've seen different stuff but we have
also<00:01:34.979> kind<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.430> seen<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.450> meteorite<00:01:36.930> has

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
also kind of seen that the meteorite has

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.990 
also kind of seen that the meteorite has
kind<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.380> been<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.710> central<00:01:38.130> focus<00:01:38.400> point<00:01:38.850> of

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
kind of been a central focus point of

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.760 
kind of been a central focus point of
the<00:01:39.150> zombie<00:01:39.450> universe<00:01:39.869> when<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.470> comes<00:01:40.619> to

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the zombie universe when it comes to

you see it on kino der toten you see it
on<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.549> Reese<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:45.149> see<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.540> lot<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.990> maps

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
on to Reese you see it on a lot of maps

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.039 
on to Reese you see it on a lot of maps
to<00:01:46.649> meteorites<00:01:47.189> even<00:01:47.520> see<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:47.909> origins<00:01:48.479> but

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
to meteorites even see it on origins but

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.510 
to meteorites even see it on origins but
one<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.320> things<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.829> stood<00:01:50.070> struck<00:01:50.369> me

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
one of the things that I stood struck me

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.060 
one of the things that I stood struck me
is<00:01:50.640> well<00:01:51.000> first<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.110> all<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.439> couple<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.040> things

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
is well first of all a couple of things

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.370 
is well first of all a couple of things
why<00:01:53.820> does<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.210> keep<00:01:54.240> changing<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:54.930> then<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
why does it keep changing and then the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.959 
why does it keep changing and then the
second<00:01:55.829> thing<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:55.979> kept<00:01:56.369> me<00:01:56.430> thinking<00:01:56.850> about

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
second thing that kept me thinking about

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.450 
second thing that kept me thinking about
this<00:01:57.240> was<00:01:57.479> why<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.960> hell<00:01:58.530> were<00:01:59.250> these

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
this was why the hell were these

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.510 
this was why the hell were these
meteorites<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.630> earth<00:02:00.950> it's<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.130> second

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
meteorites on the earth it's the second

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.219 
meteorites on the earth it's the second
thing<00:02:02.670> now<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.270> reason<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.689> was<00:02:03.719> questioning

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
thing now the reason I was questioning

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.560 
thing now the reason I was questioning
this<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.860> because<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.939> meteorite<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.450> we

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
this is because the meteorite that we

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.850 
this is because the meteorite that we
saw<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.780> shi<00:02:06.990> no<00:02:07.110> numa<00:02:07.140> from<00:02:07.619> what<00:02:07.770> we

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
saw in shi no numa from what we

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.229 
saw in shi no numa from what we
understand<00:02:08.340> was<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.700> reason<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
understand was the reason that the

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.150 
understand was the reason that the
zombie<00:02:09.569> outbreak<00:02:09.959> started<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.560> chino<00:02:10.890> numa

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
zombie outbreak started in chino numa

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.860 
zombie outbreak started in chino numa
it's<00:02:11.310> where<00:02:11.459> they<00:02:11.550> first<00:02:11.700> discovered<00:02:12.030> one

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
it's where they first discovered one

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.050 
it's where they first discovered one
15<00:02:13.170> or<00:02:13.379> was<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:13.890> when<00:02:14.159> they<00:02:14.280> first<00:02:14.459> saw<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.760> in

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
15 or was it when they first saw it in

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.430 
15 or was it when they first saw it in
origins<00:02:15.659> where<00:02:15.840> they<00:02:15.930> first<00:02:16.080> saw<00:02:16.290> that

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
origins where they first saw that

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.809 
origins where they first saw that
meteorite<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.129> everyone<00:02:17.459> saw<00:02:17.610> getting

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
meteorite and everyone saw getting

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.149 
meteorite and everyone saw getting
infected<00:02:18.239> then<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.230> next<00:02:19.349> question<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.920> well

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
infected then the next question is well

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.949 
infected then the next question is well
if<00:02:20.370> they<00:02:20.849> didn't<00:02:21.390> know<00:02:21.450> about<00:02:21.569> shi<00:02:21.810> no<00:02:21.930> numa

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
if they didn't know about shi no numa

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.130 
if they didn't know about shi no numa
about<00:02:22.709> 115<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.459> she<00:02:23.670> no<00:02:23.790> numa<00:02:24.180> then<00:02:24.450> how<00:02:25.019> come

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
about 115 and she no numa then how come

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.270 
about 115 and she no numa then how come
you<00:02:25.260> didn't<00:02:25.470> know<00:02:25.560> about<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.860> when<00:02:25.980> they<00:02:26.099> saw

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
you didn't know about it when they saw

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.130 
you didn't know about it when they saw
it<00:02:26.370> in<00:02:26.489> origin<00:02:27.000> see<00:02:27.209> it's<00:02:27.420> always<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:27.900> kind

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
it in origin see it's always this kind

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.500 
it in origin see it's always this kind
of<00:02:28.200> weird<00:02:28.500> kind<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.129> sweep<00:02:29.909> it<00:02:30.090> under<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.390> rug

are<00:02:48.299> the<00:02:48.480> reason<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:48.810> we<00:02:49.079> started<00:02:49.349> getting

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
are the reason that we started getting

are the reason that we started getting
all<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:49.709> architecture<00:02:50.459> all<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:51.090> weird

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
all this architecture all this weird

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
everything was based on some kind of

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.319 
everything was based on some kind of
alien<00:02:58.170> design<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.430> we<00:02:59.549> found<00:02:59.849> it<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.180> was

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
alien design and that we found it it was

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:01.970 
alien design and that we found it it was
like<00:03:00.450> some<00:03:00.720> kind<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:00.989> prehistoric<00:03:01.260> thing<00:03:01.769> that

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
like some kind of prehistoric thing that

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.399 
like some kind of prehistoric thing that
humans<00:03:02.370> found<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:02.940> they<00:03:03.659> started<00:03:03.930> basing

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
humans found and they started basing

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.770 
humans found and they started basing
their<00:03:04.530> technology<00:03:05.069> off<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:05.760> it's<00:03:06.599> all

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
their technology off it and it's all

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.500 
their technology off it and it's all
basically<00:03:07.440> came<00:03:08.040> from<00:03:08.280> aliens<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:08.940> it

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
basically came from aliens is it

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.270 
basically came from aliens is it
possible<00:03:10.049> that<00:03:10.079> these<00:03:10.379> meteorites<00:03:10.769> were

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
possible that these meteorites were

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.849 
possible that these meteorites were
maybe<00:03:11.849> a<00:03:12.000> bigger<00:03:12.329> one<00:03:12.569> I<00:03:12.599> was<00:03:12.870> broken<00:03:13.260> apart<00:03:13.349> or

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
maybe a bigger one I was broken apart or

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.319 
maybe a bigger one I was broken apart or
maybe<00:03:14.159> purposely<00:03:14.730> put<00:03:14.970> in<00:03:15.150> different

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
maybe purposely put in different

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.900 
maybe purposely put in different
locations<00:03:15.810> by<00:03:16.200> somebody<00:03:16.739> was<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.190> aliens<00:03:17.669> is

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
locations by somebody was it aliens is

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.909 
locations by somebody was it aliens is
it<00:03:18.480> possible<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:18.930> maybe<00:03:19.169> the<00:03:19.440> crew<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.799> this

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
it possible that maybe the crew and this

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.860 
it possible that maybe the crew and this
is<00:03:20.040> completely<00:03:20.639> out<00:03:20.669> there<00:03:21.060> guys<00:03:21.209> but<00:03:21.540> is<00:03:21.690> it

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
is completely out there guys but is it

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.839 
is completely out there guys but is it
possible<00:03:22.019> that<00:03:22.290> maybe<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.650> crew<00:03:22.859> tried<00:03:23.700> to

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
possible that maybe the crew tried to

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.509 
possible that maybe the crew tried to
prevent<00:03:24.150> 115<00:03:24.750> from<00:03:24.959> getting<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.349> earth<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:25.799> it

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
prevent 115 from getting to earth and it

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.369 
prevent 115 from getting to earth and it
was<00:03:26.669> like<00:03:26.819> a<00:03:26.849> meteorite<00:03:27.419> and<00:03:27.870> they<00:03:27.989> just<00:03:28.169> blew

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
it up and it ended up going to different

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.909 
it up and it ended up going to different
locations<00:03:30.260> you<00:03:31.260> know<00:03:31.349> because<00:03:31.530> it's<00:03:31.680> always
