00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.110
 two 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.790
 now friends after the first video 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.960
 that we published in which we prepared 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.580
 this vehicle 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.439
 I will not teach it because with the farra 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.589
 it would be the same if you do not identify it if it is 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.589
 the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:33.420
 mz if I leave a time between letters not 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.890
 nothing happens well the car is not in the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.960
 first video we explained a series of 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.320
 tricks that we did at the time 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.430
 prepare it when adjusting it and then 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.610
 well we have had a very good response 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.710
 has liked the video fran in particular one 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.230
 from our followers he made us some 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.210
 questions in which I wanted that 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.339
 we will specify a little more as we had 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.500
 made some of the adjustments but let's 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.480
 explain today and we'll see also what else 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.609
 we have contributed to the car as we have 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.220
 adjusted input you see that we have already 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.650
 put the body of the megane renault 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.890
 for this we have used the tab 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.410
 adjustable front height that's 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.700
 important to be able to raise or lower the 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.700
 body without touching the chassis 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.830
 already has the go lap receiver for 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.200
 use a normal sf transmitter 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.210
 in principle we have not touched anything to the 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.250
 expected to explain to you concretely how 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.980
 we have done what we already announced in your 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.530
 day to accelerate the wear process 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.530
 natural in one piece in this case of the 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.140
 kneecaps and in the upper trapezoids or 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.060
 lower of the suspension well what 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.340
 you will see in enlarged images this is about 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.320
 Dismantle the piece once you have it in 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.600
 the hand check the movement of the 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.650
 metallic ball joint in what is the arm of 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.330
 suspension and good you can tune that 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.540
 movement is very important that the 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.090
 Patella runs free in the cavity 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.670
 what's inside the trapeze like 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.250
 we see in the image you take the 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.290
 dremel you put a small tip that 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.660
 once tightened then hold 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.229
 perfectly the small threaded shaft that 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.870
 has the kneecap 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.420
 that's very important, you turn the 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.879
 kneecap at very low revolutions and little 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.280
 time and you can not pass or give 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.910
 too much reed to the drill or the dremel 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.190
 what do you use 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.930
 and leave it a long time because you think that 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.840
 the break when turning on the trapeze of 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.090
 plastic is going to heat up and if it 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.280
 heated will end up melting the kneecap 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.070
 of plastic is simply about 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.900
 spin it a little bit is more than 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.820
 if he did it naturally mounted 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.010
 in the car that's speeding up the process 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.810
 natural wear and what 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.460
 you will get is that the patella once 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.890
 you have done this process and this we are 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.780
 talking about 20 30 seconds of doing it 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.550
 rotate to move the trapeze very well 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.920
 us with the subject hand is the 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.650
 trapezius while with the other subject 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.690
 jce the dremel that has screwed 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.020
 let's say you have a good grip on what 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.440
 is the kneecap not so once of turns 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.240
 you will see that it is released a little takes the 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.400
 minimum clearance the plastic so that the 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.170
 kneecap was super thin 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.400
 this you do with the four spherical 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.709
 which make up 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.299
 the trapezoids of the front train and the 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.370
 four kneecaps that make up the 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.519
 trapezoids of the rear train and you will be left 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.040
 a car with a bestial suspension and 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.900
 that we talked about this that we explain to you 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.390
 in the previous video it is also 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.739
 interesting to emphasize how we have 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.540
 put the friction grease in the 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.180
 friction shock absorbers that it carries 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.270
 this car you see also in images 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.330
 it's about first 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.180
 make sure that the shock absorber goes 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.730
 fine that 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.770
 ngo which falls within another or is 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.540
 that has no trick but 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.670
 you will have to search very well what kind of 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.790
 fat you put on there are fats of fiction 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.130
 denser softer and is very dense 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.500
 fat fiction and you put a lot you'll leave 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:04.040
 almost jammed the damper if 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.590
 a description would gain a little dense and 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.170
 the best you can little fat and you put little 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.500
 Fat, you will have a lot more touch 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.750
 natural if you notice also you will see what 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.940
 what is the shank what is the axis 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.220
 that enters inside the other leads as a 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.590
 small hole is designed to 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.360
 Expel the excess oil because 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.240
 you can also put oil 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.370
 silicone or shock absorber oil 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.350
 you can play a density a little high 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.210
 because the silicone oil itself 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.220
 It is already less dense than the fat of 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.580
 friction because if you are seeking a 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.980
 high silicone oil density of 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.100
 1000 up for example and only 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.620
 compose a little needless 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.330
 fill it in simply let everything 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.449
 the whole is well lubricated and already 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.139
 is 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:54.330
 with that you will get having released 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.280
 the kneecaps and leaving the suspensions 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.050
 very tuned and 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.790
 knowing that the trapezoids are already 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.310
 are tuned you have a set of 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.780
 incredible suspension this car is a 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.639
 of the advantages it has regarding the 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.750
 mini zeta that the touch of suspension is 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:12.880
 bestial but you have to adjust it well 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.890
 with these improvements that we have made 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.890
 it's the most suspension touch 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.230
 good these little adjustments as soon as 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.090
 to the power steering we have mounted the 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.520
 digital servo that is the one that recommends 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.220
 the manufacturer when the 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.190
 receiver go lab and we have put him 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:35.330
 also some washers between what 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:37.640
 it would be the rim and the bearing that makes 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.140
 of cap now we will put the reference in 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.360
 image so you can see that the model of 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.310
 washer is you can put one or two per 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.700
 roll to avoid a bit of the game 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.770
 excessive they have with these settings the 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.630
 car is ready to roll then we 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.660
 will be final because put to point 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.910
 the electronics with him with the card 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.650
 programmer and set-up 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.660
 geometries based on the circuit and the 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.180
 tires that we use we will tell you 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.830
 in following videos if you liked 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.910
 this video and you have clarified the doubts 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.410
 I like it 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.050
 if you have more doubts the French arrive 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.610
 and we will answer them as we 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.400
 We will improve the car and you can 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:16.639
 follow us at the same pace we will be 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.669
 very progressive and finally 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.539
 subscribe to the channel if you are not 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:24.340
 existing to the day of everything we go 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:24.340
 doing see you in the next video
