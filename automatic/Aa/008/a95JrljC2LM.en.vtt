00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.900
 imax hussem so today I hope 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.580
 how are you doing this how is it not 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.420
 the great shape I caught a little 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.700
 nasopharyngitis 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.889
 but hey it's not for that consumes 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.679
 so here is my new 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:18.609
 singh on skylander except force the 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.720
 starter pack in normal a standard I 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:23.140
 you had presented some time on 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.990
 ps3 the dark edition but here I have 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.390
 recovered so the standard version but 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:33.640
 this time on ps4 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:37.829
 go then go on the front 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.719
 so have classically found the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:46.059
 the three the three basic skylander 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:48.000
 so intel health here the other two 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.160
 anything but force 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.890
 besides I'm going to compare you the 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.500
 box 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.250
 so here is the back the edition mark 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.460
 so we see that the difference of 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:07.720
 quite blatantly size 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.220
 the dark edition is more imposing 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.140
 by the way if the packaging is when 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.210
 even much more work on this 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:18.490
 edition 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:20.820
 that's when is there any good thing to 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.820
 interior 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:43.330
 so we find the game on ps4 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:47.619
 also noted no small 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.900
 logo in play mode like what can we 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.220
 play on the vita have of course that's 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:02:02.550
 logical because the game uses figurines 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:06.430
 here is the interior found 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.619
 the three cards each each person the 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.890
 codes with the stickers so the codes 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.510
 used on the game the game on pc so 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.180
 you can use one I am 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.620
 am I use it phone so the first 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:23.170
 who will use them ben it is said 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.280
 happy for him 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.810
 the class if the classic notice 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.019
 of use informs you not how 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.269
 it works 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.269
 the poster 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.269
 so 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:44.170
 so here I like it very much 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.910
 I like this poster I find it already 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.710
 big there are still a lot of 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:53.040
 figurines and then in the middle one 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.780
 find an example of 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.470
 possible exchange between two 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:04.599
 figurines so a right to the left 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:07.060
 it's nice then the base is 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:11.030
 exactly the same as in the dark 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.690
 edition there is really nothing 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:21.910
 nothing changed and here are the three 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:25.970
 figurines so ninja style health 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:32.890
 So here is the 3-2 series this 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:43.730
 blatt figurine area so a soft force 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:45.500
 here and wash mate I know 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.840
 more if I explained to you in the dark 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.989
 edition the forces besides exchanging 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.940
 they have a capacity that we see at this 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.580
 place there so there is a capacity to 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:01.489
 total for this thirsty force so there 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:04.300
 will have two force by abilities on 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.300
 small exchange 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:17.859
 so here it is wesh wesh zones is 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.400
 and to the left 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:25.720
 black butler by the way I may have 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:32.390
 compare it compared to the figurines in 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:35.479
 dark edition and here I am I like 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:38.539
 well provided that their milk both 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.680
 versions even the standard version 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:44.770
 frankly she is really pretty and 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:47.750
 the mix of blue and gold really well 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.510
 so style health then she I find 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.880
 that there is really no change to 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.710
 the blades and the color of his skin 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.620
 so we see at the level of the face and 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:01.700
 ears that's all non cola 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:04.940
 frankly not much changed and 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.350
 roaches zone so he who from black to 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.090
 the bass by the plane I changed the 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:12.900
 gold color 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:15.330
 in money otherwise the basic version is 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.240
 I really find the leap pretty 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.920
 two deep fringes bling bling 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.290
 that's it but I honestly like it 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.590
 both so here's the starter pack of 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.710
 based 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:29.010
 so so frankly if you like 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.300
 skylander I recommend it even if 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.380
 you already have the dark world edition in 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.500
 this case if you have the dark edition 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.820
 was waiting for them to be in 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.920
 reduction like that you will also have the 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.420
 three figurines in standard version which 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.370
 are really really pretty i find 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.370
 see you soon on my blog
