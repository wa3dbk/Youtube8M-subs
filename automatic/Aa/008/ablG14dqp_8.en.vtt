00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
like of course you can spin it but just

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.830

natural as possible maybe something like

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.710 
natural as possible maybe something like
this<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:26.650> don't<00:02:26.830> try<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.300> pick<00:02:28.300> it<00:02:28.330> up<00:02:28.540> like

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
this so don't try to pick it up like

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.170 
this so don't try to pick it up like
this<00:02:28.900> because<00:02:29.230> otherwise<00:02:29.670> they<00:02:30.670> might<00:02:30.910> think

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
this because otherwise they might think

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.810 
this because otherwise they might think
that<00:02:31.510> something<00:02:32.410> fishy<00:02:32.740> is<00:02:33.040> going<00:02:33.070> on<00:02:33.340> here

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
that something fishy is going on here

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.000 
that something fishy is going on here
so<00:02:34.330> what<00:02:34.480> you're<00:02:34.630> doing<00:02:34.660> is<00:02:34.990> just<00:02:35.200> take<00:02:35.830> it

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
so what you're doing is just take it

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.400 
so what you're doing is just take it
okay<00:02:36.580> it<00:02:36.970> should<00:02:37.270> look<00:02:37.450> really<00:02:37.690> natural<00:02:37.900> and

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
okay it should look really natural and

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.350 
okay it should look really natural and
you're<00:02:38.950> here<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.400> don't<00:02:39.850> square<00:02:40.000> up<00:02:40.060> them

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
you're here and don't square up them

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.480 
you're here and don't square up them
because<00:02:40.960> you<00:02:41.590> want<00:02:41.740> to<00:02:41.980> be<00:02:42.100> in<00:02:42.190> this<00:02:42.280> position

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
so there are kind of psyshock now you

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.940 
so there are kind of psyshock now you
are<00:02:45.460> going<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.760> take<00:02:46.000> or<00:02:46.240> pinch<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.560> double

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
are going to take or pinch the double

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.030 
are going to take or pinch the double
between<00:02:48.640> your<00:02:49.300> thumb<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:50.440> point<00:02:50.770> of

between your thumb and this point of
your<00:02:52.030> index<00:02:52.360> finger<00:02:52.660> like<00:02:52.780> so<00:02:52.840> because<00:02:53.800> you

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
your index finger like so because you

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.610 
your index finger like so because you
are<00:02:54.130> going<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.490> do<00:02:54.730> this<00:02:55.209> move<00:02:55.450> okay

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
are going to do this move okay

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.540 
are going to do this move okay
it's<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.370> simple<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:58.000> since<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:59.550> selection

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
it's that simple and since the selection

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.460 
it's that simple and since the selection
is<00:03:01.470> capped<00:03:02.470> between<00:03:03.120> your<00:03:04.120> fingers<00:03:04.600> and<00:03:04.750> the

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
is capped between your fingers and the

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.590 
is capped between your fingers and the
single<00:03:05.830> cat<00:03:06.070> ear<00:03:06.370> which<00:03:06.940> is<00:03:07.150> kind<00:03:07.390> of<00:03:07.510> a

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
single cat ear which is kind of a

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.770 
single cat ear which is kind of a
surface<00:03:08.020> for<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.740> production<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:10.060> is<00:03:10.600> very

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
surface for the production it is very

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.340 
surface for the production it is very
simple<00:03:11.020> to<00:03:11.200> do<00:03:11.410> this<00:03:11.560> okay<00:03:12.280> so<00:03:12.880> this<00:03:13.300> is<00:03:13.480> the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
simple to do this okay so this is the

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.290 
simple to do this okay so this is the
position<00:03:14.530> you're<00:03:15.040> in<00:03:15.070> and<00:03:15.459> what<00:03:16.000> you're

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
position you're in and what you're

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.720 
position you're in and what you're
saying<00:03:16.510> is<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:16.780> basically<00:03:17.110> use<00:03:17.490> these<00:03:18.490> two

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
saying is you basically use these two

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.030 
saying is you basically use these two
fingers<00:03:18.940> okay<00:03:19.540> so<00:03:19.600> your<00:03:19.840> index<00:03:20.170> finger<00:03:20.470> to

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
fingers okay so your index finger to

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.880 
fingers okay so your index finger to
push<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.490> cat<00:03:21.810> forward<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:23.350> kind<00:03:23.590> of<00:03:23.650> seems

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
push the cat forward it kind of seems

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.250 
push the cat forward it kind of seems
you<00:03:24.370> have<00:03:24.580> the<00:03:24.820> single<00:03:25.150> cat<00:03:25.420> underneath<00:03:25.900> and

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
you have the single cat underneath and

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.470 
you have the single cat underneath and
you<00:03:26.709> don't<00:03:26.920> have<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.340> care<00:03:27.580> about<00:03:27.610> it<00:03:27.880> at<00:03:28.269> all

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
you don't have to care about it at all

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.410 
you don't have to care about it at all
because<00:03:28.750> it<00:03:29.620> wouldn't<00:03:29.980> fall<00:03:30.280> on<00:03:30.550> the<00:03:30.820> table<00:03:31.269> or

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
because it wouldn't fall on the table or

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.150 
because it wouldn't fall on the table or
on<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:31.959> floor<00:03:32.080> in<00:03:32.410> this<00:03:32.560> case<00:03:32.769> because<00:03:32.980> you

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
on the floor in this case because you

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.850 
on the floor in this case because you
have<00:03:33.430> this<00:03:33.640> cat<00:03:33.910> as<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.420> surface<00:03:34.959> so<00:03:35.530> on<00:03:35.709> one

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
have this cat as a surface so on one

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.570 
have this cat as a surface so on one
side<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:37.750> are<00:03:37.780> in<00:03:38.140> this<00:03:38.260> position<00:03:38.500> of<00:03:39.250> course

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
side you are in this position of course

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.820 
side you are in this position of course
they<00:03:39.730> don't<00:03:39.940> say<00:03:40.150> you<00:03:40.900> pinch<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.260> cat<00:03:41.470> between

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
they don't say you pinch the cat between

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.440 
they don't say you pinch the cat between
your<00:03:41.950> thumb<00:03:42.190> and<00:03:42.220> this<00:03:42.489> part<00:03:42.760> of<00:03:42.940> your<00:03:43.060> index

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
your thumb and this part of your index

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.250 
your thumb and this part of your index
finger<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:44.350> say<00:03:44.500> three<00:03:44.739> two<00:03:45.190> one<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.780> you

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
finger and you say three two one and you

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.400 
finger and you say three two one and you
produce<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:47.799> okay<00:03:48.670> so<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.209> only<00:03:49.390> move<00:03:49.750> like<00:03:50.260> we

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
produce it okay so the only move like we

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.930 
produce it okay so the only move like we
felt<00:03:50.650> these<00:03:51.010> moves<00:03:51.310> it<00:03:51.519> would<00:03:51.670> look<00:03:51.820> something

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
felt these moves it would look something

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.140 
felt these moves it would look something
like<00:03:52.150> this<00:03:52.860> and<00:03:53.860> that's<00:03:54.010> it<00:03:54.340> okay<00:03:54.850> it's<00:03:55.030> really

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
like this and that's it okay it's really

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.840 
like this and that's it okay it's really
simple<00:03:55.480> so<00:03:55.780> one<00:03:56.530> more<00:03:56.680> time<00:03:56.890> from<00:03:57.100> the<00:03:57.190> from

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
simple so one more time from the from
