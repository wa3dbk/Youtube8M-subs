all<00:00:01.979> right<00:00:02.129> there's<00:00:02.399> two<00:00:03.350> features<00:00:04.350> on<00:00:04.500> the

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
all right there's two features on the

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.110 
all right there's two features on the
camera<00:00:04.950> that<00:00:05.130> some<00:00:05.580> people<00:00:05.819> might<00:00:05.970> get

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
camera that some people might get

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.519 
camera that some people might get
confused<00:00:06.540> I<00:00:06.660> don't<00:00:06.720> know<00:00:06.839> maybe<00:00:06.990> maybe<00:00:07.259> not

what mirror up does and that's selected
on<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:17.100> dial<00:00:17.490> right<00:00:17.760> here<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.270> change<00:00:18.480> it

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
on this dial right here you change it

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.470 
on this dial right here you change it
from<00:00:19.070> right<00:00:20.070> now<00:00:20.189> except<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.520> CH<00:00:21.119> which<00:00:21.359> is

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
from right now except the CH which is

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.390 
from right now except the CH which is
continuous<00:00:21.960> hi<00:00:22.140> if<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:22.859> click<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.189> over<00:00:23.279> a

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
continuous hi if you click it over a

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.179 
continuous hi if you click it over a
couple<00:00:23.730> times<00:00:23.910> it'll<00:00:24.300> go<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.570> M<00:00:24.900> up<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.619> what

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
couple times it'll go to M up and what

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.250 
couple times it'll go to M up and what
that<00:00:26.340> means<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.880> when<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.660> push<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.230> button

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
that means is when you push the button

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.359 
that means is when you push the button
but<00:00:28.980> when<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:29.939> push<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.300> shutter<00:00:30.449> button

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
but when you push the shutter button

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.350 
but when you push the shutter button
right<00:00:32.369> there<00:00:32.989> the<00:00:34.130> mirror<00:00:35.130> will<00:00:35.340> flip<00:00:35.579> up<00:00:35.730> that

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
right there the mirror will flip up that

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.610 
right there the mirror will flip up that
doesn't<00:00:36.570> start<00:00:36.870> taking<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.170> picture<00:00:37.440> yet

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
doesn't start taking the picture yet

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.440 
doesn't start taking the picture yet
just<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.430> mirror<00:00:38.640> flips<00:00:38.910> up<00:00:39.140> and<00:00:41.210> it<00:00:42.210> waits

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
just the mirror flips up and it waits

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.290 
just the mirror flips up and it waits
for<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.750> hit<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> button<00:00:43.170> again<00:00:43.700> and<00:00:44.700> so

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
for you to hit the button again and so

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.119 
for you to hit the button again and so
what<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.140> does<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.590> when<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> mirror<00:00:47.010> flips

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
what that does is when the mirror flips

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.130 
what that does is when the mirror flips
up<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.789> camera<00:00:48.059> vibrates<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> second<00:00:49.020> so

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
up the camera vibrates for a second so

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.119 
up the camera vibrates for a second so
if<00:00:49.200> you're<00:00:49.320> taking<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.590> picture<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.890> something

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
if you're taking a picture of something

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.560 
if you're taking a picture of something
really<00:00:50.460> really<00:00:50.670> far<00:00:50.820> away<00:00:51.090> with<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> really

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
really really far away with a really

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.350 
really really far away with a really
really<00:00:51.750> high<00:00:51.870> powerful<00:00:52.350> telephoto<00:00:53.280> zoom<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
really high powerful telephoto zoom the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.549 
really high powerful telephoto zoom the
mirror<00:00:54.660> flipping<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.079> might<00:00:55.289> cause<00:00:55.530> some

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
mirror flipping up might cause some

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.160 
mirror flipping up might cause some
vibrations<00:00:56.280> which<00:00:56.789> would<00:00:57.000> give<00:00:57.539> your<00:00:57.719> picture

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
vibrations which would give your picture

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.360 
vibrations which would give your picture
a<00:00:58.199> little<00:00:58.320> bit<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.559> motion<00:00:58.829> we're<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.250> an

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
a little bit of motion we're in an

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.270 
a little bit of motion we're in an
extreme<00:00:59.730> scenario<00:00:59.969> or<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.710> other<00:01:01.829> option<00:01:01.980> or

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
extreme scenario or the other option or

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.889 
extreme scenario or the other option or
the<00:01:02.609> other<00:01:02.730> way<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.270> might<00:01:03.390> happen<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.780> if

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
the other way that might happen is if

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.200 
the other way that might happen is if
you're<00:01:04.019> doing<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.229> macro<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.060> it's<00:01:06.060> almost

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
you're doing a macro and it's almost

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.210 
you're doing a macro and it's almost
like<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> microscope<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.290> any<00:01:07.920> kind<00:01:08.159> of

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
like a microscope and any kind of

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.920 
like a microscope and any kind of
vibration<00:01:08.400> whatsoever<00:01:09.060> has<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> huge<00:01:09.630> impact

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
vibration whatsoever has a huge impact

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:19.219 
vibration whatsoever has a huge impact
on<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:14.060> vibration<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.210> camera<00:01:18.229> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
on the the vibration of the camera the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.780 
on the the vibration of the camera the
problem<00:01:19.650> with<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.890> though<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.490> have<00:01:20.640> to

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
problem with that though is you have to

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.330 
problem with that though is you have to
hit<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> button<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.630> second<00:01:22.259> time<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:23.070> start

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
hit the button a second time to start

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.850 
hit the button a second time to start
the<00:01:23.460> exposure<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:25.170> like<00:01:25.320> if<00:01:25.710> you're

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
the exposure so it's like if you're

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.020 
the exposure so it's like if you're
touching<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.189> camera<00:01:26.369> you're<00:01:26.670> kind<00:01:26.880> of

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
touching the camera you're kind of

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.960 
touching the camera you're kind of
defeating<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.869> point<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.189> only<00:01:29.310> or<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
defeating the point so the only or the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.700 
defeating the point so the only or the
the<00:01:30.360> most<00:01:30.509> effective<00:01:30.869> way<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.020> use<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.500> mirror

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
the most effective way to use the mirror

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.499 
the most effective way to use the mirror
up<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.040> with<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> remote<00:01:32.700> cable<00:01:32.909> release<00:01:33.299> or

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
up is with a remote cable release or

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.660 
up is with a remote cable release or
software<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:36.110> hit<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.350> cable<00:01:38.220> release<00:01:38.430> once

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
software you hit the cable release once

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.069 
software you hit the cable release once
the<00:01:38.850> mirror<00:01:39.060> goes<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.509> hit<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.720> again<00:01:39.930> and

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
the mirror goes up you hit it again and

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.830 
the mirror goes up you hit it again and
it<00:01:40.170> start<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.560> exposure<00:01:40.860> nasan<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.479> uses

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
it start to the exposure nasan it uses

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.899 
it start to the exposure nasan it uses
whatever<00:01:43.020> exposure<00:01:43.560> settings<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.369> have<00:01:44.579> set

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
whatever exposure settings you have set

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.749 
whatever exposure settings you have set
on<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.329> camera<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.530> as<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.340> see<00:01:47.490> right<00:01:47.520> now

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
on the camera so as you see right now

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.100 
on the camera so as you see right now
I've<00:01:47.939> got<00:01:48.210> programmable<00:01:48.509> ATO

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
I've got programmable ATO

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.109 
I've got programmable ATO
I<00:01:51.530> can<00:01:52.530> choose<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.100> know<00:01:53.189> shutter<00:01:53.939> priority

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
I can choose you know shutter priority

I'm using back here is what the mirror

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.690 
I'm using back here is what the mirror
up<00:02:00.149> will<00:02:00.719> use<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.530> if<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.070> have<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.219> two-second

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
up will use so if I have a two-second

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.959 
up will use so if I have a two-second
exposure<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:03.450> manual<00:02:04.350> mode<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.820> mirror<00:02:05.820> will

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
exposure in manual mode the mirror will

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.639 
exposure in manual mode the mirror will
go<00:02:06.090> up<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.479> hit<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.869> button<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.110> second<00:02:07.380> time<00:02:07.409> and

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
go up I hit the button a second time and

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.050 
go up I hit the button a second time and
it'll<00:02:07.860> start<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.129> two-second<00:02:08.550> exposure<00:02:08.610> and

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
it'll start a two-second exposure and

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.249 
it'll start a two-second exposure and
when<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.239> exposures<00:02:09.660> down<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.929> mirror<00:02:10.140> will

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
when the exposures down the mirror will

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.900 
when the exposures down the mirror will
flip<00:02:10.440> down

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.840 

the<00:02:14.910> other<00:02:15.090> choice<00:02:15.959> is<00:02:16.550> after<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.640> hit<00:02:17.790> the

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
the other choice is after you hit the

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.070 
the other choice is after you hit the
button<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.360> first<00:02:18.540> time<00:02:18.690> in<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.900> mirror

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
button the first time in the mirror

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.340 
button the first time in the mirror
flips<00:02:19.200> up<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.730> camera<00:02:20.730> will<00:02:20.880> take<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:21.090> picture

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
flips up the camera will take a picture

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.140 
flips up the camera will take a picture
after<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:22.410> times<00:02:22.590> out<00:02:22.800> 30<00:02:23.190> seconds<00:02:23.550> later<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.120> I

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
after it times out 30 seconds later so I

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.540 
after it times out 30 seconds later so I
just<00:02:24.330> have<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.480> be<00:02:24.660> patient<00:02:25.020> but<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.920> mean

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
just have to be patient but that mean

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.160 
just have to be patient but that mean
that's<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.180> one<00:02:27.330> way<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.900> won't<00:02:28.050> have

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
that's the one way that you won't have

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.720 
that's the one way that you won't have
any<00:02:28.319> vibration<00:02:28.800> whatsoever<00:02:29.220> in<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.400> camera

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
any vibration whatsoever in the camera

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.030 
any vibration whatsoever in the camera
and<00:02:30.270> you<00:02:30.959> don't<00:02:31.110> have<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.319> touch<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.920> need

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
and you don't have to touch it you need

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.440 
and you don't have to touch it you need
room<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.220> have<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.459> cable<00:02:32.760> release<00:02:32.819> or<00:02:33.150> plug<00:02:33.330> it

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
room to have a cable release or plug it

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.920 
room to have a cable release or plug it
into<00:02:33.569> a<00:02:33.630> laptop<00:02:34.520> now<00:02:35.520> bulb<00:02:35.850> is<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.630> little<00:02:36.840> bit

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
into a laptop now bulb is a little bit

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.229 
into a laptop now bulb is a little bit
different<00:02:37.910> bulb<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.480> what<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.870> would<00:02:39.959> use<00:02:40.200> for

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
different bulb is what you would use for

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.960 
different bulb is what you would use for
like<00:02:42.239> taking<00:02:42.959> half<00:02:43.920> hour<00:02:44.160> pictures<00:02:44.640> anything

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
like taking half hour pictures anything

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.759 
like taking half hour pictures anything
over<00:02:45.300> 30<00:02:45.540> seconds<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.450> do<00:02:48.570> that<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:49.620> need

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
over 30 seconds and to do that you need

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.949 
over 30 seconds and to do that you need
to<00:02:50.180> adjust<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.840> shutter<00:02:52.110> speed<00:02:53.090> manually<00:02:54.090> as

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
to adjust the shutter speed manually as

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.890 
to adjust the shutter speed manually as
you<00:02:55.170> go<00:02:55.320> to<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:56.010> very<00:02:56.850> very<00:02:57.120> long<00:02:57.300> shutter<00:02:57.600> you

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
you go to a very very long shutter you

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.600 
you go to a very very long shutter you
go<00:02:58.019> past<00:02:58.260> 30<00:02:58.500> seconds<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.069> it<00:02:59.190> will<00:02:59.250> switch<00:02:59.310> to

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
go past 30 seconds and it will switch to

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.080 
go past 30 seconds and it will switch to
bulb<00:02:59.819> now<00:03:00.709> it'll<00:03:01.709> expose<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.489> sensor<00:03:02.819> to

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
bulb now it'll expose the sensor to

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.729 
bulb now it'll expose the sensor to
whatever<00:03:03.540> you're<00:03:03.780> looking<00:03:04.080> at<00:03:04.260> for<00:03:04.530> as<00:03:04.620> long

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
whatever you're looking at for as long

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.590 
whatever you're looking at for as long
as<00:03:04.800> you<00:03:05.010> hold<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.220> button<00:03:05.370> down<00:03:05.519> of<00:03:06.420> course

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
as you hold the button down of course

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.370 
as you hold the button down of course
you<00:03:06.660> don't<00:03:06.780> want<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.959> hold<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.140> button<00:03:07.260> down

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
you don't want to hold the button down

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.130 
you don't want to hold the button down
for<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.680> half<00:03:07.860> hour<00:03:08.269> so<00:03:09.269> you<00:03:09.900> either<00:03:10.019> need

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
for a half hour so you either need

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.570 
for a half hour so you either need
software<00:03:10.769> or<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.160> cable<00:03:11.550> release<00:03:13.280> no<00:03:14.280> other<00:03:14.459> way

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
software or a cable release no other way

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.120 
software or a cable release no other way
around<00:03:14.819> that<00:03:15.769> but<00:03:16.769> that's<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.070> difference

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
around that but that's the difference

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.640 
around that but that's the difference
between<00:03:17.400> Balban<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:19.880> mirror<00:03:20.880> up<00:03:21.090> bulb<00:03:21.989> is<00:03:22.590> a

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
between Balban and mirror up bulb is a

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.410 
between Balban and mirror up bulb is a
manual<00:03:23.130> exposure<00:03:23.430> setting<00:03:23.850> where<00:03:24.000> mirror<00:03:24.269> up

manual exposure setting where mirror up
all<00:03:24.930> that<00:03:25.350> means<00:03:25.650> is<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:25.890> mirror<00:03:26.250> goes<00:03:26.430> up

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
all that means is the mirror goes up

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.520 
all that means is the mirror goes up
before<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.180> take<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.570> picture

right back to the focus selector modes
you've<00:03:37.599> got<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.640> single<00:03:39.640> area<00:03:39.790> like<00:03:40.269> manually

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
you've got the single area like manually

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.330 
you've got the single area like manually
set

you've<00:03:42.340> got<00:03:42.549> dynamic<00:03:43.060> area<00:03:43.390> and<00:03:44.170> you've<00:03:44.290> got

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
you've got dynamic area and you've got

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
want 11 points to choose from or I want

all 51 to choose from say 51 is like

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
you'll be able to see a confirmation

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.070 
you'll be able to see a confirmation
that<00:04:30.699> the<00:04:30.820> picture<00:04:31.060> you<00:04:31.150> took<00:04:31.330> was<00:04:31.570> in<00:04:31.600> focus

the camera set to 921 or 51 points what
it'll<00:05:11.289> do<00:05:11.470> is<00:05:11.680> you<00:05:12.220> pick<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:12.669> area<00:05:12.699> that's<00:05:13.030> in

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
it'll do is you pick the area that's in

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.360 
it'll do is you pick the area that's in
focus<00:05:13.570> and<00:05:13.810> then<00:05:14.409> the<00:05:14.620> subject<00:05:14.860> of<00:05:15.039> the

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
focus and then the subject of the

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.189 
focus and then the subject of the
subject<00:05:15.760> can<00:05:15.940> temporarily<00:05:16.300> leave<00:05:16.750> that<00:05:16.930> area

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
subject can temporarily leave that area

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.770 
subject can temporarily leave that area
and<00:05:17.409> go<00:05:17.889> back<00:05:18.039> into<00:05:18.250> it<00:05:18.460> and<00:05:18.639> the<00:05:19.300> camera<00:05:19.599> won't

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
and go back into it and the camera won't

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.170 
and go back into it and the camera won't
refocus<00:05:20.440> it'll<00:05:21.159> wait<00:05:21.310> for<00:05:21.639> that<00:05:21.760> subject<00:05:22.150> to

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
refocus it'll wait for that subject to

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.060 
refocus it'll wait for that subject to
come<00:05:22.389> back<00:05:22.570> so<00:05:23.169> like<00:05:23.440> if<00:05:23.560> they're<00:05:23.710> bouncing

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
come back so like if they're bouncing

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.129 
come back so like if they're bouncing
around<00:05:24.159> a<00:05:24.400> little<00:05:24.430> bit<00:05:24.789> it'll<00:05:25.659> give<00:05:25.840> you<00:05:25.960> some

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
around a little bit it'll give you some

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.399 
around a little bit it'll give you some
some<00:05:26.830> margin<00:05:27.130> of<00:05:27.220> error<00:05:27.370> to<00:05:27.550> work<00:05:27.699> with<00:05:27.880> there

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
some margin of error to work with there

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.899 
some margin of error to work with there
if<00:05:29.409> you<00:05:29.680> have<00:05:29.830> the<00:05:29.979> camera<00:05:30.310> set<00:05:30.490> for<00:05:30.639> 3d

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:30.909 
if you have the camera set for 3d

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.439 
if you have the camera set for 3d
tracking<00:05:31.210> once<00:05:32.139> you<00:05:32.260> focus<00:05:32.500> on<00:05:32.800> that<00:05:33.039> subject

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
tracking once you focus on that subject

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:35.820 
tracking once you focus on that subject
the<00:05:34.449> focus<00:05:34.780> point<00:05:35.020> will<00:05:35.139> actually<00:05:35.470> follow<00:05:35.650> it

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
the focus point will actually follow it

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.469 
the focus point will actually follow it
around<00:05:36.010> the<00:05:36.310> screen<00:05:36.580> so<00:05:36.820> long<00:05:36.970> as<00:05:37.120> it<00:05:37.210> stays

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
around the screen so long as it stays

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:40.649 
around the screen so long as it stays
within<00:05:37.840> this<00:05:38.560> little<00:05:38.830> area<00:05:38.979> here<00:05:39.240> the<00:05:40.240> focus

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
within this little area here the focus

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.450 
within this little area here the focus
will<00:05:40.810> follow<00:05:41.080> it<00:05:41.349> and<00:05:41.530> so<00:05:42.010> you<00:05:42.070> could<00:05:42.460> have

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
will follow it and so you could have

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
will follow it and so you could have
with<00:05:43.640> camera<00:05:44.090> on<00:05:44.210> a<00:05:44.240> tripod<00:05:44.450> for<00:05:44.930> example<00:05:45.350> and

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
with camera on a tripod for example and

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.570 
with camera on a tripod for example and
focus<00:05:47.480> on<00:05:47.630> someone's<00:05:47.930> face<00:05:48.140> and<00:05:48.440> if<00:05:49.190> they<00:05:49.370> move

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
focus on someone's face and if they move

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.400 
focus on someone's face and if they move
to<00:05:49.640> the<00:05:49.880> left<00:05:50.060> right<00:05:50.300> front<00:05:50.600> back<00:05:50.780> it'll

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
to the left right front back it'll

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.930 
to the left right front back it'll
follow<00:05:51.650> that<00:05:51.950> subject<00:05:52.370> no<00:05:52.460> matter<00:05:52.640> where<00:05:52.850> they

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
follow that subject no matter where they

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.220 
follow that subject no matter where they
go<00:05:52.970> so<00:05:53.300> long<00:05:53.390> as<00:05:53.540> they<00:05:53.630> stay<00:05:53.840> in<00:05:53.870> this<00:05:54.080> little

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.230 
go so long as they stay in this little

00:05:54.230 --> 00:06:01.480 
go so long as they stay in this little
focusing<00:05:54.740> area<00:05:57.130> the<00:05:58.130> full<00:05:58.370> auto<00:05:58.550> mode<00:05:58.670> I<00:06:00.490> think

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
focusing area the full auto mode I think

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.670 
focusing area the full auto mode I think
is<00:06:01.610> only<00:06:01.760> really<00:06:01.970> useful<00:06:02.420> in<00:06:02.660> single<00:06:03.380> servo

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
is only really useful in single servo

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.860 
is only really useful in single servo
mode<00:06:03.860> in<00:06:04.150> continuous<00:06:05.150> servo<00:06:05.390> mode<00:06:05.570> you<00:06:05.780> don't

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
mode in continuous servo mode you don't

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.660 
mode in continuous servo mode you don't
get<00:06:06.050> any<00:06:06.260> identification<00:06:06.890> for<00:06:07.430> where<00:06:07.550> the

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
get any identification for where the

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.730 
get any identification for where the
camera<00:06:07.970> focused<00:06:08.300> at<00:06:08.420> all<00:06:08.540> so<00:06:08.780> it's<00:06:09.470> kind<00:06:09.650> of

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
camera focused at all so it's kind of

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.090 
camera focused at all so it's kind of
like<00:06:09.890> shooting<00:06:10.070> blind<00:06:10.520> in<00:06:11.410> a<00:06:12.410> single<00:06:12.830> servo

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
like shooting blind in a single servo

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.370 
like shooting blind in a single servo
mode<00:06:13.310> it<00:06:14.150> will<00:06:14.330> light<00:06:14.570> up<00:06:14.750> with<00:06:14.930> little<00:06:15.170> blocks

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
mode it will light up with little blocks

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.800 
mode it will light up with little blocks
all<00:06:15.650> the<00:06:15.830> areas<00:06:16.160> that<00:06:16.190> were<00:06:16.400> focused<00:06:16.760> on<00:06:16.910> so<00:06:17.780> I

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
all the areas that were focused on so I

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.300 
all the areas that were focused on so I
can<00:06:18.140> demonstrate<00:06:18.290> that<00:06:18.620> with<00:06:18.920> a<00:06:18.980> picture

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
can demonstrate that with a picture

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.970 
can demonstrate that with a picture
right<00:06:19.490> now<00:06:22.540> actually<00:06:23.540> there<00:06:23.930> we<00:06:24.020> go<00:06:24.140> now<00:06:24.950> you

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:24.980 
right now actually there we go now you

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.350 
right now actually there we go now you
can<00:06:25.100> see<00:06:25.310> all<00:06:25.430> the<00:06:25.490> places<00:06:25.730> that<00:06:25.970> the<00:06:26.090> camera

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
can see all the places that the camera

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.030 
can see all the places that the camera
thought<00:06:26.570> were<00:06:26.720> in<00:06:26.840> focus<00:06:27.200> which<00:06:27.470> is<00:06:27.500> quite<00:06:28.010> a

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
thought were in focus which is quite a

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.000 
thought were in focus which is quite a
few<00:06:28.220> and<00:06:28.940> I<00:06:29.510> like<00:06:30.260> it<00:06:30.380> because<00:06:30.500> you<00:06:30.680> can<00:06:30.710> see

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.010 
few and I like it because you can see

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.890 
few and I like it because you can see
like<00:06:31.280> what<00:06:31.910> areas<00:06:32.210> around<00:06:32.360> your<00:06:32.660> subject

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
like what areas around your subject

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.250 
like what areas around your subject
we're<00:06:33.260> also<00:06:33.380> in<00:06:33.620> focus<00:06:34.660> and<00:06:35.660> it<00:06:35.750> also<00:06:35.900> can

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
we're also in focus and it also can

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.130 
we're also in focus and it also can
detect<00:06:36.590> a<00:06:37.010> fatal<00:06:37.640> shot<00:06:37.850> so<00:06:38.090> if<00:06:38.210> if<00:06:38.840> you<00:06:38.990> have<00:06:39.110> a

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:39.140 
detect a fatal shot so if if you have a

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.950 
detect a fatal shot so if if you have a
CPU<00:06:39.470> lens<00:06:39.770> on<00:06:40.010> that's<00:06:40.460> a<00:06:40.550> G<00:06:40.790> or<00:06:40.850> a<00:06:40.940> D<00:06:41.120> it'll

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
CPU lens on that's a G or a D it'll

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.800 
CPU lens on that's a G or a D it'll
detect<00:06:42.260> the<00:06:42.650> shape<00:06:42.830> of<00:06:42.950> a<00:06:43.040> face<00:06:43.250> and

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:43.810 
detect the shape of a face and

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.510 
detect the shape of a face and
automatically<00:06:44.810> focus<00:06:45.110> on<00:06:45.230> that<00:06:45.410> no<00:06:46.340> matter

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
automatically focus on that no matter

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.850 
automatically focus on that no matter
what<00:06:47.390> kind<00:06:47.930> of<00:06:47.990> information<00:06:48.470> is<00:06:48.590> in<00:06:48.680> the

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
what kind of information is in the

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.400 
what kind of information is in the
viewfinder<00:06:49.630> it'll<00:06:50.630> find<00:06:50.840> the<00:06:50.960> face<00:06:51.110> and<00:06:51.320> focus

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.410 
viewfinder it'll find the face and focus

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.170 
viewfinder it'll find the face and focus
on<00:06:51.710> that<00:06:51.860> it'll<00:06:52.460> assume<00:06:52.640> you<00:06:52.790> want<00:06:52.940> the<00:06:53.030> person

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.180 
on that it'll assume you want the person

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.640 
on that it'll assume you want the person
if<00:06:53.480> you<00:06:53.540> don't<00:06:53.720> want<00:06:53.840> the<00:06:53.900> person<00:06:54.230> and<00:06:54.470> turn

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:54.650 
if you don't want the person and turn

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.920 
if you don't want the person and turn
off<00:06:54.830> full<00:06:55.580> auto<00:06:55.760> and<00:06:56.360> switch<00:06:56.660> it<00:06:56.780> to<00:06:56.810> the

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
off full auto and switch it to the

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:03.370 
off full auto and switch it to the
manual<00:06:57.350> selector<00:07:01.420> one<00:07:02.420> more<00:07:02.810> thing<00:07:03.080> to

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 
manual selector one more thing to

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.940 
manual selector one more thing to
mention<00:07:03.530> is<00:07:04.070> about<00:07:04.490> the<00:07:04.820> focus<00:07:05.810> mode<00:07:05.990> is<00:07:06.320> that

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:06.950 
mention is about the focus mode is that

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:12.790 
mention is about the focus mode is that
um<00:07:07.990> is<00:07:09.160> that<00:07:10.900> the<00:07:11.900> full<00:07:12.110> auto<00:07:12.260> mode<00:07:12.380> is<00:07:12.680> the

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 
um is that the full auto mode is the

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.280 
um is that the full auto mode is the
slowest<00:07:13.220> it<00:07:13.610> has<00:07:13.760> to<00:07:13.880> come<00:07:14.060> it<00:07:14.300> has<00:07:14.420> to<00:07:14.570> analyze

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:15.290 
slowest it has to come it has to analyze

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.050 
slowest it has to come it has to analyze
the<00:07:15.560> scene<00:07:15.830> to<00:07:16.070> figure<00:07:16.220> out<00:07:16.430> what<00:07:16.550> to<00:07:16.640> focus<00:07:16.760> on

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.060 
the scene to figure out what to focus on

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.300 
the scene to figure out what to focus on
and<00:07:17.360> that<00:07:17.480> adds<00:07:17.660> a<00:07:17.750> little<00:07:17.840> bit<00:07:17.990> of<00:07:18.170> delay<00:07:18.470> the

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:19.310 
and that adds a little bit of delay the

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.970 
and that adds a little bit of delay the
fastest<00:07:19.760> by<00:07:19.880> far<00:07:20.150> is<00:07:20.390> the<00:07:20.420> single<00:07:20.980> selector

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:21.980 
fastest by far is the single selector

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.000 
fastest by far is the single selector
mode<00:07:22.190> and<00:07:22.520> then<00:07:23.090> dynamic<00:07:23.870> area<00:07:24.140> is<00:07:24.230> not<00:07:24.860> too

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.010 
mode and then dynamic area is not too

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.690 
mode and then dynamic area is not too
bad<00:07:25.190> it's<00:07:25.490> somewhere<00:07:26.030> in<00:07:26.120> the<00:07:26.210> middle<00:07:26.770> but<00:07:27.770> if

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:28.700 
bad it's somewhere in the middle but if

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.980 
bad it's somewhere in the middle but if
you<00:07:28.880> always<00:07:29.030> want<00:07:29.300> the<00:07:29.390> fastest<00:07:29.660> focus

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:29.990 
you always want the fastest focus

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.870 
you always want the fastest focus
manually<00:07:30.860> choose<00:07:31.070> the<00:07:31.220> area<00:07:31.460> that's<00:07:31.640> in<00:07:31.760> focus

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:31.880 
manually choose the area that's in focus

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.180 
manually choose the area that's in focus
that's<00:07:32.690> the<00:07:32.960> fastest<00:07:33.350> for<00:07:33.500> single<00:07:33.800> servo<00:07:34.040> and

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:34.190 
that's the fastest for single servo and

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.940 
that's the fastest for single servo and
continuous<00:07:34.730> servo<00:07:35.000> mode<00:07:35.620> that's<00:07:36.620> all<00:07:36.740> I<00:07:36.770> have

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:36.950 
continuous servo mode that's all I have

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.160 
continuous servo mode that's all I have
for<00:07:37.100> that
