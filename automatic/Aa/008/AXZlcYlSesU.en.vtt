here<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.229> got<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> bunch<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:17.360> look<00:01:18.360> there<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.630> go

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
here you got a bunch of look there we go

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.060 
here you got a bunch of look there we go
here<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.140> got<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> bunch<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.680> gesture

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
here you got a bunch of like gesture

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.300 
here you got a bunch of like gesture
drawings<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:21.000> get<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.240> movements<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.840> stuff

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
drawings to get the movements and stuff

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.240 
drawings to get the movements and stuff
and<00:01:23.869> I<00:01:24.869> think<00:01:25.350> there's<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> page<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.860> here<00:01:26.009> -<00:01:26.159> it

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
and I think there's a page in here - it

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.830 
and I think there's a page in here - it
shows<00:01:26.820> stick<00:01:27.150> figures<00:01:29.360> let<00:01:30.360> me<00:01:30.450> see<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.689> can

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
shows stick figures let me see if I can

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:39.499 
shows stick figures let me see if I can
find<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.790> yeah<00:01:36.979> here<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.009> go<00:01:38.329> who<00:01:39.329> would<00:01:39.420> have

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
find it yeah here we go who would have

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.819 
find it yeah here we go who would have
thought<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.930> stick<00:01:40.200> figures<00:01:40.530> would<00:01:40.740> have

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
thought that stick figures would have

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.550 
thought that stick figures would have
been<00:01:40.979> useful<00:01:41.810> this<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.869> actually<00:01:43.290> good<00:01:43.470> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
been useful this is actually good to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.840 
been useful this is actually good to
design<00:01:44.009> your<00:01:44.159> skeleton<00:01:44.930> so<00:01:45.930> got<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.110> one<00:01:46.850> and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
design your skeleton so got that one and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.490 
design your skeleton so got that one and
then<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.750> other<00:01:48.869> book<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.520> force

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
then the other book is the force

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.670 
then the other book is the force
character<00:01:52.500> design<00:01:52.860> from<00:01:53.490> life<00:01:54.149> drawings<00:01:54.680> this

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
character design from life drawings this

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.679 
character design from life drawings this
one's<00:01:55.890> gonna<00:01:56.070> be<00:01:56.159> more<00:01:56.490> teaching<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.540> how<00:01:57.630> to

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
one's gonna be more teaching you how to

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.690 
one's gonna be more teaching you how to
draw<00:01:57.899> cartoon<00:01:58.680> your<00:01:59.070> shifting<00:01:59.340> characters

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
draw cartoon your shifting characters

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.179 
draw cartoon your shifting characters
kind<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.969> stuff<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.270> see<00:02:00.420> what<00:02:00.570> biz<00:02:00.719> knee

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:05.929 

which<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.219> pretty<00:02:05.640> cool

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
which is pretty cool

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.600 
which is pretty cool
like<00:02:06.090> DreamWorks<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.600> stuff<00:02:07.280> so<00:02:08.280> that's<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
like DreamWorks and stuff so that's the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.990 
like DreamWorks and stuff so that's the
books

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.460 

so<00:02:16.290> books<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:18.520> might<00:02:18.730> not<00:02:18.880> be<00:02:19.000> able<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.150> see

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
so books you might not be able to see

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.820 
so books you might not be able to see
okay<00:02:20.470> good<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.709> can<00:02:20.830> see<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:22.510> this<00:02:22.780> is<00:02:23.110> a

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
okay good you can see and this is a

that's pretty snazzy like that okay I

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.940 
that's pretty snazzy like that okay I
most<00:05:19.060> certainly<00:05:19.300> did<00:05:20.080> not<00:05:20.320> send<00:05:20.650> up<00:05:20.740> to<00:05:20.830> be<00:05:20.919> a

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
most certainly did not send up to be a

doctor or a butcher or whatever is I'm a

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:32.640 
doctor or a butcher or whatever is I'm a
bug<00:05:30.180> that's<00:05:31.180> probably<00:05:31.539> to<00:05:31.780> do<00:05:32.229> like<00:05:32.410> head

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
bug that's probably to do like head

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:33.870 
bug that's probably to do like head
sizes<00:05:33.100> and<00:05:33.280> stuff<00:05:33.400> like<00:05:33.520> that<00:05:33.729> you<00:05:33.850> can

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880
