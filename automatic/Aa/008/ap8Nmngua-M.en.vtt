Big Ed sweta frostbites been in

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.770 
Big Ed sweta frostbites been in
development<00:00:08.650> since<00:00:09.040> 2006<00:00:09.999> and<00:00:10.360> there's

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:10.780 
development since 2006 and there's

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.989 
development since 2006 and there's
always<00:00:11.049> been<00:00:11.200> a<00:00:11.259> road<00:00:11.499> map<00:00:11.740> and<00:00:11.950> a<00:00:11.980> plan<00:00:12.309> for

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:12.999 
always been a road map and a plan for

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:16.080 
always been a road map and a plan for
gen<00:00:13.419> 4<00:00:13.749> and<00:00:14.019> beyond<00:00:14.650> so<00:00:15.070> I<00:00:15.369> like<00:00:15.610> to<00:00:15.639> think<00:00:15.879> of

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
gen 4 and beyond so I like to think of

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.779 
gen 4 and beyond so I like to think of
frostbite<00:00:16.570> as<00:00:16.929> an<00:00:17.140> evolutionary<00:00:17.949> process<00:00:18.519> and

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:18.789 
frostbite as an evolutionary process and

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:20.849 
frostbite as an evolutionary process and
frostbite<00:00:19.179> 3<00:00:19.420> is<00:00:19.720> the<00:00:20.080> next<00:00:20.410> step<00:00:20.650> in<00:00:20.800> that

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:20.859 
frostbite 3 is the next step in that

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.519 
frostbite 3 is the next step in that
evolution<00:00:21.640> frostbite<00:00:22.539> 3<00:00:22.720> is<00:00:22.869> a<00:00:22.929> really

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
evolution frostbite 3 is a really

water react and the debris will then

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.890 
water react and the debris will then
float<00:02:44.620> on<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.400> waves<00:02:45.610> it's<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:45.970> very<00:02:46.209> very<00:02:46.660> cool

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
float on the waves it's a very very cool

dynamic engine things just happen and it

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.130 
dynamic engine things just happen and it
seems<00:02:49.930> right

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
seems right

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.110 
seems right

there's a whole slew of features in
frostbite<00:03:02.390> that<00:03:02.780> support<00:03:03.620> that<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.190> one<00:03:04.760> of

frostbite that support that and one of
the<00:03:05.030> most<00:03:05.180> important<00:03:05.660> is<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:06.260> way<00:03:06.410> a<00:03:06.680> person's

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
the most important is the way a person's

the most important is the way a person's
eyes<00:03:07.550> look<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.630> way<00:03:08.750> we<00:03:08.780> render<00:03:09.170> characters

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
eyes look the way we render characters

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.740 
eyes look the way we render characters
is<00:03:09.890> better<00:03:10.520> than<00:03:10.700> ever<00:03:10.850> before<00:03:11.240> we're<00:03:11.570> doing

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
is better than ever before we're doing

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.330 
is better than ever before we're doing
subsurface<00:03:12.230> scattering<00:03:12.470> models<00:03:13.100> we<00:03:13.220> have

subsurface scattering models we have

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.880 
subsurface scattering models we have
parallax<00:03:13.910> animation<00:03:14.750> in<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.020> iris<00:03:15.440> you'll

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
parallax animation in the iris you'll

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.310 
parallax animation in the iris you'll
notice<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.730> looks<00:03:17.000> like<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.209> real<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:17.780> you'll

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
notice it looks like a real I you'll

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.400 
notice it looks like a real I you'll
back<00:03:18.470> me<00:03:18.500> up<00:03:18.680> right<00:03:19.300> frostbite<00:03:20.300> 3<00:03:20.569> is<00:03:20.900> so<00:03:21.200> much

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
back me up right frostbite 3 is so much

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.050 
back me up right frostbite 3 is so much
more<00:03:21.590> powerful<00:03:21.860> than<00:03:22.100> an<00:03:22.220> engine<00:03:22.580> I<00:03:22.670> ever<00:03:22.819> used

before we have the frostbite team we

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.190 
before we have the frostbite team we
were<00:03:34.489> building<00:03:34.910> a<00:03:35.120> new<00:03:35.269> engine<00:03:35.660> every<00:03:36.019> time

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
were building a new engine every time

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.960 
were building a new engine every time
and<00:03:36.530> we<00:03:36.590> were<00:03:36.680> kind<00:03:36.830> of<00:03:36.950> stumbling<00:03:37.400> constantly

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
and we were kind of stumbling constantly

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.960
