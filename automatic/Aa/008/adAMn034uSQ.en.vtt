00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
little bit what we're doing is we're

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.589 
little bit what we're doing is we're
doing<00:00:26.939> cold<00:00:27.330> fusion<00:00:28.010> extensions<00:00:29.010> we're<00:00:29.369> using

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
doing cold fusion extensions we're using

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.990 
doing cold fusion extensions we're using
copper<00:00:30.599> bombs<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.260> if<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.560> look<00:00:32.550> at<00:00:32.669> copper

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
copper bombs and if you look at copper

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.330 
copper bombs and if you look at copper
under<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.210> microscope<00:00:33.890> it<00:00:34.890> looks<00:00:35.040> like<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.250> has

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
under a microscope it looks like it has

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.340 
under a microscope it looks like it has
goosebumps<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.180> it's<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.450> soft<00:00:36.690> metal<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.260> when

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
goosebumps and it's a soft metal so when

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.590 
goosebumps and it's a soft metal so when
you<00:00:37.440> mash<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.860> down<00:00:37.890> onto<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:39.090> hair<00:00:39.360> those

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
you mash it down onto the hair those

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.139 
you mash it down onto the hair those
goosebumps<00:00:39.930> create<00:00:40.440> an<00:00:40.559> airtight<00:00:40.710> seal<00:00:41.149> and

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
goosebumps create an airtight seal and

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.000 
goosebumps create an airtight seal and
copied<00:00:42.629> us<00:00:42.750> expanded<00:00:43.260> heat<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.770> when<00:00:43.860> you're

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
copied us expanded heat so when you're

a carpet before but it's the same
premise<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.970> have<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.360> heat<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.229> back<00:01:16.350> up<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
premise you have to heat it back up and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.679 
premise you have to heat it back up and
then<00:01:17.610> basically<00:01:17.939> rip<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.720> off<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.290> hair<00:01:19.530> and

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
then basically rip it off the hair and

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.910 
then basically rip it off the hair and

change<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> boss<00:01:27.450> usually<00:01:28.170> involves<00:01:28.590> heat

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
change the boss usually involves heat

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.440 
change the boss usually involves heat
and<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.340> cannot<00:01:29.640> revert<00:01:30.030> back<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.299> its

and it cannot revert back to its
original<00:01:30.630> state<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.700> have<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.970> literally

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
original state so you have to literally

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.420 
original state so you have to literally
rip<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.840> break<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.770> get<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.009> back<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
rip it break it to get it back a

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.179 
rip it break it to get it back a
chemical<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:36.270> physical<00:01:37.079> bond<00:01:37.290> all<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.890> have<00:01:38.159> to

chemical a physical bond all I have to

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.069 
chemical a physical bond all I have to
do<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.610> open<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.329> up<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.689> slide<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:39.930> right

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
do is open this up and slide it right

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.100 
do is open this up and slide it right
out

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110
