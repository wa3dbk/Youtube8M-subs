really<00:03:38.290> starting<00:03:38.530> to<00:03:38.650> tighten<00:03:38.859> up<00:03:39.069> and<00:03:39.250> look

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400

to see this on my device there's no word

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.159 
to see this on my device there's no word
on<00:03:48.910> that<00:03:49.090> yet<00:03:49.359> and<00:03:49.510> this<00:03:49.690> brings<00:03:49.930> me<00:03:49.989> to

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
on that yet and this brings me to

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.720 
on that yet and this brings me to
another<00:03:50.200> point<00:03:50.650> one<00:03:51.099> of<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.280> main<00:03:51.519> issues

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
another point one of the main issues

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.449 
another point one of the main issues
that<00:03:51.940> Android<00:03:52.449> still<00:03:52.750> has<00:03:52.959> is<00:03:53.290> updates<00:03:54.040> for

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
that Android still has is updates for

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.400 
that Android still has is updates for
older<00:03:54.760> phones<00:03:55.030> in<00:03:55.269> my<00:03:55.629> opinion<00:03:56.049> they<00:03:56.169> really

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
older phones in my opinion they really

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.599 
older phones in my opinion they really
should<00:03:56.560> have<00:03:56.650> addressed<00:03:56.829> that<00:03:57.099> before<00:03:57.370> moving

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
should have addressed that before moving

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.909 
should have addressed that before moving
forward<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.239> as<00:03:58.569> a<00:03:58.599> side<00:03:58.930> point<00:03:59.169> history

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
forward and as a side point history

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.470 
forward and as a side point history
tells<00:04:00.190> us<00:04:00.340> that<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.609> note<00:04:00.790> 4<00:04:01.000> will<00:04:01.120> probably

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
tells us that the note 4 will probably

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.599 
tells us that the note 4 will probably
