00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.250
 of each operator in this but now it's 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.250
 an excel if they notice is also this 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.990
 nextel 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:25.320
 is the edition of that and 867 that this was 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.619
 a model of 2012 that here is here says 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.919
 ferrari and reactivate the horn forward and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.710
 dysfunctions of hanging and sodium 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.620
 mate 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:40.399
 500 megapixels has ternada pixels 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.860
 here has a sensor the new drive what 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.829
 which is the next next third 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.860
 area and it comes with video call something like that 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.909
 the good thing about these is in excel they are 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.729
 of radio the only abnormal difference is 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:59.140
 this they use radio use a 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:59.140
 key that is here 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.079
 Perez is this key to click 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.320
 go from being the sound that identifies 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:13.270
 nextel and radio to radio costs a 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.659
 cent communicate you know much more 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.630
 cheap the question is that like this 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:24.100
 cell phone is that smartphone 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.159
 has a joke and all that has the system 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.149
 operative 2.1 at that time was the 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:33.159
 roll if I develop the version of 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.770
 android if you look at the technology now 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.780
 almost the messages that come to you not 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.569
 fear to almost is by whatsapp 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.429
 so if you see that a team of this 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.430
 in the temple you can find in 800 and 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.079
 800 is this one 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.680
 of nextel 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.750
 stout and it comes with 2.1 now the great 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.720
 difference of that in excel of that you 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.500
 can agree one of these sport the 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:03.520
 rate plan of this free nextel in 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:07.119
 free excel is this the one that gives you as 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.479
 being left without it but it's orange and they say 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.479
 excel 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.280
 in your chips in passing you can take 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:18.800
 air by plan and by free or with a 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.190
 Sunday type kit for third but of 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.319
 nextel this without free costs you 150 and you 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.580
 bring this one for a week what is 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.349
 limited radio this also this one of 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.550
 some way post shelf is fine 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.580
 fact 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.820
 if you notice now also account that with 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.150
 30 pesos the recharge can recharge the 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:45.140
 excel of 30 57 what is best for you 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.240
 more would be the free nextel you use when 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.240
 you want and when you do not and you can receive 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.430
 calls what is convenient is the radio if 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.590
 you use it for in externally out 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.810
 much cheaper accommodation contacts in 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.750
 plan because if you use do not use them 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.260
 those who are the data points or 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.180
 all that 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.110
 nothing will be the same you stay 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.960
 but as I think that's the way it is 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.880
 way in excel in fact if the person 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:19.340
 who spends more 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:22.640
 pay more then yes yes yes if it were for a 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.900
 example when that contract I had 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.060
 I think the contracts are made 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.570
 so that you see up 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.920
 for example, you use data that is no longer used 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.920
 of data and from wifi 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.510
 normal I think 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.730
 reinstall what is this 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.349
 free what is this whatsapp you can 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.330
 walk hungry message all that comes out 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:46.150
 cheaper and apart is radio the art 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.489
 it comes out cheaper than it is a penny for 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.190
 second and it comes out cheaper I do not imagine 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.170
 what to do 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.970
 without much evil now everything on the shelf 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.790
 economic I think a minute or two 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.280
 minutes and that what you pay to be what 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.960
 you pay this two pesos or if they are three 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.210
 minutes three pesos so 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.730
 agrees the next in our part of 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.100
 that since the radio has greater coverage 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.060
 and there is a rumor that nextel was going to 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:16.510
 disappear but did not change owner in 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.160
 2013 the news was given that in excel 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.320
 was going to change owners today is going to 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.320
 disappear but only changed from 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.330
 owner and changed the 4g network that the 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.460
 will change directly to the US and then the 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.200
 they changed here mexico that the network 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.300
 evolution 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.850
 that the other teams come and they are another 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.030
 kind of chip yes yes if you guys want 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.860
 this buy this equipment can you 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.960
 buy in tennis from this 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.900
 model on but already the models 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:48.580
 of 2014 have their own chip with their 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:51.760
 own plan is fashion 30 but it is 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.280

 more use to call you lest by 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.110
 radios tributes by radio is going to be 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.510
 much cheaper if you use it by call 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.300
 this work you go in this free give you 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.180
 a normal cell phone and apart they had your 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.570
 radio now how to radio here to the 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.570
 hour d 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.400
 here it appears 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.100
 when you are digital for example a 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:30.620
 radio the dante is identified by several 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.620
 numbers starts with what this album is 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.810
 asterisk an example 26 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:51.900
 more or less so it is used of is 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:55.199
 asterisk an example 26 16 25 to 6 x 58 and 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.750
 asterisk 11 42 and does the pressure and 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:01.259
 will appear here the logo of a radio and 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:04.949
 they already give the reality to a key and they 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:08.160
 send one with the beep to the excel 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:11.190
 have the other person and that is accepted 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.400
 the radio communication already returns you 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:17.910
 beep and you this one you talk for example 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.460
 if they speak to you this one already believes you the 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.410
 key the fib presses them a key and already 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.870
 he answers and if that's how it works it's the 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.220
 time because to have and stay the same I have 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.740
 a story now how does this work 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:32.130
 thing but so acidity 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.960
 in fact it was very good because 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:37.960
 sure the matter of two days systems 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.720
 aside then and the radio is easier 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.569
 that makes us communicate what is this 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.990
 of these equipment is to take out side from the 

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:48.490
 true advantage and also this know 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.770
 what are the big 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.919
 companies for example in excel is for 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:56.530
 contract but if you buy the cell phone 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:58.780
 in a diary and it's from there's area 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:01.419
 returns if it's not since years ago 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:04.240
 for example you do not care 2002 or you 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:07.210
 buy the kinder the chip nextel book 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:10.810
 which is like the friend that and that already 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:13.630
 you have it and created the refills are 30 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:15.889
 57 and they last you for about two months 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.259
 and you do not use it 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:20.030
 that is, if you do not use that they are more than 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:22.520
 receive calls and all that be use 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.889
 It can last you maximum I think that 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.419
 15 days or depends on how you are with the 

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:28.870
 radio but it's a big advantage that has 

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:28.870
 radio 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.080
 and so any doubt you have of the 

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:36.500
 excel 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.669
 Now he is going to answer all his 

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.060
 comments 

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:40.060
 see you
