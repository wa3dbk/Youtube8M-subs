00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
give some delineation to give some idea

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.160 
give some delineation to give some idea
how<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.440> shape<00:00:43.829> over<00:00:44.190> there<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:45.270> four-vector

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
how to shape over there and four-vector

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.270 
how to shape over there and four-vector
using<00:00:47.239> this<00:00:48.239> little<00:00:48.480> thing<00:00:49.100> because<00:00:50.100> I

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
using this little thing because I

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.310 
using this little thing because I
actually<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.180> got<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.480> standing<00:00:51.899> over<00:00:52.170> here

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
actually I got it standing over here

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.389 
actually I got it standing over here
from<00:00:52.649> from<00:00:53.219> another<00:00:53.430> shoot<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:55.039> so<00:00:56.039> I'm<00:00:56.190> going

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
from from another shoot and so I'm going

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.580 
from from another shoot and so I'm going
I'm<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:57.059> going<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.390> use<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.350> speed

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
I'm just going to use it it's a speed

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.950 
I'm just going to use it it's a speed
light<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:58.920> well<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.520> will<00:00:59.730> set<00:00:59.940> it<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.270> slave

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
light as well so I will set it to slave

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.240 
light as well so I will set it to slave
and<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:02.010> got<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.760> little<00:01:03.750> soft<00:01:03.960> box<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.470> top<00:01:04.680> so

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
and it got a little soft box on top so

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.950 
and it got a little soft box on top so
since<00:01:05.489> light<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.729> coming<00:01:06.090> from<00:01:06.299> behind<00:01:06.630> and

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
since light is coming from behind and

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.840 
since light is coming from behind and
should<00:01:07.140> show<00:01:07.380> delineation<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.280> don't<00:01:08.700> need

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
should show delineation I don't need

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.030 
should show delineation I don't need
this<00:01:08.939> big<00:01:09.240> soft<00:01:09.540> box<00:01:09.780> over<00:01:10.080> there<00:01:10.200> even<00:01:10.830> though

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
this big soft box over there even though

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.039 
this big soft box over there even though
it<00:01:11.340> would<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.549> good<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:12.030> don't<00:01:12.360> have<00:01:12.540> one<00:01:12.780> over

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
it would be good but don't have one over

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.580 
it would be good but don't have one over
here<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.799> just<00:01:14.540> will<00:01:15.540> attach<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.110> this

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
here you just will attach it like this

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.249 
here you just will attach it like this
so<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.040> coming<00:01:17.340> from<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.640> low<00:01:18.210> angle<00:01:21.110> using<00:01:22.110> a

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
so it's coming from a low angle using a

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.160 
so it's coming from a low angle using a
multi<00:01:22.950> clamp<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.670> do<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.450> thing<00:01:25.020> over

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
multi clamp to do this this thing over

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.140 
multi clamp to do this this thing over
here<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.560> multi<00:01:25.890> clamp<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.759> I'm<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
here it's a multi clamp so I'm going to

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.850 
here it's a multi clamp so I'm going to
place<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.509> somewhere<00:01:27.689> over<00:01:28.140> there<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.680> it's

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
place it somewhere over there so it's

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.910 
place it somewhere over there so it's
coming<00:01:29.250> between<00:01:29.759> her<00:01:29.909> legs<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.350> Tahoe<00:01:31.350> that's

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
coming between her legs and Tahoe that's

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:47.580 
coming between her legs and Tahoe that's
a<00:01:32.070> good<00:01:32.220> effect<00:01:32.549> let's<00:01:33.000> see<00:01:33.210> let's<00:01:33.450> try<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.750> out

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.410
