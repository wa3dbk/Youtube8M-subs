so<00:00:07.279> the<00:00:07.370> jet<00:00:07.550> obviously<00:00:08.059> very<00:00:08.420> highly<00:00:08.960> proud

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
so the jet obviously very highly proud

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.470 
so the jet obviously very highly proud
aircraft<00:00:09.590> and<00:00:09.770> very<00:00:10.190> maneuverable<00:00:10.639> but<00:00:10.820> still

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
aircraft and very maneuverable but still

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.759 
aircraft and very maneuverable but still
even<00:00:11.690> in<00:00:11.780> the<00:00:11.840> temperatures<00:00:12.230> of<00:00:12.349> the<00:00:12.500> other

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
even in the temperatures of the other

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.310 
even in the temperatures of the other
day<00:00:12.889> at<00:00:12.950> Waddington<00:00:13.309> it's<00:00:13.429> still<00:00:13.610> fairly

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 
day at Waddington it's still fairly

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.299 
day at Waddington it's still fairly
tricky<00:00:15.320> maneuver<00:00:15.679> to<00:00:15.769> get<00:00:15.860> a<00:00:15.920> leap<00:00:16.040> and<00:00:16.189> take

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
tricky maneuver to get a leap and take

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.679 
tricky maneuver to get a leap and take
off<00:00:16.430> out<00:00:16.580> of<00:00:16.730> it<00:00:16.849> just<00:00:16.970> because<00:00:17.240> the<00:00:17.360> weight<00:00:17.540> of

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
off out of it just because the weight of

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.900 
off out of it just because the weight of
the<00:00:17.779> aircraft<00:00:17.900> we've<00:00:18.380> got<00:00:18.710> about<00:00:18.920> five<00:00:19.700> and<00:00:19.880> a

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
the aircraft we've got about five and a

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.910 
the aircraft we've got about five and a
half<00:00:19.939> tonnes<00:00:20.300> of<00:00:20.420> fuel<00:00:20.570> in<00:00:20.750> there<00:00:20.930> in<00:00:21.380> a<00:00:21.470> 12-ton

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
half tonnes of fuel in there in a 12-ton

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.029 
half tonnes of fuel in there in a 12-ton
jet<00:00:22.220> so<00:00:22.400> that's<00:00:23.359> what<00:00:23.539> 17<00:00:23.930> 17<00:00:24.650> odd<00:00:24.740> tonnes<00:00:24.980> of

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
jet so that's what 17 17 odd tonnes of

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.830 
jet so that's what 17 17 odd tonnes of
aeroplanes<00:00:25.400> to<00:00:25.880> get<00:00:26.000> around<00:00:26.150> the<00:00:26.270> sky<00:00:26.449> with

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
aeroplanes to get around the sky with

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.570 
aeroplanes to get around the sky with
40,000<00:00:27.439> pounds<00:00:27.650> of<00:00:27.740> thrust<00:00:27.830> going<00:00:28.279> vertically

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
40,000 pounds of thrust going vertically

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.400 
40,000 pounds of thrust going vertically
up<00:00:28.760> so<00:00:29.029> I'm<00:00:29.510> just<00:00:29.689> kicking<00:00:29.810> off<00:00:30.019> there<00:00:30.230> to<00:00:30.349> the

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
up so I'm just kicking off there to the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.080 
up so I'm just kicking off there to the
left-hand<00:00:30.740> side<00:00:30.949> because<00:00:31.369> the<00:00:31.580> display<00:00:31.939> line

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
left-hand side because the display line

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.150 
left-hand side because the display line
at<00:00:32.210> Waddington<00:00:32.570> is<00:00:32.689> actually<00:00:32.960> further<00:00:33.230> to<00:00:34.010> the

at Waddington is actually further to the
biscuit<00:00:35.150> that's<00:00:35.239> right<00:00:35.449> further<00:00:35.750> to<00:00:35.900> the<00:00:36.050> east

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
biscuit that's right further to the east

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.530 
biscuit that's right further to the east
than<00:00:37.219> the<00:00:37.399> runway<00:00:37.640> itself<00:00:37.880> using<00:00:38.180> it<00:00:38.270> to<00:00:38.329> kick

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
than the runway itself using it to kick

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.240 
than the runway itself using it to kick
off<00:00:38.719> get<00:00:39.170> out<00:00:39.290> the<00:00:39.380> way<00:00:39.500> of<00:00:39.590> it<00:00:39.710> to<00:00:39.829> get<00:00:40.130> onto

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
off get out the way of it to get onto

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.979 
off get out the way of it to get onto
the<00:00:40.430> line<00:00:40.550> it's<00:00:41.149> actually<00:00:41.239> just<00:00:41.630> about<00:00:41.719> where

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
the line it's actually just about where

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.170 
the line it's actually just about where
the<00:00:42.020> taxiway<00:00:42.500> is<00:00:42.530> you<00:00:42.770> see<00:00:43.040> those<00:00:43.190> you<00:00:43.309> up<00:00:43.489> so

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
the taxiway is you see those you up so

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.119 
the taxiway is you see those you up so
coming<00:00:44.570> over<00:00:44.719> the<00:00:44.809> top<00:00:44.960> of<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.230> you<00:00:45.980> might

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
coming over the top of the you might

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.889 
coming over the top of the you might
hear<00:00:46.250> on<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:46.399> other<00:00:46.520> tape<00:00:46.730> it's<00:00:47.420> got<00:00:47.629> some

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
hear on the other tape it's got some

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.270 
hear on the other tape it's got some
speedily<00:00:48.440> recover<00:00:48.739> coming<00:00:49.010> in<00:00:49.100> from<00:00:49.219> the

speedily recover coming in from the

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.560 
speedily recover coming in from the
airplane<00:00:49.550> itself<00:00:49.789> it's<00:00:50.059> just<00:00:50.090> warning<00:00:50.420> me

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
airplane itself it's just warning me

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.940 
airplane itself it's just warning me
that<00:00:50.690> I'm<00:00:50.780> coming<00:00:50.930> down<00:00:51.170> towards<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:51.800> lower

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
that I'm coming down towards the lower

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.959 
that I'm coming down towards the lower
speed<00:00:52.190> boundary<00:00:54.219> but<00:00:55.219> quite<00:00:55.520> happily<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:55.850> jet

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
speed boundary but quite happily the jet

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.790 
speed boundary but quite happily the jet
goes<00:00:56.120> over<00:00:56.329> top<00:00:56.510> of<00:00:56.539> my<00:00:56.690> nostril<00:00:57.079> and<00:00:57.559> back

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
goes over top of my nostril and back

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.889 
goes over top of my nostril and back
down<00:00:58.039> and<00:00:58.730> actually<00:00:59.000> levels<00:00:59.420> off<00:00:59.510> at<00:00:59.600> about<00:00:59.870> a

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
down and actually levels off at about a

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.420 
down and actually levels off at about a
thousand<00:01:00.440> feet<00:01:00.469> coming<00:01:00.890> off<00:01:00.980> the<00:01:01.070> loop<00:01:01.219> so<00:01:01.340> you

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
thousand feet coming off the loop so you

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.680 
thousand feet coming off the loop so you
gain<00:01:01.670> a<00:01:01.699> thousand<00:01:02.149> feet<00:01:02.270> in<00:01:02.390> that<00:01:02.449> maneuver

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
gain a thousand feet in that maneuver

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.090 
gain a thousand feet in that maneuver
which<00:01:02.960> is<00:01:03.079> just<00:01:03.620> shows<00:01:03.800> you<00:01:03.890> how<00:01:03.980> much

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
which is just shows you how much

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.100 
which is just shows you how much
performance<00:01:04.699> here<00:01:04.879> eight<00:01:05.089> o'clock<00:01:05.270> coming

performance here eight o'clock coming

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.359 
performance here eight o'clock coming
straight<00:01:06.320> towards<00:01:06.710> now<00:01:06.800> a<00:01:06.830> judgment<00:01:07.280> call

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
straight towards now a judgment call

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.160 
straight towards now a judgment call
really<00:01:07.610> as<00:01:07.670> though<00:01:07.880> how<00:01:08.450> close<00:01:08.750> to<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:08.960> line<00:01:09.140> I

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
really as though how close to the line I

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.440 
really as though how close to the line I
get<00:01:09.439> to<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:09.619> -<00:01:09.710> 30<00:01:09.920> metre<00:01:10.130> line<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:10.580> then<00:01:11.330> to

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
get to the - 30 metre line and then to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.170 
get to the - 30 metre line and then to

then turn back on to the 45 axis on the

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.630 
then turn back on to the 45 axis on the
way<00:01:14.330> out<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.950> runway<00:01:16.250> then<00:01:16.430> goes<00:01:16.610> straight

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
way out the runway then goes straight

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.600 
way out the runway then goes straight

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
12 units of alpha an angled attack which

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.620 
12 units of alpha an angled attack which
