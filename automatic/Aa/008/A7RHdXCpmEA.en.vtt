they're all going to be individual
strips<00:02:11.680> it's<00:02:11.980> not<00:02:12.220> going<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.459> clash<00:02:12.849> and<00:02:13.150> it's

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.800 

okay<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:18.310> basically<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:19.090> have<00:02:19.269> it<00:02:19.390> measured

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
okay so basically you have it measured

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.020 
okay so basically you have it measured
already<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.409> this<00:02:20.590> is<00:02:20.769> about<00:02:21.010> 14<00:02:21.459> inches<00:02:21.549> long

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
already and this is about 14 inches long

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.670 
already and this is about 14 inches long
and<00:02:22.239> so<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:22.780> want<00:02:22.959> to<00:02:22.989> make<00:02:23.080> sure<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:23.319> all<00:02:23.650> my

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
and so I want to make sure that all my

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.449 
and so I want to make sure that all my
strips<00:02:24.430> are<00:02:24.670> at<00:02:24.849> least<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.750> same<00:02:26.459> length

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
strips are at least the same length

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.550 
strips are at least the same length
either<00:02:27.790> 13<00:02:28.420> 14<00:02:28.780> inches<00:02:29.200> because<00:02:29.379> they're

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
either 13 14 inches because they're

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.979 
either 13 14 inches because they're
going<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.769> get<00:02:29.830> tied<00:02:30.159> and<00:02:30.519> look<00:02:30.670> like<00:02:30.819> that<00:02:31.030> and

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
going to get tied and look like that and

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.050 
going to get tied and look like that and
then<00:02:32.080> grab<00:02:32.230> your<00:02:32.290> Fisk<00:02:32.709> are<00:02:32.950> your<00:02:33.340> blade<00:02:33.760> or

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
then grab your Fisk are your blade or

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.569 
then grab your Fisk are your blade or
whatever<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:35.560> then<00:02:36.010> you're<00:02:36.159> just<00:02:36.190> going<00:02:36.489> to

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
whatever and then you're just going to

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.339 
whatever and then you're just going to
slice<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.420> I'm<00:02:37.510> going<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:37.720> do<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:37.959> about<00:02:38.049> an

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
slice it so I'm going to do it about an

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.199 
slice it so I'm going to do it about an
inch<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.769> a<00:02:38.890> half<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.579> I'm<00:02:39.670> able<00:02:39.909> to<00:02:40.030> measure

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
inch and a half and I'm able to measure

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.190 
inch and a half and I'm able to measure
it<00:02:40.360> on<00:02:40.599> this<00:02:40.810> grid<00:02:41.140> here<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.560> when<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.340> cut

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
it on this grid here and when you cut

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.410 
it on this grid here and when you cut
and<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.260> go<00:02:44.409> one<00:02:44.620> direction<00:02:44.739> you<00:02:45.610> see<00:02:45.819> how<00:02:46.000> fast

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
and I go one direction you see how fast

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.500 
and I go one direction you see how fast
that<00:02:46.629> it<00:02:46.870> this<00:02:47.500> is<00:02:47.709> so<00:02:47.950> much<00:02:48.099> better<00:02:48.510> then

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
that it this is so much better then

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.809 
that it this is so much better then
scissors<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.980> pull<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.340> out<00:02:51.519> so<00:02:51.790> you

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
scissors and you pull it out so you

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.240 
scissors and you pull it out so you
don't<00:02:51.940> cut<00:02:52.329> that<00:02:52.569> again<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:56.590> didn't<00:02:56.950> get<00:02:57.129> it

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
don't cut that again it didn't get it

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.220 
don't cut that again it didn't get it
well<00:02:57.430> then<00:02:57.700> you<00:02:57.819> just<00:02:57.849> splice<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:59.019> one<00:02:59.109> more

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
well then you just splice it one more

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.349 
well then you just splice it one more
time<00:02:59.440> but<00:03:00.220> then<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:00.459> have<00:03:00.670> your<00:03:00.700> strips<00:03:01.150> and

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
time but then you have your strips and

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.160 
time but then you have your strips and
then<00:03:01.390> these<00:03:01.629> are<00:03:01.799> since<00:03:02.799> this<00:03:02.950> is<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.159> end

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
then these are since this is the end

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.539 
then these are since this is the end
part<00:03:05.170> so<00:03:05.470> I'm<00:03:05.560> just<00:03:05.709> going<00:03:05.829> to<00:03:05.890> slice<00:03:06.250> those

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
part so I'm just going to slice those

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.849 
part so I'm just going to slice those
right<00:03:06.819> now<00:03:06.849> but<00:03:07.750> I<00:03:07.780> will<00:03:07.959> end<00:03:08.230> up<00:03:08.379> with<00:03:08.530> several

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
right now but I will end up with several

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.860 
right now but I will end up with several
though<00:03:09.280> so<00:03:09.519> I'm<00:03:09.670> just<00:03:09.790> going<00:03:09.909> to<00:03:09.970> put<00:03:10.239> these<00:03:10.450> to

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
though so I'm just going to put these to

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.720 
though so I'm just going to put these to
the<00:03:10.959> side<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.500> then<00:03:11.980> I'll<00:03:12.099> slice<00:03:12.400> them<00:03:12.640> all

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
the side and then I'll slice them all

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.910 
the side and then I'll slice them all
together<00:03:12.940> but<00:03:13.720> yep<00:03:13.930> that's<00:03:14.230> basically<00:03:14.650> what

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
together but yep that's basically what

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.250 
together but yep that's basically what
you<00:03:15.069> do<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:16.030> have<00:03:16.299> your<00:03:16.450> four<00:03:16.780> favorite

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
you do you have your four favorite

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.180 
you do you have your four favorite
patterns<00:03:17.819> and<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:21.040> just<00:03:22.019> slice<00:03:23.019> it<00:03:23.049> yay<00:03:23.560> and

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
patterns and you just slice it yay and

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.280 
patterns and you just slice it yay and
then<00:03:24.760> they<00:03:24.910> don't<00:03:25.060> have<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.329> be<00:03:25.419> perfect<00:03:28.290> but

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
then they don't have to be perfect but

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.220 
then they don't have to be perfect but
these<00:03:29.590> are<00:03:29.829> good<00:03:30.040> side

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.900 

so<00:03:36.230> here<00:03:36.440> comes<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.770> easy<00:03:36.830> part<00:03:37.400> believe<00:03:37.790> it

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
so here comes the easy part believe it

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.030 
so here comes the easy part believe it
or<00:03:38.030> not<00:03:38.150> what<00:03:38.750> you<00:03:38.870> want<00:03:39.020> to<00:03:39.080> do<00:03:39.260> is<00:03:39.560> just<00:03:39.590> tie

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
or not what you want to do is just tie

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.130 
or not what you want to do is just tie
your<00:03:40.220> strips<00:03:40.550> of<00:03:40.700> ribbon<00:03:40.850> to<00:03:41.300> your<00:03:41.510> twine<00:03:41.900> or

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
your strips of ribbon to your twine or

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.890 
your strips of ribbon to your twine or
rope<00:03:42.560> and<00:03:42.830> just<00:03:43.150> alternate<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.330> colors<00:03:44.360> if

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
rope and just alternate the colors if

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.390 
rope and just alternate the colors if
it's<00:03:45.110> going<00:03:45.230> to<00:03:45.290> be<00:03:45.410> up<00:03:45.530> high<00:03:45.740> then<00:03:46.100> you<00:03:46.220> want

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
it's going to be up high then you want
