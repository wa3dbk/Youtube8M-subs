00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 people create 198 sales here with the 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.059
 review of a 2014 factor 2 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.429
 look at the doll that refactured him 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.170
 one was cardboard here and it beckons you 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.120
 normal goes backwards and also a lot 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.130
 better as I commented these and very 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.590
 quick to be able to tell you these little ones 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.060
 things are worth so good I'm going to how I'm going 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.400
 to do here a small network about five 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.130
 minutes something like that I temper with him is 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.439
 with the mclaren a turn is integrated today 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.850
 I am going to comment my opinion and what in 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.649
 he seems value first of all you will have in 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.570
 what will you have in the description of the channel 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.309
 of baptisms where you have a tutorial 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.690
 to download the rest to me he taught me 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.879
 he personally and I got on very well with 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.800
 he was going I feel really going to be 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.300
 flames circuits so you'll have 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.520
 your face in the description and from here 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.200
 thank you very much víctor so good 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.960
 notice now that we are going to go through this 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.940
 curve I hope your can get to see 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.969
 look at this bet, look how it is 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.530
 puts a bit more black a piece that more 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.120
 it warms vale and fixed also the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.130
 bottom part to the right that appears 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.200
 that 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.440
 from what area it heats up better 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.110
 It is also much more complex in my 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.630
 opinion that other formula1 heat of 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.670
 I cast one does not know why the truth but 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.040
 that yes that changes enough besides the 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.590
 eight marches yes it shows a little the 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.620
 change as you can see there are eight with the drs 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.000
 is implemented is worth us here 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.190
 it comes a little outside I did not remember 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.040
 that was the drs worth look here I've 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.540
 open and good you have to close it for 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.220
 that curve because if it does not go but 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.200
 notice now I open it again and the 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.360
 truth is that with and without network will be 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.280
 blocked tape that is reached is 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.330
 completely different very different 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.850
 I would say 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.920
 because the psuv is like 20 kilometers 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.580
 little more or less valdés father me 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.710
 went from 310 to 325 post here I've 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.650
 put in slow motion so you can see that 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.270
 the drs is open, it is valid for you to see 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.700
 that opens because in that factor 1 and I 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.280
 He passed that would not open it picked yes 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.810
 more speed but it would not come out that good 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.300
 let's do with the dengra review 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.190
 graphically I think it's great 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.700
 start for example the detail this of the 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.799
 wheel 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.539
 I have removed the mirrors from above 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.120
 because if not to study much more 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.610
 but then, I recommend a 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.560
 more complicated game with physics than me 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.450
 It seems to mothers who seem more real 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.220
 as I have done the eight more are made 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.620
 that changed a lot because it was doing the 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.360
 acceleration when it comes to accelerating very 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.940
 fast and get off is very fast from gears 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.260
 they change a lot about carrying 78 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.420
 marches that you press where already but 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.000
 change quite then I had to be 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.520
 Now talking with bayliss more and I've 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.680
 said that when you reach the goal 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.750
 the one that gives you the metal signal that is a 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.050
 uncle with the flag by the way fixos 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.150
 here that there are three positions to read that 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.540
 according to time said babies man is like that in 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.239
 the reality I the truth 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.549
 I did not know the truth but he told me he 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.019
 that reality is like this three positions 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.379
 that we set much more network in my opinion 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.510
 I have opened the drs and I was left 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.890
 very much the car here as always 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.760
 close on this curve and I continue to 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.950
 go ahead 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.989
 then you will have a test I think it is not and 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.370
 I think it would be the next round that 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.290
 what goes to the car with the duty of 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.480
 sexual then I also want something else 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.280
 that I like that is that when you break a 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.900
 thing for example if it breaks 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.389
 about employment and yes you notice the 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.340
 difference you can earn a little more than 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:21.099
 peak speed but lose a bit of 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.500
 garrido more and not getting the truth is 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.689
 that blocks so I tried but 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.370
 I have not managed to block but yes 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:28.900
 once I've blocked and so on 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.090
 that stays a good plane on the wheel 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.849
 ok and the car I think it does vibrate a 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.870
 little when you catch a piano that 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.659
 you will have seen especially at the beginning 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.209
 when I followed him to catch and when 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:42.879
 you take a piano the fiber car a lot and it 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.040
 note is valid and the sound seems to me 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.379
 pretty good 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.209
 and I start very good physics the 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.980
 only thing that you have that in my opinion 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.430
 rather more crappy to install than 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.060
 others 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.400
 so go to the egypt channel of by this 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.690
 man who has it all right there and 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.030
 since you will see 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.030
 so good the truth is that it's a 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.670
 juezo department and then you can know 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.930
 then try and do some race and 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.670
 others to climb on the channel 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.400
 and then and then, then, you try 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.140
 championship action something natural 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.459
 I opened the df 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.590
 and then close so it 's the next 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.840
 return to bolivia had one less round 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.850
 recorded but good was also done with 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.000
 the beef and it goes a lot more you back 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.560
 of course nike is because currently 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 to our such as you have seen 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.320
 They are three positions 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.810
 I have not verified what varies between 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.169
 every position if I do not 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.270
 also the options of 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.029
 to avoid set-ups as they change 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.520
 quite because for example in the 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:45.229
 aerodynamic in me you put 20 30 such a 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.389
 they give them in degrees between me here has me 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:51.259
 put almost to the maximum of the forward 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:54.370
 a question 43 degrees and the maximum 45 and 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:56.350
 back 69 degrees that is the maximum 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.120
 and well then also because there is more 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.160
 options which seems to me very badly 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.949
 it's only in English and I do not know 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.479
 practically no English so 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.580
 good to go saying goodbye now so 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.169
 I will leave now with the sound at the top of 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.760
 car so you can listen to it 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.580
 perfectly well and judge yourselves 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.060
 same so even the same people 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.060
 goodbye
