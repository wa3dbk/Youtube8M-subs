00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
noticing some issues with the speeds

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.110 
noticing some issues with the speeds
that<00:00:09.599> i<00:00:09.750> was<00:00:09.870> getting<00:00:10.170> i<00:00:10.710> do<00:00:11.370> live<00:00:11.610> in<00:00:11.639> Chicago

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.850 
that i was getting i do live in Chicago
when<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.269> live<00:00:12.480> actually<00:00:12.809> about<00:00:12.990> half<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.710> mile

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
when I live actually about half a mile

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.589 
when I live actually about half a mile
away<00:00:14.009> from<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.370> 4g<00:00:14.910> tower<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.299> was<00:00:15.389> recently

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
away from a 4g tower that was recently

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.529 
away from a 4g tower that was recently
put<00:00:15.960> up<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.289> area<00:00:17.090> so<00:00:18.090> it's<00:00:18.330> kind<00:00:18.480> of

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
put up in the area so it's kind of

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.990 
put up in the area so it's kind of
excited<00:00:19.020> before<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.320> got<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.800> see<00:00:20.010> what<00:00:20.609> type

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
excited before I got it to see what type

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.560 
excited before I got it to see what type
of<00:00:21.029> speeds<00:00:21.390> are<00:00:21.539> beginning<00:00:23.180> but<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.240> noticed

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
of speeds are beginning but I noticed

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.140 
of speeds are beginning but I noticed
when<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.689> got<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.170> my<00:00:25.680> 3g<00:00:26.279> speeds<00:00:26.609> were<00:00:26.820> actually

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
when I got it my 3g speeds were actually

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.210 
when I got it my 3g speeds were actually
quicker<00:00:27.390> than<00:00:27.660> my<00:00:28.529> speeds<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.099> was

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
quicker than my speeds that I was

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.849 
quicker than my speeds that I was
getting<00:00:29.429> when<00:00:29.490> i<00:00:29.580> was<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:29.730> 4g<00:00:30.500> so<00:00:31.500> I'm<00:00:31.590> gonna<00:00:31.679> do

download and I'll still not the regime
and<00:01:14.270> that's<00:01:15.170> uploading<00:01:15.770> right<00:01:15.890> now<00:01:16.600> so<00:01:17.600> we

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
and that's uploading right now so we

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.590 
and that's uploading right now so we
gotta<00:01:17.870> download<00:01:18.050> speed<00:01:18.530> of<00:01:18.770> 14<00:01:19.640> 29<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:20.510> an

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
gotta download speed of 14 29 and an

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.440 
gotta download speed of 14 29 and an
upload<00:01:20.960> speed<00:01:21.200> of<00:01:21.290> 60<00:01:21.680> 2<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.250> that's<00:01:23.240> on<00:01:23.420> 3g<00:01:25.450> so

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
upload speed of 60 2 and that's on 3g so

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.730 
upload speed of 60 2 and that's on 3g so
I'm<00:01:26.630> going<00:01:26.690> to<00:01:26.810> switch<00:01:26.960> over<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.790> 4G<00:01:29.680> see<00:01:30.680> you

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
I'm going to switch over to 4G see you

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.969 
I'm going to switch over to 4G see you
guys<00:01:30.890> can<00:01:31.100> see<00:01:31.310> that<00:01:32.619> so<00:01:33.619> you<00:01:33.710> got<00:01:33.860> a<00:01:33.890> 4g<00:01:35.979> high

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
guys can see that so you got a 4g high

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:52.550 
guys can see that so you got a 4g high
power<00:01:37.310> up

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.100 

takes<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.310> couple<00:01:53.490> seconds<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.180> power<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
takes a couple seconds to power on the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.680 
takes a couple seconds to power on the
radio<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:56.479> excuse<00:01:57.479> that

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.180 

alright<00:02:01.410> so<00:02:01.620> it<00:02:02.610> toggles<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.920> it's<00:02:04.920> going<00:02:05.130> to

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
alright so it toggles on it's going to

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:13.060 
alright so it toggles on it's going to
switch<00:02:05.400> over<00:02:05.550> right<00:02:05.880> now<00:02:05.910> from<00:02:06.180> 3g<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.660> 4g

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.870 

there<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.160> go<00:02:14.420> so<00:02:15.420> before<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:16.550> go<00:02:17.550> back<00:02:17.730> to

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
there you go so before you go back to

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.240 
there you go so before you go back to
the<00:02:18.000> appt<00:02:21.950> be<00:02:22.950> test

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
the appt be test

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.660 
the appt be test
then<00:02:25.180> I'm<00:02:25.300> forging<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.740> I'm<00:02:27.190> going<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.370> rerun

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
then I'm forging and I'm going to rerun

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:35.750 
then I'm forging and I'm going to rerun
the<00:02:27.790> test<00:02:28.740> and<00:02:29.740> see<00:02:30.370> what<00:02:31.030> happens

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.640

was peeking sa like 700 on the download

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.809 
was peeking sa like 700 on the download
and<00:02:50.629> unless<00:02:50.959> you<00:02:51.079> really<00:02:51.200> get<00:02:51.409> problem<00:02:53.500> 242<00:02:54.819> so

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
and unless you really get problem 242 so

and unless you really get problem 242 so
in<00:02:55.939> this<00:02:56.060> instance<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.780> upload<00:02:57.170> speed<00:02:57.200> was

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
in this instance the upload speed was

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.140 
in this instance the upload speed was
quick<00:02:59.239> round<00:02:59.510> four<00:02:59.720> on<00:02:59.959> 3g<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.500> 4g<00:03:01.030> but<00:03:02.030> the

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
quick round four on 3g and 4g but the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.289 
quick round four on 3g and 4g but the
download<00:03:02.450> speeds<00:03:02.689> were<00:03:02.930> obviously<00:03:03.349> better<00:03:04.299> it

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
download speeds were obviously better it

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:06.520 
download speeds were obviously better it
could<00:03:05.420> have<00:03:05.540> been<00:03:05.689> the<00:03:05.930> area<00:03:06.200> in<00:03:06.260> my<00:03:06.349> house

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
could have been the area in my house

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.289 
could have been the area in my house
that<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:06.799> was<00:03:06.980> in<00:03:07.129> yesterday<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.819> gave<00:03:08.030> me<00:03:08.060> the

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
that I was in yesterday that gave me the

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.020 
that I was in yesterday that gave me the
issue<00:03:10.930> actually<00:03:11.930> I'm<00:03:12.019> not<00:03:12.139> sure<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.859> know

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
issue actually I'm not sure you know

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.399 
issue actually I'm not sure you know
what<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.150> thing<00:03:14.329> is<00:03:14.389> but<00:03:14.750> i<00:03:14.900> guess<00:03:15.109> i'll<00:03:15.260> run

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
what the thing is but i guess i'll run

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:31.550 
what the thing is but i guess i'll run
it<00:03:15.530> again<00:03:16.120> just<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:17.239> uh

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:43.270 

all<00:03:32.099> right<00:03:32.310> so<00:03:32.670> since<00:03:33.480> 730<00:03:34.370> still<00:03:35.370> forging<00:03:41.810> 176

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
all right so since 730 still forging 176

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.250 
all right so since 730 still forging 176
so<00:03:44.280> that<00:03:44.550> this<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:44.849> on<00:03:44.970> for<00:03:45.239> gene<00:03:45.480> 730<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.680> 176

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
so that this is on for gene 730 and 176

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.720 
so that this is on for gene 730 and 176
that<00:03:49.260> inconsistency<00:03:49.920> right<00:03:50.220> there<00:03:50.430> is<00:03:50.550> kind

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
that inconsistency right there is kind

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.120 
that inconsistency right there is kind
of<00:03:50.880> a<00:03:51.090> pain<00:03:51.810> in<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:51.959> ass<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.500> be<00:03:52.769> honest<00:03:53.010> with

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
of a pain in the ass to be honest with

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.460 
of a pain in the ass to be honest with
you<00:03:53.280> i<00:03:54.290> guess<00:03:55.290> i'll<00:03:55.440> switch<00:03:55.620> over<00:03:55.830> to<00:03:55.860> 3g<00:03:56.090> we'll

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
you i guess i'll switch over to 3g we'll

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:08.559 
you i guess i'll switch over to 3g we'll
do<00:03:58.470> that<00:03:58.500> one<00:03:58.739> more<00:03:58.800> time<00:04:02.870> toggle<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:03.959> off

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:18.020 

back<00:04:09.569> on<00:04:09.750> 3g<00:04:11.360> go<00:04:12.360> back<00:04:12.599> to<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.930> app<00:04:13.080> and<00:04:16.910> go<00:04:17.910> our

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
back on 3g go back to the app and go our

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.170 
back on 3g go back to the app and go our
3g<00:04:18.389> still<00:04:19.280> again<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:20.639> I'm<00:04:20.760> going<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:20.910> run<00:04:21.060> it

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
3g still again and I'm going to run it

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:28.450 
3g still again and I'm going to run it
again

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.960 

so<00:04:29.060> this<00:04:29.210> is<00:04:29.300> not<00:04:29.419> 3g<00:04:29.840> actually<00:04:30.229> right<00:04:30.410> here<00:04:30.440> so

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:43.600 

we're<00:04:34.970> downloads<00:04:35.419> at<00:04:35.660> 1447<00:04:36.530> on<00:04:37.400> 3g<00:04:38.650> uploading

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.930 

760<00:04:44.780> on<00:04:45.780> 3g<00:04:46.409> and<00:04:46.460> we'll<00:04:47.460> run<00:04:47.610> that<00:04:47.699> one<00:04:47.849> more

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
760 on 3g and we'll run that one more

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.939 
760 on 3g and we'll run that one more
time<00:04:48.000> you<00:04:48.659> can<00:04:48.720> see<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.050> 3g<00:04:49.530> is<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.650> little<00:04:49.860> bit

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
time you can see the 3g is a little bit

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:51.830 
time you can see the 3g is a little bit
more<00:04:50.069> consistent<00:04:50.819> with<00:04:51.060> it<00:04:51.210> speeds<00:04:51.539> as

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
more consistent with it speeds as

00:04:51.840 --> 00:05:01.770 
more consistent with it speeds as
opposed<00:04:52.169> to<00:04:52.289> the<00:04:52.379> 4g

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:09.560 

so<00:05:02.350> it<00:05:02.740> actually<00:05:02.889> peaked<00:05:03.310> at<00:05:03.520> 18<00:05:04.410> 97<00:05:05.410> on<00:05:06.130> 3g<00:05:06.700> and

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:17.010 

uploading<00:05:12.690> 715<00:05:14.100> on<00:05:15.100> 3g<00:05:15.639> so<00:05:16.600> we<00:05:16.690> go<00:05:16.810> back<00:05:16.990> to

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
uploading 715 on 3g so we go back to

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.629 
uploading 715 on 3g so we go back to
these<00:05:17.200> results<00:05:17.800> so<00:05:18.010> you<00:05:18.160> can<00:05:18.340> actually<00:05:18.460> see

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
these results so you can actually see

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:27.720 
these results so you can actually see
the<00:05:19.060> past<00:05:19.480> couple<00:05:21.540> speed<00:05:22.540> tests<00:05:25.950> see<00:05:26.950> at<00:05:27.160> 50<00:05:27.400> to

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
the past couple speed tests see at 50 to

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.060 
the past couple speed tests see at 50 to
that<00:05:27.880> first<00:05:28.090> test<00:05:28.360> we<00:05:28.480> did<00:05:28.630> well<00:05:29.590> I<00:05:29.620> did<00:05:29.710> one

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
that first test we did well I did one

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.490 
that first test we did well I did one
off<00:05:30.220> you<00:05:30.669> know<00:05:30.760> off<00:05:30.910> the<00:05:30.940> camera<00:05:31.389> that<00:05:32.260> was<00:05:32.350> on

176 if you notice the pretty
inconsistent<00:06:25.090> that's<00:06:25.780> what<00:06:25.900> i<00:06:25.930> was<00:06:26.050> getting
