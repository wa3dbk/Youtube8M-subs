a<00:01:13.159> trick<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.400> making<00:01:14.909> your<00:01:15.330> yeast<00:01:17.659> get<00:01:18.659> a

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
a trick to making your yeast get a

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.940 
a trick to making your yeast get a
little<00:01:18.960> bubbly<00:01:19.759> take<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> little<00:01:21.270> bit<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.540> sugar

little bubbly take a little bit of sugar

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.710 
little bubbly take a little bit of sugar
and<00:01:23.119> put<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.270> there<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.840> feeds<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.590> yeast

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
and put in there and it feeds the yeast

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.600 
and put in there and it feeds the yeast
then<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.049> makes<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:30.110> start<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.409> really<00:01:31.680> get<00:01:32.430> all

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
then it makes it start to really get all

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.719 
then it makes it start to really get all
acting's<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.450> bubble<00:01:34.009> eat<00:01:35.009> your<00:01:35.159> water<00:01:35.400> up<00:01:35.549> a

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
acting's and bubble eat your water up a

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.660 
acting's and bubble eat your water up a
little<00:01:35.939> bit<00:01:36.350> not<00:01:37.350> super<00:01:37.829> hot<00:01:38.009> probably<00:01:38.369> about

90<00:01:39.210> degrees<00:01:39.950> now<00:01:40.950> see<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:42.390> hasn't<00:01:42.750> been<00:01:42.869> very

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
90 degrees now see it hasn't been very

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.590 
90 degrees now see it hasn't been very
long<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.470> it's<00:01:43.619> gotten<00:01:43.950> real<00:01:44.280> frothy<00:01:45.119> that's

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
what you want if it doesn't your yeast

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.020 
what you want if it doesn't your yeast
is<00:01:48.180> no<00:01:48.390> good<00:01:48.720> turn<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:49.950> just<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.490> stir<00:01:50.820> it

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
start mixing and let it mix a little bit

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:16.820 
start mixing and let it mix a little bit
on<00:02:06.539> low<00:02:07.789> turn<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.940> up<00:02:09.060> real<00:02:09.360> high<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:16.230> seems<00:02:16.680> a

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
on low turn it up real high it seems a
