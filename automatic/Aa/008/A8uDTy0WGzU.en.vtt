00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.370
 anthony hello 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.870
 today I want to tell you a little bit 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.449
 more 

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:11.809
 sometimes vysotsky 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:13.149
 I think that 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:15.099
 I haven't mastered it like pains 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.449
 something like 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.079
 looks like this is played bases 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.329
 thumb and forefinger 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.079
 playing tunes 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.079
 for example, so the buildings themselves that 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.029
 play it here 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.510
 that's easy truth 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.100
 and you can still 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.720
 occasionally 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.720
 index finger not only to play 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.010
 Well, the faster the more similar 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.010
 turns royal Vysotsky 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.870
 song here 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.500
 today we begin 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.700
 in a statement 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.870
 only in appearance with both 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.590
 he recalled what was 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.570
 besides the roads the line was not called on 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.370
 interrogation 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.890
 with myself 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.040
 does not seem to be true 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.950
 This is for example such here before you 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.440
 Elementary, that is, it is played with large bases 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.020
 finger forefinger is played 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.010
 melodies 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.010
 can be like this 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.610
 I'll die 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.530
 we will increase attack 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.020
 this kind 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.540
 went down 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.090
 we are happy 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.230
 seeing in this fight 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.630
 played at the same time 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.809
 and melody 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:11.359
 that is, it turns out 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:13.339
 in which the bomb is so nice to play only 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:14.580
 flies flies 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.580
 he says new brand coca cola 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.429
 so the player is better after all 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:28.229
 vysotsky not wilderness question about the experience of a slave 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.099
 he wants to marry 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.139
 and that's just started being controlled 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:46.329
 tune with your index finger and speak 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.909
 vary don't quit day being played 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.909
 don't smell not just in the same rhythm for example 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:59.989
 can not be changed on the water day verbatim not 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.989
 only 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:06.369
 and the rest is only in training 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:07.949
 workout 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:10.949
