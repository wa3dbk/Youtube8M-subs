00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.290
 Hello, one of my subscribers 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.929
 asked to do a more detailed analysis 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.630
 on the band gas band song the night before 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.940
 merry christmas 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.910
 okay do first what you want 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.779
 say first you need to look 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:27.449
 the main guitar chord lesson then 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.949
 a lesson how to take bars and then a lesson all 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.969
 chords bars 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.360
 All the links I will give under the video and now we 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.590
 you are slow and play and see where 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.730
 there in what places to change chords because 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.539
 what seems to me the main difficulty 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:51.260
 this is where we start with chords 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.260
 fmd with and play twice as big eraser 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.860
 then a chord and two more times 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.750
 cts m 2 times 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.799
 b m 1 time 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:22.479
 then we play like that 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.479
 pam param pam param 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.050
 Well, such is such a thing 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:48.060
 that is, played on cds - down up and on 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:48.060
 smd with the same thing again 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.260
 let's first see 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:25.319
 and drove on the second verse well, here I am 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.560
 I think the complexity was exactly this 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.560
 place 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.540
 so now I am now again going to play first 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:37.959
 in a fast rhythm and then we'll see 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.959
 chorus 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:12.210
 well here's the chorus 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:16.290
 chord e 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.870
 and play the same theme that was played before 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.500
 this we have to play as 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.650
 would be a half 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.880
 chord ate and it's done so one 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.620
 full fight six 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.660
 and then here is this topic to pam couples than we 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:37.770
 were playing 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:41.430
 and with this topic on the chord e and 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.290
 chord and that is, see what we are playing 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.630
 we play one and a half 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.630
 chord e and 05 chord a 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.099
 something like this 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.760
 again 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:17.489
 and continue 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:22.830
 not again about what they used to do before 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:25.700
 pam pam couple well so let's 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.700
 one time slow 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:58.720
 Well, that is, this is the topic here. 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.560
 used what's here so here 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.550
 let's play one more time 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.550
 chorus slowly 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.520
 you 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.780

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.780

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.520
 you 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:27.030
 Well, I hope I helped everyone thanks for 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:29.389

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.389
