00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.430
 I am half dead, but not anymore 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.130
 he had come out confident 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.960

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.780
 point to basel have the remaining 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.340
 secured and as I said once 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.840
 The situation is bad 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.010

 pretty exciting for the audience 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.530
 but you say who calms everything down 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.250
 It would be better for us 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.409
 was nervous 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.090
 with the draw in the last second 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.979

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.350

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:11.120
 only team that was friendly 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.860
 I decided that sportily 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.810
 descent does not have to rely on anything anymore 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.489
 that feels pretty good on that 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.080
 Of course that is of course so was me 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.640

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.500
 power does yesterday after having that 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.400

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.709

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.660
