00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.040
 hey people what 's up are welcome 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.380
 Welcome to join Grand Theft 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.929
 Car 5 and today shows you a mission 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.180
 through which one a subtle amount at the 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.000
 p gets so easy to level 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.439
 In addition, which is also legal 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.140
 this is what some of you put on 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.039
 Great value and fun too 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.689
 may have 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.550
 that's too sensitive you can see 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.750
 with very few missions therefore 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.800
 I just wanted to see you guys 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.809
 imagine 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.880
 Of course you can find the mission in the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.710
 video description for the xbox and wii 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.050
 Playstation then adds the mission 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.940
 Just add it to your game 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.370
 online must and hosts the mission below 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.710
 Your marked jobs should be included 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.809
 to find the caps emissions 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.820
 have you started mission yet 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.949
 at least one buddy to the mission 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.629
 I think that should invite 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.250
 For the most part, not a problem 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.680
 otherwise you just put some 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.270
 random one and then one is in the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.699
 Mission you see a lot of people here 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.100
 already hit one and must 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.130
 you just killed one killed each 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.960
 You get 25 rp in the middle 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.360
 There are still small bags that one 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.180
 collect can get per sacs 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.920
 another 25 rp the hearty extremely little 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.689
 but if you how fast you can see you 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.420
 then one can kill one after another 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.450
 that was a decent amount of erp 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.460
 I am per mission pass 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.350
 come about a tenth level high 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.030
 I already have a very high level 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.189
 not so high for the people 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.210
 level I think I can do it on everyone 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.280
 case in order 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.990
 In addition, his mission is man 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.030
 also often play the piece 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.740
 at other erp missions one has at 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.460
 second or third time no 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.229
 buck more 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.750
 because the mission is so boring though 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.780
 the challenge since even really 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.520
 These npcs are not that weak 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.290
 and that's why I find the mission 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.460
 just absolutely awesome, I think everyone 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.240
 should you definitely times 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.860
 try out 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.149
 it was already so far from this 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.619
 tutorial if you the video danger only 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.750
 helped her and more of such 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.790
 let legal missions then let see 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.590
 I like a positive review since I am 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.590
 at out people and show 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.730
 the 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.900
 a young beauty fashion
