00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:11.280
 today, the theme itself today is the new one 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:13.920
 main character gdi 16 plus are very 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.980
 nice device here in this whole 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.420
 construction larger than the already 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.980
 existing areas also good if you 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.650
 slightly tilted you notice again and again 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.390
 but sometimes it is in the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:44.750
 ongoing operation has not been a problem 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:48.210
 as we keep 18 from 93 tighten 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.829
 That was a shock you have reasonable 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.250
 hammer with which one can also suck 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.800
 Of course, good battery will be clean too 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:01.609
 have but okay maybe there comes 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:04.100
 again fix something over the old stuff 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:09.270
 which has been enough for this 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:14.630
 obviously much larger in his, too 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:17.759
 Whole form he looks more professional 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.439
 with the husband and I think that has 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.810
 not just about it 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.909
 It has always been difficult when you are 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.650
 From the beginning I bet I hope you see 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.189
 it's a little bit holes now 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.990
 in it 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.579
 I assume that yes for it 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.060
 are to draw again just air 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.490
 so that with the larger suckers the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.220
 Air flow students not too fast 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.180
 But you can react this also 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.380
 very well in the hole itself the point 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.470
 which one somehow marks before 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.299
 saw what I like very much here 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.570
 is earlier you have ok on the 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.570
 handle 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.320
 I actually do not know it 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.070
 thought but there is also there 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.049
 possibilities 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:05.440
 you pulled out the seams solved 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:13.480
 Pull Lay Away solve today 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:15.700
 that was it for longer production 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.390
 drill everything very fast 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.220
 he wobbles something in the grip bosch has that 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.860
 extra avoided here no adjustable 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.830
 nuts or adjustable 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.780
 do not let anyone else on the 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.380
 Idea comes that went so hard to put on 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.510
 that he's ripping the plastic though 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:42.820
 so tight enough 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:44.860
 should he still I know that 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.410
 own experience while drilling always 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:52.620
 you can pull something in one direction 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.620
 that is actually quite good with the hand for 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.000
 the rubbers that they already have one 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.130
 It is always digging up a bit 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.300
 for the larger drills are the 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:07.120
 same as the men 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:10.380
 also the conversion from left to right is 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.380
 actually no problem with 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:24.510
 let go of weight again 3 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:39.770
 screw it that was it I hope I 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.990
 could you at least a little 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.990
 give an impression of how the new
