00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.379
 good Wednesday then let's talk 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.960
 about interesting things with all the 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.690
 integrity of the world today let's talk 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.690
 of the relationship between wheels and 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.500
 bearings that is important at the time 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.800
 to find or steal 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:25.330
 one thing that happens a lot of people who come 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.060
 with wheels maybe they are bad or they are not 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.820
 suitable for their type of skating and 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.860
 they say give me a ceramic bearing tell me 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.730
 the best bearing what 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.790
 that way I'll go faster 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.340
 it's not really what it is that affects 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.680
 the speed obviously the technique but 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.440
 apart from that the wheel a bearing 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:53.290
 it can be good very good precision and 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.300
 very expensive if your wheel is a friend 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.489
 bad 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.399
 of little use having a bearing of 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.680
 ceramics does not accelerate is not that suddenly 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.379
 carry a thousand euro bearing 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.210
 you will start to accelerate if there is a 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.800
 little resistance but that you can 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.860
 do with the hand has nothing to do with 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.290
 your weight your strength or your technique when you 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.630
 you have your weight that can be 20 kilos 50 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.850
 kilos 100 kilos 200 kilos or was a 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.920
 elephant a good bounce means that your 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.530
 weight or six as elastic if you strip 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.960
 good wheels against the floor vote 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.009
 like a ball of these button 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.899
 and then a good wheel go back that 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.679
 means that when you put the weight on you 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:38.080
 you are skating pushing and the wheel boots 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:41.470
 is what gives the speed is what is not 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.890
 slow down because for less contact with 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.020
 floor less surface with touching or more 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.880
 fast you go because if your wheel is not worth 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.149
 so you will not run anymore 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.630
 I have a bearing that is unknown 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:58.090
 and that challenge for 350 euros that are 25 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.470
 euros the bearing and once I made a 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:05.530
 25 kilometer test to sack and day 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.649
 next I did it with a number the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.170
 time difference was this obviously 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.900
 it's a very simplified way right 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.540
 but you know that if you have a 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.970
 Just write one actually recorded clearly not 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.510
 It's good for nothing, it 's better to believe a wheel 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.599
 expensive with one that a cheap wheel with 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.390
 once 23 thousand no to 7 which is very slow 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.720
 I'm going to 5 very slow base one time three 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.760
 you go super wind really a little 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.459
 it matters because we have a thermal with a 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.290
 with sand inside that almost does not rotate but 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.360
 the important thing 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.310
 is the reaction of the wheel against 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.129
 I usually ask if you ask me now 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.319
 you really carry on your skate I'll tell you 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.700
 Well, I think I have a mixture of 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:53.650
 tools that I found by the 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:56.590
 most store is a ship 7 and I have 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.439
 of everything else it may be that hardness is 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.390
 better for you than what brand is better 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:03.040
 for you and your skating style where 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.230
 you live all this is important too 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.639
 but obviously we are going to do another 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.920
 then because if we all have one 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:11.380
 Wednesday at the end we have to 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.470
 talk about other things 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.930
 they do not paint that we have learned today 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.880
 wheel is very important obviously if 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.730
 you are competing in the finals of 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.090
 world or international skating cup 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.410
 those to death 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.930
 shortcuts that can give you a 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:33.340
 chronic ceramic bearing and the 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.830
 likud well but in general the amex 7 and 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.350
 the cube 7 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.450
 all this is already good there is no motor 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.080
 inside the bearing 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.080
 OK
