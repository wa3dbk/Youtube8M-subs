00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
going to want to look out the way that

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.350 
going to want to look out the way that
you<00:01:11.290> want<00:01:11.380> your<00:01:11.560> cannon<00:01:11.890> to<00:01:11.950> fire<00:01:11.980> can<00:01:12.730> it<00:01:12.880> this

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
you want your cannon to fire can it this

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.630 
you want your cannon to fire can it this
mini<00:01:13.630> cannon<00:01:13.900> is<00:01:14.200> better<00:01:14.800> off<00:01:15.010> firing<00:01:15.370> at<00:01:15.610> a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
mini cannon is better off firing at a

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.780 
mini cannon is better off firing at a
high<00:01:16.570> ish<00:01:17.320> altitude<00:01:17.950> because<00:01:18.040> that<00:01:18.340> it<00:01:18.610> goes

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
high ish altitude because that it goes

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.940 
high ish altitude because that it goes
far<00:01:19.060> but<00:01:19.810> it<00:01:19.870> goes<00:01:19.990> farther<00:01:20.290> the<00:01:20.530> higher<00:01:20.710> you

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
far but it goes farther the higher you

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.070 
far but it goes farther the higher you
are<00:01:20.980> so<00:01:21.640> depending<00:01:22.060> on<00:01:22.060> how<00:01:22.180> far<00:01:22.510> you<00:01:22.660> want<00:01:22.690> it

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
are so depending on how far you want it

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.860 
are so depending on how far you want it
to<00:01:23.200> go<00:01:23.350> actually<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:25.240> higher<00:01:25.450> up<00:01:25.480> you<00:01:25.690> should

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
to go actually the higher up you should

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.520 
to go actually the higher up you should
be<00:01:26.140> um<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.600> you're<00:01:28.750> going<00:01:29.050> to<00:01:29.170> want<00:01:29.260> to<00:01:29.350> face

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
be um so you're going to want to face

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.140 
be um so you're going to want to face
out<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:30.130> direction<00:01:30.430> that<00:01:30.610> you<00:01:30.790> want<00:01:30.820> to<00:01:31.030> go

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
out the direction that you want to go

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.850 
out the direction that you want to go
and<00:01:32.020> you're<00:01:32.110> going<00:01:32.200> to<00:01:32.290> want<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.470> build<00:01:32.680> a

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
and you're going to want to build a

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.080 
and you're going to want to build a
cannon<00:01:33.070> one<00:01:33.370> two<00:01:33.790> three<00:01:34.270> four<00:01:34.750> five<00:01:35.020> back<00:01:36.090> up

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
cannon one two three four five back up

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.290 
cannon one two three four five back up
and<00:01:37.920> one<00:01:38.920> two<00:01:39.100> three<00:01:39.580> four<00:01:40.090> so<00:01:40.990> it's<00:01:41.970> 53<00:01:42.970> by

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
and one two three four so it's 53 by

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.560 
and one two three four so it's 53 by
five<00:01:43.600> relief<00:01:44.409> this<00:01:44.590> open<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:46.240> you<00:01:46.300> get<00:01:46.450> like

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
five relief this open so you get like

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.880 
five relief this open so you get like
this<00:01:46.720> kind<00:01:46.780> of<00:01:47.020> horseshoe<00:01:47.440> look<00:01:47.590> at<00:01:47.680> them<00:01:47.800> this

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
this kind of horseshoe look at them this

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:48.930 
this kind of horseshoe look at them this
is<00:01:48.040> going<00:01:48.159> to<00:01:48.220> be<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.400> back<00:01:48.520> of<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.730> cannon

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
is going to be the back of the cannon

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.690 
is going to be the back of the cannon
here<00:01:49.980> that's<00:01:50.980> the<00:01:51.130> front<00:01:51.310> of<00:01:51.400> the<00:01:51.460> cannon

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
here that's the front of the cannon

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.980 
here that's the front of the cannon
that's<00:01:51.820> where<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.030> TNT<00:01:52.450> is<00:01:52.510> going<00:01:52.659> to<00:01:52.750> fire

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
that's where the TNT is going to fire

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:00.510 
that's where the TNT is going to fire
out<00:01:53.940> I<00:01:56.580> think<00:01:57.580> I<00:01:57.610> need<00:01:57.729> six<00:01:58.830> no<00:01:59.830> I<00:01:59.860> can<00:02:00.159> do<00:02:00.250> five

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
out I think I need six no I can do five

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
on the redstone it activates the block

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.360 
on the redstone it activates the block
that's<00:02:48.170> here<00:02:49.100> now<00:02:50.980> for<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.070> there's

will fall down and that will provide the

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.790 
will fall down and that will provide the
boost<00:04:22.220> for<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:23.770> TNT<00:04:25.449> now<00:04:26.449> and<00:04:27.350> just<00:04:27.470> build<00:04:27.650> it
