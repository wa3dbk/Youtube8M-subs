hello<00:00:08.220> everybody<00:00:08.880> today<00:00:09.720> I'm<00:00:09.840> going<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.020> talk

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
hello everybody today I'm going to talk

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.530 
hello everybody today I'm going to talk
about<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.650> concept<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.430> exposing<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
about the concept of exposing to the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.810 
about the concept of exposing to the
right<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.620> what<00:00:13.830> exposing<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.520> the<00:00:14.639> right

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
right and what exposing to the right

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.850 
right and what exposing to the right
means<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.570> means<00:00:15.600> taking<00:00:16.200> the<00:00:16.320> histogram

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
means is it means taking the histogram

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.320 
means is it means taking the histogram
that<00:00:17.100> appears<00:00:17.460> for<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.760> image<00:00:18.030> which<00:00:18.210> you

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
that appears for the image which you

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.720 
that appears for the image which you
just<00:00:18.539> captured<00:00:19.110> and<00:00:19.369> exposing<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.520> the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
just captured and exposing it to the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.430 
just captured and exposing it to the
point<00:00:21.000> where<00:00:21.270> most<00:00:21.450> of<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.780> information

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.440

talking<00:00:44.910> about<00:00:45.050> making<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.140> image<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.560> bright

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
talking about making the image as bright

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.430 
talking about making the image as bright

North Dakota I was out taking some HDR

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.590 
North Dakota I was out taking some HDR
bracketed<00:00:55.440> exposures<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.390> could

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
bracketed exposures so that I could

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.240 
bracketed exposures so that I could
combine<00:00:57.810> them<00:00:58.200> later<00:00:58.470> and<00:00:58.770> get<00:00:58.860> the<00:00:59.040> full

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
combine them later and get the full

differences you'll end up with in the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.490 
differences you'll end up with in the
end<00:01:50.299> so<00:01:51.299> go<00:01:51.450> about<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.110> made<00:01:52.259> three

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
end so go about this I made three

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.340 
end so go about this I made three
virtual<00:01:53.009> copies<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.549> my<00:01:53.700> images<00:01:54.150> one<00:01:54.990> for<00:01:55.229> each

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
virtual copies of my images one for each

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.530 
virtual copies of my images one for each
of<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.650> exposures<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.549> then<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.180> set<00:01:57.420> about

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
of the exposures and then I set about

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.630 
of the exposures and then I set about
trying<00:01:57.900> to<00:01:58.110> edit<00:01:58.320> them<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.280> edits

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
trying to edit them so that the edits

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.320 
trying to edit them so that the edits
were<00:01:59.850> all<00:02:00.180> roughly<00:02:01.140> equivalent<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:02.220> went<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.210> my

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
were all roughly equivalent I went to my

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.210 
were all roughly equivalent I went to my
normal<00:02:03.720> exposure<00:02:04.110> which<00:02:04.439> was<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:04.829> camera

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
normal exposure which was the camera

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.580 
normal exposure which was the camera
metered<00:02:05.549> exposure<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:07.020> took<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.380> into

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
metered exposure and I took that into

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.169 
metered exposure and I took that into
the<00:02:07.770> develop<00:02:08.189> module<00:02:08.340> because<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.819> figured

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
the develop module because I figured

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.990 
the develop module because I figured
that<00:02:09.239> was<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> good<00:02:09.780> place<00:02:10.049> to<00:02:10.079> start<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:11.280> all<00:02:11.849> of

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
that was a good place to start on all of

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.089 
that was a good place to start on all of
the<00:02:12.090> images<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.689> set<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.140> white<00:02:13.470> balance<00:02:13.500> to

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
the images I set the white balance to

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.559 
the images I set the white balance to
daylight<00:02:14.549> which<00:02:14.819> was<00:02:15.000> what<00:02:15.150> we<00:02:15.269> were<00:02:15.390> shooting

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
daylight which was what we were shooting

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.660 
daylight which was what we were shooting
in<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.080> was<00:02:16.170> roughly<00:02:16.440> daylight<00:02:16.950> Shade<00:02:17.280> clouds

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
in it was roughly daylight Shade clouds

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.640 
in it was roughly daylight Shade clouds
mixed<00:02:18.239> it<00:02:18.330> was<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.480> mixed<00:02:18.810> bag<00:02:18.959> out<00:02:19.200> there<00:02:19.230> and

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
mixed it was a mixed bag out there and

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.410 
mixed it was a mixed bag out there and
then<00:02:20.280> because<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.700> thought<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.060> original

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
then because I thought the original

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.880 
then because I thought the original
image<00:02:21.690> if<00:02:21.840> you'll<00:02:21.990> remember<00:02:22.290> from<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.680> film

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
image if you'll remember from the film

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.949 
image if you'll remember from the film
strip<00:02:23.130> looked<00:02:23.430> like<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:23.940> looked<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.840> little

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
strip looked like this looked a little

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:25.790 
strip looked like this looked a little
bit<00:02:25.170> dark

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
bit dark

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.160 
bit dark
I<00:02:25.830> brought<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.520> exposure<00:02:27.000> off<00:02:27.300> by<00:02:27.510> one<00:02:27.780> stop

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
I brought the exposure off by one stop

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.960 
I brought the exposure off by one stop
so<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:29.069> I<00:02:29.099> thought<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.520> tonal<00:02:29.940> values

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
so that I thought the tonal values

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.660 
so that I thought the tonal values
matched<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:31.260> scene<00:02:31.560> which<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:32.010> shot<00:02:32.340> from

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
matched the scene which I shot from

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.240 
matched the scene which I shot from
memory<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.380> thought<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.650> shadows<00:02:35.040> were<00:02:35.220> a

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
memory I thought that the shadows were a

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.580 
memory I thought that the shadows were a
little<00:02:35.489> bit<00:02:35.700> dark<00:02:36.270> so<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.780> took<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.200> fill<00:02:37.410> light

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
little bit dark so I took the fill light

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.490 
little bit dark so I took the fill light
to<00:02:37.770> 50<00:02:38.190> then<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.150> wanted<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.630> set<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.840> black<00:02:40.140> point

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
to 50 then I wanted to set a black point

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.860 
to 50 then I wanted to set a black point
for<00:02:40.709> my<00:02:40.830> image<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.940> did<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.360> by<00:02:42.569> watching

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
for my image and I did that by watching

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.780 
for my image and I did that by watching
this<00:02:43.319> indicator<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:44.130> shows<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.640> where

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
this indicator that shows you where

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.090 
this indicator that shows you where
you're<00:02:45.000> plugging<00:02:45.270> your<00:02:45.510> shadows<00:02:46.020> and<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.890> set

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
you're plugging your shadows and I set

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.280 
you're plugging your shadows and I set
it<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.370> value<00:02:47.459> which<00:02:48.060> was<00:02:48.269> one<00:02:48.540> stop<00:02:48.870> above

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
it to a value which was one stop above

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.880 
it to a value which was one stop above
where<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.830> transition<00:02:50.310> came<00:02:50.780> between

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
where the transition came between

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.490 
where the transition came between
clipping<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:53.069> couple<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.489> channels<00:02:53.910> and

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
clipping a couple of channels and

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.809 
clipping a couple of channels and
clipping<00:02:55.500> all<00:02:55.739> of<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.160> channels<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.700> it

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
clipping all of the channels and it

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.820 
clipping all of the channels and it
turns<00:02:57.030> out<00:02:57.269> that<00:02:57.480> for<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.870> camera<00:02:58.350> metered

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
turns out that for the camera metered

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.300 
turns out that for the camera metered
exposure<00:02:59.430> this<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.390> value<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:00.900> 12<00:03:01.310> the

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
landscape sharpening which I said at

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
if we take a quick do min to 100% you

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.540 
if we take a quick do min to 100% you
can<00:05:55.960> see<00:05:56.200> that<00:05:56.380> the<00:05:56.470> plus<00:05:56.710> two<00:05:57.040> image<00:05:57.370> is<00:05:57.520> a

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
can see that the plus two image is a

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.060 
can see that the plus two image is a
much<00:05:57.880> smoother<00:05:58.450> image<00:05:58.840> look<00:05:59.590> at<00:05:59.740> the<00:05:59.830> amount

camera<00:07:29.020> meter<00:07:29.490> math<00:07:30.490> tells<00:07:30.940> us<00:07:31.150> that<00:07:31.390> there's

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:31.600 
camera meter math tells us that there's

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.750 
camera meter math tells us that there's
more<00:07:31.840> information<00:07:32.590> stored<00:07:32.980> in<00:07:33.220> the<00:07:33.340> highlight

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:33.760 
more information stored in the highlight

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.970 
more information stored in the highlight
portions<00:07:34.330> of<00:07:34.420> the<00:07:34.540> histogram<00:07:35.080> then<00:07:35.830> there

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:35.980 
portions of the histogram then there

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.800 
portions of the histogram then there
isn't<00:07:36.250> a<00:07:36.310> shadow<00:07:36.490> portions<00:07:37.060> of<00:07:37.150> the<00:07:37.270> histogram

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:37.810 
isn't a shadow portions of the histogram

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.020 
isn't a shadow portions of the histogram
and<00:07:38.140> I<00:07:38.680> think<00:07:38.920> this<00:07:39.070> little<00:07:39.250> experiment<00:07:40.000> just

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.030 
and I think this little experiment just

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.200 
and I think this little experiment just
verified<00:07:40.900> why<00:07:41.530> that<00:07:41.830> is<00:07:42.100> much<00:07:43.000> better

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.210 
verified why that is much better

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.200 
verified why that is much better
sharpness<00:07:43.930> much<00:07:44.560> less<00:07:44.860> noise<00:07:45.160> much<00:07:45.940> better

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:46.210 
sharpness much less noise much better

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.480 
sharpness much less noise much better
tonal<00:07:46.660> quality<00:07:47.140> comes<00:07:47.410> from<00:07:47.860> adjusting<00:07:48.160> an

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:48.490 
tonal quality comes from adjusting an

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.050 
tonal quality comes from adjusting an
image<00:07:48.850> that<00:07:49.330> has<00:07:49.440> higher<00:07:50.440> exposure<00:07:51.160> than<00:07:51.910> an

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:52.060 
image that has higher exposure than an

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.080 
image that has higher exposure than an
image<00:07:52.210> that<00:07:52.450> has<00:07:52.510> lower<00:07:52.810> exposure<00:07:53.910> thanks<00:07:54.910> for

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.090 
image that has lower exposure thanks for

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:56.940 
image that has lower exposure thanks for
watching<00:07:55.570> my<00:07:55.690> demonstration<00:07:56.380> if<00:07:56.680> you<00:07:56.800> have
