it's recording okay we're going to look
at<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:02.939> chimney<00:00:03.330> here<00:00:03.600> that<00:00:03.870> another<00:00:04.680> roofing

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
at a chimney here that another roofing

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.179 
at a chimney here that another roofing
contractor<00:00:05.759> put<00:00:06.600> this<00:00:06.660> three<00:00:07.170> tab<00:00:07.440> roofing<00:00:08.040> on

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
contractor put this three tab roofing on

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.839 
contractor put this three tab roofing on
here<00:00:08.519> about<00:00:08.700> ten<00:00:09.240> years<00:00:09.480> ago<00:00:09.679> and<00:00:10.849> they

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
here about ten years ago and they

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.419 
here about ten years ago and they
decided<00:00:12.269> that<00:00:12.530> the<00:00:13.530> old<00:00:13.679> counter<00:00:14.190> flashing

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
decided that the old counter flashing

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.430 
decided that the old counter flashing
which<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.150> goes<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:15.540> between<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.020> bricks<00:00:16.230> in

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
which it goes in between the bricks in

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.939 
which it goes in between the bricks in
the<00:00:16.560> border<00:00:17.180> was<00:00:18.180> worn<00:00:18.510> out<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:19.500> they<00:00:19.650> kind<00:00:19.859> of

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
the border was worn out so they kind of

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.960 
the border was worn out so they kind of
filled<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.490> with<00:00:20.520> tar<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.529> then<00:00:22.529> they<00:00:23.039> took

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
filled it in with tar and then they took

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.790 
filled it in with tar and then they took
this<00:00:24.269> intersection<00:00:24.930> which<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.439> supposed<00:00:25.710> to

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
this intersection which is supposed to

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.950 
this intersection which is supposed to
be<00:00:25.890> flashed<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.730> they<00:00:27.449> filled<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:27.930> with

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
be flashed and they filled it in with

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.800 
be flashed and they filled it in with
black<00:00:28.320> tar<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.010> put<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> coating<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.000> see

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
black tar and put a coating on it see

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.209 
black tar and put a coating on it see
they<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:30.960> put<00:00:31.289> all<00:00:31.380> this<00:00:31.529> coating<00:00:31.920> on<00:00:32.040> there

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
they just put all this coating on there

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.760 
they just put all this coating on there
thinking<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.180> that's<00:00:33.390> going<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.840> weatherize

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
thinking that that's going to weatherize

but the roofing company decided that no
one's<00:01:34.259> looking<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:34.860> we're<00:01:35.100> just<00:01:35.250> going<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.460> tar

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
one's looking so we're just going to tar

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.429 
one's looking so we're just going to tar
it<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:37.400> over<00:01:38.400> here<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.790> called<00:01:39.170> bottom<00:01:40.170> pan

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
it in over here is called bottom pan

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.520 
it in over here is called bottom pan
metal<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:42.180> see<00:01:42.390> that's<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.750> metal<00:01:43.110> here

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
metal and you see that's the metal here

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.460 
metal and you see that's the metal here
and<00:01:44.040> they<00:01:44.369> decide<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.939> would<00:01:45.060> take<00:01:45.240> 20<00:01:46.110> brined

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
and they decide it would take 20 brined

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.980 
and they decide it would take 20 brined
in<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:47.100> counter<00:01:48.060> flashing<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.659> would<00:01:48.810> lay

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
in a counter flashing that would lay

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.490 
in a counter flashing that would lay
over<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.590> see<00:01:50.549> how<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.880> works<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.229> rain

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
over this see how that works so the rain

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.649 
over this see how that works so the rain
hits<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.310> runs<00:01:53.579> down<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:53.880> down<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.479> roof

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
hits it it runs down and down the roof

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.800 
hits it it runs down and down the roof
now<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.320> have<00:01:55.619> big<00:01:55.860> gaps<00:01:56.189> here<00:01:56.610> water<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.420> going

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
now we have big gaps here water is going

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.230 
now we have big gaps here water is going
right<00:01:58.079> down<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.799> causing<00:01:59.640> some<00:01:59.820> problems

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
right down in and causing some problems

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.380 
right down in and causing some problems
in<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.509> house<00:02:00.950> namely<00:02:01.950> big<00:02:02.759> stains<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
in this house namely big stains in the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.240 
in this house namely big stains in the
ceiling<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.740> happened<00:02:05.189> this

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
ceiling and it just happened this

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.609 
ceiling and it just happened this
so<00:02:06.940> this<00:02:07.090> probably<00:02:07.450> cracked<00:02:07.810> open<00:02:08.140> last

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
so this probably cracked open last

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.430 
so this probably cracked open last
summer<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:09.250> eight<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.660> then<00:02:11.200> when<00:02:11.320> all<00:02:11.350> the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
summer of eight and then when all the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.390 
summer of eight and then when all the
rains<00:02:11.710> come<00:02:12.040> he's<00:02:12.250> discovering<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.060> so<00:02:14.400> that's

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
rains come he's discovering it so that's

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.480 
rains come he's discovering it so that's
what<00:02:15.550> we're<00:02:15.670> going<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:15.850> do<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.060> this<00:02:16.210> chimney
