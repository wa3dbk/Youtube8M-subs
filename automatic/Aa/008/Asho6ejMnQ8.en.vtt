00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.570 

okay<00:00:15.599> here's<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.929> brand<00:00:16.410> new<00:00:16.560> bake<00:00:16.830> element<00:00:17.039> for

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
okay here's a brand new bake element for

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.450 
okay here's a brand new bake element for
this<00:00:17.699> model<00:00:17.940> stove<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.690> like<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.770> said<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.160> was<00:00:20.279> in

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
this model stove I like I said it was in

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.340 
this model stove I like I said it was in
the<00:00:20.730> previous<00:00:21.000> video<00:00:21.480> testing<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
the previous video testing the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.700 
the previous video testing the
resistance<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.699> was<00:00:23.910> obvious<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.840> the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
resistance it was obvious that the the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.490 
resistance it was obvious that the the
old<00:00:25.920> element<00:00:26.369> was<00:00:26.490> bad<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.630> I'm<00:00:28.109> gonna<00:00:28.260> show

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
old element was bad so I'm gonna show

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.880 
old element was bad so I'm gonna show
you<00:00:28.560> now<00:00:28.680> testing<00:00:29.519> do<00:00:30.060> resistance<00:00:30.890> pulling

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
you now testing do resistance pulling

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.670 
you now testing do resistance pulling
more<00:00:32.099> what<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.460> should<00:00:32.700> be<00:00:32.730> for<00:00:33.410> here<00:00:34.410> we<00:00:34.500> go

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
more what it should be for here we go

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.459 
more what it should be for here we go
and<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.550> testing<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.300> bake<00:00:36.480> element<00:00:36.690> and

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
and this is testing the bake element and

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.490 
and this is testing the bake element and
showing<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.040> resistance<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.790> 25<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:40.350> that's

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
showing a resistance of 25 and that's

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.850 
showing a resistance of 25 and that's
much<00:00:40.950> more<00:00:40.980> normal<00:00:41.460> than<00:00:42.469> than<00:00:43.469> what<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:43.739> were

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
much more normal than than what we were

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.790 
much more normal than than what we were
showing<00:00:44.040> earlier<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.930> 834<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:47.370> element

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
showing earlier that 834 on the element

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.319 
showing earlier that 834 on the element
testing<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.950> through<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> plug<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:51.120> anyway

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
testing it through the plug but anyway

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.410 
testing it through the plug but anyway
this<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.660> how<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.870> would<00:00:52.199> test<00:00:52.410> an<00:00:52.710> element

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
this is how you would test an element

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.020 
this is how you would test an element
not<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> plug<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.489> same<00:00:56.699> thing<00:00:57.000> for

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
not to the plug and the same thing for

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.770 
not to the plug and the same thing for
each<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:58.289> your<00:00:58.520> your<00:00:59.520> surface<00:01:00.090> elements<00:01:00.629> if

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
each of your your surface elements if

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.479 
each of your your surface elements if
you<00:01:00.899> had<00:01:01.050> wanted<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.469> test<00:01:01.710> them<00:01:01.920> individually

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.340 

okay<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.549> here<00:01:05.939> goes<00:01:06.090> changing<00:01:06.659> out<00:01:06.780> much

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
okay so here goes changing out much

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.580 
okay so here goes changing out much
limit<00:01:08.689> what<00:01:09.689> I've<00:01:09.810> got<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.170> I've<00:01:10.290> got<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
limit what I've got is I've got the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.100 
limit what I've got is I've got the
stove<00:01:10.830> unplugged<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.939> plugs<00:01:12.180> already<00:01:12.510> if<00:01:13.049> you

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
stove unplugged the plugs already if you

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.170 
stove unplugged the plugs already if you
need<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.530> unplug<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.220> sometimes<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.000> just

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
need to unplug it sometimes you can just

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.880 
need to unplug it sometimes you can just
pull<00:01:15.360> out<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.659> bottom<00:01:15.810> drawer<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.470> then<00:01:16.680> pull

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
pull out the bottom drawer and then pull

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.640 
pull out the bottom drawer and then pull
the<00:01:17.009> plug<00:01:17.220> out<00:01:17.630> this<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.080> one<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.350> have

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the plug out this is the one I have

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.370 
the plug out this is the one I have
pulled<00:01:20.159> out<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.340> little<00:01:20.520> bit<00:01:20.759> more<00:01:21.380> anyway

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
pulled out a little bit more anyway

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.770 
pulled out a little bit more anyway
there's<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.710> couple<00:01:22.920> screws<00:01:23.280> back<00:01:23.610> here<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.600> can

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
there's a couple screws back here we can

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.560 
there's a couple screws back here we can
undo<00:01:25.400> six<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.670> one<00:01:26.790> screwdriver<00:01:27.210> works

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
undo six and one screwdriver works

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.130 
undo six and one screwdriver works
really<00:01:27.810> good<00:01:28.049> for<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.380> as<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:28.829> getting

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:41.270 

quarter-inch<00:01:34.140> heads<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:37.880> simple<00:01:40.280> and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
quarter-inch heads on it simple and

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.889 
quarter-inch heads on it simple and
generally<00:01:41.700> we<00:01:41.789> don't<00:01:41.969> have<00:01:42.149> to<00:01:42.299> take<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.719> back

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
generally we don't have to take the back

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.160 
generally we don't have to take the back
panel<00:01:43.350> off<00:01:43.439> we<00:01:43.649> can<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:43.979> pull<00:01:44.219> them<00:01:45.049> pull<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
panel off we can just pull them pull the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.050 
panel off we can just pull them pull the
element<00:01:46.320> right<00:01:46.920> here<00:01:46.950> as<00:01:47.490> long<00:01:47.670> as<00:01:47.850> we're<00:01:48.030> a

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
element right here as long as we're a

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.809 
element right here as long as we're a
plug<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.829> be<00:01:49.829> able<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.189> disconnect<00:01:50.549> the

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
plug and be able to disconnect the

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.559 
plug and be able to disconnect the
wiring<00:01:52.159> as<00:01:53.159> long<00:01:53.369> as<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:53.579> pull<00:01:53.819> this<00:01:53.969> back<00:01:54.210> far

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
wiring as long as we pull this back far

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.260 
wiring as long as we pull this back far
enough<00:01:55.189> you'll<00:01:56.189> be<00:01:56.280> able<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.700> see<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.119> little

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
enough you'll be able to see the little

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:07.850 
enough you'll be able to see the little
leads<00:01:57.569> right<00:01:58.409> there<00:02:05.599> to<00:02:06.599> worry<00:02:06.780> about<00:02:06.990> old

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
leads right there to worry about old

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:16.640 
leads right there to worry about old
elements<00:02:14.480> what<00:02:15.480> you'll<00:02:15.630> do<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:16.049> most

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
elements what you'll do is most

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:26.089 
elements what you'll do is most
especially<00:02:16.980> again<00:02:17.489> with<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.880> new<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:19.700> is<00:02:25.099> go

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
especially again with the new it is go

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:38.840 
especially again with the new it is go
ahead<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.489> pull<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.480> upper<00:02:27.840> shelves<00:02:28.110> out<00:02:37.850> and

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
ahead and pull the upper shelves out and

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.580 
ahead and pull the upper shelves out and
by<00:02:39.120> holding<00:02:39.299> that<00:02:39.569> we<00:02:39.810> can<00:02:39.989> prevent<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.530> from

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
by holding that we can prevent it from

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.190 
by holding that we can prevent it from
turning<00:02:40.920> now<00:02:41.370> we<00:02:41.579> want<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.930> make<00:02:42.930> sure<00:02:43.170> our

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
turning now we want to make sure our

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:52.450 
turning now we want to make sure our
wire<00:02:43.859> doesn't<00:02:44.190> fall<00:02:44.489> back<00:02:44.730> inside

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:59.290 

I<00:02:56.740> kind<00:02:57.740> of<00:02:57.800> lost<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.250> water<00:02:58.460> inside<00:02:58.910> there

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
I kind of lost the water inside there

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.910 
I kind of lost the water inside there
but<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.540> think<00:02:59.780> I<00:02:59.930> can<00:03:00.110> reach<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.220> pull<00:03:01.550> it<00:03:01.700> out

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
but I think I can reach it pull it out

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.560 
but I think I can reach it pull it out
pull<00:03:03.920> this<00:03:04.070> one<00:03:04.310> out<00:03:04.370> at<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.670> same<00:03:04.970> time<00:03:05.240> there

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
pull this one out at the same time there

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.970 
pull this one out at the same time there
we<00:03:05.690> go<00:03:06.430> OOP<00:03:07.430> come<00:03:08.000> on<00:03:08.180> buddy<00:03:08.390> come<00:03:08.770> on<00:03:09.770> that

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
we go OOP come on buddy come on that
