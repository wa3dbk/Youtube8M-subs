00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.640
 hello friends I am the pib a madman and I come to tell you how 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.770
 do 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.599
 games for the psp 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.119
 point 37 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.149
 because check the costs a lot of work and you can not 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:18.189
 so with this tutorial I hope it will help you a lot 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.429
 only games less than 700 megabytes can be made 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.529
 download and their less than 700 megabytes 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.730
 Then the first thing you have to do is download the program that is already 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.960
 leave the link 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.849
 and this is 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.260
 villa nocito downloaded as I have it 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.050
 they open it 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.180
 here 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.880
 they will form a pact neither 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.440
 that they open it 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.520
 i am here 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.660
 they install it as I already have it installed 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.820
 that is here 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.020
 current format 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.360
 list you do not need in the mine 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.050
 they install but legally 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.210
 positive ennis and iron 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.329
 and holds 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.260
 that or 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.000
 for those who have a game cc oo 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 and they need to convert warnings to forces 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.130
 add the file 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.130
 cc oo de nákor explained 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.690
 that is guaranteed 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.359
 and do not move to anything other than politics until it says in Michoacán 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:22.870
 petta of origin 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.480
 they put you to accept 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.110
 and until here 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.820
 are left to start and it's going to turn is a very fast very efficient trade 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.890
 nestlé wait for me to make it 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.870
 Christ 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.660
 the one that we have converted 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.700
 we close 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.070
 the flight moss open farc on hold 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.550
 we extract this folder that I did was tnp and néstor ayala corp complete does not have 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.970
 neither light nor anything 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.590
 is incomplete to the desktop 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.900
 is more advisable or where you want but know where it is 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.199
 missed me 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.599
 they close estella no no qué lo clesa 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.559
 we cover it 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:16.219
 ii this folder 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.039
 do not use it as programmatic exportable 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.679
 everything is moving nothing inside that folder 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:24.969
 jean in a gene 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.869
 do not Seneca open this 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:29.059
 we are going to open 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:31.739
 if we look for hedgehog what is this 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.909
 we are april 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.889
 here weigh in and we copy twal all the expenses this out of the two 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:41.839
 folders that 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:44.839
 we hope to get rid of him 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:49.749
 induce moss fac in epec is on the desktop 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.769
 and we put him to accept 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.769
 extract the files 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.169
 that are already here as you can realize 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:01.859
 are these 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.139
 after there 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:09.049
 Cárcamo Celis Orly Solonz collects in this folder also so 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.069
 we go back on our disc 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.489
 let's read psp 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.849
 and we look for the iso that we already believe that if this one we copy 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.739
 with nothing more huasi metal in the folder 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:25.859
 páramo copia 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.859
 they promise you 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:35.349
 Christ 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.969
 if they give him they do not have a car to name the dwarf and click when they name him they stand up 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:47.319
 all the floors have to put in this to all that any game 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:52.019
 because if the program does not read it then they give it packing np 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.139
 maybe he's a little window 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.299
 they wait for him to load he voted 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.349
 and converts them 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.109
 until the window is removed 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.549
 we already have that e-book 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.549
 now we are a new folder 

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:11.399
 if we put better pitt is the name of the game that 

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:14.399
 we made the disc 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.620
 then we put the only file that is elevated act we put there 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.710
 and these can be eliminated and they are useless 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.710
 those that did not come in the folder 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.830
 I say because every game is going to be put because they will put new and new equipment 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.330
 the best to eliminate them 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.189
 this folder 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:42.059
 we can copy it in our 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:44.270
 psp that where 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.520
 there is the folder 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.039
 who says have 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.070
 the folder is to know what it says that nothing and we put this folder and do not 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:52.509
 it affects nothing 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.729
 and we can play 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.620
 Well that's it and I hope you liked it remember I'm the crazy pigüi and 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.610
 comment 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.180
 Thank you
