so<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.829> was<00:01:37.950> back<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.159> January<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.259> the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
so that was back in January and the

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.920 
so that was back in January and the
funny<00:01:40.530> thing<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:44.030> her<00:01:45.030> leaves<00:01:45.329> are<00:01:45.720> very

dehydrated so I think it's because due

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.020 
dehydrated so I think it's because due
to<00:01:49.710> lack<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.070> humidity<00:01:51.049> however<00:01:52.049> she<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.040> just
