the<00:00:46.200> sub<00:00:46.410> didn't<00:00:46.680> go<00:00:46.829> through<00:00:47.100> but<00:00:47.430> we'll<00:00:47.579> see

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
the sub didn't go through but we'll see

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.260 
the sub didn't go through but we'll see
about<00:00:47.880> that

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
about that

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.450 
about that
so<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> last<00:00:49.530> one<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:50.010> know<00:00:50.219> of

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
so this is the last one that we know of

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.910 
so this is the last one that we know of
for<00:00:51.030> sure<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:52.140> kind<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.380> a<00:00:52.469> good<00:00:52.620> one<00:00:52.800> to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
for sure and it's kind of a good one to

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.220 
for sure and it's kind of a good one to
end<00:00:53.070> on<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.550> mean<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.180> decent<00:00:54.630> figure<00:00:54.960> and

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
end on I mean it's a decent figure and

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.540 
end on I mean it's a decent figure and
it's<00:00:55.440> one<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.860> think<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.100> lot<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.309> people

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
it's one that I think a lot of people

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.520 
it's one that I think a lot of people
are<00:00:56.610> gonna<00:00:56.700> want<00:00:57.120> since<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.570> Batman<00:00:57.960> related

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
are gonna want since it's Batman related

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.830 
are gonna want since it's Batman related
and<00:00:59.010> Batman<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.520> usually<00:01:00.180> one<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.450> most

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
and Batman is usually one that most

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.579 
and Batman is usually one that most
people<00:01:01.260> want<00:01:02.390> aside<00:01:03.390> from<00:01:03.750> looking<00:01:04.080> cool<00:01:04.559> and

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
people want aside from looking cool and

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.350 
people want aside from looking cool and
being<00:01:05.009> kind<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.399> unique<00:01:05.789> he's<00:01:06.180> not

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
being kind of unique he's not

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
because they painted a gray on the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.479 
because they painted a gray on the
inside<00:02:03.929> that's<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.289> a<00:02:04.530> really<00:02:04.800> nice<00:02:05.039> looking

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:05.489 
inside that's just a really nice looking

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:08.540 
inside that's just a really nice looking
feature<00:02:05.929> he<00:02:06.929> has<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.050> new<00:02:07.259> belt<00:02:07.530> obviously<00:02:08.220> it

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
feature he has a new belt obviously it

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.460 
feature he has a new belt obviously it
is<00:02:08.849> upside<00:02:09.360> down<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:09.989> looks<00:02:10.200> like<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
is upside down and it looks like the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.170 
is upside down and it looks like the
little<00:02:10.709> flaps<00:02:10.950> are<00:02:11.220> hanging<00:02:11.550> open<00:02:11.849> so<00:02:12.000> that's

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
little flaps are hanging open so that's

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.920 
little flaps are hanging open so that's
kind<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.510> cool

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
kind of cool

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.229 
kind of cool
I<00:02:12.959> think<00:02:13.770> everything<00:02:14.370> else<00:02:14.520> is<00:02:14.940> stuff<00:02:15.209> that

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
I think everything else is stuff that

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.000 
I think everything else is stuff that
we've<00:02:15.569> seen<00:02:15.930> before<00:02:16.110> it's<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.590> pretty<00:02:16.800> generic

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
we've seen before it's a pretty generic

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.880 
we've seen before it's a pretty generic
of<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.849> bigger<00:02:18.090> bodies<00:02:18.599> with<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.469> Batman

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
of the bigger bodies with the Batman

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.580 
of the bigger bodies with the Batman
forearms<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.980> boots<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.280> are<00:02:23.340> sculpted<00:02:23.879> on

I<00:02:24.650> don't<00:02:24.860> remember<00:02:25.040> if<00:02:25.310> Batman's<00:02:25.730> had

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
I don't remember if Batman's had

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.520 
I don't remember if Batman's had
sculpted<00:02:26.330> boots<00:02:26.540> before<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:27.080> those<00:02:27.230> might<00:02:27.470> be

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530

I<00:03:11.120> think<00:03:11.390> that's<00:03:11.540> a<00:03:11.599> little<00:03:11.690> disappointing

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
I think that's a little disappointing

I think that's a little disappointing
and<00:03:12.980> I<00:03:13.099> think<00:03:13.400> most<00:03:13.610> people<00:03:13.760> will<00:03:14.000> agree<00:03:14.060> with

and I think most people will agree with
agree<00:03:15.140> with<00:03:15.440> me<00:03:15.680> that<00:03:15.920> a<00:03:16.340> sub<00:03:16.700> figure<00:03:17.060> should

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
agree with me that a sub figure should

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.150 
agree with me that a sub figure should
be<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:18.049> little<00:03:18.319> bit<00:03:18.530> better<00:03:18.709> than<00:03:19.010> your

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
be a little bit better than your

be a little bit better than your
standard<00:03:19.370> figure<00:03:19.910> and<00:03:20.090> this<00:03:20.269> is<00:03:20.450> pretty<00:03:20.660> much

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870

on<00:03:21.049> course<00:03:21.410> for<00:03:22.090> standard<00:03:23.090> oh<00:03:23.299> well<00:03:23.780> let's

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
on course for standard oh well let's

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.839 
on course for standard oh well let's
look<00:03:24.379> at<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.590> articulation<00:03:24.860> real<00:03:25.430> quick<00:03:25.640> the

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
look at the articulation real quick the

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.620 
look at the articulation real quick the
head<00:03:26.470> no<00:03:27.470> up<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:27.829> down<00:03:27.890> really<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:29.150> can<00:03:29.389> kind

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
head no up and down really it can kind

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.420 
head no up and down really it can kind
of<00:03:29.690> go<00:03:29.810> down<00:03:29.989> just<00:03:30.019> a<00:03:30.319> tiny<00:03:30.500> bit<00:03:30.799> but<00:03:31.040> not

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
of go down just a tiny bit but not

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.970 
of go down just a tiny bit but not
enough<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:31.850> speak<00:03:32.120> of<00:03:32.329> it<00:03:32.989> does<00:03:33.410> rotate

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
enough to speak of it does rotate

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.789 
enough to speak of it does rotate
technically<00:03:34.850> but<00:03:34.970> it's<00:03:35.120> really<00:03:35.420> tight<00:03:35.780> but<00:03:36.530> I

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
technically but it's really tight but I

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.129 
technically but it's really tight but I
mean<00:03:36.950> that's<00:03:37.130> okay<00:03:37.400> I<00:03:37.430> guess<00:03:37.810> it's<00:03:38.810> not<00:03:38.989> gonna

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
mean that's okay I guess it's not gonna

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:40.809 
mean that's okay I guess it's not gonna
break<00:03:39.380> or<00:03:39.560> anything<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:39.980> hope<00:03:40.190> so<00:03:40.459> it's

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
break or anything I hope so it's

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.059 
break or anything I hope so it's
probably<00:03:41.299> okay<00:03:41.630> standard<00:03:42.590> ball<00:03:42.769> hinge

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
probably okay standard ball hinge

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.670
