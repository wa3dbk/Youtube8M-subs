00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
all right now let's take a look at our F

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:43.620 
all right now let's take a look at our F
sharp<00:01:41.139> this<00:01:41.799> is<00:01:42.069> a<00:01:42.100> really<00:01:42.429> easy<00:01:42.459> easy<00:01:43.119> chord

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630

base<00:01:43.990> all<00:01:44.529> three<00:01:44.590> Black<00:01:45.249> Keys

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:56.090 

so<00:01:48.630> let's<00:01:48.780> put<00:01:48.990> them<00:01:49.049> together<00:01:54.799> and<00:01:55.799> we're

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
so let's put them together and we're

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.649 
so let's put them together and we're
left<00:01:56.280> with<00:01:56.490> one<00:01:56.759> more<00:01:57.060> key<00:01:57.299> we're<00:01:57.479> going<00:01:57.509> to

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
left with one more key we're going to

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.630 
left with one more key we're going to
call<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.020> B<00:01:58.560> flat<00:01:59.689> and<00:02:00.689> it's<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.979> as<00:02:02.250> weird

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
call this B flat and it's just as weird

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.169 
call this B flat and it's just as weird
as<00:02:03.060> its<00:02:03.450> cousin<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:03.990> be<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.649> white<00:02:05.549> key<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.000> two

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
as its cousin the be a white key and two

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.960 
as its cousin the be a white key and two
black<00:02:06.450> keys<00:02:06.720> now<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.200> have<00:02:07.439> lucky<00:02:08.220> two<00:02:08.729> white

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970
