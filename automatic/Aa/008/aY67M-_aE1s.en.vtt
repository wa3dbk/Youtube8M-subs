so in this episode I thought I'd take a
little<00:00:28.430> bit<00:00:28.580> of<00:00:28.700> a<00:00:28.790> trip<00:00:29.000> back<00:00:29.210> in<00:00:29.240> time<00:00:29.450> to<00:00:29.930> Bad

the actual game coming out in a couple
of<00:00:36.350> weeks<00:00:36.560> time<00:00:36.800> and<00:00:37.130> I<00:00:37.910> found<00:00:38.150> myself<00:00:38.270> going

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
of weeks time and I found myself going

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.850 
of weeks time and I found myself going
back<00:00:38.720> to<00:00:38.840> Battlefield<00:00:39.260> 3<00:00:39.470> and<00:00:39.650> being

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
back to Battlefield 3 and being

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.830 
back to Battlefield 3 and being
completely<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:40.550> utterly<00:00:40.690> disappointed<00:00:41.690> with

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
completely and utterly disappointed with

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.110 
completely and utterly disappointed with
the<00:00:41.960> game<00:00:42.140> for<00:00:42.830> me<00:00:42.950> it<00:00:43.070> was<00:00:43.190> a<00:00:43.220> massive<00:00:43.610> letdown

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
the game for me it was a massive letdown

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.880 
the game for me it was a massive letdown
in<00:00:44.330> comparison<00:00:44.989> to<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:45.230> two<00:00:45.410> games<00:00:45.680> either

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
in comparison to the two games either

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.740 
in comparison to the two games either
side<00:00:46.220> of<00:00:46.250> it<00:00:46.460> bad<00:00:46.640> company<00:00:46.970> 2<00:00:47.150> and<00:00:47.330> battlefield

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
side of it bad company 2 and battlefield

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.260 
side of it bad company 2 and battlefield
4<00:00:47.830> so<00:00:48.830> I<00:00:48.860> went<00:00:49.129> even<00:00:49.250> further<00:00:49.520> back<00:00:49.790> and<00:00:50.000> came

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
4 so I went even further back and came

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.180 
4 so I went even further back and came
back<00:00:50.300> to<00:00:50.840> perhaps<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:51.410> best<00:00:51.590> game<00:00:51.830> I<00:00:52.010> have

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
back to perhaps the best game I have

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.250 
back to perhaps the best game I have
ever<00:00:52.370> played<00:00:52.520> in<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:53.180> Battlefield<00:00:53.600> series<00:00:53.690> so

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
ever played in the Battlefield series so

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.790 
ever played in the Battlefield series so
far<00:00:54.620> I<00:00:54.980> say<00:00:55.850> so<00:00:55.909> far<00:00:56.420> because<00:00:56.690> I<00:00:57.050> really<00:00:57.559> did

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
far I say so far because I really did

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.460 
far I say so far because I really did
enjoy<00:00:58.159> the<00:00:58.339> beta<00:00:58.550> for<00:00:58.820> bf4<00:00:59.360> and<00:00:59.600> I<00:00:59.989> think<00:01:00.320> it's

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
enjoy the beta for bf4 and I think it's

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.290 
enjoy the beta for bf4 and I think it's
probably<00:01:00.650> gonna<00:01:00.920> overtake<00:01:01.400> Bad<00:01:01.640> Company<00:01:01.879> 2<00:01:02.059> in

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
probably gonna overtake Bad Company 2 in

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.700 
probably gonna overtake Bad Company 2 in
terms<00:01:02.420> of<00:01:02.629> probability<00:01:03.229> for<00:01:03.409> me<00:01:03.530> and

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
terms of probability for me and

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.740 
terms of probability for me and
replayability<00:01:04.269> wanting<00:01:05.269> to<00:01:05.360> play<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.600> game

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
replayability wanting to play the game

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.170 
replayability wanting to play the game
all<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:05.930> time<00:01:06.220> when<00:01:07.220> I<00:01:07.250> play<00:01:07.520> Bad<00:01:07.760> Company<00:01:08.000> 2

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
all the time when I play Bad Company 2

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.940 
all the time when I play Bad Company 2
however<00:01:08.510> it<00:01:09.110> was<00:01:09.290> one<00:01:09.409> of<00:01:09.500> those<00:01:09.590> games<00:01:09.830> I

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
however it was one of those games I

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.680 
however it was one of those games I
could<00:01:10.070> not<00:01:10.550> put<00:01:10.760> down<00:01:11.030> whereas<00:01:11.540> with

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
could not put down whereas with

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.300 
could not put down whereas with
Battlefield<00:01:12.110> 3<00:01:12.380> I<00:01:12.530> got<00:01:12.860> increasingly

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
Battlefield 3 I got increasingly

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.399 
Battlefield 3 I got increasingly
frustrated<00:01:14.210> with<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.450> game<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:15.320> a<00:01:15.350> point

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
frustrated with the game to a point

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:16.480 
frustrated with the game to a point
where<00:01:15.770> I've<00:01:15.860> come<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.220> end<00:01:16.340> of<00:01:16.430> the

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
where I've come to the end of the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.399 
where I've come to the end of the
two-year<00:01:16.670> cycle<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:17.450> I'm<00:01:17.510> really<00:01:17.900> wanting

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
two-year cycle and I'm really wanting

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.260 
two-year cycle and I'm really wanting
the<00:01:18.560> next<00:01:18.799> game<00:01:19.010> with<00:01:19.280> bad<00:01:19.460> company<00:01:19.670> 2<00:01:20.060> I

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
the next game with bad company 2 I

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.930 
the next game with bad company 2 I
didn't<00:01:20.990> have<00:01:21.200> that<00:01:21.350> feeling<00:01:21.409> I<00:01:22.130> mean<00:01:22.729> if<00:01:22.850> you

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
didn't have that feeling I mean if you

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.880 
didn't have that feeling I mean if you
took<00:01:23.120> battlefield<00:01:23.630> 3<00:01:23.870> completely<00:01:24.500> out<00:01:24.620> of<00:01:24.650> the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
took battlefield 3 completely out of the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.410 
took battlefield 3 completely out of the
equation<00:01:24.920> here<00:01:25.610> and<00:01:25.760> you<00:01:25.850> went<00:01:26.060> from<00:01:26.240> Bad

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
equation here and you went from Bad

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.200 
equation here and you went from Bad
Company<00:01:26.659> 2<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:27.200> battlefield<00:01:27.710> 4<00:01:28.009> I<00:01:28.280> think<00:01:28.729> that

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
Company 2 to battlefield 4 I think that

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.880 
Company 2 to battlefield 4 I think that
would<00:01:29.360> probably<00:01:29.539> be<00:01:29.719> the<00:01:29.840> best<00:01:30.200> jump<00:01:30.530> that's

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
would probably be the best jump that's

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.889 
would probably be the best jump that's
ever<00:01:31.159> been<00:01:31.340> made<00:01:31.579> between<00:01:31.820> a<00:01:32.060> franchise<00:01:32.750> of

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
ever been made between a franchise of

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.319 
ever been made between a franchise of
games<00:01:33.140> ever<00:01:33.500> because<00:01:33.979> Bad<00:01:34.520> Company<00:01:34.820> 2<00:01:35.000> was<00:01:35.299> a

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
games ever because Bad Company 2 was a

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.120 
games ever because Bad Company 2 was a
really<00:01:35.750> relaxed<00:01:36.320> version<00:01:36.710> of<00:01:36.829> Battlefield

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
really relaxed version of Battlefield

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.399 
really relaxed version of Battlefield
the<00:01:37.820> dice<00:01:38.030> developer<00:01:38.450> team<00:01:38.600> even<00:01:38.960> said<00:01:39.229> that

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
the dice developer team even said that

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.560 
the dice developer team even said that
it<00:01:39.500> was<00:01:39.619> much<00:01:39.859> easier<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:40.579> much<00:01:40.759> more<00:01:40.820> fun<00:01:41.060> to

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
it was much easier and much more fun to

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.690 
it was much easier and much more fun to
develop<00:01:42.020> than<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.710> games<00:01:42.920> previous<00:01:43.490> to<00:01:43.670> that

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
develop than the games previous to that

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.459 
develop than the games previous to that
because<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.240> bad<00:01:44.359> company<00:01:44.630> series<00:01:44.810> was<00:01:45.320> all

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.469 
because the bad company series was all

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:46.929 
because the bad company series was all
about<00:01:45.710> having<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:46.100> bit<00:01:46.250> of<00:01:46.340> a<00:01:46.399> laugh

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
about having a bit of a laugh

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.580 
about having a bit of a laugh
it<00:01:47.149> was<00:01:47.359> very<00:01:47.570> laid<00:01:47.869> back<00:01:47.899> there<00:01:48.320> was<00:01:48.409> some

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
it was very laid back there was some

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.289 
it was very laid back there was some
comedy<00:01:48.920> in<00:01:49.130> there<00:01:49.340> as<00:01:49.460> well<00:01:49.609> and<00:01:49.759> you<00:01:49.820> can<00:01:49.880> feel

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
comedy in there as well and you can feel

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.450 
comedy in there as well and you can feel
that<00:01:50.509> in<00:01:50.689> the<00:01:50.780> multiplayer<00:01:51.289> it<00:01:51.950> just<00:01:52.159> feels<00:01:52.340> so

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
that in the multiplayer it just feels so

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.249 
that in the multiplayer it just feels so
much<00:01:52.579> more<00:01:52.729> arcadey<00:01:53.359> than<00:01:53.689> what<00:01:53.810> battlefield

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
much more arcadey than what battlefield

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.469 
much more arcadey than what battlefield
3<00:01:54.500> did<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:54.920> I<00:01:55.429> think<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.700> jump<00:01:56.000> between<00:01:56.179> the

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
3 did and I think the jump between the

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.469 
3 did and I think the jump between the
two<00:01:56.659> was<00:01:56.869> probably<00:01:57.170> too<00:01:57.500> big<00:01:58.119> but<00:01:59.119> looking<00:01:59.390> at

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
two was probably too big but looking at

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.719 
two was probably too big but looking at
battlefield<00:01:59.960> 4<00:02:00.229> I<00:02:00.500> can<00:02:00.890> really<00:02:01.189> see<00:02:01.490> some

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
battlefield 4 I can really see some

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.700 
battlefield 4 I can really see some
similarities<00:02:02.149> between<00:02:02.570> Bad<00:02:02.960> Company<00:02:03.229> 2<00:02:03.380> and

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
similarities between Bad Company 2 and

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.789 
similarities between Bad Company 2 and
that<00:02:04.039> game<00:02:04.280> most<00:02:05.060> specifically<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:06.079> sound<00:02:06.469> in

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
that game most specifically the sound in

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:07.929 
that game most specifically the sound in
Bad<00:02:07.310> Company<00:02:07.609> 2

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
Bad Company 2

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.850 
Bad Company 2
the<00:02:08.179> sound<00:02:08.479> engine<00:02:08.869> was<00:02:09.020> absolutely

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
the sound engine was absolutely

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.070 
the sound engine was absolutely
phenomenal<00:02:10.070> and<00:02:10.729> in<00:02:10.789> battlefield<00:02:11.270> 3<00:02:11.510> for<00:02:11.690> me

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
phenomenal and in battlefield 3 for me

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.440 
phenomenal and in battlefield 3 for me
it<00:02:12.290> was<00:02:12.500> really<00:02:12.530> disappointing<00:02:13.210> but<00:02:14.210> from

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
it was really disappointing but from

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.840 
it was really disappointing but from
having<00:02:14.720> played<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.020> beta<00:02:15.230> for<00:02:15.590> bf4<00:02:16.130> the

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
having played the beta for bf4 the

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.150 
having played the beta for bf4 the
sounds<00:02:17.300> are<00:02:17.450> just<00:02:17.750> amazing<00:02:18.440> it's<00:02:18.680> so<00:02:18.800> much

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
sounds are just amazing it's so much

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.950 
sounds are just amazing it's so much
more<00:02:19.370> immersive<00:02:19.640> than<00:02:20.030> what<00:02:20.150> battlefield<00:02:20.690> 3

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
more immersive than what battlefield 3

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.400 
more immersive than what battlefield 3
was<00:02:21.370> take<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.520> m1911<00:02:23.420> for<00:02:23.600> example<00:02:24.080> in<00:02:24.230> Bad

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
was take the m1911 for example in Bad

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.170 
was take the m1911 for example in Bad
Company<00:02:24.680> 2<00:02:24.800> that<00:02:25.069> thing<00:02:25.280> sounded<00:02:25.610> like<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.790> hand

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
Company 2 that thing sounded like a hand

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.570 
Company 2 that thing sounded like a hand
cannon<00:02:26.690> in<00:02:26.810> battlefield<00:02:27.500> 3<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:28.100> sounded<00:02:28.550> like

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
cannon in battlefield 3 it sounded like

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.970 
cannon in battlefield 3 it sounded like
a<00:02:28.700> cap<00:02:28.970> gun<00:02:29.210> but<00:02:29.810> in<00:02:29.930> battlefield<00:02:30.410> 4<00:02:30.470> having

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
a cap gun but in battlefield 4 having

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.530 
a cap gun but in battlefield 4 having
heard<00:02:31.160> all<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.580> other<00:02:31.790> gun<00:02:32.090> sounds<00:02:32.420> that

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
heard all the other gun sounds that

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.540 
heard all the other gun sounds that
we've<00:02:32.660> heard<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:33.050> far<00:02:33.080> I<00:02:33.560> think<00:02:34.100> we're<00:02:34.430> going

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
we've heard so far I think we're going

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.010 
we've heard so far I think we're going
to<00:02:34.610> be<00:02:34.730> going<00:02:34.970> back<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.450> hand

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
to be going back to the hand

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.470 
to be going back to the hand
version<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.620> we<00:02:36.710> did<00:02:36.920> have<00:02:37.100> in<00:02:37.220> bc2<00:02:37.580> the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
version that we did have in bc2 the

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.000 
version that we did have in bc2 the
sounds<00:02:38.900> overall<00:02:39.260> just<00:02:39.440> sound<00:02:39.650> much<00:02:39.980> more

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
sounds overall just sound much more

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.830 
sounds overall just sound much more
punchy<00:02:40.760> than<00:02:40.940> they<00:02:41.030> did<00:02:41.090> in<00:02:41.240> battlefield<00:02:41.810> 3

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
punchy than they did in battlefield 3

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.170 
punchy than they did in battlefield 3
for<00:02:42.230> battlefield<00:02:42.650> 4<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.460> can<00:02:43.670> see<00:02:43.910> why

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
for battlefield 4 and I can see why

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.120 
for battlefield 4 and I can see why
they've<00:02:44.420> returned<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:45.080> it<00:02:45.200> because<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.920> was

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
they've returned to it because it was

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.910 
they've returned to it because it was
such<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.610> letdown<00:02:46.910> in<00:02:47.270> battlefield<00:02:47.720> 3<00:02:47.920> coming

being<00:03:30.080> a<00:03:30.200> problem<00:03:30.380> for<00:03:30.590> me<00:03:30.920> but<00:03:31.070> looking

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
being a problem for me but looking

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.100 
being a problem for me but looking
forward<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:31.910> battlefield<00:03:32.420> 3<00:03:32.660> and<00:03:32.690> playing

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
forward to battlefield 3 and playing

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.480 
forward to battlefield 3 and playing
that<00:03:33.290> game<00:03:33.500> for<00:03:33.710> a<00:03:33.740> couple<00:03:33.800> of<00:03:34.100> years<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:34.400> then

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
that game for a couple of years and then

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.850 
that game for a couple of years and then
coming<00:03:34.790> back<00:03:34.960> you<00:03:35.960> suddenly<00:03:36.380> start<00:03:36.770> to

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
coming back you suddenly start to

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.860 
coming back you suddenly start to
realize<00:03:37.340> that<00:03:37.370> this<00:03:37.820> game<00:03:38.060> was<00:03:38.240> much<00:03:38.600> more

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
realize that this game was much more

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.199 
realize that this game was much more
arcadey<00:03:39.320> than<00:03:39.620> battlefield<00:03:40.100> 3<00:03:40.340> was<00:03:40.520> but<00:03:41.090> I

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
arcadey than battlefield 3 was but I

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.120 
arcadey than battlefield 3 was but I
kind<00:03:41.540> of<00:03:41.600> enjoyed<00:03:41.930> that<00:03:42.230> because<00:03:42.709> it<00:03:42.830> made<00:03:42.980> me

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
kind of enjoyed that because it made me

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.560 
kind of enjoyed that because it made me
feel<00:03:43.280> good<00:03:43.340> that<00:03:43.580> I<00:03:43.700> could<00:03:43.940> get<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.090> headshot<00:03:44.450> on

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
feel good that I could get a headshot on

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.260 
feel good that I could get a headshot on
a<00:03:44.630> running<00:03:44.990> target<00:03:45.170> 150<00:03:46.010> meters<00:03:46.340> away<00:03:46.459> made<00:03:47.150> me

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
a running target 150 meters away made me

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.600 
a running target 150 meters away made me
feel<00:03:47.420> like<00:03:47.480> an<00:03:47.630> absolute<00:03:47.720> boss<00:03:48.260> of<00:03:49.220> course<00:03:49.310> the

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
feel like an absolute boss of course the

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.520 
feel like an absolute boss of course the
sniping<00:03:49.940> mechanics<00:03:50.390> in<00:03:50.540> battlefield<00:03:50.990> 4<00:03:51.050> is

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
sniping mechanics in battlefield 4 is

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.230 
sniping mechanics in battlefield 4 is
going<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.100> be<00:03:52.190> much<00:03:52.459> different<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:53.030> what<00:03:53.150> it

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
going to be much different to what it

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.090 
going to be much different to what it
was<00:03:53.360> in<00:03:53.480> battlefield<00:03:53.870> 3<00:03:54.080> and<00:03:54.110> bad<00:03:54.500> company<00:03:54.920> 2

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
was in battlefield 3 and bad company 2

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.250 
was in battlefield 3 and bad company 2
having<00:03:55.730> played<00:03:55.880> the<00:03:56.000> beta<00:03:56.209> I<00:03:56.660> felt<00:03:57.020> that<00:03:57.140> the

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
having played the beta I felt that the

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.350 
having played the beta I felt that the
bullet<00:03:57.530> velocity<00:03:57.650> is<00:03:58.130> much<00:03:58.310> slower<00:03:58.700> the

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
bullet velocity is much slower the

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.270 
bullet velocity is much slower the
bullet<00:03:59.690> trail<00:03:59.959> actually<00:04:00.260> puts<00:04:00.680> me<00:04:00.800> off<00:04:01.010> where

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
bullet trail actually puts me off where

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.340 
bullet trail actually puts me off where
the<00:04:01.370> target<00:04:01.730> should<00:04:01.940> be<00:04:02.060> going<00:04:02.390> to<00:04:02.600> and<00:04:02.810> it's

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
the target should be going to and it's

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.990 
the target should be going to and it's
making<00:04:03.530> me<00:04:03.740> judge<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.160> distance<00:04:04.490> a<00:04:04.670> hell<00:04:04.850> of<00:04:04.940> a

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
making me judge the distance a hell of a

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.250 
making me judge the distance a hell of a
lot<00:04:05.150> more<00:04:05.180> differently<00:04:05.720> than<00:04:05.900> it<00:04:06.020> did<00:04:06.110> in

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
lot more differently than it did in

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.750 
lot more differently than it did in
battlefield<00:04:06.709> 3<00:04:06.770> which<00:04:07.130> is<00:04:07.160> where<00:04:07.459> I<00:04:07.490> learned

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
battlefield 3 which is where I learned

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.220 
battlefield 3 which is where I learned
to<00:04:07.910> snipe<00:04:08.120> most<00:04:08.360> of<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:08.570> time<00:04:08.750> anyway

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
to snipe most of the time anyway

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.220 
to snipe most of the time anyway
bad<00:04:10.130> company<00:04:10.430> twos<00:04:10.760> handgun<00:04:11.270> system<00:04:11.690> also<00:04:11.900> had

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
bad company twos handgun system also had

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.750 
bad company twos handgun system also had
a<00:04:12.260> massive<00:04:12.500> flaw<00:04:12.800> in<00:04:12.920> it<00:04:13.010> for<00:04:13.160> me<00:04:13.250> looking<00:04:13.520> back

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
a massive flaw in it for me looking back

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.120 
a massive flaw in it for me looking back
now<00:04:13.970> those<00:04:14.660> things<00:04:14.930> are<00:04:15.080> like<00:04:15.200> lasers<00:04:15.740> they

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
now those things are like lasers they

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.220 
now those things are like lasers they
can<00:04:16.340> go<00:04:16.489> miles<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.359> bullet<00:04:17.630> will<00:04:17.750> just<00:04:17.959> fly

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
can go miles the bullet will just fly

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.840 
can go miles the bullet will just fly
across<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.620> map<00:04:18.890> and<00:04:19.100> hit<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.370> target<00:04:19.580> as

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
across the map and hit the target as

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.909 
across the map and hit the target as
intended<00:04:20.299> but<00:04:21.140> there<00:04:21.410> doesn't<00:04:21.650> seem<00:04:21.680> to<00:04:21.830> be

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
intended but there doesn't seem to be

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.620 
intended but there doesn't seem to be
any<00:04:22.190> bullet<00:04:22.580> drop<00:04:22.760> on<00:04:22.910> them<00:04:23.060> at<00:04:23.150> all<00:04:23.330> and

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
any bullet drop on them at all and

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.420 
any bullet drop on them at all and
they're<00:04:24.020> so<00:04:24.230> powerful<00:04:24.800> that<00:04:24.830> they<00:04:25.040> can<00:04:25.250> take

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
they're so powerful that they can take

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.100 
they're so powerful that they can take
out<00:04:25.610> somebody<00:04:25.970> in<00:04:26.030> about<00:04:26.210> four<00:04:26.450> or<00:04:26.480> five<00:04:26.780> shots

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
out somebody in about four or five shots

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.350 
out somebody in about four or five shots
at<00:04:27.260> pretty<00:04:27.500> much<00:04:27.530> any<00:04:27.800> range<00:04:28.220> so<00:04:28.640> there's

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
at pretty much any range so there's

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.030 
at pretty much any range so there's
another<00:04:29.660> floor<00:04:29.990> that<00:04:30.110> I<00:04:30.140> didn't<00:04:30.530> notice<00:04:30.890> when

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
another floor that I didn't notice when

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.440 
another floor that I didn't notice when
I<00:04:31.100> used<00:04:31.400> to<00:04:31.520> play<00:04:31.640> the<00:04:31.820> game<00:04:31.970> a<00:04:32.000> couple<00:04:32.360> of

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
I used to play the game a couple of

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.930 
I used to play the game a couple of
years<00:04:32.570> ago<00:04:32.750> but<00:04:33.050> now<00:04:33.260> it<00:04:34.160> seems<00:04:34.430> so<00:04:34.610> much<00:04:34.760> more

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
years ago but now it seems so much more

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.000 
years ago but now it seems so much more
fun<00:04:35.150> to<00:04:35.180> me<00:04:35.450> because<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:35.930> game<00:04:36.110> is<00:04:36.290> so<00:04:36.440> relaxed

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
fun to me because the game is so relaxed

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.130 
fun to me because the game is so relaxed
and<00:04:37.160> I'm<00:04:37.640> not<00:04:37.820> playing<00:04:38.120> it<00:04:38.300> on<00:04:38.419> the<00:04:38.450> regular<00:04:38.930> so

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
and I'm not playing it on the regular so

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.110 
and I'm not playing it on the regular so
for<00:04:39.410> me<00:04:39.560> it's<00:04:40.070> kind<00:04:40.340> of<00:04:40.370> a<00:04:40.460> feature<00:04:40.640> that<00:04:40.880> I<00:04:40.910> now

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
for me it's kind of a feature that I now

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.330 
for me it's kind of a feature that I now
enjoy<00:04:41.650> moving<00:04:42.650> onto<00:04:42.770> a<00:04:42.890> couple<00:04:43.070> of<00:04:43.220> things

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
enjoy moving onto a couple of things

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.430 
enjoy moving onto a couple of things
that<00:04:43.520> I<00:04:43.550> really<00:04:43.940> do<00:04:44.120> enjoy<00:04:44.360> about<00:04:44.930> Bad<00:04:45.169> Company

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
that I really do enjoy about Bad Company

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.590 
that I really do enjoy about Bad Company
2<00:04:45.620> I've<00:04:46.220> already<00:04:46.490> spoken<00:04:46.700> about<00:04:46.820> the<00:04:47.060> sound<00:04:47.300> so

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
2 I've already spoken about the sound so

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.640 
2 I've already spoken about the sound so
we'll<00:04:47.750> probably<00:04:47.840> leave<00:04:48.110> that<00:04:48.290> to<00:04:48.440> one<00:04:48.620> side

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
we'll probably leave that to one side

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.719 
we'll probably leave that to one side

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.969

balance<00:04:50.059> I<00:04:50.210> think<00:04:50.240> it<00:04:50.569> was<00:04:50.689> so<00:04:50.960> much<00:04:51.319> better<00:04:51.650> in

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.499 
balance I think it was so much better in
Bad<00:04:52.159> Company<00:04:52.400> 2<00:04:52.550> than<00:04:52.759> it<00:04:52.849> was<00:04:52.969> in<00:04:53.089> battlefield

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
Bad Company 2 than it was in battlefield

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
have been looking back at what they did

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.679 
have been looking back at what they did
in<00:04:58.099> Bad<00:04:58.279> Company<00:04:58.520> 2<00:04:58.669> and<00:04:58.939> taking<00:04:59.210> a<00:04:59.300> few<00:04:59.479> things

00:04:59.679 --> 00:04:59.689 
in Bad Company 2 and taking a few things

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:02.499 
in Bad Company 2 and taking a few things
forward<00:05:00.039> the<00:05:01.039> main<00:05:01.219> thing<00:05:01.520> is<00:05:01.729> the<00:05:01.939> defib<00:05:02.360> to

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
forward the main thing is the defib to

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:03.879 
forward the main thing is the defib to
the<00:05:02.599> recharge<00:05:02.990> time<00:05:03.050> on<00:05:03.379> those<00:05:03.499> things<00:05:03.770> is

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
the recharge time on those things is

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:05.499 
the recharge time on those things is
about<00:05:04.069> two<00:05:04.249> to<00:05:04.400> three<00:05:04.430> seconds<00:05:05.089> and<00:05:05.210> you<00:05:05.270> don't

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
about two to three seconds and you don't

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:07.119 
about two to three seconds and you don't
have<00:05:05.719> the<00:05:05.870> choice<00:05:06.080> of<00:05:06.349> choosing<00:05:06.529> to<00:05:06.800> revive

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:07.129 
have the choice of choosing to revive

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:08.890 
have the choice of choosing to revive
somebody<00:05:07.490> earlier<00:05:07.699> than<00:05:08.089> that<00:05:08.270> I<00:05:08.509> think

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
somebody earlier than that I think

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.600 
somebody earlier than that I think
that's<00:05:09.050> a<00:05:09.110> really<00:05:09.439> good<00:05:09.559> system<00:05:09.919> because<00:05:10.069> it's

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
that's a really good system because it's

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.640 
that's a really good system because it's
like<00:05:10.849> it<00:05:11.120> would<00:05:11.270> be<00:05:11.330> an<00:05:11.599> actual<00:05:12.020> set<00:05:12.199> of<00:05:12.229> defibs

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
like it would be an actual set of defibs

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.529 
like it would be an actual set of defibs
in<00:05:12.830> real<00:05:12.979> life<00:05:13.219> of<00:05:13.430> course<00:05:13.580> it<00:05:14.059> can't<00:05:14.330> bring

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
in real life of course it can't bring

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:15.850 
in real life of course it can't bring
somebody<00:05:14.809> to<00:05:14.960> back<00:05:15.229> to<00:05:15.379> life<00:05:15.529> that's<00:05:15.710> been

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
somebody to back to life that's been

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.279 
somebody to back to life that's been
shot<00:05:16.039> in<00:05:16.159> the<00:05:16.249> heart<00:05:16.430> but<00:05:16.789> the<00:05:17.539> recharge<00:05:18.020> time

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
shot in the heart but the recharge time

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.170 
shot in the heart but the recharge time
on<00:05:18.469> them<00:05:18.740> actually<00:05:19.159> was<00:05:19.279> more<00:05:19.430> realistic<00:05:19.789> and

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
on them actually was more realistic and

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.119 
on them actually was more realistic and
I<00:05:20.629> loved<00:05:20.900> the<00:05:21.110> sound<00:05:21.319> that<00:05:21.529> those<00:05:21.710> things<00:05:21.919> make

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:22.129 
I loved the sound that those things make

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:24.850 
I loved the sound that those things make

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
where your enemies were and the motion

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.230 
where your enemies were and the motion
balls<00:05:57.949> could<00:05:58.159> be<00:05:58.219> replenished<00:05:58.789> by<00:05:58.849> going<00:05:59.149> up

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240

to<00:05:59.270> ammo<00:05:59.599> packs<00:05:59.839> as<00:05:59.990> well<00:06:00.139> so<00:06:00.259> you<00:06:00.349> could<00:06:00.529> just

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
to ammo packs as well so you could just

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.050 
to ammo packs as well so you could just
literally<00:06:01.009> move<00:06:01.279> around<00:06:01.520> the<00:06:01.669> map<00:06:01.819> all<00:06:01.969> the

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
literally move around the map all the

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.659 
literally move around the map all the
time<00:06:02.270> find<00:06:02.899> an<00:06:03.110> ammo<00:06:03.229> box<00:06:03.499> replenish<00:06:04.189> them<00:06:04.399> and

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
time find an ammo box replenish them and

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:05.829 
time find an ammo box replenish them and
throw<00:06:04.999> them<00:06:05.029> out<00:06:05.240> again<00:06:05.360> of<00:06:05.599> course<00:06:05.659> it

00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:05.839 
throw them out again of course it

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:07.269 
throw them out again of course it
doesn't<00:06:05.959> just<00:06:06.169> help<00:06:06.259> yourself<00:06:06.709> it<00:06:06.919> helps<00:06:07.159> the

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:07.279 
doesn't just help yourself it helps the

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:09.760 
doesn't just help yourself it helps the
team<00:06:07.459> as<00:06:07.669> well<00:06:07.849> and<00:06:08.180> so<00:06:08.810> it<00:06:09.169> just<00:06:09.199> made<00:06:09.529> it<00:06:09.649> much

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
team as well and so it just made it much

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.379 
team as well and so it just made it much
more<00:06:09.949> fluid<00:06:10.370> than<00:06:10.520> it<00:06:10.639> was<00:06:10.759> in<00:06:10.909> battlefield<00:06:11.330> 3

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
more fluid than it was in battlefield 3

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.029 
more fluid than it was in battlefield 3
and<00:06:11.719> I'm<00:06:11.810> so<00:06:12.080> glad<00:06:12.319> they've<00:06:12.589> gone<00:06:12.709> back<00:06:12.889> to

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 
and I'm so glad they've gone back to

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.999 
and I'm so glad they've gone back to
that<00:06:13.159> system<00:06:13.370> in<00:06:13.639> battlefield<00:06:14.120> 4<00:06:15.009> destruction

they<00:06:49.159> just<00:06:49.189> wanted<00:06:49.550> to<00:06:49.610> make<00:06:49.699> sure<00:06:49.999> that

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 
they just wanted to make sure that

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.579 
they just wanted to make sure that
frames<00:06:50.419> kept<00:06:50.719> were<00:06:50.839> kept<00:06:51.080> as<00:06:51.229> high<00:06:51.409> as

frames kept were kept as high as

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:53.290 
frames kept were kept as high as
possible<00:06:51.680> because<00:06:52.580> of<00:06:52.759> course<00:06:53.029> the<00:06:53.149> game

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.300 
possible because of course the game

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.999 
possible because of course the game
wasn't<00:06:53.479> fully<00:06:53.719> optimized<00:06:54.199> so<00:06:54.379> it<00:06:54.499> will<00:06:54.830> be

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:55.009 
wasn't fully optimized so it will be

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:57.219 
wasn't fully optimized so it will be
there<00:06:55.219> in<00:06:55.399> the<00:06:55.520> final<00:06:55.849> game<00:06:55.999> with<00:06:56.899> all<00:06:57.080> of

there in the final game with all of

00:06:57.229 --> 00:06:58.929 
there in the final game with all of
these<00:06:57.319> cool<00:06:57.649> awesome<00:06:58.069> features<00:06:58.490> being<00:06:58.639> moved

00:06:58.929 --> 00:06:58.939 
these cool awesome features being moved

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:01.420

forward<00:06:59.209> into<00:06:59.329> battlefield<00:06:59.719> 4<00:07:00.229> I'm<00:07:00.500> thinking

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:01.430 
forward into battlefield 4 I'm thinking

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.860

that<00:07:01.550> the<00:07:01.639> dice<00:07:01.849> developers<00:07:02.419> might<00:07:02.599> have<00:07:02.719> had

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870 
that the dice developers might have had

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.430 
that the dice developers might have had
themselves<00:07:03.050> a

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 
themselves a

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.810 
themselves a
little<00:07:03.590> bit<00:07:03.680> of<00:07:03.770> a<00:07:03.830> better<00:07:04.010> time<00:07:04.340> developing
