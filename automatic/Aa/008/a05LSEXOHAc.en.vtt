and put aside the packaging for the
iphone<00:00:32.250> 6<00:00:32.610> plus<00:00:33.230> let's<00:00:34.230> pull<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.710> scale<00:00:35.010> into

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
iphone 6 plus let's pull the scale into

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.830 
iphone 6 plus let's pull the scale into
view<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.579> we'll<00:00:35.850> talk<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> little<00:00:36.420> bit<00:00:36.660> about

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
view and we'll talk a little bit about

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.600 
view and we'll talk a little bit about
wait<00:00:37.140> here<00:00:37.440> there's<00:00:37.620> nothing<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> inside

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
wait here there's nothing on the inside

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.180 
wait here there's nothing on the inside
of<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.940> case<00:00:39.210> zero<00:00:39.600> grams<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.379> scale<00:00:40.920> and

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
of this case zero grams on the scale and

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.250 
of this case zero grams on the scale and
it<00:00:41.520> comes<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:41.910> at<00:00:42.030> about<00:00:42.120> fifty<00:00:42.690> four<00:00:42.930> grams

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
it comes in at about fifty four grams

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.590 
it comes in at about fifty four grams
now<00:00:43.710> let's<00:00:44.460> go<00:00:44.579> ahead<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.730> put<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.090> six<00:00:45.329> plus

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
now let's go ahead and put the six plus

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.360 
now let's go ahead and put the six plus
into<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.410> case<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:46.980> we're<00:00:47.070> going<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.219> do

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
into this case and we're going to do

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.639 
into this case and we're going to do
button<00:00:47.730> side<00:00:47.969> first<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.719> we'll<00:00:49.200> just<00:00:49.410> kind<00:00:49.590> of

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
button side first so we'll just kind of

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.130 
button side first so we'll just kind of
line<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.160> up<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.059> pretty<00:00:51.270> easy<00:00:51.390> fit<00:00:51.899> if

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
line it up and it's a pretty easy fit if

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.619 
line it up and it's a pretty easy fit if
you've<00:00:52.500> got<00:00:52.649> screen<00:00:53.010> shields<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:54.090> should<00:00:54.360> work

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
you've got screen shields it should work

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.689 
you've got screen shields it should work
decently<00:00:55.260> well<00:00:55.590> enough<00:00:55.980> unless<00:00:56.250> you've<00:00:56.520> got<00:00:56.550> a

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
decently well enough unless you've got a

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.430 
decently well enough unless you've got a
really<00:00:57.030> thick<00:00:57.420> screen<00:00:57.750> shield<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.289> might

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
really thick screen shield and you might

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.170 
really thick screen shield and you might
run<00:00:58.590> into<00:00:58.770> issues<00:00:59.010> here<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.760> let's<00:00:59.940> take<00:01:00.149> a

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
run into issues here and let's take a

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.700 
run into issues here and let's take a
look<00:01:00.390> at<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.539> up<00:01:00.750> close<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.350> you're<00:01:01.530> going<00:01:01.649> to

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
look at it up close so you're going to

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.080 
look at it up close so you're going to
notice<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.160> do<00:01:02.399> get<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> lay<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> table

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
notice you do get a lay on the table

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.210 
notice you do get a lay on the table
design<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.080> one<00:01:04.320> all<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.979> way<00:01:05.100> around

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
design with this one all the way around

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.060 
design with this one all the way around
the<00:01:05.460> edges<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.030> face<00:01:06.240> down<00:01:06.540> on<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> flat<00:01:06.990> surface

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
the edges so face down on a flat surface

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.740 
the edges so face down on a flat surface
the<00:01:08.070> case<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.490> touching<00:01:08.939> not<00:01:09.150> your<00:01:09.330> screen

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
the case is touching not your screen

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.570 
the case is touching not your screen
down<00:01:10.409> below<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:11.040> see<00:01:11.070> what<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.520> looks

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
down below you can see what this looks

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.630 
down below you can see what this looks
like<00:01:11.850> from<00:01:12.000> an<00:01:12.299> accessibility<00:01:12.869> standpoint

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
like from an accessibility standpoint

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.399 
like from an accessibility standpoint
headphone<00:01:14.640> jack<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> most<00:01:15.869> part<00:01:16.140> is

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
headphone jack for the most part is

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.399 
headphone jack for the most part is
pretty<00:01:17.150> generous<00:01:18.150> however<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.869> could<00:01:19.200> run

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
pretty generous however you could run

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.050 
pretty generous however you could run
into<00:01:19.530> some<00:01:19.860> issues<00:01:19.950> there<00:01:20.220> with<00:01:20.549> oversized

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
into some issues there with oversized

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.640 
into some issues there with oversized
connectors<00:01:21.689> same<00:01:22.229> thing<00:01:22.439> goes<00:01:22.619> for

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
connectors same thing goes for

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.200 
connectors same thing goes for
third-party<00:01:23.070> lightning<00:01:23.759> connectors

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
third-party lightning connectors

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.120 
third-party lightning connectors
otherwise<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.810> looking<00:01:25.080> pretty<00:01:25.290> good<00:01:25.470> along

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
otherwise it's looking pretty good along

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.920 
otherwise it's looking pretty good along
the<00:01:26.310> side<00:01:26.520> you've<00:01:26.790> got<00:01:26.820> your<00:01:27.270> sleep<00:01:27.659> awake

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
the side you've got your sleep awake

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.899 
the side you've got your sleep awake
power<00:01:28.170> button<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.770> covered<00:01:28.979> up<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.430> it

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
power button that is covered up and it

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.240 
power button that is covered up and it
adds<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.960> little<00:01:31.320> bit<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.530> resistance<00:01:31.860> but

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
adds just a little bit of resistance but

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.249 
adds just a little bit of resistance but
nothing<00:01:32.610> too<00:01:32.790> terrible<00:01:33.000> up<00:01:33.509> along<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.049> top
