00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello today I want to talk about an anime that 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.820
 look when I started with this genre sk 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.790
 and at sukoi is from the same author 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.040
 June a romantic by the way the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.350
 mystery of this author is already 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.990
 bothering when I wanted an image of 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.480
 I realized that mangaka is not 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.430
 It goes out in public and there's no lack of fan 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.890
 says that she is a man and uses a 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.170
 pseudonym but I do not believe that for me 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.630
 she is a woman and if you do not go out at 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.630
 famous that they turned their works but 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.239
 good following with dry and this anime 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.030
 it's about three couples like June 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.640
 except that couples have no name 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.670
 and they do not have an animal either and like June 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.910
 well starting with the main couple 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.010
 this couple is onodera rickshaw and 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.489
 takano masamune than in his adolescence 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.039
 it was called saga masamune this story 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.620
 seems to start when onodera is 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.260
 transferred to the eye sleeve area instead 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.629
 of literature like elpidio he had 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.420
 transferred to literature and do not know how 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.850
 cojones finished have eye sleeves 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.860
 once you know your boss is here not 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.830
 tells him that he had never worked 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.950
 manga is here he does not look at him and he says 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.530
 then you will be useless onodera 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.259
 angry and proposes to himself not to leave 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.930
 that his boss thinks that about him suddenly 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.110
 they have to attend to a mangaka that 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.840
 he was about to deliver his manuscripts 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.909
 they check the manuscripts but it's 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.280
 here is not happy with the scene 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.740
 of the kiss and tells the mangaka that the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.710
 arrange the mangaka draw but he 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.229
 still not satisfied then says 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.479
 grab your pencil and start drawing me 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.090
 I'll give you a model onodera gets up and 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.880
 says I go for the models where they are 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.850
 he's here he does not grab him by the waist and what 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.640
 kiss in the mouth after that event or 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.500
 modera wants to give up more urgently not 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.049
 just for being in an area that does not 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.409
 like but also to be harassed by 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.229
 his boss when meeting his boss 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.019
 demands an explanation and this one answers 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.690
 with a simple but if it's for work or 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.830
 no , he was angry even more but he's 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.920
 here he does not look at it well 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.140
 and if perhaps you and I know each other 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.780
 Onodera replies that it is the first 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.480
 Once you see him suddenly have to go to 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.060
 the house of a mangaka to collect the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.460
 manuscripts in the middle of all that 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.220
 uncontrolled because the mangaka got depressed 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.320
 and it's here it does not help saying that 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.600
 I was going to kill if she does not finish the 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.480
 manuscript onodera can no longer stand 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.240
 and he tells the mangaka that he buys his 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.120
 work the animates and helps him out of that 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.580
 of pre to finish your work after 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.290

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.810
 begins to understand that despite everything 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.390

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.820

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.920
 This is the first time I see you 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.110

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.750

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.090
 tells him to stop playing with him is 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.670
 here he does not get up and he answers clear 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.190
 for you it was just a game he retires 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.590
 but he's saying when I was 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.990

 changed before I called saga masamune 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:51.420
 Onodera begins to remember to remember his 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.440

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.720

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.890
 countries about him rather he laughed at 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.590

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.560

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.050
