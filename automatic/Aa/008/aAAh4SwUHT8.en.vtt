Hi Guys and welcome to STUDIO KNIT. I'm Kristen and today we are making this BEE STITCH Pattern.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.990
This is a Brioche knit, which means it's light, fluffy, has some great dimension. The BEE

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.170
STITCH requires that we cast on an ODD number of stitches. There are four rows in total.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:35.570
And this first row is simply knitting the
knit stitch all the way across the row until

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.579
you get to the end. Now here on row two, we first do one knit stitch, and then it's the

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:53.450
K1B, that means Knit One Below. I have an entire video that is dedicated to learning

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.329
the Knit One Below stitch. I have a link in
the description below. So, if you're not familiar

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.329
with this stitch, please go check it out.
And here I will slow it down on the Knit One Below. 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.090
We put it in the Stitch Below and knit
through. Awesome. Then we knit one. 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:31.149
And we keep doing that pattern all the way across row two. Knit one below and knit one. Now

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:44.299
on row three, exactly like we did on row one, we are going to be just knitting all the way

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.079
across the row. Now on row four, we first
knit two stitches. And then it's time for

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:07.069
the Knit One Below. And we continue on doing Knit One and Knit One Below. Until we get

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:22.230
to these last two stitches. Those last two
stitches are simply knit and knit. So we just

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.390
continue these four rows until your piece
is the length you require. And if this video
