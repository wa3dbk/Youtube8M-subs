blades it's definitely a stainless steel
which<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.360> plus<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.750> know<00:01:24.840> you're<00:01:24.960> not

going to get hardly any rust on it

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.550 
going to get hardly any rust on it
the<00:01:27.150> downside<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.690> you<00:01:27.930> know<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.140> definitely

kind<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.800> in<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:28.980> 440<00:01:29.580> a<00:01:29.610> type<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.570> realm<00:01:31.020> so

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
kind of in that 440 a type of realm so

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.810 
kind of in that 440 a type of realm so
it's<00:01:31.350> definitely<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.770> budget<00:01:32.190> steal<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.700> know

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
it's definitely a budget steal you know

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
you're not going to get a lot of edge

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.899 
you're not going to get a lot of edge
retention<00:01:34.200> out<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.920> or<00:01:35.310> anything<00:01:35.670> like

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
retention out of it or anything like

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.280
