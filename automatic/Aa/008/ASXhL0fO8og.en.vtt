move at all keep the ball nice and
stable<00:01:48.100> don't<00:01:48.340> move

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
stable don't move

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.210 
stable don't move
keep<00:01:49.479> your<00:01:49.659> reach<00:01:49.810> sky<00:01:50.229> for<00:01:50.619> single<00:01:51.040> arm

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
keep your reach sky for single arm

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.069 
keep your reach sky for single arm
reaches<00:01:51.580> just<00:01:51.729> make<00:01:52.240> it<00:01:52.390> a<00:01:52.420> little<00:01:52.509> bit<00:01:52.720> harder

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
reaches just make it a little bit harder

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.929 
reaches just make it a little bit harder
you<00:01:53.170> can<00:01:53.259> feel<00:01:53.500> how<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:53.710> ball<00:01:53.950> wants<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:54.400> move

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
you can feel how the ball wants to move

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.690 
you can feel how the ball wants to move
to<00:01:55.150> the<00:01:55.270> side<00:01:55.509> just<00:01:55.840> slightly<00:01:56.520> it's<00:01:57.520> now

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
to the side just slightly it's now

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.700 
to the side just slightly it's now
progressed<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.479> arms<00:01:58.990> overhead

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
progressed to arms overhead

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.200 
progressed to arms overhead
so<00:01:59.979> obviously<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:00.490> wouldn't<00:02:00.640> be<00:02:00.820> doing<00:02:01.060> the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
so obviously you wouldn't be doing the

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.469 
so obviously you wouldn't be doing the
in<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.720> early<00:02:02.079> day<00:02:02.290> if<00:02:02.740> you've<00:02:03.040> had<00:02:03.479> abdominal

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
in the early day if you've had abdominal

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.600 
in the early day if you've had abdominal
surgery<00:02:04.990> so<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:05.470> wouldn't<00:02:05.770> do<00:02:05.920> arm<00:02:06.189> reaching

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
surgery so you wouldn't do arm reaching

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.550 
surgery so you wouldn't do arm reaching
overhead<00:02:06.850> for<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.210> first<00:02:07.479> six<00:02:07.689> weeks<00:02:07.899> after

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
overhead for the first six weeks after

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.139 
overhead for the first six weeks after
that<00:02:08.920> you<00:02:09.009> might<00:02:09.190> be<00:02:09.369> able<00:02:09.519> to<00:02:09.610> start<00:02:09.910> doing

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
that you might be able to start doing

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.610 
that you might be able to start doing
that<00:02:10.360> if<00:02:10.450> your<00:02:10.600> gynecologist<00:02:11.200> is<00:02:11.350> giving

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
that if your gynecologist is giving

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.090 
that if your gynecologist is giving
approval<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:12.220> do<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.400> so<00:02:13.390> nice<00:02:14.049> tall<00:02:14.530> reaches

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
approval to do that so nice tall reaches

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.180 
approval to do that so nice tall reaches
again<00:02:15.459> keeping<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.209> ball<00:02:16.480> really<00:02:17.019> stable<00:02:17.799> we

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
again keeping the ball really stable we

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.470 
again keeping the ball really stable we
can<00:02:18.370> regress<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:18.850> even<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.090> little<00:02:19.180> bit<00:02:19.329> more

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
can regress that even a little bit more

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.009 
can regress that even a little bit more
by<00:02:19.630> coming<00:02:19.959> onto

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
by coming onto

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.500 
by coming onto
so<00:02:21.709> stay<00:02:22.129> on<00:02:22.159> your<00:02:22.370> heels<00:02:22.580> keep<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.299> ball

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
so stay on your heels keep the ball

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.080 
so stay on your heels keep the ball
really<00:02:23.900> stable<00:02:24.530> looks<00:02:25.430> make<00:02:25.579> even<00:02:25.879> more

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
really stable looks make even more

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.030 
really stable looks make even more
