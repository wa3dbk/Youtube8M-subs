00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.940
 let's now turn to the topic of types of 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.160
 crepe heras since we are going surely 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.340
 we are in the process of you 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.730
 buy your equipment let's talk first 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.100
 of the believe gas pears have a 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.320
 rapid temperature rise which 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.710
 allows us to do faster 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.630
 crepes instead in cree pears 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.530
 electrical costs a little more than 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.780
 work to increase the temperature 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.210
 this allows us really efficiency 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.260
 greater efficiency the cost of energy 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.320
 is sometimes a little cheaper since 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.020
 we commented that previously 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.660
 and the gas that comes bottled or the gas 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.420
 that comes in a small tank in a 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.670
 cylinder also called allows one 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.590
 move especially if your concept is of 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.990
 future or from a kiosk 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.150
 and we should review very well the 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.840
 gas restrictions in places 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.680
 public where you present yourself because 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.060
 there are many problems especially in 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.850
 market overruns in markets 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.440
 very many problems with the 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.120
 gas and there are many restrictions 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.030
 legal in the case of gas 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.100
 on the other hand if you buy an acre pear 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.130
 Electrical use is really 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.370
 simple and comfortable as long as there is a 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.770
 light socket plus the atmosphere of 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:38.100
 work is less hot these folders 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.939
 are calculated for 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.100
 let's say extract less smoke and also the 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.400
 heat is not as intense as when 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.210
 there is the presence of fire there is a 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.549
 very important issue with voltages with 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.130
 industrial light against light 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.190
 domestic in the case of domestic light 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.530
 we have 110 volts is what a pancake 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.200
 it was normal however there are some cree 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.399
 industrial pears that have a voltage 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.190
 of 220 volts if it were a case of a 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.860
 crepe was industrial would have to call 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.989
 your electricity body to your 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.690
 Federal Electricity Commission 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.819
 where you live and make the change 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.000
 corresponding to raise the 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.640
 your electricity's voltage there's also 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.310
 different wallets per amperage what 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.010
 We do not want to burn some fuse or 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.790
 have a problem if you put 2 or 3 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.130
 crepes to use this type of crepe 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.470
 you have to learn to clean them 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.650
 before cleaning obviously you have to 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.970
 unplug let it cool is 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.480
 important 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.840
 at least once a day while 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.720
 There is constant service for several 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.510
 hours you can keep a clean 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.930
 let's say shallow though after 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.510
 an eight- hour shift will be fundamental 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.019
 clean our believe pear 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.590
 there are even people who use a 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:14.790
 sponge similar to the one we teach 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.890
 a moment ago to oil and fill 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.810
 of butter the crepe was there are some 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.090
 special brushes that do not harm the 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.280
 Teflon and that can be used too 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.340
 for cleaning if you were afraid 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.980
 of the damage that there is sealing but you can 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.010
 do with some kind of sponge that does not 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.409
 damage surfaces and water so as not to 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.959
 detergents there are some detergents that 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.790
 they serve perfectly for stoves those 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.480
 same detergents can be used 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.639
 for these crepe you were very important 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.670
 after making each cream you have to 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:50.629
 eliminate waste to prevent it from 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.450
 stick the next crepe to us 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:56.010
 affect then is to make wax for 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.200
 remove waste make wax to remove 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.810
 waste and as far as possible 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.700
 to remove some of that butter 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.069
 we could have 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.500
 and some kind of cloth or some 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.180
 sponge with water to try 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.580
 remove some of the things that have been 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.010
 stuck if for example the 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.959
 jam is usually very scandalous and 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.720
 there are some products such as cheese 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.940
 they also stick and are a bit 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.479
 scandalous as we had commented 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.210
 before it is very important not to use objects 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:31.810
 metal which are pointed for 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.790
 cleaning that will prevent us from always 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.610
 the surface of the iron 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.460
 sealing for we also want to clean the 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.710
 plate with a soft cloth and a detergent 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.380
 soft that is something that we have already 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:49.620
 been touching when we use the cream 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.680
 it is important to use it 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:57.680
 the crepe was the plate of crepes is 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.680
 important to use it the right way
