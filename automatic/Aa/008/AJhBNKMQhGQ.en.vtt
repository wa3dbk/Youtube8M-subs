off week after week after week then that
misses<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:36.640> point<00:00:36.910> and<00:00:37.210> then<00:00:37.450> remember<00:00:38.230> this

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
misses the point and then remember this

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.100 
misses the point and then remember this
has<00:00:38.500> all<00:00:38.620> been<00:00:38.650> a<00:00:38.830> lifestyle<00:00:39.490> and<00:00:39.820> so<00:00:40.270> just<00:00:41.020> to

continue to bring back in okay the

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.940 
continue to bring back in okay the
person<00:00:42.940> or<00:00:43.300> people<00:00:43.660> you're<00:00:43.750> deciding<00:00:44.350> are

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
person or people you're deciding are

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.710 
person or people you're deciding are
they<00:00:45.250> are<00:00:45.580> they<00:00:45.790> already<00:00:46.000> starting<00:00:46.480> to<00:00:46.510> teach

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
they are they already starting to teach

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.690 
they are they already starting to teach
some<00:00:46.930> of<00:00:47.020> these<00:00:47.110> things<00:00:47.410> to<00:00:47.710> other<00:00:47.920> people<00:00:48.010> are

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
some of these things to other people are

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.150 
some of these things to other people are
you<00:00:48.880> encouraging<00:00:49.510> them<00:00:49.690> to<00:00:49.720> do<00:00:50.020> that<00:00:50.230> or<00:00:50.620> is

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
you encouraging them to do that or is

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.400 
you encouraging them to do that or is
that<00:00:51.550> is<00:00:51.760> that<00:00:51.970> being<00:00:52.510> reproduced<00:00:52.900> in<00:00:53.290> their

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
that is that being reproduced in their

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.260 
that is that being reproduced in their
life<00:00:53.560> are<00:00:53.860> they<00:00:53.950> planning<00:00:54.460> to<00:00:54.490> do<00:00:54.700> that<00:00:54.730> soon

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
life are they planning to do that soon

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.240 
life are they planning to do that soon
and<00:00:55.540> so<00:00:56.050> this<00:00:56.260> is<00:00:56.410> a<00:00:56.440> continual<00:00:57.220> process

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
and so this is a continual process

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.910 
and so this is a continual process
that's<00:00:58.060> not<00:00:58.239> just<00:00:58.540> okay<00:00:58.870> once<00:00:59.440> I<00:00:59.560> get<00:00:59.710> to<00:00:59.739> this

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
that's not just okay once I get to this

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.590 
that's not just okay once I get to this
I'll<00:01:00.160> check<00:01:00.489> this<00:01:00.640> off<00:01:00.880> I've<00:01:01.120> got<00:01:01.360> to<00:01:01.510> make

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
I'll check this off I've got to make

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.389 
I'll check this off I've got to make

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
is that I think we don't always really

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:47.289 
is that I think we don't always really
understand<00:02:46.760> what<00:02:46.879> we're<00:02:47.000> saying<00:02:47.030> but

relationship that's built on promise and

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.009 
relationship that's built on promise and
and<00:02:51.859> the<00:02:52.640> storyline<00:02:53.120> of<00:02:53.239> Scripture<00:02:53.629> really

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
and the storyline of Scripture really

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.160 
and the storyline of Scripture really
revolves<00:02:54.500> around<00:02:54.640> God<00:02:55.640> initiating<00:02:56.599> covenant
