technique<00:02:18.710> is<00:02:18.950> that

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
technique is that

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.680 
technique is that
you<00:02:19.920> can<00:02:20.220> really<00:02:20.490> control<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.150> amount<00:02:21.510> of

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
you can really control the amount of

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.060 
you can really control the amount of
eyeliner<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.260> you're<00:02:22.500> getting<00:02:22.650> on<00:02:22.830> there

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
okay so there's a bottom and I think I

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.440

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
nice thing about this is that you can go

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.949 
nice thing about this is that you can go
ahead<00:04:10.080> then<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.739> blend<00:04:11.129> it<00:04:11.310> so<00:04:11.489> that<00:04:12.209> it's<00:04:12.810> not

ahead then and blend it so that it's not

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.839 
ahead then and blend it so that it's not
such<00:04:13.200> a<00:04:13.230> hard<00:04:13.500> line<00:04:13.709> or<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:14.400> can<00:04:14.550> leave<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:14.790> a

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
such a hard line or you can leave it a

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.250

subtler settler look so now on the other
eye<00:04:30.169> what<00:04:31.169> I'm<00:04:31.260> going<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.410> do<00:04:31.650> is<00:04:31.950> I'm<00:04:32.250> going<00:04:32.370> to

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
eye what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.290 
eye what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create<00:04:33.260> kind<00:04:34.260> of<00:04:34.350> like<00:04:34.440> a<00:04:34.560> stencil<00:04:35.160> almost<00:04:35.820> for

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
create kind of like a stencil almost for

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.030 
create kind of like a stencil almost for
where<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.780> liquid<00:04:36.990> liner<00:04:37.350> is<00:04:37.620> going<00:04:37.830> to<00:04:37.889> go

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
where the liquid liner is going to go

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.640 
where the liquid liner is going to go
and<00:04:38.400> when<00:04:39.150> I<00:04:39.180> say<00:04:39.419> a<00:04:39.450> stencil<00:04:40.020> I<00:04:40.169> always<00:04:40.410> think

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
and when I say a stencil I always think

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.960 
and when I say a stencil I always think
of<00:04:40.740> something<00:04:40.800> with<00:04:41.190> a<00:04:41.250> cutout<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:41.729> I'm<00:04:41.790> going

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
of something with a cutout and I'm going

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.280 
of something with a cutout and I'm going
to<00:04:42.000> lay<00:04:42.120> it<00:04:42.240> on<00:04:42.330> there<00:04:42.540> and<00:04:42.690> just<00:04:42.870> paint<00:04:43.110> in

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
to lay it on there and just paint in

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.140 
to lay it on there and just paint in
there<00:04:43.470> that's<00:04:43.919> not<00:04:44.190> what<00:04:44.340> I<00:04:44.370> mean<00:04:44.550> so<00:04:44.880> really

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
there that's not what I mean so really

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.909 
there that's not what I mean so really
it's<00:04:45.330> not<00:04:45.419> a<00:04:45.600> stencil<00:04:45.900> what<00:04:46.229> it<00:04:46.320> is<00:04:46.470> is<00:04:46.710> more

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
it's not a stencil what it is is more

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.290 
it's not a stencil what it is is more
like<00:04:47.100> a<00:04:47.130> template<00:04:47.639> of<00:04:47.790> where<00:04:48.000> you're<00:04:48.120> going<00:04:48.240> to

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
like a template of where you're going to

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.730 
like a template of where you're going to
put<00:04:48.479> it<00:04:48.630> so<00:04:49.050> you're<00:04:49.169> going<00:04:49.290> to<00:04:49.320> take<00:04:49.560> your

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
put it so you're going to take your

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.370 
put it so you're going to take your
black<00:04:50.160> eyeliner<00:04:50.639> pencil<00:04:50.729> and<00:04:51.419> you're<00:04:52.200> just

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
black eyeliner pencil and you're just

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.110 
black eyeliner pencil and you're just
going<00:04:52.530> to<00:04:52.560> create<00:04:53.010> the<00:04:53.310> initial<00:04:53.639> line<00:04:53.820> and

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
going to create the initial line and

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.460 
going to create the initial line and
then<00:04:54.240> you're<00:04:54.360> just<00:04:54.450> going<00:04:54.630> to<00:04:54.690> go<00:04:54.810> over<00:04:55.050> that

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
then you're just going to go over that

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.790 
then you're just going to go over that
with<00:04:56.190> your<00:04:56.669> liquid<00:04:57.300> eyeliner<00:04:57.840> and<00:04:58.139> that

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
with your liquid eyeliner and that

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.770 
with your liquid eyeliner and that
softens<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.669> edge<00:04:59.850> of<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.330> liquid<00:05:00.630> eyeliner

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
softens the edge of the liquid eyeliner

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.570 
softens the edge of the liquid eyeliner
so<00:05:01.229> that<00:05:01.380> you<00:05:01.440> can't<00:05:01.680> see<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:01.889> hard<00:05:02.220> edge<00:05:02.400> of

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
so that you can't see the hard edge of

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.159 
so that you can't see the hard edge of
it<00:05:02.729> and<00:05:02.850> then<00:05:03.419> it<00:05:03.540> gives<00:05:03.630> you<00:05:03.780> something<00:05:04.020> to

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
it and then it gives you something to

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:05.990 
it and then it gives you something to
blend<00:05:04.440> with<00:05:04.590> so<00:05:04.800> you're<00:05:05.580> just<00:05:05.669> going<00:05:05.820> to<00:05:05.880> go

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
blend with so you're just going to go

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.159 
blend with so you're just going to go
ahead<00:05:06.210> and<00:05:06.360> take<00:05:06.510> your<00:05:06.600> pencils<00:05:06.960> going<00:05:07.110> to

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
ahead and take your pencils going to

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:16.960 
ahead and take your pencils going to
line<00:05:07.290> the<00:05:07.500> bottom

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:46.730 

and<00:05:17.120> then<00:05:17.630> the<00:05:17.750> top

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.240 

I'm<00:05:47.340> just<00:05:47.520> gonna<00:05:47.639> make<00:05:47.819> a<00:05:47.880> little<00:05:48.979> wing<00:05:49.979> on
