00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.090
 most recently held today at the technical follow-up meeting of the 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.470
 kinship project the members of the technical team of the ministry of 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:12.949
 science and innovation 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:16.470
 in which good have been seen and significant advances are some of 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.619
 the projects 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.829
 in fact 1 we are in the third year of the project and there have been some variations 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:26.609
 spatial of the different devices that are is to highlight smart to the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.909
 professional transport 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:32.850
 the simulator san ber and dried it of the operation of the his projects 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.490
 alert that issues 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.910
 educated of spaces but in attentions of the driver 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.980
 milestones that define a methodology of validation of the east 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.650
 onboard devices 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.940
 assists that integrates the different devices 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.050
 which is that they have and establish well and the stability of the vehicle in a 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.850
 dynamics of 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.910
 In addition, real tests have been carried out in this field with the other two 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.980
 Projects 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.980
 technological ones that are registers and it's great 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.160
 in a real vehicle 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.500
 in this case not professional 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.110
 the capabilities that it has 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.720
 conventional vehicle 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.310
 the pri who pointed out that his project 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.630
 is framed by a vehicle brand system that will collect information 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.110
 both static and dynamic of a series of elements or beacons placed 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.440
 in infrastructure 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.630
 and then it's a smart process in training to show 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.630
 the most appropriate information at each moment to the driver 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.860
 only two minutes 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.550
 the products 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.499
 on the other hand 

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:05.399
 the other project was post they record that their project that is storing all 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.450
 important information 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.410
 for the subsequent analysis of reconstruction in the case of accident 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.330
 so that you can find out the specific causes that produce it 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.290
 alert for example is one of the projects that we have been able to 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.769
 check percent in the simulator 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.769
 we have planned the 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.080
 in the opening of the eyes to determine the fatigue of the driver and 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.229
 also hands-on tracking that does not give very valuable information 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:35.689
 for example for all to determine inappropriate gestures on the part of 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:39.389
 determine also some command of overload law work 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:44.229
 another of the projects that we have verified in the simulator has been one 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:48.469
 of the key aspects of the g20 as partners in assisting in what we do is 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:50.669
 create an integration platform 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.849
 as much heat as they are keep new devices marked 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.169
 for this we have replaced 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:58.239
 the real bullets bombs have to bring is with this cabin 

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:02.630
 photo efe one developed ad-hoc for the project 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.980
 hundreds of casualties place completely percent as a hundred and furthermore continued 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.179
 the dollar 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:11.470
 the development that makes action and application 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.230
 It is an own development based on intelligent environments, besides the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.960
 centime simulator defined the integration methodology of two 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.399
 past digits 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:24.559
 Caesar collected in his project within 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:28.649
 the eastern part of the entity such devices are hands-free c 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:31.149
 Delegates to the heart contest 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:32.909
 that allows you to do a study 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.909
 hundredths 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:36.879
 meteorological services 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.099
 e how these devices should be integrated
