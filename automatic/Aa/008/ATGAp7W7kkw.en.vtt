00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
to write a scope right here i wish every

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.120 
to write a scope right here i wish every
game<00:01:08.820> would<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.930> yeah<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.439> kind

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
game would have that but yeah it's kind

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.710 
game would have that but yeah it's kind
of<00:01:11.159> muddled<00:01:11.640> or<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:12.119> aiming<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.689> a

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
of muddled or it's aiming for a

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.870 
of muddled or it's aiming for a
realistic<00:01:13.380> take<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.250> whole<00:01:14.369> I'm<00:01:14.670> sure

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
realistic take on the whole I'm sure

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.910 
realistic take on the whole I'm sure
thing<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.840> normally<00:01:16.170> die<00:01:16.350> within<00:01:16.590> one<00:01:16.890> to

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
thing so you normally die within one to

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.130 
thing so you normally die within one to
two<00:01:17.070> shots<00:01:17.460> basically<00:01:18.119> with<00:01:18.330> all<00:01:18.509> guns<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.080> I

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
two shots basically with all guns and I

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.499 
two shots basically with all guns and I
think<00:01:19.380> if<00:01:19.530> you're<00:01:20.030> if<00:01:21.030> you're<00:01:21.180> getting<00:01:21.330> a

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
think if you're if you're getting a

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.390 
think if you're if you're getting a
headshot<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.960> there<00:01:22.710> will<00:01:22.860> always<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:23.130> able

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
headshot and there will always be able

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.359 
headshot and there will always be able
to<00:01:23.580> kill<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.509> yeah<00:01:24.689> it's<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.770> little<00:01:26.250> bit

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
to kill so yeah it's it's a little bit

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.219 
to kill so yeah it's it's a little bit
about<00:01:26.520> gunplay<00:01:26.759> not<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.450> much<00:01:27.600> as<00:01:27.780> other<00:01:27.990> games

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
about gunplay not so much as other games

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.679 
about gunplay not so much as other games
like<00:01:28.729> Battlefield<00:01:29.729> 4<00:01:29.880> examples<00:01:30.119> network

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
like Battlefield 4 examples network

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.740 
like Battlefield 4 examples network
would<00:01:30.810> work<00:01:31.020> or<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:32.130> strike<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:33.090> it's

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
would work or like on strike but it's

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.289 
would work or like on strike but it's
still<00:01:33.930> about<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:35.009> still<00:01:35.549> really<00:01:35.759> important

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
still about it's still really important

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.060 
still about it's still really important
that<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.659> kind<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.110> got<00:01:37.710> your<00:01:37.829> aim<00:01:37.920> down

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
that you kind of got your aim down

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.770 
that you kind of got your aim down
however<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:39.090> game<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.450> more<00:01:39.600> about

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
however this game is more about

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.200 
however this game is more about
positioning<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.560> as<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.920> real<00:01:41.070> life<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.939> all

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
positioning so as in real life and all

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.350 
positioning so as in real life and all
the<00:01:42.329> guns<00:01:42.479> are<00:01:42.659> killing<00:01:43.409> pretty<00:01:43.799> quickly<00:01:44.070> so

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
the guns are killing pretty quickly so

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.030 
the guns are killing pretty quickly so
assume<00:01:45.360> it's<00:01:45.869> more<00:01:46.020> about<00:01:46.140> who<00:01:46.530> sees<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
assume it's more about who sees the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.100 
assume it's more about who sees the
other<00:01:47.070> one<00:01:47.369> first<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.909> right<00:01:48.750> here<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.960> got

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
other one first and right here I got

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.230 
other one first and right here I got
killed<00:01:49.320> till<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.369> day<00:01:50.520> i<00:01:50.549> do<00:01:50.820> not<00:01:51.000> know<00:01:51.060> where

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
killed till this day i do not know where

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.389 
killed till this day i do not know where
he<00:01:51.329> came<00:01:51.450> from<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.810> there's<00:01:51.990> no<00:01:52.140> kill<00:01:52.350> cam<00:01:52.530> by

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
he came from so there's no kill cam by

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.280 
he came from so there's no kill cam by
the<00:01:53.460> way<00:01:53.610> i<00:01:53.640> think<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:54.119> game<00:01:54.570> mode<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.990> called

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
the way i think this game mode is called

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.770 
the way i think this game mode is called
it's<00:01:56.189> not<00:01:56.369> search<00:01:56.610> destroy<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.240> they<00:01:57.630> have

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
it's not search destroy this they have

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.389 
it's not search destroy this they have

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
to our game modes one it's like a team

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.679 
to our game modes one it's like a team

like<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.170> am<00:02:19.260> right<00:02:19.290> here<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.709> thought<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.069> would

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
like I am right here I thought it would

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.890 
like I am right here I thought it would
be<00:02:20.459> kind<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.849> good<00:02:21.180> point<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.540> thought

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
be kind of a good point so I thought

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.690 
be kind of a good point so I thought
this<00:02:22.440> game<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.680> would<00:02:22.800> be<00:02:23.130> kind<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.459> fitting

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
this game that would be kind of fitting

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.800 
this game that would be kind of fitting
to<00:02:23.790> explain<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.180> whole<00:02:24.239> game<00:02:24.420> play<00:02:24.630> thing

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
to explain this whole game play thing

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.100 
to explain this whole game play thing
but<00:02:25.470> yeah<00:02:25.620> I'm<00:02:25.770> so<00:02:26.370> you're<00:02:26.520> this<00:02:27.000> you're<00:02:27.239> kind

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
but yeah I'm so you're this you're kind

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.490 
but yeah I'm so you're this you're kind
of<00:02:28.140> one<00:02:28.319> of<00:02:28.349> getting<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:29.540> ABC<00:02:30.540> flags<00:02:30.840> or<00:02:31.140> just

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
of one of getting the ABC flags or just

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.020 
of one of getting the ABC flags or just
objectives<00:02:32.250> if<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.489> want<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.700> call<00:02:32.819> like<00:02:33.000> that

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
objectives if you want to call like that

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.850 
objectives if you want to call like that
and<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.870> game<00:02:33.989> is<00:02:34.110> really<00:02:34.260> objectively

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
and the game is really objectively

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.920 
and the game is really objectively
focused<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.790> think<00:02:36.120> in<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.540> end<00:02:36.569> I<00:02:36.780> go

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
focused so you I think in the end I go

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.690 
focused so you I think in the end I go
like<00:02:37.140> three<00:02:37.770> and<00:02:37.890> one<00:02:38.069> or<00:02:38.190> something<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.610> you

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
like three and one or something and you

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.660 
like three and one or something and you
can<00:02:38.760> see<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.060> but<00:02:39.690> I'm<00:02:40.380> not<00:02:40.590> MVP<00:02:41.010> sore<00:02:41.250> i<00:02:41.280> think

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
can see it but I'm not MVP sore i think

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.100 
can see it but I'm not MVP sore i think
i<00:02:41.850> think<00:02:42.120> even<00:02:42.239> though<00:02:42.420> i<00:02:42.450> got<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.720> most<00:02:42.840> kills

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
i think even though i got the most kills

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.390 
i think even though i got the most kills
i'm<00:02:43.260> not<00:02:43.410> even<00:02:43.500> if<00:02:43.709> he<00:02:43.800> because<00:02:44.130> it's<00:02:44.280> more

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
i'm not even if he because it's more

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.220 
i'm not even if he because it's more
about<00:02:44.519> who's<00:02:44.790> keeping<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.150> flags<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.569> course

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
about who's keeping the flags of course

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.199 
about who's keeping the flags of course
since<00:02:46.440> i<00:02:46.500> was<00:02:46.650> playing<00:02:46.920> kind<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.430> scout<00:02:47.970> or

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
marksman roll it was a little bit harder

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.270 
marksman roll it was a little bit harder

to to just be upfront and close and
personal<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.760> it's<00:02:54.390> it's<00:02:54.630> really<00:02:54.810> dangerous

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
personal and it's it's really dangerous

not<00:03:49.739> too<00:03:50.070> much<00:03:50.160> about<00:03:50.370> gun<00:03:50.609> skill<00:03:50.880> and<00:03:51.060> a

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
not too much about gun skill and a

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.110 
not too much about gun skill and a
heavily<00:03:52.890> focused<00:03:53.100> on<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.430> objective<00:03:53.850> but

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
heavily focused on the objective but

definitely the thing it's focused around

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.300 
definitely the thing it's focused around
is<00:03:57.060> positioning<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:58.530> that<00:03:58.739> you<00:03:58.859> learn<00:03:59.040> how
