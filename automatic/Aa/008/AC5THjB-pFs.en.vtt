incredibly<00:01:42.000> solid<00:01:42.509> like<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.840> can't<00:01:43.140> get<00:01:43.259> over

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
incredibly solid like I can't get over

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.440 
incredibly solid like I can't get over
how<00:01:43.740> solid<00:01:44.280> they<00:01:44.399> actually<00:01:44.790> made<00:01:45.210> these

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
how solid they actually made these

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.780 
how solid they actually made these
headphones<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.439> ear<00:01:46.590> cups<00:01:46.920> add<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.579> much<00:01:47.729> more

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
headphones the ear cups add so much more

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.789 
headphones the ear cups add so much more
weight<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.509> hopefully<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.200> means<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
weight so hopefully that means that the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.130 
weight so hopefully that means that the
sound<00:01:50.100> quality<00:01:50.189> has<00:01:50.790> improved<00:01:50.820> now<00:01:51.630> if<00:01:51.899> these

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
sound quality has improved now if these

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.289 
sound quality has improved now if these
things<00:01:52.439> sound<00:01:52.829> as<00:01:53.159> good<00:01:53.399> as<00:01:53.520> they<00:01:53.700> look<00:01:53.729> they

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
things sound as good as they look they

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.600 
things sound as good as they look they
could<00:01:54.509> quite<00:01:54.780> possibly<00:01:54.810> be<00:01:55.560> an<00:01:55.979> incredible

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
never really been a strong point for the

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.530 
never really been a strong point for the
beats<00:02:48.410> lineup<00:02:48.890> but<00:02:49.160> with<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.340> solo<00:02:49.730> twos<00:02:50.030> that
