00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:34.170
 the first letter of the alphabet 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.950
 perhaps more important things in my life are contained in it 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.000
 starting with a 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.870
 to like love 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.350
 to like friendship 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.350
 to like art 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.770
 do not worry 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.329
 I don't presume to have my say on all three weapons 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.150
 for the rest of love and the fox they have occupied themselves for centuries 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.150
 great artists and poets of humanity 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.880
 much more modestly I would just like to tell you something about your head 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.010
 that is on the art 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.490
 on my art of course 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.020
 makes those who may not like it or like it 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.220
 it's my thing 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.510
 but things that I write from the bottom of my heart and that I want to dedicate to everyone 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.689
 those who seeing my work 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.969
 somehow they feel ideally close to me 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.620
 and symptoms to 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.490
 oh my God how much it is 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.850
 I said since the early years 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.440
 I've always been fascinated by soft colors 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.440
 from castles with harmonious curves 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.300
 I love painting above all nature 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.119
 in my opinion it was not created to serve man 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.019
 and to remind you that 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:17.049
 todey to live in harmony the pins must be replaced with the 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.139
 that true strength lies not in the clash but in the continuous search for 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:23.439
 complementarity 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:24.759
 sack him 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.759
 forms and contents 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.789
 as well as on Latin 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:35.759
 I also love painting on porcelain 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:38.819
 in this case only with the little finger 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.659
 I can get shapes that are nuances 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.659
 I hope so 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:47.609
 but even more beautiful arts 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.469
 during the sculpture that fascinates me 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:55.399
 I feel like you are visiting serious things about weddings as you settle for 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:59.170
 success sciascia ressort photoshop that only I will live 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.120
 and when I receive the need for shipping 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.250
 then it is all day friends of hi come here noemi sculture e 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.850
 become as if by magic my only and exclusive source of pleasure 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:35.239
 I must admit and that as an artist being born and living in Rome is really 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.919
 a gift of via 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:42.279
 in no other city in the world is it possible to be inspired to sing 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:46.270
 and touch authentic masterpieces 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.270
 who have made art history 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:56.319
 estoril is a work in a gallery I also have in one of the many churches of Rome 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.709
 it is perhaps the best even an artist can expect I desired 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:12.549
 I want you all to confess something 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.289
 of all the chief sports suits 

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:20.879
 in Italy and abroad this picture I called the martyr and maybe seminar 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:23.879
 the one that occupies the first place in my heart 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:46.169
 now you know something more about me 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.059
 I can only add that I am married 

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:52.059
 and that I had two Sicilies 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.120
 I love young people and this is why I dedicate myself with great passion too 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.719
 teaching 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:02.939
 to young people who always remember that the first two years 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:05.210
 or love and friendship 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.810
 they are perhaps the only real things that matter in life 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.340
 naturally after the third
