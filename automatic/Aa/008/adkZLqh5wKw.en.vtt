wasn't at his right point of impact nor
its<00:01:35.310> correct<00:01:35.850> accuracy<00:01:36.680> but<00:01:37.680> after<00:01:38.040> we<00:01:38.190> got

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340

that flew over here to fly and it's
still<00:02:01.200> pretty<00:02:01.410> good<00:02:01.680> definitely<00:02:02.520> very<00:02:03.090> good

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
still pretty good definitely very good

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.310 
still pretty good definitely very good
for<00:02:03.540> 30<00:02:03.720> yards<00:02:03.960> um<00:02:04.430> so<00:02:05.450> this<00:02:06.450> video<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.869> kind<00:02:07.170> of

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
for 30 yards um so this video is kind of

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.660 
for 30 yards um so this video is kind of
screwy<00:02:07.590> I'm<00:02:07.830> still<00:02:08.040> going<00:02:08.130> to<00:02:08.190> pulse<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.550> up

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
screwy I'm still going to pulse it up

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.530 
screwy I'm still going to pulse it up
though<00:02:10.580> so<00:02:11.580> this<00:02:11.760> has<00:02:11.910> been<00:02:12.090> 30<00:02:12.510> yard<00:02:12.810> shot<00:02:14.540> a
