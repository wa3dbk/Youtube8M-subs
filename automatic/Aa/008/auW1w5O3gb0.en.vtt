these Beatles song earworms stuck in my
head<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:51.050> I<00:00:52.050> started<00:00:52.680> thinking<00:00:53.010> about<00:00:53.100> as<00:00:53.520> I

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
head and I started thinking about as I

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.410 
head and I started thinking about as I
was<00:00:53.760> sketching<00:00:54.000> how<00:00:54.449> music<00:00:55.410> moves<00:00:55.829> and

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
was sketching how music moves and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.930 
was sketching how music moves and
there's<00:00:57.420> rhythm<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.680> flows<00:00:59.100> but

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
there's rhythm to it and it flows but

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.759 
there's rhythm to it and it flows but
there's<00:01:00.149> nothing<00:01:00.449> tangible<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.260> see<00:01:01.620> in

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
there's nothing tangible that you see in

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.230 
there's nothing tangible that you see in
the<00:01:01.890> movement<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:03.359> moves<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:05.129> moves<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
the movement it moves you it moves the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.170 
the movement it moves you it moves the
sounds<00:01:06.870> there's<00:01:07.710> no<00:01:07.860> visual<00:01:08.310> execution<00:01:09.119> of

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
sounds there's no visual execution of

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.820 
sounds there's no visual execution of
the<00:01:09.330> movement<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.900> wanted<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> see<00:01:10.500> how<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.740> could

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the movement I wanted to see how I could

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.330 
the movement I wanted to see how I could
play<00:01:11.189> with<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.850> my<00:01:11.970> garment<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:14.130> song

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
play with that in my garment the song

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.920 
play with that in my garment the song
that<00:01:14.369> was<00:01:14.580> really<00:01:14.850> stuck<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.180> my<00:01:15.330> head<00:01:15.540> was

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
that was really stuck in my head was

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.560 
that was really stuck in my head was
something<00:01:16.380> by<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.710> Beatles<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:18.330> first

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
something by the Beatles and the first

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.999 
something by the Beatles and the first
line<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.290> something<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> way<00:01:19.979> she

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
line of it is something in the way she

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.359 
line of it is something in the way she
moves<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.180> talks<00:01:21.420> about<00:01:21.570> how<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.530> woman

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
moves and it talks about how this woman

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.749 
moves and it talks about how this woman
who's<00:01:23.520> unimposing<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.509> confident<00:01:25.049> and

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
who's unimposing and is confident and

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.130 
who's unimposing and is confident and
really<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:27.000> alluring<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:27.930> without

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
really is just alluring but without

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.560 
really is just alluring but without
being<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.340> an<00:01:29.430> obvious<00:01:29.610> way<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.390> thought

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
being so in an obvious way so I thought

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.880 
being so in an obvious way so I thought
about<00:01:30.780> how<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:30.990> might<00:01:31.229> translate<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.799> my

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
about how that might translate to my

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.990 
about how that might translate to my
garment<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:33.979> how<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.009> could<00:01:35.399> put<00:01:35.970> that

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
garment and how I could put that

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.109 
garment and how I could put that
confidence<00:01:36.689> into<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.860> home<00:01:38.040> knitter<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.790> is

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
confidence into the home knitter that is

be<00:02:20.280> my<00:02:20.640> plan<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:22.460> started<00:02:23.460> with<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.610> sketch<00:02:24.020> I

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
be my plan I started with a sketch I

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.100 
be my plan I started with a sketch I
started<00:02:25.470> with<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.590> lot<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:25.830> sketches<00:02:26.220> actually

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
started with a lot of sketches actually

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.660 
started with a lot of sketches actually
this<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.320> what<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:28.710> finally<00:02:29.040> settled<00:02:29.400> on

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.600 

something<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:33.260> has<00:02:34.260> movement<00:02:34.650> movement<00:02:35.340> but

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
something that has movement movement but

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.710 
something that has movement movement but
not<00:02:35.790> in<00:02:35.940> an<00:02:36.060> obvious<00:02:36.240> way<00:02:36.510> it's<00:02:38.300> got<00:02:39.300> cables

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
not in an obvious way it's got cables

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.930 
not in an obvious way it's got cables
coming<00:02:39.960> down<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.380> front<00:02:40.590> something<00:02:41.580> similar

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
coming down the front something similar

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.460 
coming down the front something similar
is<00:02:42.030> happening<00:02:42.060> in<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.570> back<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.990> cables<00:02:43.380> are

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
is happening in the back the cables are

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.350 
is happening in the back the cables are
moving<00:02:43.920> there's<00:02:44.310> some<00:02:44.490> yarn<00:02:44.700> over<00:02:44.970> details

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
moving there's some yarn over details

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.270 
moving there's some yarn over details
that<00:02:45.570> are<00:02:45.660> moving<00:02:45.840> but<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.680> garment<00:02:47.190> itself

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
that are moving but the garment itself

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
there's a little bit of ease but I

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.140 
there's a little bit of ease but I
really<00:02:53.190> wanted<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.520> think<00:02:53.640> about<00:02:53.910> sell

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
to play with in my sketching what it

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.510 
to play with in my sketching what it
might<00:03:03.720> look<00:03:03.750> like<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.380> one<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.370> blue

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
might look like and one of the blue

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.790 
might look like and one of the blue
colors<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:07.100> this<00:03:08.100> pretty<00:03:08.820> orange<00:03:09.090> color<00:03:09.420> and

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
I'm pretty happy with it in colors i

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.610 
I'm pretty happy with it in colors i
think<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.600> cables<00:03:12.930> will<00:03:13.080> still<00:03:13.290> pop<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:14.090> think

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
think the cables will still pop I think

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.500 
think the cables will still pop I think
it<00:03:16.620> looks<00:03:16.830> pretty<00:03:16.920> good<00:03:17.250> at<00:03:17.340> new<00:03:17.489> color<00:03:17.700> so

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
it looks pretty good at new color so

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.880 
it looks pretty good at new color so
this<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:18.870> where<00:03:19.020> I'm<00:03:19.110> at<00:03:19.230> with<00:03:19.260> my<00:03:19.530> garment

the bias they're super easy they're
really<00:03:33.090> not<00:03:34.050> as<00:03:34.260> hard<00:03:35.100> as<00:03:35.280> they<00:03:35.430> might<00:03:35.610> seem<00:03:35.940> or

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
really not as hard as they might seem or

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.390
