playing<00:00:52.770> card<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.340> was<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.520> decorated<00:00:54.270> card<00:00:55.070> but

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
playing card it was a decorated card but

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.639 
playing card it was a decorated card but
I<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:56.969> wanted<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> plain<00:00:57.539> orange<00:00:57.870> side<00:00:58.320> so

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
I just wanted the plain orange side so

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.819 
I just wanted the plain orange side so
I'm<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:59.010> using<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.670> back<00:01:00.829> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
I'm just using that for the back the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:02.779 
I'm just using that for the back the
rest<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.129> them<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.430> nice<00:01:02.579> thing<00:01:02.609> about

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
rest of them and the nice thing about

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.579 
rest of them and the nice thing about
these<00:01:03.120> cards<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.899> they're<00:01:04.170> colored<00:01:04.439> on

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
these cards is that they're colored on

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.660 
these cards is that they're colored on
the<00:01:04.680> outside<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.159> they're<00:01:05.309> white<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
the outside and they're white in the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.210 
the outside and they're white in the
middle<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.150> don't<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.630> line<00:01:06.810> them

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
middle so you don't have to line them

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.550 
middle so you don't have to line them
and<00:01:08.220> then<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:08.850> took<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.060> piece<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:10.409> is

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
and then I just took a piece of this is

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.140 
and then I just took a piece of this is

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.670 
it's not great card stock but it's good
for<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.420> just<00:01:18.420> kind<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.750> using<00:01:18.960> for<00:01:19.259> scrap<00:01:19.500> work

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680

and<00:01:19.860> stuff<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.670> ran<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.119> through<00:01:21.299> my

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and stuff so I ran that through my

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.440 
and stuff so I ran that through my
cuttlebug<00:01:21.960> with<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.619> Swiss<00:01:22.860> dots<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.610> then<00:01:24.210> I

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
cuttlebug with the Swiss dots and then I

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.020 
cuttlebug with the Swiss dots and then I
left<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.900> little<00:01:25.280> band<00:01:26.280> across<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.729> bottom

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
left a little band across the bottom

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.999 
left a little band across the bottom
that<00:01:27.270> didn't<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.720> any<00:01:27.840> dots<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.650> I

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
that didn't have any dots on it and I

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.920 
that didn't have any dots on it and I
stamped<00:01:29.460> thank<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.329> didn't<00:01:30.810> do<00:01:30.900> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
stamped thank you and I didn't do a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.560 
stamped thank you and I didn't do a
great<00:01:31.200> job<00:01:31.320> there<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:31.979> i<00:01:32.250> think<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.030> blingy

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
great job there but i think the blingy

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.830 
great job there but i think the blingy
butterfly<00:01:34.140> kind<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:35.509> distracts<00:01:36.509> people<00:01:36.630> from

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
butterfly kind of distracts people from

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.960 
butterfly kind of distracts people from
seeing<00:01:37.229> my<00:01:37.380> poor<00:01:37.619> stamping<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.549> one<00:01:38.729> isn't

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
seeing my poor stamping this one isn't

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.789 
seeing my poor stamping this one isn't
as<00:01:39.299> blingy<00:01:39.659> because<00:01:40.049> i<00:01:40.079> use<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.530> pink

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
as blingy because i use the pink

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.920 
as blingy because i use the pink
stickles<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.640> cotton<00:01:42.090> candy<00:01:42.299> i<00:01:42.570> think<00:01:42.810> it's

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
stickles the cotton candy i think it's

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.109

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.000 
go over it with the stickles I outline
it<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.120> then<00:03:08.209> I<00:03:08.300> go<00:03:08.420> back<00:03:08.450> and<00:03:09.020> when<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:09.800> first

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
it and then I go back and when the first

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.710 
it and then I go back and when the first
color<00:03:10.190> is<00:03:10.400> dried<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:10.700> usually<00:03:11.239> take<00:03:11.390> another

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
color is dried I usually take another

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.930
