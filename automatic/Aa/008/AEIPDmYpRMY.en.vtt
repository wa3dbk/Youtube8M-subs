ARE BECOMING INTERNET SENSATIONS

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.450

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.770
I PLAY BASKETBALL HERE TODAY.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.610
LAST NIGHT CLARK MADE SOME

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.440
NEW FRIENDS ON THE COURT WITH

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.710
KANSAS CITY'S FINEST.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.510
IT WAS VERY SPECIAL.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.480
I FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT AND

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.480
OBLIGATED TO RECORD IT.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.950
THIS MAN CAPTURED THE GAME ON

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.550
CAMERA, A PICKUP GAME BETWEEN

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.920
POLICE AND NEIGHBORHOOD

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.490
CHILDREN.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.520
IT WAS THREE ON THREE.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.620
WHILE THESE OFFICERS WON'T BE

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.790
PLAYING IN THE NBA ANY TIME

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.660
SOON, THEY SAY THEY ENJOY THIS

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.530
PART OF THEIR JOB.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.600
WE TRY TO DO OUR BEST TO

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.640
INTERACT WITH THE KIDS.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.700
IF THE POLICE COULD PLAY, I

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.670
DECIDED TO TRY MY LUCK AGAINST

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.770
THE ASPIRING NBA SUPERSTAR, BUT

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.740
WITHIN SECONDS WAS ALREADY

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.580
LOSING BY TWO.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.850
POLICE SAY WIN OR LOSE, IT'S A

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.680
GREAT EXPERIENCE.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.950
THEY SEE ENOUGH OF THE BAD

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.620
STUFF THAT GOES ON IN THE

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.690
NEIGHBORHOOD, JUST LIKE WE DO.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.990
WE NEED TO GET THEIR MIND OFF OF

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.790
THAT.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.700
JUST 30 MINUTES OF A PICK UP

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.560
GAME FOR WHAT COULD BE -- MAKE A

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.910
LIFETIME A DIFFERENCE FOR KID.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.570
I LIKE TO PLAY BASEBALL --

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.640
BASKETBALL A LOT.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.540
I DID EVENTUALLY LOSE THAT

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.580
PICKUP GAME.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.650
HE'S PRETTY GOOD.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.680
ONLY A FEW BREAKS AWAY FROM THAT

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.750
THAT NBA CONTRACT.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.690
STILL PEOPLE ARE OUT HERE

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.960
