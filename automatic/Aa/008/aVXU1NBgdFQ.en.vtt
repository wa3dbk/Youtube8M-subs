00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
when you started otherwise it has a

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.090 
when you started otherwise it has a
chance<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.750> missing<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.619> again<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:28.979> is

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
chance of missing so again this is

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.880 
chance of missing so again this is
another<00:01:29.570> st.<00:01:30.570> same<00:01:30.840> combo<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.409> performed<00:01:31.770> on

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
another st. same combo just performed on

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.249 
another st. same combo just performed on
the<00:01:31.979> corner<00:01:32.270> but<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.720> little<00:01:33.960> bit<00:01:34.110> risk

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
the corner but in this a little bit risk

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.749 
the corner but in this a little bit risk
you<00:01:34.350> have<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.500> know<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.770> ranges<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.640> need

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
you have to know the ranges so you need

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.859 
you have to know the ranges so you need
to<00:01:35.820> practice<00:01:35.939> with<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.329> training<00:01:36.570> mode<00:01:36.600> just

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
to practice with in training mode just

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.100 
to practice with in training mode just
for<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.079> bit<00:01:37.200> um<00:01:38.060> next<00:01:39.060> way<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.299> can<00:01:39.750> get<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.079> a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
for a bit um next way you can get is a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.170 
for a bit um next way you can get is a
dive<00:01:40.619> kick<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.759> land<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.000> dive

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
dive kick this is a you can land a dive

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.280 
dive kick this is a you can land a dive
kick<00:01:42.329> really<00:01:42.659> easy<00:01:42.810> especially<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.229> center

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
kick really easy especially in center

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.060 
kick really easy especially in center
point<00:01:43.500> like<00:01:43.710> riding<00:01:44.009> fireballs<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.759> lot<00:01:44.909> so

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
point like riding fireballs a lot so

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.740 
point like riding fireballs a lot so
just<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.880> again<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.149> linked<00:01:48.720> it

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
just like that and again I linked it

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.260 
just like that and again I linked it
with<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.020> medium<00:01:49.439> kick<00:01:49.649> again<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.220> choose<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
with the medium kick again I choose the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.940 
with the medium kick again I choose the
medium<00:01:51.360> kick<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.840> can<00:01:51.990> do<00:01:52.079> medium<00:01:52.409> punch<00:01:52.680> work

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
medium kick you can do medium punch work

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.620 
medium kick you can do medium punch work
sometimes<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.579> mean<00:01:54.060> kick<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.299> nice<00:01:54.450> because

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
sometimes I mean kick is nice because

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.969 
sometimes I mean kick is nice because
it's<00:01:54.780> lower<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.079> ground<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.799> is

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
it's lower to the ground in it this is

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.200 
it's lower to the ground in it this is
less<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.899> one's<00:01:58.049> nice<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.649> easy<00:01:59.210> this

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
less so that one's nice and easy this

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.780 
less so that one's nice and easy this
one<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> new<00:02:00.630> one<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.619> can<00:02:01.740> do<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.979> EXP

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
one is a new one you can do the EXP

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
one is a new one you can do the EXP
wheel<00:02:03.000> if<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.810> are<00:02:04.280> nova<00:02:05.280> screen<00:02:05.750> just<00:02:06.750> like

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
wheel if you are nova screen just like

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.330 
wheel if you are nova screen just like
that<00:02:07.049> will<00:02:07.320> take<00:02:07.500> all<00:02:07.710> three<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.009> your<00:02:08.160> bars

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
that will take all three of your bars

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.749 
that will take all three of your bars
though<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.849> rather<00:02:09.030> expensive

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
though so it is rather expensive

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.119 
though so it is rather expensive
but<00:02:10.569> you<00:02:10.659> can<00:02:10.869> come<00:02:11.049> with<00:02:11.230> that<00:02:11.409> way<00:02:11.530> however

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
but you can come with that way however

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.309 
but you can come with that way however
you're<00:02:12.280> in<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.459> corner<00:02:12.879> and<00:02:13.720> your<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.200> get

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.660 
I'm going to notice you can connect a
medium<00:02:20.409> kick<00:02:20.590> so<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.129> means<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.430> can

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
like that it is really sticky like it

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.330 
like that it is really sticky like it
rarely<00:02:28.900> misses<00:02:29.260> like<00:02:29.560> I'm<00:02:29.709> street<00:02:30.190> fight<00:02:30.310> a

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
rarely misses like I'm street fight a

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.680 
rarely misses like I'm street fight a
lot<00:02:30.519> of<00:02:30.579> times<00:02:30.730> like<00:02:30.879> if<00:02:31.030> like<00:02:31.420> was<00:02:31.540> right

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
lot of times like if like was right

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.270 
lot of times like if like was right
across<00:02:31.810> me<00:02:32.110> up<00:02:32.200> there<00:02:32.349> with<00:02:32.470> Miss<00:02:32.680> but<00:02:33.129> this

one<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.489> rarely<00:02:33.819> misses<00:02:34.060> I<00:02:34.209> haven't<00:02:34.420> had<00:02:34.540> any

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
one it rarely misses I haven't had any

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.420 
one it rarely misses I haven't had any
problems<00:02:34.720> with<00:02:34.989> that<00:02:35.200> so<00:02:35.859> you<00:02:35.920> can<00:02:36.099> still<00:02:36.280> do

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
problems with that so you can still do

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.729 
problems with that so you can still do
like<00:02:36.549> any<00:02:36.730> kind<00:02:36.909> of<00:02:37.000> combo<00:02:37.329> you<00:02:37.420> want<00:02:37.739> with

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
like any kind of combo you want with

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.140 
like any kind of combo you want with
that<00:02:38.769> and<00:02:39.280> then<00:02:40.120> finish<00:02:40.450> with<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:43.090> you

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
that and then finish with it and so you

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.520 
that and then finish with it and so you
just<00:02:43.359> got<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.540> be<00:02:43.780> aware<00:02:43.870> when<00:02:44.290> you're<00:02:44.409> doing

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
just got to be aware when you're doing

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.309 
just got to be aware when you're doing
these<00:02:44.590> combos<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.159> more<00:02:45.340> hits<00:02:45.519> you<00:02:45.609> do<00:02:45.790> up

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
these combos the more hits you do up

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.289 
these combos the more hits you do up
before<00:02:47.319> you<00:02:47.769> finish<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.670> less<00:02:48.849> damage<00:02:49.150> or

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
before you finish it the less damage or

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.030 
before you finish it the less damage or
super<00:02:49.599> will<00:02:49.750> do<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.349> sometimes<00:02:50.650> it's<00:02:50.799> better

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
super will do so sometimes it's better

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.629 
super will do so sometimes it's better
not<00:02:51.159> to<00:02:52.019> go<00:02:53.019> for<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.290> really<00:02:53.980> really<00:02:54.010> fancy

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
not to go for a really really fancy

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.599 
not to go for a really really fancy
combo<00:02:55.000> if<00:02:55.599> you<00:02:55.720> really<00:02:55.900> wanted<00:02:56.079> to<00:02:56.139> do<00:02:56.230> damage

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:03.990 
and true one two hits and that was more
hits<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.190> was<00:03:03.280> harder<00:03:03.549> to<00:03:03.579> do<00:03:03.760> when<00:03:03.879> there's

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
hits it was harder to do when there's

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.180 
hits it was harder to do when there's
only<00:03:04.090> 450<00:03:04.659> to<00:03:04.900> damage<00:03:05.230> where<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.920> other<00:03:06.010> ones

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
only 450 to damage where the other ones

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.089 
only 450 to damage where the other ones
are<00:03:06.310> over<00:03:06.819> 500<00:03:07.090> for<00:03:07.540> less<00:03:07.720> hits<00:03:07.959> so<00:03:08.620> just<00:03:09.010> as

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.680 
absolute favorite ways to land it is off
a<00:03:18.310> anti-air<00:03:19.180> also<00:03:20.019> our<00:03:20.139> anti<00:03:20.470> air<00:03:20.940> is<00:03:21.940> really

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
several but this one's nice because you

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.150 
several but this one's nice because you
can<00:03:28.000> combo<00:03:28.419> after<00:03:28.750> it<00:03:28.840> so<00:03:29.620> after<00:03:29.859> you<00:03:29.919> do<00:03:30.010> this

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160

by going to jump forward like that and

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.509 
by going to jump forward like that and
it's<00:03:32.290> going<00:03:32.379> to<00:03:32.440> cause<00:03:32.650> a<00:03:32.680> ground<00:03:33.010> bounce<00:03:33.220> so

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
it's going to cause a ground bounce so

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.580 
it's going to cause a ground bounce so
you<00:03:33.579> jump<00:03:33.879> up<00:03:34.000> with<00:03:34.359> a<00:03:34.389> fierce<00:03:34.930> punch<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.530> a
