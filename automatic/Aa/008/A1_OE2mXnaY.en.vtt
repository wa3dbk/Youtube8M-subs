inch<00:00:00.599> and<00:00:00.780> an<00:00:00.870> eighth<00:00:01.610> that's<00:00:02.610> a<00:00:02.820> big<00:00:03.030> chunk<00:00:03.300> of

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
inch and an eighth that's a big chunk of

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.369 
inch and an eighth that's a big chunk of
plywood<00:00:03.770> boy<00:00:04.770> I'm<00:00:04.980> sure<00:00:05.009> I'm<00:00:05.310> glad<00:00:06.170> that<00:00:07.170> fit

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
plywood boy I'm sure I'm glad that fit

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.220 
plywood boy I'm sure I'm glad that fit
the<00:00:07.500> first<00:00:07.680> time<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.809> wasn't<00:00:09.809> going<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.019> trim<00:00:10.200> it

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
the first time I wasn't going to trim it

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.480 
the first time I wasn't going to trim it
to<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.559> door<00:00:10.740> I'm<00:00:10.920> just<00:00:11.070> going<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.280> rip<00:00:11.460> a

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
to the door I'm just going to rip a

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.890 
to the door I'm just going to rip a
strip<00:00:11.820> drop<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.480> in<00:00:12.599> there

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
strip drop it in there

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.289 
strip drop it in there
because<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.679> threshold<00:00:13.920> covers<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:14.639> anyway

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
because the threshold covers that anyway

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.200 
because the threshold covers that anyway
so<00:00:15.360> that's<00:00:15.509> not<00:00:15.690> really<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:16.020> steppin<00:00:16.470> point<00:00:17.210> but

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
so that's not really a steppin point but

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.859 
so that's not really a steppin point but
this<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.720> inch<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.320> an<00:00:19.380> eighth<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:20.480> I<00:00:21.480> think<00:00:21.720> I

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
this is inch and an eighth and I think I

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.120 
this is inch and an eighth and I think I
grossly<00:00:22.550> underestimated<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.850> weight<00:00:25.130> I

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
grossly underestimated the weight I

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.169 
grossly underestimated the weight I
gotta<00:00:27.060> say<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:27.420> 90<00:00:27.750> or<00:00:27.810> 100<00:00:28.109> pounds<00:00:28.970> it's<00:00:29.970> way

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
gotta say it's 90 or 100 pounds it's way

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.020 
gotta say it's 90 or 100 pounds it's way
more<00:00:30.210> than<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> sack<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.779> concrete<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.529> away<00:00:32.160> an

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
more than a sack of concrete and away an

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.660 
more than a sack of concrete and away an
80<00:00:33.300> pound<00:00:33.510> sack<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.280> that's<00:00:35.280> usually<00:00:35.399> how<00:00:35.640> I

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
80 pound sack and that's usually how I

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.540 
80 pound sack and that's usually how I
gauge<00:00:36.000> things<00:00:36.410> this<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.559> probably<00:00:37.860> 90<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.219> 100

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
gauge things this is probably 90 to 100

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.150 
gauge things this is probably 90 to 100
pounds<00:00:38.700> even<00:00:39.690> with<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.020> little<00:00:40.290> chingadera

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
pounds even with this little chingadera

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.229 
pounds even with this little chingadera
here<00:00:41.520> cut<00:00:41.730> off<00:00:43.219> but<00:00:44.219> one<00:00:44.430> piece<00:00:44.700> right<00:00:45.000> you

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
here cut off but one piece right you

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.639 
here cut off but one piece right you
want<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.480> continue<00:00:45.899> with<00:00:45.989> floor<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.559> I'm

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
want to continue with floor and I'm

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.049 
want to continue with floor and I'm
going<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.829> put<00:00:47.010> tile<00:00:47.250> board<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:47.610> top<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.969> this

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
going to put tile board on top of this

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.840 
going to put tile board on top of this
but<00:00:49.070> it's<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.370> heavy<00:00:50.899> heavy<00:00:51.899> heavy<00:00:52.160> and<00:00:53.160> I'm

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
but it's just heavy heavy heavy and I'm

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.580 
but it's just heavy heavy heavy and I'm
going<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.090> test<00:00:54.329> my<00:00:54.809> ability<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.289> measure

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
going to test my ability to measure

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.500 
going to test my ability to measure
stuff<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.309> see<00:00:56.399> if<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.820> do<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.329> one

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
stuff and see if I can do this in one

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.319 
stuff and see if I can do this in one
sheet<00:00:57.750> which<00:00:58.379> would<00:00:58.530> be<00:00:58.649> really<00:00:58.890> cool<00:00:59.120> as<00:01:00.120> this

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
sheet which would be really cool as this

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.920 
sheet which would be really cool as this
is<00:01:00.510> tongue<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.870> groove<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:03.390> I'll<00:01:03.480> be<00:01:03.629> able<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
is tongue and groove and I'll be able to

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.160 
is tongue and groove and I'll be able to
slip<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:05.210> groove<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.450> over<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.869> tongue<00:01:07.140> and

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
slip the groove in over that tongue and

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.880 
slip the groove in over that tongue and
drop<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:09.020> really<00:01:10.020> all<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.740> to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
drop it in and really all I have to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.070 
drop it in and really all I have to
account<00:01:11.189> for<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.180> could<00:01:12.360> verify<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.930> these

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
account for is I could verify that these

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.270 
account for is I could verify that these
corners<00:01:13.470> are<00:01:13.590> square<00:01:13.680> which<00:01:14.070> they're

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
corners are square which they're

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.580 
corners are square which they're
probably<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:14.750> which<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.930> why<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.080> don't<00:01:16.259> cut

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
probably not which is why I don't cut

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.640 
probably not which is why I don't cut
these<00:01:16.740> tight<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.600> get<00:01:18.600> them<00:01:18.689> close<00:01:18.930> but<00:01:19.500> it's

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
these tight I get them close but it's

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.920 
these tight I get them close but it's
not<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.950> big<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.189> deal<00:01:20.479> because<00:01:21.479> I'm<00:01:21.720> going

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
not that big a deal because I'm going

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.070 
not that big a deal because I'm going
over<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.259> with<00:01:22.530> cement<00:01:22.890> board<00:01:23.130> anyway<00:01:23.490> and

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
over this with cement board anyway and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.570 
over this with cement board anyway and
quite<00:01:25.080> honestly<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.890> here<00:01:26.220> I'm<00:01:26.369> going<00:01:26.520> to

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
quite honestly like here I'm going to

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.950 
quite honestly like here I'm going to
run<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.759> cement<00:01:27.060> board<00:01:27.150> out<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.540> wall<00:01:27.689> and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
run the cement board out to the wall and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.780 
run the cement board out to the wall and
by<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.290> time<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.530> put<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.400> going<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.670> get

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
by the time I put this is going to get

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.670 
by the time I put this is going to get
half-inch<00:01:30.270> cement<00:01:31.259> board

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
half-inch cement board

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.580 
half-inch cement board
it'll<00:01:32.189> fill<00:01:32.400> those<00:01:32.549> gaps<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:33.060> half<00:01:33.869> inch<00:01:34.140> plus

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
it'll fill those gaps so half inch plus

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.130 
it'll fill those gaps so half inch plus
the<00:01:34.890> three-eighths<00:01:35.369> tile<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.090> these<00:01:36.960> little

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
the three-eighths tile and these little

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.289 
the three-eighths tile and these little
gaps<00:01:37.470> mean<00:01:37.770> nothing<00:01:38.210> there's<00:01:39.210> no

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
gaps mean nothing there's no

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.550 
gaps mean nothing there's no
compromising<00:01:40.049> integrity<00:01:41.119> integrity<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.930> yeah

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
compromising integrity integrity so yeah

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.620 
compromising integrity integrity so yeah
let's<00:01:43.890> check<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:45.030> out<00:01:45.240> let's<00:01:45.450> see<00:01:45.570> how

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
let's check this this out let's see how

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.230 
let's check this this out let's see how
the<00:01:45.689> next<00:01:45.869> piece<00:01:46.079> goes<00:01:46.290> see<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:47.149> fit<00:01:48.149> it

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the next piece goes see if I can fit it

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.830 
the next piece goes see if I can fit it
around<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.750> toilet<00:01:48.930> flange<00:01:50.750> actually<00:01:51.750> I've

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
around the toilet flange actually I've

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.539 
around the toilet flange actually I've
got<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.110> go<00:01:52.229> pick<00:01:52.500> my<00:01:52.649> nads<00:01:52.860> up<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.280> think

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
got to go pick my nads up I think

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.999 
got to go pick my nads up I think
they're<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.970> think<00:01:54.840> they<00:01:54.990> rolled<00:01:55.320> down<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
they're I think they rolled down the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.679 
they're I think they rolled down the
stairs

they<00:05:50.659> cut<00:05:50.900> these<00:05:51.050> grooves<00:05:51.289> so<00:05:51.560> when<00:05:51.710> you<00:05:51.800> when

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:52.009 
they cut these grooves so when you when

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:53.290 
they cut these grooves so when you when
you<00:05:52.129> bury<00:05:52.370> them<00:05:52.490> in<00:05:52.580> the<00:05:52.639> wood<00:05:52.849> they<00:05:53.030> kind<00:05:53.240> of

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:59.800 
lock in on themselves and I was using
number<00:05:56.659> six<00:05:57.050> screws<00:05:58.039> is<00:05:58.310> why<00:05:58.460> I<00:05:58.490> was<00:05:58.789> as<00:05:59.300> was<00:05:59.629> I

a little less beefy than these number
tens<00:06:05.150> so<00:06:05.539> these<00:06:05.960> little<00:06:06.289> two<00:06:06.470> inches<00:06:06.770> the

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
tens so these little two inches the

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.040 
tens so these little two inches the
heads<00:06:07.759> were<00:06:07.909> snapping<00:06:08.360> off<00:06:08.479> once<00:06:08.720> they<00:06:08.870> would

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
heads were snapping off once they would

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.809 
heads were snapping off once they would
get<00:06:09.229> down<00:06:09.409> to<00:06:09.590> torque<00:06:09.889> and<00:06:10.099> I<00:06:10.159> wanted<00:06:10.430> to<00:06:10.580> set

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:10.819 
get down to torque and I wanted to set

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:12.909 
get down to torque and I wanted to set
them<00:06:10.940> in<00:06:11.090> they<00:06:11.930> would<00:06:12.110> snap<00:06:12.409> so<00:06:12.650> I'm<00:06:12.710> going

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 
them in they would snap so I'm going

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.580 
them in they would snap so I'm going
with<00:06:12.979> the<00:06:13.099> heavier<00:06:13.370> one
