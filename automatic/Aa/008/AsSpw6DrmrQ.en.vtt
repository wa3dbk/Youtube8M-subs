pretty much applying to schools when we

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.070 
pretty much applying to schools when we
leave<00:05:48.979> here<00:05:49.009> and<00:05:49.550> God<00:05:50.180> willing<00:05:50.449> getting<00:05:50.810> into

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080

one of the schools where we'll be going

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
one of the schools where we'll be going
and<00:05:53.409> starting<00:05:54.409> my<00:05:54.729> journey<00:05:55.729> to<00:05:56.330> becoming

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
and starting my journey to becoming

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.600 
and starting my journey to becoming
indicators<00:05:57.289> I<00:05:57.560> just<00:05:57.949> think<00:05:58.190> I<00:05:58.550> think<00:05:59.590> that

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
indicators I just think I think that

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.980 
indicators I just think I think that
love<00:06:01.610> and<00:06:01.759> support<00:06:01.970> was<00:06:02.419> probably<00:06:02.810> the

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
love and support was probably the

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.379 
love and support was probably the
foundation<00:06:03.680> of<00:06:03.979> probably<00:06:04.819> both<00:06:05.090> of<00:06:05.270> our

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
foundation of probably both of our

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.170 
foundation of probably both of our
families<00:06:05.810> I<00:06:05.840> would<00:06:06.259> actually<00:06:06.860> say<00:06:07.099> that<00:06:07.180> that

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
families I would actually say that that

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
think I think that's the foundation of

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.170 
think I think that's the foundation of
our<00:06:27.229> of<00:06:27.560> our<00:06:27.860> success<00:06:28.340> in<00:06:28.520> many<00:06:28.639> ways<00:06:28.880> both

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 
our of our success in many ways both

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.980 
our of our success in many ways both
individually<00:06:29.960> and<00:06:29.990> together<00:06:31.659> but<00:06:32.659> you<00:06:32.870> know<00:06:32.960> I

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
individually and together but you know I

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.959 
individually and together but you know I
think<00:06:33.229> I'm<00:06:33.319> an<00:06:33.440> example<00:06:33.770> you<00:06:34.550> know<00:06:34.610> my<00:06:34.729> parents

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:34.969 
think I'm an example you know my parents

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:38.290 
think I'm an example you know my parents
always<00:06:36.069> had<00:06:37.069> me<00:06:37.250> aim<00:06:37.460> and<00:06:37.699> strive<00:06:37.969> to<00:06:38.000> do<00:06:38.270> the

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
always had me aim and strive to do the

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.360 
always had me aim and strive to do the
best<00:06:38.599> that<00:06:38.810> I<00:06:38.900> could<00:06:38.960> so<00:06:39.740> that<00:06:40.039> didn't

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
best that I could so that didn't

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.339 
best that I could so that didn't
necessarily<00:06:40.460> look<00:06:41.240> like<00:06:41.419> straight<00:06:41.780> A's<00:06:42.020> if

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:42.349 
necessarily look like straight A's if

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:44.529 
necessarily look like straight A's if
you<00:06:43.190> know<00:06:43.280> straight<00:06:43.610> A's<00:06:43.759> wasn't<00:06:44.240> what<00:06:44.509> I

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:44.539 
you know straight A's wasn't what I

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:46.240 
you know straight A's wasn't what I
could<00:06:44.780> pull<00:06:45.020> I<00:06:45.139> never<00:06:45.349> felt<00:06:45.650> that<00:06:45.800> pressure<00:06:46.069> I

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250 
could pull I never felt that pressure I

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.790 
could pull I never felt that pressure I
guess<00:06:46.580> and<00:06:46.880> I<00:06:46.940> know<00:06:47.000> for<00:06:47.360> for<00:06:48.229> a<00:06:48.259> lot<00:06:48.409> of<00:06:48.440> people

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
guess and I know for for a lot of people

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.399 
guess and I know for for a lot of people
maybe<00:06:49.009> um<00:06:49.430> you<00:06:50.120> know<00:06:50.240> they<00:06:50.509> do<00:06:50.810> carry<00:06:51.229> that

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:51.409 
maybe um you know they do carry that

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:54.219 
maybe um you know they do carry that
pressure<00:06:51.740> you<00:06:52.569> know<00:06:53.569> maybe<00:06:53.840> you've<00:06:54.050> had<00:06:54.169> a

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:54.229 
pressure you know maybe you've had a

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:56.230 
pressure you know maybe you've had a
different<00:06:54.650> story<00:06:54.919> but<00:06:55.159> I<00:06:55.219> just<00:06:55.669> know<00:06:55.849> for<00:06:56.090> me

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 
different story but I just know for me

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.689 
different story but I just know for me
that<00:06:56.419> one<00:06:56.990> way<00:06:57.199> that<00:06:57.409> support<00:06:57.889> was<00:06:58.069> seen<00:06:58.310> in<00:06:58.550> my

00:06:58.689 --> 00:06:58.699 
that one way that support was seen in my

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:01.120 
that one way that support was seen in my
upbringing<00:06:58.909> was<00:06:59.300> it<00:06:59.690> you<00:07:00.349> know<00:07:00.469> the<00:07:00.740> goal<00:07:00.949> was

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.130 
upbringing was it you know the goal was

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.580 
upbringing was it you know the goal was
always<00:07:01.250> to<00:07:01.430> do<00:07:01.699> the<00:07:01.819> best<00:07:02.000> that<00:07:02.210> I<00:07:02.569> could<00:07:02.719> and<00:07:03.469> I

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:03.590 
always to do the best that I could and I

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.809 
always to do the best that I could and I
think<00:07:03.830> that<00:07:04.009> you<00:07:04.250> know<00:07:04.340> I<00:07:04.370> think<00:07:04.460> that<00:07:04.669> that's

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:04.819 
think that you know I think that that's

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:06.670 
think that you know I think that that's
probably<00:07:05.150> a<00:07:05.389> principle<00:07:05.930> that<00:07:06.050> we<00:07:06.110> want<00:07:06.590> to

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 
probably a principle that we want to

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.029 
probably a principle that we want to
raise<00:07:06.830> our<00:07:07.039> kids<00:07:07.880> with<00:07:08.150> right<00:07:08.419> because<00:07:08.840> um<00:07:09.110> you

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 
raise our kids with right because um you

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:11.500 
raise our kids with right because um you
know<00:07:10.159> we<00:07:10.370> want<00:07:10.789> them<00:07:10.940> shooting<00:07:11.270> for<00:07:11.389> the<00:07:11.449> stars

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:11.510 
know we want them shooting for the stars

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.860 
know we want them shooting for the stars
and<00:07:11.839> Amy<00:07:12.110> for<00:07:12.349> the<00:07:12.409> best<00:07:12.680> but<00:07:12.979> you<00:07:13.580> know

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:13.870 
and Amy for the best but you know

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.570 
and Amy for the best but you know
the<00:07:14.169> pressure<00:07:14.410> is<00:07:14.620> it<00:07:14.740> would<00:07:14.860> be<00:07:14.950> perfect<00:07:15.400> per

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580 
the pressure is it would be perfect per

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.000 
the pressure is it would be perfect per
se<00:07:15.790> I<00:07:16.090> think<00:07:16.900> that<00:07:17.050> that<00:07:17.169> really<00:07:17.200> helped<00:07:17.620> me<00:07:17.830> be

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.010 
se I think that that really helped me be

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.070 
se I think that that really helped me be
successful<00:07:18.250> because<00:07:18.820> I<00:07:19.360> didn't<00:07:19.900> have<00:07:19.990> to

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 
successful because I didn't have to

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.010 
successful because I didn't have to
carry<00:07:20.320> around<00:07:20.410> that<00:07:20.590> weight<00:07:21.900> thank<00:07:22.900> you
