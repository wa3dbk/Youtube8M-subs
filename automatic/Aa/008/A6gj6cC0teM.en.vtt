some<00:00:19.500> mock<00:00:19.859> ribbing<00:00:20.609> I'm<00:00:21.510> going<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.779> start<00:00:22.050> as

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
some mock ribbing I'm going to start as

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.910 
some mock ribbing I'm going to start as
I<00:00:22.439> always<00:00:22.710> do<00:00:23.220> by<00:00:23.550> nodding<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:24.119> loop<00:00:24.769> into<00:00:25.769> my

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
I always do by nodding a loop into my

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.210 
I always do by nodding a loop into my
main<00:00:26.160> yarn<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.820> I'm<00:00:27.720> wrapping<00:00:28.289> every<00:00:28.980> other

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
main yarn and I'm wrapping every other

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.840 
main yarn and I'm wrapping every other
stitch<00:00:30.439> my<00:00:31.439> hand<00:00:31.740> may<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.340> way<00:00:32.430> a

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
stitch my hand may get in the way a

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.250 
stitch my hand may get in the way a
little<00:00:33.000> bit<00:00:33.149> I'm<00:00:33.390> going<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.570> try<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.809> keep<00:00:34.110> it

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
little bit I'm going to try to keep it

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.889 
little bit I'm going to try to keep it
out<00:00:34.350> as<00:00:34.530> much<00:00:34.559> as<00:00:34.920> possible<00:00:38.360> the<00:00:39.360> reason<00:00:39.390> we're

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
out as much as possible the reason we're

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.440 
out as much as possible the reason we're
going<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.079> start<00:00:40.469> with<00:00:40.649> every<00:00:41.129> other<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.820> to

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
going to start with every other is to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.380 
going to start with every other is to
approximate<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.530> look<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:44.550> one<00:00:44.879> by<00:00:45.120> one

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
approximate the look of one by one

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.160 
approximate the look of one by one
ribbing<00:00:46.460> but<00:00:47.460> then<00:00:47.789> that's<00:00:48.300> really<00:00:48.899> just

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
ribbing but then that's really just

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.290 
ribbing but then that's really just
stocking<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.860> fabric<00:00:50.460> with<00:00:50.700> stitches<00:00:51.149> out

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
stocking that fabric with stitches out

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.569 
stocking that fabric with stitches out
of<00:00:51.360> work<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.379> we're<00:00:52.590> going<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.739> need<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.160> double

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
of work so we're going to need to double

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.729 
of work so we're going to need to double
it<00:00:53.699> up<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.480> doesn't<00:00:54.899> roll<00:00:56.719> normally

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
it up so that it doesn't roll normally

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.290 
it up so that it doesn't roll normally
one<00:00:58.739> by<00:00:58.949> one<00:00:59.219> ribbing<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.760> knitted<00:01:00.120> more

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
one by one ribbing is knitted more

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.410 
one by one ribbing is knitted more
tightly<00:01:00.920> than<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.129> main<00:01:02.340> yarn<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.969> mean<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
tightly than the main yarn I mean the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.109 
tightly than the main yarn I mean the
main<00:01:03.600> knitting<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.110> that's<00:01:04.920> true<00:01:05.280> also<00:01:05.580> of

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
main knitting and that's true also of

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.899 
main knitting and that's true also of
mock<00:01:06.360> ribbing<00:01:07.189> okay<00:01:08.189> I'm<00:01:08.400> cast<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:10.909> let's

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
mock ribbing okay I'm cast on let's

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.999 
mock ribbing okay I'm cast on let's
thread<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.510> into<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> carriage<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:16.009> would

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
thread this into the carriage I would

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.070 
thread this into the carriage I would
normally<00:01:17.280> knit<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.150> yarn<00:01:18.479> at<00:01:18.689> three<00:01:18.930> or<00:01:19.049> four

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
normally knit this yarn at three or four

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.249 
normally knit this yarn at three or four
so<00:01:19.920> I'm<00:01:20.100> going<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.549> knit<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.880> at<00:01:21.060> two<00:01:24.080> I'm<00:01:25.080> going

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
so I'm going to knit it at two I'm going

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.380 
so I'm going to knit it at two I'm going
to<00:01:25.320> take<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> break<00:01:25.979> off-camera<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.150> hang<00:01:27.360> some

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
to take a break off-camera and hang some

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.359 
to take a break off-camera and hang some
weights<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:28.200> here<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.619> make<00:01:28.650> sure<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.040> works

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
weights on here to make sure it works

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.270 
weights on here to make sure it works

knit our mock rib what I need to do is

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.289 
knit our mock rib what I need to do is
get<00:01:37.470> twice<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.920> number<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.670> rows<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.240> I

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
get twice the number of rows that I

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.390 
get twice the number of rows that I
actually<00:01:40.049> desire<00:01:40.470> because<00:01:40.979> I'm<00:01:41.159> going<00:01:41.340> to

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
actually desire because I'm going to

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:49.150 
actually desire because I'm going to
hang<00:01:41.579> them<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.909> double<00:01:42.119> them<00:01:42.390> up

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
let's just say I've decided on eight

00:01:52.050 --> 00:02:04.930 
let's just say I've decided on eight
rows<00:01:52.350> really<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.490> I'm<00:01:53.610> going<00:01:53.760> to<00:01:53.790> need<00:01:53.970> 16<00:01:54.690> rows

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.290

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
that's my 16 I'm going to remove all my

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:15.230 
that's my 16 I'm going to remove all my
weights<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:10.310> put<00:02:11.310> these<00:02:11.490> combs<00:02:11.940> on<00:02:13.880> because<00:02:14.880> I

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
weights I put these combs on because I

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.390 
weights I put these combs on because I
wanted<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.810> make<00:02:16.260> sure<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.860> these<00:02:17.070> loose

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
wanted to make sure that these loose

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.610 
wanted to make sure that these loose
stitches<00:02:17.850> because<00:02:18.300> using<00:02:19.020> every<00:02:19.470> other

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
stitches because using every other

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.920 
stitches because using every other
needle<00:02:19.980> they<00:02:20.100> are<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.310> little<00:02:20.520> bit<00:02:20.730> looser<00:02:21.120> just

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
needle they are a little bit looser just

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.990 
needle they are a little bit looser just
behaved<00:02:22.290> well<00:02:22.590> now<00:02:23.370> I'm<00:02:23.550> going<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.790> bring

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
behaved well now I'm going to bring

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.470 
behaved well now I'm going to bring
forward<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.780> needles<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.260> were<00:02:25.410> not<00:02:25.650> in<00:02:25.860> use

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
forward the needles that were not in use

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.820 
forward the needles that were not in use
trying<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.540> keep<00:02:27.780> my<00:02:27.960> arms<00:02:28.290> out<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> way

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
trying to keep my arms out of the way

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.300 
trying to keep my arms out of the way
let's<00:02:29.130> see<00:02:29.310> if<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.490> can<00:02:29.670> do<00:02:29.820> this<00:02:30.060> other<00:02:30.420> handed

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
let's see if I can do this other handed

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.080 
let's see if I can do this other handed
there<00:02:32.310> we<00:02:32.430> go<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.820> I<00:02:32.880> hang<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.690> irreps<00:02:34.200> I

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
there we go and I hang the irreps I

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.700 
there we go and I hang the irreps I
think<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.210> should<00:02:36.450> get<00:02:36.810> extra<00:02:37.020> points<00:02:37.650> for

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
think I should get extra points for

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.120 
think I should get extra points for
switching<00:02:38.070> hands<00:02:38.520> don't<00:02:38.820> you<00:02:39.710> you<00:02:40.710> can<00:02:40.920> hang
