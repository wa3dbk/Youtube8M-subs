00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
still hold on to those DVDs but yeah you

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.480 
still hold on to those DVDs but yeah you
only<00:01:09.330> get<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> 5.1<00:01:10.170> audio<00:01:10.590> mix<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.280> they

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
only get the 5.1 audio mix that they

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.899 
only get the 5.1 audio mix that they
later<00:01:12.420> went<00:01:12.750> back<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.369> created<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.490> new<00:01:14.670> mix

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
later went back and created a new mix

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.359 
later went back and created a new mix
because<00:01:15.750> James<00:01:16.049> Cameron<00:01:16.439> basically<00:01:16.890> wanted

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
because James Cameron basically wanted

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.120 
because James Cameron basically wanted
the<00:01:18.150> sound<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> big-budget<00:01:19.619> film

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
the sound to be like a big-budget film

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.730 
the sound to be like a big-budget film
so<00:01:20.490> that's<00:01:20.700> why<00:01:20.880> they<00:01:21.030> did<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> 5.1<00:01:22.259> mix<00:01:22.530> but

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
so that's why they did the 5.1 mix but

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.050 
so that's why they did the 5.1 mix but
it's<00:01:22.890> unfortunately<00:01:23.520> because<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.790> really

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
it's unfortunately because I really

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.730 
it's unfortunately because I really
would<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.720> hear<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.170> original<00:01:25.590> mono

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
would like to hear the original mono

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.429 
would like to hear the original mono
track<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.220> well<00:01:26.430> but<00:01:26.930> let's<00:01:27.930> take<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.110> look<00:01:28.320> at

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
track as well but let's take a look at

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.230 
track as well but let's take a look at
the<00:01:28.560> spine<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.090> slipcover<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.970> here's

the spine of the slipcover and here's

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.760 
the spine of the slipcover and here's
the<00:01:33.390> case<00:01:33.600> II<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.229> pretty<00:01:34.409> interesting

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
the case II and it's pretty interesting

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.499 
the case II and it's pretty interesting
they<00:01:35.100> went<00:01:35.310> with<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> red<00:01:35.670> case<00:01:35.970> kind<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.390> like

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
they went with the red case kind of like

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.420 
they went with the red case kind of like
with<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> release<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.560> Birdman<00:01:38.009> on<00:01:38.189> blu-ray
