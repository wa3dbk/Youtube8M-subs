00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
and in each round module is basically as

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.860 
and in each round module is basically as
you<00:01:01.140> can<00:01:01.260> see<00:01:01.380> here<00:01:01.560> 8<00:01:02.010> Ram<00:01:02.790> slots<00:01:03.450> in<00:01:03.690> there

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
you can see here 8 Ram slots in there

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.690 
you can see here 8 Ram slots in there
and<00:01:04.589> there's<00:01:04.769> 5<00:01:04.920> mm<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.369> can<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.549> up<00:01:05.670> to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700
