00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
used with the jaws clamp so that's

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.580 
used with the jaws clamp so that's
really<00:01:36.420> cool<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.840> itself<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.439> actually

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
really cool in itself and actually

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.679

mount<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.350> really<00:01:43.560> cool<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.979> then<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> handle

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
mount is really cool and then the handle

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.910 
mount is really cool and then the handle
I'm<00:01:45.180> not<00:01:45.780> really<00:01:45.990> soul<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.500> using<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:46.860> a

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
I'm not really soul and using this as a

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.910 
I'm not really soul and using this as a
handle<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.399> think<00:01:47.610> there's<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.820> way<00:01:48.000> better

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
handle I think there's a way better

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.560 
handle I think there's a way better
handles<00:01:49.920> out<00:01:50.100> there<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.850> I'm<00:01:50.970> not<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.149> huge<00:01:51.240> fan

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
handles out there so I'm not a huge fan

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.999 
handles out there so I'm not a huge fan
of<00:01:51.750> using<00:01:51.930> as<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.200> handle<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.740> little<00:01:52.920> bit

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
of using as I handle it's a little bit

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.550 
of using as I handle it's a little bit
too<00:01:53.759> big<00:01:54.030> for<00:01:54.060> my<00:01:54.299> liking<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.869> yeah<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.439> think

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
too big for my liking and yeah I think

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.609 
too big for my liking and yeah I think
as<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.520> handle<00:01:57.000> it's<00:01:57.119> not<00:01:57.299> perfect<00:01:57.719> but<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:58.469> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
as a handle it's not perfect but for the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.649 
as a handle it's not perfect but for the
flexibility<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.340> versatility<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.420> allows

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
flexibility and versatility it allows

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.450 
flexibility and versatility it allows
for<00:02:00.899> static<00:02:01.170> mounting<00:02:01.439> shots<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:01.890> really

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
for static mounting shots it's really

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.399 
for static mounting shots it's really
cool<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.570> coming<00:02:03.840> down<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.079> clamp<00:02:04.259> itself

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
cool so coming down to the clamp itself

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.419 
cool so coming down to the clamp itself
it<00:02:04.829> has<00:02:05.070> way<00:02:05.369> higher<00:02:05.399> bite<00:02:06.270> force<00:02:06.659> than<00:02:07.469> just

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
it has way higher bite force than just

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.699 
it has way higher bite force than just
traditional<00:02:09.000> hardware<00:02:09.330> store<00:02:09.720> mounts<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
traditional hardware store mounts the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.110 
traditional hardware store mounts the
other<00:02:10.830> thing<00:02:10.950> that's<00:02:11.009> cool<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.550> does<00:02:11.700> use<00:02:11.879> a

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
other thing that's cool is it does use a

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.630 
other thing that's cool is it does use a
direct<00:02:12.629> GoPro<00:02:13.530> buckle<00:02:13.920> mount<00:02:14.099> which<00:02:14.430> is

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
direct GoPro buckle mount which is

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.460 
direct GoPro buckle mount which is
integrated<00:02:15.120> into<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.569> clamp<00:02:15.840> itself<00:02:16.020> which

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
integrated into the clamp itself which

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.830 
integrated into the clamp itself which
is<00:02:16.590> cool<00:02:16.940> that<00:02:17.940> means<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.239> can<00:02:18.360> use<00:02:18.390> J<00:02:18.690> Buc

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
is cool that means you can use J Buc

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.720 
is cool that means you can use J Buc
amounts<00:02:19.290> or<00:02:19.410> buckle<00:02:20.190> mounts<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.550> then<00:02:20.640> it

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
amounts or buckle mounts and then it

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.130 
amounts or buckle mounts and then it
also<00:02:20.849> makes<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.270> really<00:02:21.360> quick<00:02:21.629> and<00:02:21.810> easy<00:02:21.989> to

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
also makes it really quick and easy to

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.770 
also makes it really quick and easy to
remove<00:02:22.440> your<00:02:23.250> camera<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.239> cool

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
remove your camera so that is cool

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.070 
remove your camera so that is cool
I<00:02:24.810> know<00:02:25.200> use<00:02:25.349> no<00:02:25.650> need<00:02:25.860> for<00:02:26.450> tripod<00:02:27.450> mounts

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
I know use no need for tripod mounts

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.820 
I know use no need for tripod mounts
there<00:02:28.319> then<00:02:29.069> it's<00:02:29.430> also<00:02:29.610> got<00:02:29.879> a<00:02:29.910> rubber<00:02:30.209> coated

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
there then it's also got a rubber coated

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.070 
there then it's also got a rubber coated
rubber<00:02:31.830> coated<00:02:32.280> grips<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:32.879> the<00:02:33.239> tip<00:02:33.569> here<00:02:33.900> is

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
rubber coated grips so the tip here is

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.130 
rubber coated grips so the tip here is
rubber<00:02:34.349> coated<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:34.890> then<00:02:34.950> as<00:02:35.190> is<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.599> inside

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
rubber coated and then as is the inside

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.949 
rubber coated and then as is the inside
of<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.739> clamp<00:02:37.980> itself<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.209> makes<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.629> way

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
of the clamp itself so that makes it way

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.339 
of the clamp itself so that makes it way
better<00:02:40.890> at<00:02:41.220> gripping<00:02:41.550> on<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:42.030> all<00:02:42.660> kinds<00:02:43.260> of

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
better at gripping on to all kinds of

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.259 
better at gripping on to all kinds of
things<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:43.830> anything<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:44.580> was<00:02:44.700> smooth<00:02:45.030> that

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
things so anything that was smooth that

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.790 
things so anything that was smooth that
a<00:02:45.330> clamp<00:02:45.569> maybe<00:02:45.810> didn't<00:02:46.080> hold<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.379> well<00:02:46.650> to

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
a clamp maybe didn't hold that well to

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.100 
a clamp maybe didn't hold that well to
this<00:02:47.010> will<00:02:47.250> because<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:47.879> rubber<00:02:48.120> inside

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
this will because of that rubber inside

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.610 
this will because of that rubber inside
now<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.410> can<00:02:49.530> hold<00:02:49.709> up<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.459> two-inch<00:02:51.030> grip<00:02:51.750> so

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
now it can hold up to a two-inch grip so

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.410 
now it can hold up to a two-inch grip so
wide<00:02:52.890> open<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.310> will<00:02:53.400> hold<00:02:53.519> on<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.849> about<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.060> 2

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
wide open it will hold on to about a 2

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.589 
wide open it will hold on to about a 2
inch<00:02:54.620> diameter<00:02:55.620> thing<00:02:56.190> which<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.150> cool<00:02:57.390> and

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
inch diameter thing which is cool and

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:58.850 
inch diameter thing which is cool and
then<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.780> other<00:02:57.959> thing<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.470> this<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:58.709> what

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
then the other thing and this is what

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.500 
then the other thing and this is what
really<00:02:59.159> sets<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.550> apart<00:02:59.640> and<00:03:00.000> which<00:03:00.360> is

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
really sets it apart and which is

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.180 
really sets it apart and which is
totally<00:03:00.750> awesome<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:01.260> they've<00:03:01.890> got<00:03:02.069> this

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
totally awesome is they've got this

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.979 
totally awesome is they've got this
rubber<00:03:03.739> ratcheting<00:03:04.739> band<00:03:05.129> here<00:03:05.640> which<00:03:06.360> you

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
rubber ratcheting band here which you

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.290 
rubber ratcheting band here which you
can<00:03:07.200> pull<00:03:07.409> out<00:03:07.530> just<00:03:07.560> like<00:03:07.950> this<00:03:08.159> I<00:03:08.430> don't<00:03:09.239> know

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
can pull out just like this I don't know

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.550 
can pull out just like this I don't know
if<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.450> guys<00:03:09.540> can<00:03:09.720> see<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.019> but<00:03:10.050> it<00:03:10.290> wraps

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
if you guys can see it but it wraps

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.250 
if you guys can see it but it wraps
inside<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.819> mount<00:03:12.090> for<00:03:12.360> storage<00:03:12.780> normally

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
inside the mount for storage normally

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.750 
inside the mount for storage normally
but<00:03:13.920> then<00:03:14.040> if<00:03:14.159> you<00:03:14.220> want<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.459> clip<00:03:14.580> onto

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
but then if you want to clip onto

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.399 
but then if you want to clip onto
something<00:03:15.150> really<00:03:15.360> small<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.080> ratchet

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
something really small and the ratchet

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:19.220 
something really small and the ratchet
works<00:03:16.650> by<00:03:17.090> right<00:03:18.090> now<00:03:18.269> it's<00:03:18.480> open<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:18.989> then

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
works by right now it's open and then

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.369 
works by right now it's open and then
when<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.590> grips<00:03:20.060> touch<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.690> locks<00:03:22.200> the

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
when the grips touch it locks the

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.500 
when the grips touch it locks the
ratchet<00:03:22.650> down<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.069> becomes<00:03:23.519> impossible

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
ratchet down and it becomes impossible

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.420 
ratchet down and it becomes impossible
to<00:03:24.900> move<00:03:25.049> so<00:03:25.379> you<00:03:25.920> want<00:03:26.069> to<00:03:26.129> grip<00:03:26.250> onto

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
to move so you want to grip onto

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.130 
to move so you want to grip onto
something<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:26.940> they<00:03:27.060> there<00:03:27.659> demonstration

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
something and they there demonstration

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.330 
something and they there demonstration
shows<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.290> pencil<00:03:28.680> so<00:03:28.769> I<00:03:28.799> forgot<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.159> do<00:03:29.250> the

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
shows a pencil so I forgot to do the

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.300 
shows a pencil so I forgot to do the
same<00:03:29.519> thing<00:03:29.760> as<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.510> pencil<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:31.019> put<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.379> inside

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
same thing as a pencil you put it inside

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.119 
same thing as a pencil you put it inside
here<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:33.150> then<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:33.930> pull<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.530> ratcheting

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
here and then you pull the ratcheting

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.420

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
and just like that it's held on super

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.780 
and just like that it's held on super
securely<00:03:45.360> to<00:03:46.349> the<00:03:46.709> pencil<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.430> you<00:03:47.519> can<00:03:47.640> see

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
securely to the pencil and you can see

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.089 
securely to the pencil and you can see
that<00:03:47.940> as<00:03:48.120> I<00:03:48.150> that<00:03:48.540> it's<00:03:48.720> not<00:03:49.290> slipping<00:03:49.739> I<00:03:49.890> can

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
that as I that it's not slipping I can

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.550 
that as I that it's not slipping I can
turn<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.430> pencil<00:03:50.819> and<00:03:51.030> it<00:03:51.959> will<00:03:51.989> actually<00:03:52.230> it

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
turn the pencil and it will actually it

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.589 
turn the pencil and it will actually it
has<00:03:52.680> enough<00:03:52.890> grip<00:03:53.099> to<00:03:53.129> pick<00:03:53.610> itself<00:03:54.120> up<00:03:54.330> and

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
has enough grip to pick itself up and

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.170 
has enough grip to pick itself up and
without<00:03:55.080> slipping<00:03:55.379> and<00:03:56.310> then<00:03:56.519> again<00:03:56.760> spinning

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
without slipping and then again spinning

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
without slipping and then again spinning
it<00:03:57.360> like<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:57.750> there's<00:03:58.500> no<00:03:58.980> slip<00:03:59.310> so<00:03:59.489> that's

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
it like this there's no slip so that's

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.229 
it like this there's no slip so that's
really<00:04:01.200> really<00:04:02.069> cool<00:04:02.430> now<00:04:02.939> maybe<00:04:03.120> you're

not<00:04:21.780> is<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:22.650> gooseneck<00:04:22.830> something<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.400> use

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
not is the gooseneck something to use

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.960 
not is the gooseneck something to use
for<00:04:23.610> that<00:04:23.669> either

for that either

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.600 
for that either
probably<00:04:24.750> not<00:04:25.020> but<00:04:25.830> what<00:04:26.010> it<00:04:26.100> is<00:04:26.280> will<00:04:26.520> allow

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
probably not but what it is will allow

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.660 
probably not but what it is will allow
you<00:04:26.670> do<00:04:26.880> is<00:04:27.060> get<00:04:27.270> really<00:04:27.750> really<00:04:28.290> awesome

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
static shots and it's going to allow you

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.890 
static shots and it's going to allow you
to<00:04:31.200> switch<00:04:31.590> positions<00:04:32.430> of<00:04:32.730> those<00:04:33.510> static

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
to switch positions of those static

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.870

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
me I see this as a mount for someone who

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.910 
me I see this as a mount for someone who
uses<00:04:41.070> their<00:04:41.340> GoPro<00:04:41.730> to<00:04:41.790> shoot<00:04:42.120> things<00:04:42.830> from<00:04:43.830> a

stationary position this is kind of a

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.700 
stationary position this is kind of a
step<00:04:45.420> away<00:04:45.540> from<00:04:45.750> GoPros<00:04:46.320> that<00:04:46.530> kind<00:04:46.680> of

edition<00:05:00.000> I<00:05:00.300> believe<00:05:01.110> one<00:05:01.560> of<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.830> I<00:05:02.040> think

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
edition I believe one of the I think

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.640 
edition I believe one of the I think
that<00:05:02.400> goosenecks<00:05:03.240> included<00:05:03.630> in<00:05:03.720> that<00:05:03.900> so

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
that goosenecks included in that so

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.200 
that goosenecks included in that so
that's<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.490> direction<00:05:05.700> they're<00:05:05.940> going<00:05:06.060> with

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
that's the direction they're going with

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.000 
that's the direction they're going with
this<00:05:06.360> mount<00:05:06.570> it<00:05:06.750> can<00:05:06.870> be<00:05:06.990> great<00:05:07.440> for<00:05:07.680> mounting

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
this mount it can be great for mounting

this mount it can be great for mounting
to<00:05:08.750> stationary<00:05:09.750> things<00:05:10.080> you<00:05:10.290> want<00:05:10.470> to<00:05:10.530> get<00:05:10.710> set

up shop set up shots of events or
something<00:05:15.750> like<00:05:15.930> that<00:05:16.110> being<00:05:16.380> able<00:05:16.500> to<00:05:16.620> mount

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
something like that being able to mount

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.180 
something like that being able to mount
with<00:05:18.060> one<00:05:18.240> of<00:05:18.360> these<00:05:18.480> would<00:05:19.169> be<00:05:19.320> really<00:05:19.950> really

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
with one of these would be really really

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.909 
with one of these would be really really
easy<00:05:20.790> and<00:05:20.970> versatile<00:05:21.510> and<00:05:21.570> it<00:05:21.840> does<00:05:22.050> go<00:05:22.770> back

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
easy and versatile and it does go back

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.200 
easy and versatile and it does go back
to<00:05:22.950> the<00:05:23.130> roots<00:05:23.280> of<00:05:23.370> being<00:05:23.490> able<00:05:23.610> to<00:05:23.730> a<00:05:23.880> camera

will become incredibly versatile and
valuable<00:06:01.050> overall<00:06:01.919> then<00:06:02.160> I<00:06:02.400> see<00:06:03.150> the<00:06:03.630> value<00:06:03.900> of

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
valuable overall then I see the value of

valuable overall then I see the value of
this<00:06:04.440> mount<00:06:04.770> for<00:06:05.460> some<00:06:06.150> people<00:06:06.660> however<00:06:07.050> I

this mount for some people however I

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.159 
this mount for some people however I
don't<00:06:07.470> think<00:06:07.950> it's<00:06:08.400> a<00:06:08.700> necessary<00:06:09.390> piece<00:06:09.930> of

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
don't think it's a necessary piece of

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.430 
don't think it's a necessary piece of
gear<00:06:10.410> for<00:06:10.620> every<00:06:11.190> GoPro<00:06:11.669> kit<00:06:11.910> bag<00:06:12.200> if<00:06:13.200> you're

clamp mount and make one for two dollars

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.310 
clamp mount and make one for two dollars
and<00:06:20.880> then<00:06:21.000> see<00:06:21.270> if<00:06:21.419> you<00:06:21.540> actually<00:06:21.660> use<00:06:21.900> it<00:06:22.229> I

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
and then see if you actually use it I

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.040 
and then see if you actually use it I
found<00:06:22.710> that<00:06:22.860> I<00:06:22.979> used<00:06:23.280> it<00:06:23.430> a<00:06:23.550> ton<00:06:24.030> and<00:06:24.330> then<00:06:24.960> I

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
found that I used it a ton and then I

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.450 
found that I used it a ton and then I
found<00:06:25.229> the<00:06:25.410> investment<00:06:25.919> in<00:06:26.010> one<00:06:26.190> of<00:06:26.280> these

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
found the investment in one of these

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.760 
found the investment in one of these
easier<00:06:27.060> to<00:06:27.180> justify<00:06:27.510> because<00:06:27.960> I<00:06:27.990> know<00:06:28.140> that<00:06:28.740> I

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
easier to justify because I know that I

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.610 
easier to justify because I know that I
like<00:06:29.010> the<00:06:29.460> ease<00:06:30.150> of<00:06:30.180> mounting<00:06:30.840> that<00:06:30.990> the<00:06:31.320> clamp

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
like the ease of mounting that the clamp

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.040 
like the ease of mounting that the clamp
mount<00:06:31.770> provides<00:06:32.250> and<00:06:32.550> this<00:06:32.760> just<00:06:33.240> seems<00:06:33.660> all
