00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello to everyone from ranzi studios this 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.120
 comment of the new trailer of 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.000
 transformers 4 the era of distinctions 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.550
 then this trailer confirms again 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.320
 plus the expectations I had made myself 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.719
 with the first or that this film by 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.199
 transformers will be much nicer than 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.930
 precedents and will straighten the road that 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.970
 she was lost with the second film because 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.930
 Russian those reasons meanwhile meanwhile 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.380
 initial scene that I really enjoyed 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.390
 of this trailer you can practically do it 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.890
 see that this organization 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.290
 this organization discovered the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.020
 metal that a particular metal 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.180
 precisely molecularly unstable and it is 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.770
 practically the main metal of 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.629
 therefore the transformers are made 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.640
 discovering their material this 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.190
 organize it will manage to create his own 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.480
 transformers and therefore precisely in the film 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.640
 we will find a lot of drones commanded by 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.770
 how the activity this organization is 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.870
 same megatron the same megatorneo 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.420
 controlled by this ours 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.250
 organization you will have a very body 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.700
 different so expect but we are 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.990
 very different from the previous one and yes 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.960
 will call calva tron 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.990
 then here's a difference between comics 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.799
 a transformer would not suffice 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.630
 however, unicron's servant is fine then 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.270
 obviously bigger will explain 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.100
 this thing here so here's the thing is 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.150
 very nice of this little show that 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.820
 they show that they are finally looking 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.049
 disco try to explain in a manner 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.509
 scientific a little so transformers 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.890
 because in the end in the previous film 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.040
 they look like special effects 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.350
 he will never say that explanation 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.799
 to make them maybe a little more likely 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.360
 and to give more tone to the film 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.600
 science fiction in this film 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.490
 finally this thing will be here then 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.759
 in this train we see you are the scenes 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.649
 truly spectacular action ie me 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.710
 already in the trailer before I said that 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.440
 I think this would of 5 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.360
 wax 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.190
 even more ethical than previous and 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.610
 there are those who have them in this trailer 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.150
 just chock-full of scenes really that 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.400
 take your breath away beautiful 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.030
 then here in my opinion this plan trailer 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:32.080
 perfect because it tells you something about 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.990
 movie shows you good action scenes 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.630
 however, it does not reveal everything to you then 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.150
 we see nine scenes with green blocks that 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.560
 yet it had already been presented in the 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.690
 trailer before we even see more of the 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.430
 main villain which would be lockdown 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.560
 this new decepticon which is a 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.260
 mercenary arrive on earth between 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.730
 we believe in more scenes than him 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.770
 we see its transformation we see 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.050
 also of the scenes in which besides the usual 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.120
 the usual transformation of the face 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.210
 incarnate that shoots from optimus we see 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.570
 just that we see up scenes in 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.100
 which practically of fight with optimus 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.340
 then we also see a new bus 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:17.200
 let's see hound which is practically the 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.150
 green truck yes no let's say it's a 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.370
 perfect thriller because it shows us 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.320
 the action explains something but is born 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.530
 it reveals everything in fact in this trailer 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.940
 are missing for example were not not 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.540
 all buses were shown 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.700
 for example, drifters that are missing 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.910
 car blue black in short that then 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.930
 it would be the swordsman robot missing 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.700
 also of the others a tanker 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:45.360
 especially miss all the others who 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:48.100
 dinho bang because among the images of the 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.720
 toys and ears and in short le 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.450
 Various online interviews it turns out that 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.830
 in the end the nino vote 7 in short 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.019
 we have seen in do the reader 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.200
 above for milk we have it 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:01.930
 then saw the tyrannosaurus cricket 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.110
 we say that this trailer is also beautiful 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.700
 because it is not burned everything is not 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.220
 left all his twists 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.640
 all the things he has in the movie with two 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.790
 trailer minutes a trailer that was 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.080
 nice because pro ride April goes revealing 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.630
 the whole plot was that of arona where 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.940
 there is practically everything to arrive 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.460
 before and there was no twist and 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.400
 I think this film will have many things 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.320
 that are not told in the trailer 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.560
 for example the reason why the lock 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.650
 down comes to earth because it arrives 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.750
 on earth precisely 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.140
 plus then the trailer mannino jet 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.530
 of mystery about the character because it arrives 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:47.050
 no one knows why and octus wonders who 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.540
 has sent you here or we discover 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.390
 that the knock down is the main one 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.460
 but he takes orders from someone else 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:59.260
 and I stated that this someone else 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.160
 be unicron because it is something of the 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.350
 gender 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.240
 a fleet that is also a fleet 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.640
 do not wait any longer for calva tron 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.470
 that in the comic strip is the herald of 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.150
 unicron but what then was 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.270
 I think he replaced the old town 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.220
 obviously then for various reasons therefore 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.200
 john who also creates a halo around 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:22.300
 to the character and it is a very thing 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:25.150
 positive and nothing or very large 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:29.650
 aspect expectations path finally 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:32.500
 yes I hope all that comedy 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:36.010
 stupid of the three previous films both 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.500
 been so totally and then deleted 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:41.920
 here is also something else and above all that 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.900
 I like this new movie that these 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.560
 23 showed us that the robots 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:50.380
 are the main characters of the film 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.090
 that is, the events revolve around them and not 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.280
 there are human characters in the end 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.820
 the first trilogy could be titled 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.920
 sam the sam and robot problems we are 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:03.010
 one is addressed but there is this film yes 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.910
 can finally call transformers e 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.650
 transformers 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:10.390
 the robots are the characters on which he rotates 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.970
 history and above all i 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.040
 characters that make things happen 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.870
 in history and this is the thing 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.120
 important because in the end 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.110
 in the first three films they were only gods 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.390
 special effects 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.310
 here in my opinion and above all I hope 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:27.540
 they will also be more characterized also 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.770
 excellent however in the trailer speaks therefore 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.840
 optimus however is the character 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.770
 main of the robots therefore by force 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.810
 saw the race 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:38.229
 used will have many jokes but I hope 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:41.710
 that others will also have something to 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:44.379
 say they will not simply be robots 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:46.659
 which differ from the others because 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:48.550
 they have a different shape and punch 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:51.370
 in a different way that is finally I hope 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.860
 that with this movie michael bay has 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.470
 understood that the robots must be al 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.840
 center of the script 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.930
 that is, if they have to talk they have to show 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.150
 that they are people who have 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.250
 emotions that you speak but that act or not 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:09.159
 just shoot but then in my opinion 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.990
 this is going to be a great movie, and 

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:13.169
 I can't wait to see it 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.680
 and when I see it now the review 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:16.690
