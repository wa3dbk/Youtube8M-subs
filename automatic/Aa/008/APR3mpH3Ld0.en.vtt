00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
phone now the obvious comparison for the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.380 
phone now the obvious comparison for the
taco<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.439> with<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.860> iphone<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:15.090> be<00:01:15.150> honest

taco is with the iphone and to be honest
I<00:01:15.509> don't<00:01:15.570> find<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:15.990> helpful<00:01:16.290> comparison<00:01:17.100> but

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
I don't find that helpful comparison but

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.039 
I don't find that helpful comparison but
just<00:01:17.430> for<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.580> sake<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.820> argument<00:01:18.450> it's

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
just for the sake of argument it's

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.020 
just for the sake of argument it's
smaller<00:01:19.470> than<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.770> iphone<00:01:20.070> for<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> start<00:01:20.820> it's
