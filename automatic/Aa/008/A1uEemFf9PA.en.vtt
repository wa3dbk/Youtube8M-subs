although i did try using the combat axe
to<00:02:07.110> one<00:02:07.259> time<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.829> did<00:02:08.399> work<00:02:08.550> out<00:02:08.759> pretty

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
to one time and it did work out pretty

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.300 
to one time and it did work out pretty
well<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.629> just<00:02:09.929> depends<00:02:10.379> all<00:02:10.530> really<00:02:10.920> what<00:02:11.069> you

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
well it just depends all really what you

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.420 
well it just depends all really what you
I<00:02:11.340> do<00:02:11.780> so<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> tactical<00:02:13.380> this<00:02:13.500> is<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.770> one<00:02:14.340> of

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
I do so the tactical this is the one of

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.710 
I do so the tactical this is the one of
the<00:02:14.489> bread<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.819> butter<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.360> whole<00:02:15.510> class

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
the bread and butter of the whole class

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.640 
the bread and butter of the whole class
it<00:02:16.050> is<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.560> black<00:02:17.220> hat<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:17.790> went<00:02:17.940> two<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.390> these

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
it is a black hat it went two of these

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.750 
it is a black hat it went two of these
basically<00:02:19.650> this<00:02:19.770> is<00:02:19.920> why<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.069> have<00:02:20.220> engineer

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
basically this is why you have engineer

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.570 
basically this is why you have engineer
and<00:02:21.030> blonde<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.870> sort<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.380> so<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.430> going<00:02:23.520> to

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
and blonde I sort of so this is going to

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.360 
and blonde I sort of so this is going to
pair<00:02:23.880> up<00:02:24.060> with<00:02:24.239> your<00:02:24.840> anti<00:02:25.440> air<00:02:25.680> gun<00:02:25.920> you

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
pair up with your anti air gun you

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.759 
pair up with your anti air gun you
already<00:02:26.580> have<00:02:26.790> basically<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.930> black<00:02:28.170> hat<00:02:28.440> can

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
also hot care packages so I'm going to

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.750 
also hot care packages so I'm going to
go<00:02:34.560> into<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:34.890> really<00:02:35.190> quickly<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.610> that's

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
go into that really quickly and that's

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.490 
go into that really quickly and that's
going<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:35.940> be<00:02:36.030> like<00:02:36.150> part<00:02:37.080> of<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.230> video

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
going to be like part of this video

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.710 
going to be like part of this video
because<00:02:37.680> it's<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.040> big<00:02:38.190> part<00:02:38.459> so<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.330> black<00:02:39.480> hat

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
because it's a big part so the black hat

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.360 
because it's a big part so the black hat
is<00:02:39.900> actually<00:02:40.200> an<00:02:40.260> interesting<00:02:40.410> piece<00:02:41.190> of

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
is actually an interesting piece of

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.130 
is actually an interesting piece of
equipment<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:41.970> not<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.390> lot<00:02:42.480> of<00:02:42.599> people<00:02:42.900> use

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
equipment that not a lot of people use

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.479 
equipment that not a lot of people use
because<00:02:43.170> they<00:02:43.709> just<00:02:43.830> don't<00:02:44.040> really<00:02:44.220> see<00:02:44.459> a

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
because they just don't really see a

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.880 
because they just don't really see a
point<00:02:44.760> in<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.030> now<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:46.080> highly<00:02:46.769> recommend

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
point in it now I highly recommend

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.940 
point in it now I highly recommend
trying<00:02:47.430> out<00:02:47.760> because<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.600> great<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.590> I

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
trying out because it is great and I

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.309 
trying out because it is great and I
mean<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.340> basically<00:02:51.269> say<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:51.989> there<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.140> a

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
mean it basically say that there is a

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.070 
mean it basically say that there is a
claim<00:02:52.620> 1<00:02:52.799> and<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:54.030> use<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.450> black<00:02:54.600> hat<00:02:54.810> on<00:02:54.959> it

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
claim 1 and you use the black hat on it

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.610 
claim 1 and you use the black hat on it
equipment<00:02:55.500> gets<00:02:55.830> hacked<00:02:56.060> almost

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
equipment gets hacked almost

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.380 
equipment gets hacked almost
instantaneously<00:02:58.620> if<00:02:58.890> there's<00:02:59.430> like<00:02:59.610> no<00:02:59.819> the

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
instantaneously if there's like no the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.910 
instantaneously if there's like no the
lateral<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.290> turns<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:01.739> piece<00:03:01.890> of

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
lateral and it turns that piece of

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.920 
lateral and it turns that piece of
equipment<00:03:02.430> into<00:03:02.580> yours<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.540> there's<00:03:03.870> a

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
equipment into yours so there's a

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.870 
equipment into yours so there's a
claymore<00:03:04.290> in<00:03:04.380> front<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.680> door<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.310> protect

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
claymore in front of a door to protect

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.030 
claymore in front of a door to protect
it<00:03:06.000> or<00:03:06.060> whatever<00:03:06.260> then<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.590> turn<00:03:07.769> that<00:03:07.860> into

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
it or whatever then you turn that into

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.100 
it or whatever then you turn that into
yours<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.849> say<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.239> enemy<00:03:09.450> put<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:09.989> in

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
yours so say that the enemy put that in

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.650 
yours so say that the enemy put that in
their<00:03:10.319> spawn<00:03:10.819> so<00:03:11.819> that<00:03:12.030> people<00:03:12.299> couldn't<00:03:12.480> get

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
their spawn so that people couldn't get

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.270 
their spawn so that people couldn't get
in<00:03:12.780> there<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.380> have<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.650> get<00:03:13.799> through<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.040> wall

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
in there you have to get through a wall

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.910 
in there you have to get through a wall
from<00:03:14.580> pretty<00:03:15.000> dang<00:03:15.299> far<00:03:15.329> away<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.650> then<00:03:16.769> the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
from pretty dang far away and then the

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.039 
from pretty dang far away and then the
enemies<00:03:17.340> spawn<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:17.880> they<00:03:17.940> go<00:03:18.090> in<00:03:18.299> boom<00:03:18.630> blows

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
enemies spawn and they go in boom blows

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.590 
enemies spawn and they go in boom blows
up<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.290> kills<00:03:19.380> them<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:20.359> that's<00:03:21.359> a<00:03:21.450> pretty

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
up and kills them and that's a pretty

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.250 
up and kills them and that's a pretty
good<00:03:21.900> way<00:03:22.079> to<00:03:22.140> use<00:03:22.350> this<00:03:22.790> now<00:03:24.019> it<00:03:25.019> can<00:03:25.140> also

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
good way to use this now it can also

UAV a care package helicopter anything
you<00:03:33.450> can<00:03:33.600> blow<00:03:33.780> it<00:03:33.810> up<00:03:34.019> with<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.260> black<00:03:34.440> hat

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
you can blow it up with the black hat

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.289 
you can blow it up with the black hat
now<00:03:34.829> take<00:03:35.069> us<00:03:35.160> longer<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.760> takes<00:03:35.850> about<00:03:36.000> five

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
now take us longer it takes about five

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.840 
now take us longer it takes about five
seconds<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.959> eat<00:03:37.290> kind<00:03:38.010> of<00:03:38.130> like<00:03:38.250> just<00:03:38.430> keep

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
seconds to eat kind of like just keep

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.160 
seconds to eat kind of like just keep
your<00:03:38.970> cursor<00:03:39.390> over<00:03:39.569> top<00:03:39.810> of<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:40.079> and

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
your cursor over top of it and

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.559 
your cursor over top of it and
eventually<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:41.010> will<00:03:41.069> blow<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.400> up

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
eventually it will blow it up

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.240 
eventually it will blow it up
unfortunately<00:03:42.569> it<00:03:42.750> can't<00:03:43.109> hack<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:44.010> score

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
unfortunately it can't hack the score

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.949 
unfortunately it can't hack the score
streak<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:44.700> give<00:03:44.819> it<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.180> but<00:03:45.750> blowing

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
streak and give it to you but blowing

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.590 
streak and give it to you but blowing
them<00:03:46.170> up<00:03:46.290> is<00:03:46.470> just<00:03:46.859> as<00:03:47.010> satisfying<00:03:47.519> so<00:03:48.269> that's

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
them up is just as satisfying so that's

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.629 
them up is just as satisfying so that's
pretty<00:03:48.810> awesome<00:03:48.950> now<00:03:49.950> that's<00:03:50.310> not<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.609> only

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
pretty awesome now that's not the only

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:51.949 
pretty awesome now that's not the only
thing<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.180> can<00:03:51.299> do<00:03:51.359> with<00:03:51.450> this<00:03:51.600> you<00:03:51.750> can<00:03:51.780> also

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
thing you can do with this you can also

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.199 
thing you can do with this you can also
hack<00:03:52.350> care<00:03:52.739> packages<00:03:53.220> so<00:03:53.639> this<00:03:53.790> one<00:03:53.970> puts<00:03:54.150> a

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
hack care packages so this one puts a

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.690 
hack care packages so this one puts a
care<00:03:54.359> package<00:03:54.480> down<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:55.380> can<00:03:55.590> basically<00:03:56.040> hack

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
care package down you can basically hack

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.039 
care package down you can basically hack
the<00:03:56.910> care<00:03:57.090> package<00:03:57.420> and<00:03:57.540> then<00:03:57.600> turn<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:57.870> into

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
the care package and then turn it into

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.620 
the care package and then turn it into
your<00:03:58.170> own<00:03:58.470> bomb<00:03:58.829> so<00:03:59.459> that<00:03:59.639> not<00:04:00.030> only<00:04:00.209> will<00:04:00.510> you

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
your own bomb so that not only will you

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.390 
your own bomb so that not only will you
get<00:04:00.900> what's<00:04:01.109> inside<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.470> care<00:04:01.650> package<00:04:01.950> but

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
get what's inside the care package but

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.940 
get what's inside the care package but
then<00:04:02.609> you'll<00:04:02.910> get<00:04:03.290> if<00:04:04.290> you<00:04:04.380> basically<00:04:04.650> make<00:04:04.739> it

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
then you'll get if you basically make it

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.259 
then you'll get if you basically make it
a<00:04:05.010> booby<00:04:05.280> trap<00:04:05.310> so<00:04:05.700> that<00:04:05.819> when<00:04:05.940> they<00:04:06.060> go<00:04:06.209> to

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
a booby trap so that when they go to

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.660 
a booby trap so that when they go to
open<00:04:06.660> their<00:04:06.780> own<00:04:06.810> care<00:04:07.139> package<00:04:07.470> boom<00:04:08.069> kills

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
open their own care package boom kills

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.610 
open their own care package boom kills
them<00:04:08.850> so<00:04:09.600> hope<00:04:09.750> you<00:04:09.810> guys<00:04:09.900> enjoyed<00:04:10.290> this<00:04:10.440> short
