00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:11.469
 good ladies and gentlemen below 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:15.780
 I will show you how to have him teach him the 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:20.820
 recovery for samsung galaxy 7 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.890
 and 8200 helle start as show 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.560
 the way traveled for me to show you 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.160
 the recovery mode the recovery mode 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.810
 install to be able to install the binaries 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.860
 this device has been very difficult 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.230
 get him the recovery mode since he does not 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.110
 the programmers who are responsible for 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.140
 develop and modify them recovery not 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:47.239
 It goes well they had not gotten a hand to this 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.870
 version of samsung galaxy mini s3 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.870
 we proceed to learn 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.690
 to enter the recovery mode as they can 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.280
 see in the version and 8,200 is and this is 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.559
 the record 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.559
 the record is totally all 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.770
 there is so much to see so far not 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.980
 I have tried whip function no 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.440
 another function I had previously installed 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.020
 in recovery that claimed to be compatible 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.330
 with this device but the truth is 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.450
 affected the device so in this 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.960
 moment they are watching the device with 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.830
 the original system the factory has not yet 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.670
 out rock not built for it but 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.909
 may see 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.689
 the tour has already left and to install the 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.890
 I am going to leave a link with the 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:48.140
 binary and with all the route and the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.830
 odin for the steps to install it 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.750
 to install the record the garden area 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.050
 of his person are simply going to 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:03.229
 install without once in distance you get 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:05.270
 on something for external sd card once 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.630
 they give him there they look for the file of the 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.720
 binaries here I do not have and they give in 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:16.100
 date psuv to give in a date sul in 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.150
 English I do not give because I already install 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.939
 previously in him 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.340
 the binaries and I have them updated 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:27.670
 by the shop plays everything so not 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.299
 I want the update to go away and 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.060
 maybe I'm affected by the device and I have 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:37.090
 to go back to zero 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.530
 We reset the device to 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.960
 show them that effectively this method 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:49.950
 makes rock to the device 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:54.190
 as you can see is the version to which 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.530
 left abandoned is not the sauce 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.710
 because he wins the device owns 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.450
 requirement for long enough not 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:06.010
 until one more version 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.010
 at least the girl 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.190
 we hope that ignite forgive that 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.780
 make my distance this video I do not want 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.780
 spend 5 minutes 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.930
 unlock ma 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:29.189
 and we'll go so you see this is the 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.890
 super south once installed the super his 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:35.140
 the recovery and after having done the 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.930
 super process the phone is 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.349
 will turn on and the shop plays tory 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.030
 it may show you an update 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.099
 update the super show but at the moment 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.280
 that they reopen the superuser 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:51.040
 will ask you to be updated to 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.609
 the binaries then what are they going to do 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:58.000
 is to give it in install in a normal way if 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:04:00.489
 they give him the recovery I have not tried in 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.040
 this version does work because 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.099
 previously with the previous recovery 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.310
 that I had was not kept 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:11.379
 the recovery to have given 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.790
 update the super support a mode 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.459
 recovery 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.769
 then in the normal way I gave it mode 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.329
 normal and it did not take even five seconds 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:26.310
 updating binaries 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:29.520
 and here I have also the red 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:33.740
 your check the rock shaker as you can see 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:37.490
 the device is rock 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:40.240
 and in this way rock is made in the 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.810
 Samsung galaxy 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.810
 7 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:53.060
 8200 the and 8,200 the easy way 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:57.560
 quick and simple you just have to 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:02.180
 have three things odin 3.9 I'm going 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:05.169
 to leave in a link the route and the 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:09.199
 files 1 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:12.260
 and there are three processes, three processes in 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:15.440
 General step number one would 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.990
 install the recovery with odin once 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:22.120
 installed in recovery save in the 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:26.090
 sim card of the device 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:30.660
 this the binaries that I'm going to leave in 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:33.930
 the link once installed the binaries 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.690
 turn on the device if the store 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.630
 plan story shows you there is a 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.290
 update your profile update the 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.290
 application 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.950
 and when you open the application of your 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.950
 and ask him 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:54.320
 and the application asks you to binaries 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:58.280
 they must be updated in the way 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:01.820
 normal will be installed and once installed 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:04.449
 already the device is surrounded and with 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:08.620
 super your updated 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:11.919
 and you can install it in Roche that if 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:15.420
 they said if they want to try to verify that their 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:17.850
 device has been surrounded 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.380
 what we should expect now is that 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:23.650
 take out a new rom 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.570
 an update because until now 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.630
 is watching tour and for this 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.760
 device and previous processes 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.970
 to do what they were too 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.420
 complicated many did not work and there were 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:39.850
 have to try testing until a 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:43.360
 method would serve you with this method if 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:48.340
 well rock in an easy way and this video 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:52.920
 is only to show you the 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.920
 process that I am going to show you 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:59.330
 that effectively closed me and in this 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:02.390
 phone showing the same phone already 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:05.890
 who considered that one is capture is not 

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.890
 more effective than in videos 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:11.320
 and good with this I say goodbye to visit 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:18.170
 the post I did in taringa that is there 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:22.370
 more detailed information on how to be 

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:25.210
 break in this device with the steps and 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.910
 files that I'm going to leave 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:31.140
 Thank you 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.140
 and little hand up
