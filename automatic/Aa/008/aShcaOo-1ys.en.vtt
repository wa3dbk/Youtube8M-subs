 my name is morena menegatti and for technology it is synonymous with communication 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.710
 where to communicate I mean social media

 for me it is essential that you help me in my daily life and therefore also

 trivially from the date of the tame smartphone to the appliances for me the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.760
 enough trips to life, so to speak 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.350
 when I was already introducing you to us, the daring dinner number 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.720
 15 surprised me a lot 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.010
 mdv's ability to merge the processor with the io graphics card 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.130
 I deal with video editing video editing and for me the fact of being able to 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.730
 tell about a processor so fast and at the same time so small from 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.410
 being able to carry it around was fundamental for this to the struck attempt 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.410

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.230
 it was fundamental to be able to understand what actually succeeded in

 work with videos 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.639
 I tried ein dedicating a video inside a pauer point and kate 

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:57.149
 the transitions themselves create real problems 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.770
 the images were very fluid and even accomplished because the surrender was 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.770
 decidedly optimal xp

 they call me to hold back the tears of technology in the life of all 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.199
 my days 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.329
 the presentation of hurt struck because

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.699
 3 as a developer is definitely a machine that is perhaps a little more suitable 

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:48.699
 performance would be ideal 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.839

 instead I red dead revolution italo carlo poerio I was struck by the 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.469
 presentation to the fact that 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:14.359
 brands builds and while doing it i'm not sure if the quest to improve

 because you have chosen to test the graphics card because you save money 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:02.260
 because in our lives it is increasingly possible to count on a processor 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.459
 only 10 cents big which also incorporates a graphics card 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.380
 and decidedly fundamental for the many data that succeeds other than being in 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.380
 very short time for everything 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.979
