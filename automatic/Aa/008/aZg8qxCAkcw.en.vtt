00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 good to all guys for boston a 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:12.630
 bucciano we're just calling two 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:16.920
 killer in my opinion that is really scary 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:21.500
 in practice the story would be that jeff is 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:26.430
 entered our house and is looking for us 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:30.689
 and I hate the toilet lobby but I don't 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.430
 you can but also a bank in the toilet a 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:41.540
 guys really scares 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:47.300
 or because he never knows what to expect 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:52.370
 oh God is in the midst of so many disgusting games 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:57.500
 I found this saying pearl because 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:03.829
 then indicatively it cannot survive 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:06.400
 if you find yourself facing police bucket 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.400
 door 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:16.149
 I also think the fear is there because you 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.149
 I take a dose, we try again 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:27.130
 In any case I come in, I don't believe it 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.280
 I believe more 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.310
 is he is he with that fishy face 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.200
 that look like scyne anyway guys 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.950
 in his shop it is absurd why 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.909
 It is not that the face is actually made 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:46.880
 pretty bad it looks like sica range 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:50.240
 that is to say, done quite badly though fuck 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.340
 Fuck case I think he came in again 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.560
 the continuous 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.030
 oh my God but because he has not entered again 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.649
 knows what to do 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.740
 and anyway I found it in the middle of 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:06.350
 so many days that is really disgusting 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:10.110
 and they know nothing or stop it 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:16.030
 no no no run away run away run away 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.830
 escapes all the boys and that is back 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.530
 in that room 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.140
 I expect you here that he maybe passive 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.260
 somewhere else because if me 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.030
 I find myself before I don't know how to survive 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.080
 I 'm not 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.120
 berwin and if it has then spoken then 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.930
 they feel 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.690
 but not me 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.230
 ok open 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.190
 when you are simple 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.360
 it means use 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:45.260
 9 past has class but I did not expect 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.260
 own 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.210
 I hope you enjoyed the video is not 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.430
 always invites you to leave me like and 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.290
 share it because I take some 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.600
 in fact absurd like you 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.640
 however the vote is the dolls gameplay 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.510
 of this game and you are because it really is 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.290
 curious 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.410
 the graphic is the same from 60 being the 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.660
 young flash doing animations a 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.150
 a certain sense of fear that if in practice 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.330
 the only animation an image ticks 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.940
 take the vote on this game 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.270
 if because I consider the headphones to do the 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.160
 cool because in a sense it doesn't cost 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.560
 nothing to play with it so I put it in 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.110
 Amazonian description please 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.770
 sign up and leave for the cabbage of 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.810
 I like to see you at the next video on 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.400
 fetus video but they are worried because 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.800
 can watch this horror that you 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.320
 fraccari under this cool game 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:48.739
 this video is hilarious but ways 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:50.780
 already click on it if they tell you move to 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.630
 click on how many you need to click 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.530
 locke and gods look at me that von moron 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:00.500
 so move then the video is going to 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.440
 ending and when it ends it becomes everything 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.650
 black that you no longer see anything like like 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.620
 does mine when I move too much in a 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.049
 little more click and you take it in the cu for which 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.840
 move now then watch if you don't 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:18.380

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.950
 and the old man does not immediately come that is to a 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.019
 banana 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.019
 oh my God, but if the usual traffic jam
