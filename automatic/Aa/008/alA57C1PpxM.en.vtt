performance on the internal side how
much<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.740> has<00:00:17.039> improved<00:00:17.490> from<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.510> s2<00:00:18.990> from

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
much it has improved from the s2 from

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.779 
much it has improved from the s2 from
2011<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.210> galaxy<00:00:21.750> s6<00:00:22.140> edge<00:00:22.519> from<00:00:23.519> this

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
to do this benchmark test here so we are

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.279 
to do this benchmark test here so we are
going<00:00:44.100> from<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:45.180> lowest<00:00:45.600> here<00:00:45.840> exit

life 400 on the lowest to the highest

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.820 
life 400 on the lowest to the highest
and<00:01:02.280> then<00:01:02.789> we<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.480> devices<00:01:04.439> there<00:01:04.710> in

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
and then we have the devices there in

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.480 
and then we have the devices there in
between<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.880> let's<00:01:06.360> fire<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.590> up<00:01:07.740> here<00:01:08.189> shall

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
between so let's fire this up here shall

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.100 
between so let's fire this up here shall
we

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.929 

you'll<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.380> how<00:01:13.500> quickly<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.159> test<00:01:14.520> will

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
you'll see how quickly this test will

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:23.060 
you'll see how quickly this test will
run<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.830> various<00:01:16.830> devices<00:01:17.250> here<00:01:20.210> so<00:01:22.070> almost

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
run on various devices here so almost

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.830 
run on various devices here so almost
double<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.610> speed<00:01:23.880> that's<00:01:24.090> moment<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.570> s6

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
double the speed that's moment the s6

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.510 
double the speed that's moment the s6
edge<00:01:24.990> compared<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.619> s2<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:27.560> running<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:31.520> this

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
edge compared to s2 in running this this

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.890 
edge compared to s2 in running this this
course<00:01:32.880> definitely<00:01:33.150> will<00:01:33.720> be<00:01:33.750> interesting

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.190 

so<00:01:39.620> this<00:01:39.800> is<00:01:39.920> a<00:01:40.040> s<00:01:40.430> for<00:01:40.760> the<00:01:40.880> Anita<00:01:41.420> NFL<00:01:42.760> 5g<00:01:43.760> is

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
so this is a s for the Anita NFL 5g is

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.060 
so this is a s for the Anita NFL 5g is
8900<00:01:45.200> gene

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
8900 gene

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:54.790 
8900 gene
9250<00:01:46.970> yeah<00:01:47.420> you<00:01:47.480> can<00:01:47.750> see<00:01:47.870> that<00:01:52.180> Wow<00:01:53.240> okay<00:01:53.900> so

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
9250 yeah you can see that Wow okay so

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.530 
9250 yeah you can see that Wow okay so
almost<00:01:55.070> interesting<00:01:55.580> how<00:01:55.760> the<00:01:55.820> galaxy<00:01:56.270> s6

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
almost interesting how the galaxy s6

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.110 
almost interesting how the galaxy s6
edge<00:01:56.840> is<00:01:57.170> getting<00:01:57.650> a<00:01:57.740> higher<00:01:57.980> score<00:01:58.460> here<00:01:58.820> than

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
edge is getting a higher score here than

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.420 
edge is getting a higher score here than
the<00:01:59.270> gal<00:01:59.540> the<00:01:59.960> normal<00:02:00.410> galaxy<00:02:00.740> s6<00:02:00.980> even<00:02:01.310> though

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
the gal the normal galaxy s6 even though

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.220 
the gal the normal galaxy s6 even though
they<00:02:01.610> should<00:02:01.670> have<00:02:02.030> come<00:02:02.240> like<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.540> same<00:02:02.750> but

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
they should have come like the same but

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.930 
they should have come like the same but
I<00:02:03.260> also<00:02:03.470> saw<00:02:03.740> that<00:02:03.920> on<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.400> internet<00:02:04.760> speed

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
I also saw that on the internet speed

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.580 
I also saw that on the internet speed
test<00:02:05.000> that<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.480> s6<00:02:05.810> edge<00:02:05.960> needs<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.440> be<00:02:06.560> a

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
test that the s6 edge needs to be a

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.790 
test that the s6 edge needs to be a
little<00:02:06.770> bit<00:02:06.890> sharper<00:02:07.340> than<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.730> normal<00:02:08.210> s6

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
little bit sharper than the normal s6

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.500 
little bit sharper than the normal s6
and<00:02:09.800> then<00:02:09.950> we<00:02:10.070> do<00:02:10.340> get<00:02:10.550> in<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:10.880> galaxy<00:02:11.270> s5

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
and then we do get in the galaxy s5

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.250 
and then we do get in the galaxy s5
coming<00:02:12.020> in<00:02:12.140> here<00:02:12.470> and<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:14.870> galaxy<00:02:15.320> s4<00:02:15.740> and<00:02:17.260> now

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
coming in here and the galaxy s4 and now

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.630 
coming in here and the galaxy s4 and now
we<00:02:18.320> can<00:02:18.590> definitely<00:02:18.710> there's<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.370> big

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
we can definitely there's a big

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.200 
we can definitely there's a big
difference<00:02:20.090> in<00:02:20.270> speed<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:21.740> s6<00:02:22.370> edge<00:02:22.610> vs.<00:02:23.090> the

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
difference in speed the s6 edge vs. the

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.000 
difference in speed the s6 edge vs. the
s2<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:26.510> something<00:02:26.870> definitely<00:02:27.260> has<00:02:27.470> improved

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
s2 so something definitely has improved

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:43.460 
s2 so something definitely has improved
over<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.670> years<00:02:28.990> which<00:02:29.990> is<00:02:30.140> pretty<00:02:30.500> awesome

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.710 

so<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.070> can<00:02:44.190> see<00:02:44.340> how<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.670> score<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.330> doubled

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
so you can see how the score is doubled

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.320 
so you can see how the score is doubled
from<00:02:45.960> like<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.530> Galaxy<00:02:47.070> s5<00:02:47.490> to<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.790> galaxy<00:02:48.120> s6

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
from like the Galaxy s5 to the galaxy s6

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.420 
from like the Galaxy s5 to the galaxy s6
edge<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.990> five<00:02:49.350> hundred<00:02:49.710> five<00:02:49.890> thousand

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
edge to the five hundred five thousand

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.660 
edge to the five hundred five thousand
so<00:02:50.580> double<00:02:51.150> here<00:02:51.420> very<00:02:51.720> nice<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:52.670> not

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
so double here very nice and not

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.090 
so double here very nice and not
actually<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.120> double<00:02:54.330> between<00:02:54.780> s4<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.890> s

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
actually a double between s4 and the s

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.640 
actually a double between s4 and the s
file<00:02:56.400> but<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.210> little<00:02:57.840> bit<00:02:57.930> incremental

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
file but it is a little bit incremental

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.460 
file but it is a little bit incremental
upgrade<00:02:59.400> but<00:03:00.000> then<00:03:00.150> we<00:03:00.300> do<00:03:00.450> have<00:03:00.660> also<00:03:00.810> pretty

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
upgrade but then we do have also pretty

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.700 
upgrade but then we do have also pretty
nice<00:03:02.160> difference<00:03:02.790> between<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.270> s3<00:03:03.690> s4<00:03:03.990> 9s

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
nice difference between the s3 s4 9s

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.890 
nice difference between the s3 s4 9s
upgrade<00:03:05.130> there<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.610> then<00:03:06.330> we<00:03:06.570> do<00:03:06.690> have<00:03:06.720> the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
upgrade there and then we do have the

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.020 
upgrade there and then we do have the
lowest<00:03:07.320> from<00:03:07.800> here<00:03:08.070> it<00:03:08.190> is<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.400> big<00:03:08.640> difference

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
lowest from here it is a big difference

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.180 
lowest from here it is a big difference
multi-core<00:03:09.510> score<00:03:09.770> 686<00:03:10.770> vs<00:03:12.050> 4251<00:03:13.050> almost<00:03:13.770> ten

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
multi-core score 686 vs 4251 almost ten

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.900 
multi-core score 686 vs 4251 almost ten
times<00:03:14.610> higher<00:03:15.060> score<00:03:15.600> on<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:18.050> galaxy<00:03:19.050> s6<00:03:19.140> edge

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
times higher score on the galaxy s6 edge

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.300 
times higher score on the galaxy s6 edge
and<00:03:20.910> just<00:03:21.660> because<00:03:22.020> that's<00:03:22.410> many<00:03:22.890> many<00:03:23.130> more

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
and just because that's many many more

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.300 
and just because that's many many more
course<00:03:23.700> that's<00:03:24.600> why<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:24.840> see<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.440> high<00:03:25.770> we<00:03:26.280> are

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
course that's why you see a high we are

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.850 
course that's why you see a high we are
a<00:03:26.460> multi-core<00:03:27.000> score<00:03:27.120> versus<00:03:27.630> eft<00:03:28.020> single

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
a multi-core score versus eft single

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.880 
a multi-core score versus eft single
core<00:03:29.100> score<00:03:29.570> so<00:03:30.570> that's<00:03:30.780> that's<00:03:31.110> quite<00:03:31.530> nice

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
core score so that's that's quite nice

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.400 
core score so that's that's quite nice
actually<00:03:32.190> so<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:33.060> big<00:03:33.930> difference<00:03:34.230> also

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
actually so a big difference also

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.520 
actually so a big difference also
between<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.890> s2<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:36.390> s3<00:03:36.900> very<00:03:37.230> nice

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
between the s2 and the s3 very nice

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.000 
between the s2 and the s3 very nice
upgrade<00:03:38.070> there<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:39.140> almost<00:03:40.140> doubling<00:03:40.590> here

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
upgrade there and almost doubling here

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.640 
upgrade there and almost doubling here
it<00:03:41.280> did<00:03:41.520> it<00:03:41.640> double<00:03:42.000> from<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.300> s3<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.930> s4<00:03:43.110> but

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
it did it double from the s3 to s4 but

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.830 
it did it double from the s3 to s4 but
it<00:03:44.010> was<00:03:44.130> a<00:03:44.160> very<00:03:44.430> nice<00:03:44.700> update<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.360> then<00:03:45.480> use<00:03:45.810> a

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
it was a very nice update and then use a

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.990 
it was a very nice update and then use a
tiny<00:03:46.140> update<00:03:46.530> from<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:46.860> four<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.430> s5<00:03:47.790> and

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
tiny update from this four to the s5 and

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.660 
tiny update from this four to the s5 and
setting<00:03:48.570> up<00:03:48.690> some<00:03:48.840> problems<00:03:49.200> there<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:49.670> with

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
setting up some problems there and with

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.850 
setting up some problems there and with
low<00:03:50.820> sales<00:03:51.239> on<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.450> s5<00:03:51.840> so<00:03:52.440> they<00:03:52.560> really

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
low sales on the s5 so they really

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.770 
low sales on the s5 so they really
really<00:03:53.160> stepped<00:03:53.459> up<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.700> game<00:03:53.730> again<00:03:54.209> with

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
really stepped up the game again with

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.290 
really stepped up the game again with
the<00:03:54.989> s6<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.590> s6<00:03:55.680> edge<00:03:56.040> here<00:03:56.520> for<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.850> doubling

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
the s6 and s6 edge here for the doubling

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.270 
the s6 and s6 edge here for the doubling
like<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.660> speeds<00:03:57.989> so<00:03:58.380> that's<00:03:58.830> quite<00:03:59.040> nice<00:03:59.220> so

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
like the speeds so that's quite nice so

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.520 
like the speeds so that's quite nice so
just<00:04:00.209> a<00:04:00.300> quick<00:04:00.480> deal<00:04:00.630> video<00:04:00.930> chicken<00:04:01.320> that<00:04:01.410> out

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
just a quick deal video chicken that out

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.530 
just a quick deal video chicken that out
definite<00:04:01.950> let<00:04:02.040> me<00:04:02.130> know<00:04:02.250> if<00:04:02.520> you<00:04:02.820> want<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.239> see
