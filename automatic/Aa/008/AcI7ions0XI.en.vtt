00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.160 
the native 1080p on two and a half weeks
ago<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:26.039> put<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.550> bit<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.939> wire<00:00:27.210> there<00:00:27.539> with

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
ago I put that bit of wire there with

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.370 
ago I put that bit of wire there with
the<00:00:28.349> view<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:29.060> by<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.119> time<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.720> bees<00:00:30.929> bring

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
to lift that wire up and place it in

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.970 
to lift that wire up and place it in
another<00:00:37.440> box<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.300> make<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> new<00:00:39.600> hive<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.890> you

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
another box and make a new hive so you

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.170 
another box and make a new hive so you

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
perspex on here four screws countersunk

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.590 
perspex on here four screws countersunk
holding<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.739> place<00:00:47.000> we<00:00:48.000> often<00:00:48.270> put<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
holding it in place we often put the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.020 
holding it in place we often put the
other<00:00:48.750> lid<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.140> top<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.730> anybody<00:00:50.730> can

this<00:00:58.920> what<00:00:59.430> I'm<00:00:59.520> going<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.730> do<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.090> remove<00:01:00.420> this

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
this what I'm going to do is remove this

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.529 
this what I'm going to do is remove this
lid<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.530> then<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:02.059> overcome<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
lid and and then we can overcome the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.270 
lid and and then we can overcome the
reflection<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.500> can<00:01:04.559> see<00:01:04.830> what<00:01:05.070> they've<00:01:05.250> done

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
reflection you can see what they've done

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.080 
reflection you can see what they've done
is<00:01:05.640> they've<00:01:05.850> blocked<00:01:06.600> up<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.830> gaps<00:01:08.520> with

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
is they've blocked up all the gaps with

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.940 
is they've blocked up all the gaps with
probably<00:01:09.570> some<00:01:09.840> sort<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.140> propolis<00:01:10.619> at<00:01:10.799> their

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
probably some sort of propolis at their

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.609 
probably some sort of propolis at their
native<00:01:11.280> bees<00:01:11.490> mate<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.990> can<00:01:13.140> see<00:01:13.350> them

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
native bees mate and you can see them

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.429 
native bees mate and you can see them
working<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.700> brood<00:01:15.030> they<00:01:15.930> build<00:01:16.229> that

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
working on that brood they build that

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.890 
working on that brood they build that
brood<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> sort<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.759> spiral<00:01:18.180> they<00:01:18.600> saw<00:01:18.869> a

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
brood in a sort of a spiral they saw a

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.469 
brood in a sort of a spiral they saw a
spiral<00:01:19.560> around<00:01:19.950> they<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:20.970> sort<00:01:21.360> of

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
spiral around they have this sort of

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.440 
spiral around they have this sort of
stuff<00:01:21.869> around<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.439> outside<00:01:22.970> which<00:01:23.970> bridges

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
stuff around the outside which bridges

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.530 
stuff around the outside which bridges
the<00:01:24.750> cross<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.890> their<00:01:26.159> honey<00:01:26.430> their<00:01:27.270> little

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
the cross to their honey their little

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.499 
the cross to their honey their little
honey<00:01:27.750> pots<00:01:28.110> where<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.340> European<00:01:30.000> honeybee

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
honey pots where the European honeybee

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.819 
honey pots where the European honeybee
has<00:01:31.290> their<00:01:31.650> honey<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.340> honeycomb<00:01:33.439> these<00:01:34.439> bees

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
has their honey in honeycomb these bees

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.520 
has their honey in honeycomb these bees
make<00:01:35.280> these<00:01:35.520> little<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.810> topple<00:01:37.350> over

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
make these little this a topple over

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.249 
make these little this a topple over
decide<00:01:38.040> here<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.579> then<00:01:39.540> they<00:01:39.689> put<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> cap<00:01:40.229> on

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
decide here and then they put a cap on

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.980 
decide here and then they put a cap on
it<00:01:40.619> yeah<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.759> honey<00:01:42.000> pots<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.570> was<00:01:42.659> talking

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
it yeah the honey pots I was talking

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.170 
it yeah the honey pots I was talking
about<00:01:43.229> there's<00:01:43.680> one<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.549> on<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.060> floor

here away from the main hive and see
where<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.409> screwdrivers<00:01:50.070> pointing<00:01:50.689> there's

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
where the screwdrivers pointing there's

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.149
