put a little hairspray in it which I
really<00:02:26.910> probably<00:02:27.270> shouldn't<00:02:27.750> have<00:02:27.780> done<00:02:27.900> but

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
really probably shouldn't have done but

really probably shouldn't have done but
just<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.340> little<00:02:29.490> bit<00:02:29.760> just<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.150> kind<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.450> freeze

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720

it<00:02:30.959> on<00:02:31.170> in<00:02:31.590> place<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.760> holds<00:02:32.940> the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
it on in place and it holds the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.300 
it on in place and it holds the
hairspray<00:02:33.630> pretty<00:02:33.930> well<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.200> actually<00:02:34.500> used<00:02:35.010> a

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
hairspray pretty well I actually used a

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.740 
hairspray pretty well I actually used a
suave<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:37.470> maximum<00:02:38.370> holds<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.850> eighth<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.360> I

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
suave the maximum holds the eighth and I

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.720 
suave the maximum holds the eighth and I
just<00:02:39.989> sprayed<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> little<00:02:40.350> bit<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:40.950> here<00:02:41.489> and

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
just sprayed a little bit of it here and

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.220 
just sprayed a little bit of it here and
a<00:02:41.760> little<00:02:41.910> bit<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.180> here<00:02:42.569> just<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.959> kind<00:02:43.140> of

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
a little bit of here just to kind of

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.260 
a little bit of here just to kind of
keep<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.620> there's<00:02:44.190> some<00:02:44.550> hair<00:02:44.730> sprays<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.180> I

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.000 
keep it there's some hair sprays that I
use<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.569> it<00:02:46.140> really<00:02:46.350> doesn't<00:02:46.709> work<00:02:46.800> that

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
use that it really doesn't work that

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.890

long<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.370> ways<00:02:47.550> that<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:47.850> one<00:02:48.209> it<00:02:48.690> works

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
long the ways that that one it works

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.860 
long the ways that that one it works
pretty<00:02:49.080> much<00:02:49.230> okay<00:02:49.770> it's<00:02:50.069> pretty<00:02:50.310> much<00:02:50.870> louder

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870
