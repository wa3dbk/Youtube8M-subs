 This plant is 2 giant scale voltage 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.860
 he has 2 and 28 wingspan and the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.109
 his compliance is one meter and sixty 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:21.140
 three in the complete plan to whom it goes 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.140
 mount the air 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:30.780
 in every detail and ps is for 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.780
 conversion of 120 cc 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.629
 bia that has both plants each plant 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.110
 It's about 23 meters almost two meters

 impulse 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:09.500
 I'm going to shoot from the pieces now 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:13.090
 that she already wang in the format of this plant 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.090
 here to talk about the clipping 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.890
 this tour

 these are the other 22 and 28 pieces 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:51.700
 wingspan all to make cutouts 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.700
 manual has to have city are 15 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:13.510

 manual with 60 sheets explaining the 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.820
 expulso assembly 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:32.210
 the emcop meters and half of bench only here 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.849
 goose 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.849
 the giant 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:09.630
 this is a bomb and montage of it

 parts for mounting that they do not size 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.710
 great 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:31.420
 already the actual size for you to make a 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.640
 clipping assemblies have other sheets 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.520
 in low not only simplified you have 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:41.590
