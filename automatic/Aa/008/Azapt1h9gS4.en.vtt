across all barriers you know what I mean

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.710 
across all barriers you know what I mean
because<00:02:16.440> when<00:02:17.220> somebody<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.390> deeply

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
because when somebody that you deeply

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.940 
because when somebody that you deeply
loved<00:02:19.490> strikes<00:02:20.490> you<00:02:20.790> for<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.270> first<00:02:21.480> time<00:02:21.950> it

just you know it just lowers the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.880 
just you know it just lowers the
self-esteem<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:28.200> world<00:02:28.410> just<00:02:28.530> comes

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
self-esteem and the world just comes

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.560 
self-esteem and the world just comes
crashing<00:02:29.370> down<00:02:29.400> because<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.150> just<00:02:30.330> can't
