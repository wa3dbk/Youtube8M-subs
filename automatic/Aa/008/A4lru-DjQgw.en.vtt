come<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.130> now<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.909> targeting<00:01:39.329> system<00:01:39.450> is

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
come on now the targeting system is

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.940 
come on now the targeting system is
similar<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.020> other<00:01:40.170> MMOs<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.860> you

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
similar to other MMOs and that you

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.380 
similar to other MMOs and that you
simply<00:01:41.159> select<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.549> target<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.000> lock<00:01:42.150> onto

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
simply select the target and lock onto

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.789 
simply select the target and lock onto
them<00:01:42.600> from<00:01:42.899> there<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.439> have<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.590> make<00:01:43.770> sure

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
them from there you have to make sure

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.800 
them from there you have to make sure
that<00:01:44.100> they're<00:01:44.250> not<00:01:44.369> only<00:01:44.670> within<00:01:44.850> range<00:01:45.329> but

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
that they're not only within range but

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.149 
that they're not only within range but
they<00:01:45.930> also<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.439> within<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.829> front

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
they also have to be within the front

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.580 
they also have to be within the front
Conal<00:01:47.610> range<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.030> be<00:01:48.119> attacked<00:01:48.450> your<00:01:49.170> cannons

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590

and<00:01:52.770> their<00:01:53.009> hit<00:01:53.220> rate<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.520> determined<00:01:53.640> by

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
and their hit rate is determined by

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.969 
and their hit rate is determined by
whatever<00:01:54.329> evasive<00:01:54.750> maneuvers<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.560> target<00:01:55.860> is

whatever evasive maneuvers the target is
taking<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:56.700> you're<00:01:56.850> firing<00:01:57.329> away<00:01:57.570> at<00:01:57.840> them

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
taking so if you're firing away at them

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.139 
taking so if you're firing away at them
they<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.530> be<00:01:58.619> doing<00:01:59.009> dips<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.610> dives<00:01:59.850> and

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
they can be doing dips and dives and

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.300 
they can be doing dips and dives and

the<00:02:05.250> target<00:02:05.430> but<00:02:05.969> there<00:02:06.149> are<00:02:06.240> ways<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.420> modify

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
the target but there are ways to modify

this which we'll talk about in a second
in<00:02:08.819> each<00:02:09.000> system<00:02:09.360> there's<00:02:09.569> typically<00:02:09.840> a

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
in each system there's typically a

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.890 
in each system there's typically a
starship<00:02:10.500> or<00:02:10.709> bass<00:02:11.039> or<00:02:11.459> craft<00:02:11.849> or<00:02:12.209> some<00:02:12.510> sort

experience you get these skill points

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.349 
experience you get these skill points
that<00:02:38.430> allow<00:02:38.609> you<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.760> invest<00:02:39.090> in<00:02:39.209> improving

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
that allow you to invest in improving

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.000 
that allow you to invest in improving
some<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.019> core<00:02:40.200> mechanics<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.680> your<00:02:40.799> ship

some of the core mechanics of your ship

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.220 
some of the core mechanics of your ship
these<00:02:41.430> range<00:02:41.670> from<00:02:41.790> boost<00:02:42.239> speed<00:02:42.569> to<00:02:42.989> turn

these range from boost speed to turn
radius<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:44.010> weapon<00:02:44.310> precision<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.209> these<00:02:45.359> are

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
radius to weapon precision and these are

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.449 
radius to weapon precision and these are
all<00:02:45.510> relatively<00:02:45.959> small<00:02:46.319> jumps<00:02:46.769> each<00:02:46.980> giving

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
all relatively small jumps each giving

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.160 
all relatively small jumps each giving
you<00:02:47.549> around<00:02:47.849> like<00:02:48.000> one<00:02:48.209> percent<00:02:48.569> or<00:02:48.659> so<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:49.079> an

sure in the later levels it probably
takes<00:03:02.189> even<00:03:02.489> longer<00:03:02.639> and<00:03:03.389> this<00:03:03.629> leads<00:03:03.900> us<00:03:04.139> to

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
takes even longer and this leads us to

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.770 
takes even longer and this leads us to
the<00:03:04.439> cash<00:03:04.709> shop<00:03:05.129> because<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:06.120> cash<00:03:06.299> shop<00:03:06.540> has

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
the cash shop because the cash shop has

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.750 
the cash shop because the cash shop has
a<00:03:06.810> direct<00:03:07.319> impact<00:03:07.500> on<00:03:07.889> everything<00:03:08.280> we've<00:03:08.430> just

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
a direct impact on everything we've just

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.250 
a direct impact on everything we've just
talked<00:03:08.970> about<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.599> it's<00:03:09.780> important<00:03:10.139> I<00:03:10.200> think

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
talked about so it's important I think

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.899 
talked about so it's important I think
that<00:03:10.590> we<00:03:10.709> kind<00:03:11.159> of<00:03:11.250> knock<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.549> out<00:03:11.639> while<00:03:11.790> we're

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
that we kind of knock it out while we're

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:13.940 
that we kind of knock it out while we're
here<00:03:12.120> first<00:03:12.780> off<00:03:12.959> I<00:03:13.079> want<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.290> mention<00:03:13.439> again
