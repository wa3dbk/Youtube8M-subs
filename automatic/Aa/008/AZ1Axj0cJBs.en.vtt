 6 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.470
 for the fears they faced each other in the ring 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.720
 of the voice we turn andrea manchiero 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.420
 noemi relationship I have to ask you who you want 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.580
 bring with you to live shows instead I would like 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.100
 ask other coaches what 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.750
 they think of j ax and what do you think of women 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.170
 by andrea manchiero but above all that 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.760
 what do you think of the orlay lo andrea lo 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.660
 we know that with the play I don't like them 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.640
 however, you sang this song 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.200
 like someone who has had 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.250
 experiences with women not like chris 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:01.700
 martin so I liked you though 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.880
 when I see and hear yvonne sing to me 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:09.790
 seems to have something to do with a diva 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.790
 with something big and with something 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:18.350
 unusual both as a stamp and as a way 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.299
 to ask, I don't know the class, maybe the fact 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.010
 which has been part of the team that j ax 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.070
 gave that extra quality 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.410
 I don't know and therefore without removing anything 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.690
 andrea i like all those who do 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.730
 I'm parting from the Ajax team 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.250
 I exhibited I was all my support to 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.930
 my goals 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:40.250
 we remember that ivano was fished out and 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.670
 recaptured by noemi during the 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.980
 bartles thanks to the steel law 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:49.520
 which instead have a raffaella also a 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.970
 technical opinion look I think that 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.280
 gwyneth paltrow his wife is not much 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.740
 happy and this fact that he does not go 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.420
 so with women, that's why 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.830
 would like to be I think that in this 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.830
 moment was not jumping 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:14.220
 but he made me a very version 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.200
 very very interesting staff 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.440
 I must say that yvonne had a big one 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.780
 dare to sing a noemi song 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:27.560
 and he did it with the utmost ease 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.560
 and with a very good crazy talent 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.470
 compliments the other guard now 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:35.419
 but I have to go back to your coach noemi 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.699
 noemi I have to ask you the winner away 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:42.229
 to the winner of this knock out 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:43.940
 now the ribbons are apart are they are 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.650
 moved flattered that you chose 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.389
 my piece because the fact that one 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.050
 girl who sings and wants to do the 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:52.160
 singer who also a song of mine 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:06:01.010
 market mark thanks 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:06:03.620
 meanwhile I thank you for this I must say 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.120
 the truth you sang very well 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.910
 even if this is a double weapon 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.560
 I cut it because I know this song 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.820
 very well like my taxes 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.090
 I remember the first time I have it 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:16.250
 heard I remember when I sang it 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.860
 fiorella and so it is a piece that 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.800
 so I know well then maybe 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.590
 it's not like you've done it your way 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:28.449
 and it's really a big big one 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:31.460
 charisma that to say of andrea manchiero 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:34.639
 andrea success fantastic stamp you are a 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:39.669
 diesel you're one that takes it slowly and 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:39.669
 you know where there is a beautiful world behind 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.960
 although I choose a little reluctantly 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:48.960
 to bring andrea andrea with me 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:51.210
 hotel manger 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.100
 up to his truck at device e 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:59.300
 above all it continues its journey 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:07:04.020
 together with his coach noemi towards the live shows 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:07.259
 andrea i hear the audience roar 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.880
 naturally the coach's choices 

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:11.550
 arrived at this point in the 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.370
 competition is difficult therefore it is 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:16.710
 clear that they cannot agree 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:19.080
 all the audience of the voice andrea 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:22.229
 what do you feel to say to your coach noemi 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.300
 but I'm happy so I didn't say 

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:26.160
 that under the viewfinder for ebooks and are 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.639
 really not very sporty in the system is 

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.830
 cute because he eventually passed me 

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:34.650
 sports year this too public 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:37.289
 accustomed to other situations and or 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:38.789
 present I don't worry you damn 

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:40.620
 the fact that I'm not happy 

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:43.500
 means that they do not recognize jobs of 

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.620
 women therefore people is always a challenge 

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:49.650
 was so short, the life you so 

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:54.110
 good compliments to andrea manchiero e 

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:54.110
 good luck seeing you at live shows
