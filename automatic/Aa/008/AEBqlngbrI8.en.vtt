there's<00:01:35.720> 4<00:01:35.930> switches

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
there's 4 switches

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.830 
there's 4 switches
the<00:01:37.340> first<00:01:37.580> two<00:01:37.759> are<00:01:37.820> coil<00:01:38.270> taps<00:01:38.509> you've<00:01:38.720> got<00:01:38.810> a

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
the first two are coil taps you've got a

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.020 
the first two are coil taps you've got a
coil<00:01:39.050> tap<00:01:39.229> for<00:01:39.350> this<00:01:39.410> pickup<00:01:39.770> get<00:01:40.580> a<00:01:40.610> coil<00:01:40.850> tap

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
coil tap for this pickup get a coil tap

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.719 
coil tap for this pickup get a coil tap
for<00:01:41.180> this<00:01:41.270> pickup<00:01:41.630> this<00:01:42.170> one<00:01:42.380> is<00:01:42.650> takes<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.369> in

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
for this pickup this one is takes the in

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.040 
for this pickup this one is takes the in
the<00:01:43.820> middle<00:01:44.030> position<00:01:44.150> takes<00:01:44.630> those<00:01:44.720> pickups

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
the middle position takes those pickups

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.540 
the middle position takes those pickups
out<00:01:45.140> of<00:01:45.259> phase<00:01:45.440> you<00:01:45.770> get<00:01:45.890> that<00:01:45.979> nice<00:01:46.160> Albert

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
out of phase you get that nice Albert

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.030 
out of phase you get that nice Albert

squak<00:01:49.759> factor<00:01:50.300> and<00:01:50.509> this<00:01:51.080> one<00:01:51.320> allows<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:52.070> to

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
squak factor and this one allows you to

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.430 
squak factor and this one allows you to
just<00:01:52.790> take<00:01:53.060> that<00:01:53.270> bridge<00:01:53.630> pickup<00:01:54.050> straight

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
just take that bridge pickup straight

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.350 
just take that bridge pickup straight
into<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:54.770> jack<00:01:55.040> into<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:55.580> amp<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.060> it<00:01:56.180> takes

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
into the jack into the amp so it takes

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.490 
into the jack into the amp so it takes
everything<00:01:56.630> out<00:01:56.810> of<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.020> circuit<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:57.440> you

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
everything out of the circuit so you

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.620 
everything out of the circuit so you
just<00:01:57.649> get<00:01:57.770> pure<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:58.280> mitigated<00:01:58.850> bridge

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
just get pure and mitigated bridge

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.870 
just get pure and mitigated bridge
pickup<00:02:00.050> tone<00:02:00.290> and<00:02:00.920> then<00:02:01.040> opening<00:02:01.340> salvo<00:02:01.850> I

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
pickup tone and then opening salvo I

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.540 
pickup tone and then opening salvo I
gave<00:02:02.300> you<00:02:02.420> that<00:02:02.540> neck<00:02:02.810> pickup<00:02:03.160> both<00:02:04.160> coil

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
gave you that neck pickup both coil

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.210 
gave you that neck pickup both coil
tapped<00:02:05.020> humbucker<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.170> coil<00:02:06.350> tapped<00:02:06.620> and<00:02:06.860> now

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
tapped humbucker and coil tapped and now

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.419 
tapped humbucker and coil tapped and now
let's<00:02:07.400> go<00:02:07.549> to<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.729> middle<00:02:07.820> position<00:02:09.429> here's

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
let's go to the middle position here's

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:22.479 
let's go to the middle position here's
just<00:02:10.820> with<00:02:11.269> the<00:02:11.420> humbuckers<00:02:20.410> here's<00:02:21.489> with

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
just with the humbuckers here's with

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:38.050 
just with the humbuckers here's with
them<00:02:22.700> out<00:02:22.880> of<00:02:23.120> phase

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.010 

little<00:02:38.420> bit<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.600> hair<00:02:38.720> on<00:02:38.870> there

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.280 

and<00:02:45.940> back<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.090> just<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.480> two<00:02:47.630> humbuckers

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
and back to just the two humbuckers

00:02:48.290 --> 00:03:05.140 
and back to just the two humbuckers
together

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.190 

all<00:03:06.150> right<00:03:06.299> let's<00:03:06.450> go<00:03:06.569> to<00:03:06.629> that<00:03:06.750> bridge<00:03:06.989> pick

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
all right let's go to that bridge pick

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:18.309 
all right let's go to that bridge pick
up<00:03:07.560> here's<00:03:08.340> bridge<00:03:08.700> pick<00:03:08.879> up<00:03:09.030> humbucker

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:40.869 

all<00:03:19.319> right<00:03:19.560> let's<00:03:19.769> coil<00:03:20.010> tap<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:20.459> rascal

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.949 

then<00:03:41.879> we<00:03:41.940> go<00:03:42.030> back<00:03:42.269> I'll<00:03:42.540> put<00:03:42.659> a<00:03:42.720> little<00:03:42.840> heat

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
then we go back I'll put a little heat

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:49.450 
then we go back I'll put a little heat
on<00:03:43.019> there

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
I'm going to hit that switch where it

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:46.490 
I'm going to hit that switch where it
takes<00:04:08.910> everything<00:04:09.090> out<00:04:09.240> of<00:04:09.270> the<00:04:09.390> circuit

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.960 

some<00:04:46.800> like<00:04:46.920> that<00:04:47.070> tones<00:04:47.370> to<00:04:47.520> burn<00:04:47.670> in<00:04:47.850> this
