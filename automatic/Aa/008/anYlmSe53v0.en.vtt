00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:34.920 
anyways but um for the regular
prestigious<00:06:34.029> though<00:06:34.210> you<00:06:34.270> lose<00:06:34.659> all<00:06:34.839> your

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
prestigious though you lose all your

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.710 
prestigious though you lose all your
attachments<00:06:35.620> which<00:06:36.039> i<00:06:36.190> think<00:06:36.250> is<00:06:36.520> stupid<00:06:36.880> but

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
attachments which i think is stupid but

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.030 
attachments which i think is stupid but
again<00:06:37.960> it<00:06:38.080> kind<00:06:38.200> of<00:06:38.350> makes<00:06:38.500> sense<00:06:38.740> because

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.040 
again it kind of makes sense because

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.920 
again it kind of makes sense because
they<00:06:39.430> kind<00:06:39.700> of<00:06:39.760> reward<00:06:39.910> you<00:06:40.360> for<00:06:40.420> going<00:06:40.810> to

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
they kind of reward you for going to

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.770 
they kind of reward you for going to
master<00:06:41.260> prestige<00:06:41.470> like<00:06:42.400> 1<00:06:42.700> through<00:06:43.240> 15<00:06:43.630> and

master prestige like 1 through 15 and

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.180 
master prestige like 1 through 15 and
stuff<00:06:43.930> like<00:06:44.080> that<00:06:44.140> and<00:06:44.320> they<00:06:44.530> kind<00:06:44.650> of<00:06:44.770> rewards

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 
stuff like that and they kind of rewards

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.800
