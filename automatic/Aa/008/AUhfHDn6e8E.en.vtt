00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.410
 good at two minutes are the videos 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:08.320
 of new details new rumors about 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.570
 playstation 4 and it's fine by part of 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.150
 the page how important is kotaku and 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.550
 from a very important person who 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.619
 It's super good now I'll explain 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.939
 who is each one is something else a 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.880
 page that usually circulates enough 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.769
 things from said filter very quickly 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.749
 details of modern warfare 3 is that what 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:28.390
 forced the company to batches 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.859
 activision logically then to release a 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.050
 thriller before time not to say it 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.239
 in a way they have filtered much more 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.649
 constant a lot more games is obvious but 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.120
 well that does not mean anything does not want 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.730
 say that this rumor is going to be real or 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.460
 much less it does not seem that all the 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.039
 information that they have released comes from a 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.300
 amount of more than 90 pdf with the 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.760
 crows good is a pretty amount 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.710
 quite up to some good way 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.690
 it's super from basically it's a person 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.870
 a year ago they tried a few 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.539
 developments of xbox 720 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.860
 on ebay I really do not know if it got 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.899
 sell it I do not know if they were 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.269
 retired the micros where to report and 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.470
 what would happen but really all 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.900
 they assumed that they subscribe 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.430
 development will be real so good the 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.380
 true that its a bit that all this does not 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.869
 I know how a person to have access to 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.210
 this kind of thing and the truth as I say 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.240
 it does not stop being a rumor really but 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.530
 good if it is confirmed it seems that in 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.869
 the development kits of January 2013 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.670
 as of January 2013 they would have the 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.350
 following specifications that in my 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.179
 house seems to be that the memory of the 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.210
 large memory would be 8 gigas the 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:37.509
 video memory 2 2 gigs link that 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.670
 would be a 4 x you to the core to md 64 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:47.560
 bulldozer with which they would remain eight 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:50.130
 mdr cpu cores 10 xx ports 4 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.729
 USB 3.0 ports 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.030
 as you as you fear playstation model 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.759
 3 then they go down I do not know channel and 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.810
 the ethernet ports would go back to 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.140
 work with blur 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.750
 and the hard drive would be 160GB which 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.759
 would also have output hdmi stories of 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.120
 always without a doubt what most calls the 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.150
 Attention maybe it is adding and adding 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.489
 it seems to be a service in that document 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.099
 vital that the buttons would have a 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.599
 button no buttons is totally weird 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.450
 play a kind of button to 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.220
 share that we will not know if it would be 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.750
 it looks like a picture of the screen if it is 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.730
 to share on social networks that 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.160
 surely be for that to share 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.170
 in social networks and such and the command would be 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.000
 similar to those seen in previous 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.350
 Sometimes the only thing that happens is that 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.720
 behind the command he probably had 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.760
 a touch screen like the one that 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.430
 it prevents that behind in the ps vita has 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.410
 a touch panel that one that you can do 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.140
 your things and late the games or be in command 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.640
 of the prison rumored that also what 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.890
 I could have it 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.930
 so good nothing more kids everything 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.160
 that is what for now we see the 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.160
 next video next
