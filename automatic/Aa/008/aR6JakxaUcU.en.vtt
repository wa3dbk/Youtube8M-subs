you can have a look at that and that's
exactly<00:02:10.920> what<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.280> does<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.400> that's<00:02:11.550> all<00:02:11.760> it

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
exactly what it does and that's all it

the<00:02:13.349> collectors<00:02:13.650> edition<00:02:13.680> itself<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.400> quite

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
the collectors edition itself is quite

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.100 
the collectors edition itself is quite
nice<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.299> there's<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.510> lot<00:02:15.659> of<00:02:15.750> really<00:02:16.019> really

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
nice and there's a lot of really really

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.479 
nice and there's a lot of really really
neat<00:02:16.379> stuff<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:16.920> there's<00:02:17.040> no<00:02:17.159> doubt<00:02:17.190> about

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
neat stuff in it there's no doubt about

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:17.960 
neat stuff in it there's no doubt about
that

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
that

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.460 
that
there's<00:02:18.420> one<00:02:18.599> thing<00:02:18.810> about<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.049> pet<00:02:19.379> that

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
there's one thing about this pet that

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.930 
there's one thing about this pet that
I'm<00:02:19.620> quite<00:02:19.890> disappointed<00:02:20.580> about<00:02:20.670> now

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
I'm quite disappointed about now

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.910 
I'm quite disappointed about now
obviously<00:02:21.599> being<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:21.989> whelp<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.470> everything

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
obviously being a whelp and everything

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.710 
obviously being a whelp and everything
and<00:02:23.280> being<00:02:23.580> something<00:02:23.849> with<00:02:24.060> wings<00:02:24.299> I<00:02:24.540> thought

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
and being something with wings I thought

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.780 
and being something with wings I thought
perhaps<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:25.200> would<00:02:25.409> follow<00:02:25.830> me<00:02:25.980> around<00:02:26.010> well

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
perhaps it would follow me around well

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.229 
perhaps it would follow me around well
as<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.330> would<00:02:27.510> fly<00:02:28.340> but<00:02:29.340> actually<00:02:30.060> as

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
as in it would fly but actually as

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.770 
as in it would fly but actually as
you're<00:02:30.690> about<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.959> find<00:02:31.110> out<00:02:31.379> it<00:02:31.709> doesn't<00:02:32.780> as

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
you're about to find out it doesn't as

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.420 
you're about to find out it doesn't as
