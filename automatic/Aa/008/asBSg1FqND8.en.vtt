spill<00:00:47.250> simulator<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.879> can<00:00:48.030> expect<00:00:48.510> much<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
spill simulator you can expect much the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.779 
spill simulator you can expect much the
same<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.680> graphics<00:00:50.039> department<00:00:50.100> they

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
same in the graphics department they

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.430 
same in the graphics department they
haven't<00:00:51.059> really<00:00:51.210> taken<00:00:51.390> any<00:00:51.600> quantum<00:00:52.170> leaps

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
haven't really taken any quantum leaps

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.560 
haven't really taken any quantum leaps
it<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:53.340> certainly<00:00:53.760> not<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.120> par<00:00:54.329> with<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
it is certainly not on par with the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.139 
it is certainly not on par with the
beauty<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.110> car<00:00:55.440> mechanic<00:00:55.829> simulator<00:00:56.030> but<00:00:57.030> on

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
beauty of car mechanic simulator but on

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.729 
beauty of car mechanic simulator but on
the<00:00:57.270> bright<00:00:57.660> side<00:00:57.690> they've<00:00:58.320> gotten<00:00:58.590> rid<00:00:58.710> of

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the bright side they've gotten rid of

the bright side they've gotten rid of
the<00:00:58.829> perpetual<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.399> gloom<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.000> doom<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.570> was

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the perpetual of gloom and doom that was

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.080 
the perpetual of gloom and doom that was
in<00:01:00.840> chemical<00:01:01.199> spills<00:01:01.469> simulator<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.670> now<00:01:03.030> do

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
in chemical spills simulator you now do

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.719 
in chemical spills simulator you now do
see<00:01:03.660> some<00:01:03.899> sunlight<00:01:04.199> though<00:01:05.100> when<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.489> rains

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
see some sunlight though when it rains

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.120 
see some sunlight though when it rains
that's<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:06.869> terrible<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.950> can

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
that's just it's just terrible you can

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.280 
that's just it's just terrible you can
hear<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.549> rain<00:01:08.760> if<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.510> look<00:01:09.659> closely<00:01:09.990> you

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
hear the rain if you look closely you

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.530 
hear the rain if you look closely you
might<00:01:10.680> see<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.520> has<00:01:11.820> no<00:01:12.060> physical

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
might see it but it has no physical

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.600 
might see it but it has no physical
impact<00:01:13.170> anywhere<00:01:13.619> no<00:01:14.010> water<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
impact anywhere no water on the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.670 
impact anywhere no water on the
windshield<00:01:14.880> which<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.570> good<00:01:15.840> given<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.500> don't

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
windshield which is good given you don't

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.679 
windshield which is good given you don't
have<00:01:16.830> any<00:01:17.009> wiper<00:01:17.250> controls<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.479> roads

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
have any wiper controls and the roads

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.820 
have any wiper controls and the roads
stay<00:01:19.290> yearly<00:01:19.799> dry<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.150> sort<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.600> man<00:01:21.990> on

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
stay yearly dry so it's sort of a man on

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.590 
stay yearly dry so it's sort of a man on
the<00:01:22.920> bright<00:01:23.100> side<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.580> cars<00:01:23.790> are<00:01:23.970> now<00:01:24.060> solid

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
objects though the people are not I mean

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.730 
objects though the people are not I mean
they<00:01:27.210> do<00:01:27.299> pull<00:01:27.540> over<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.650> you're

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
driving inside just driving through you

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.899 
driving inside just driving through you
like<00:01:30.630> they<00:01:30.750> did<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.340> in<00:01:32.340> chemical<00:01:32.729> spill

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
like they did in in chemical spill

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.310 
like they did in in chemical spill
simulator<00:01:33.299> except<00:01:33.630> for<00:01:33.750> when<00:01:33.869> you're<00:01:33.990> stopped

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
simulator except for when you're stopped

simulator except for when you're stopped
in<00:01:34.560> which<00:01:34.680> case<00:01:34.860> I'll<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.159> drive<00:01:35.310> right

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
in which case I'll just drive right

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.450 
in which case I'll just drive right
through<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.350> whatever<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.920> collapse<00:01:38.250> of

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
through you but whatever the collapse of

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.940 
through you but whatever the collapse of
certain<00:01:38.790> buildings<00:01:39.180> as<00:01:39.450> they<00:01:39.750> burn<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> nice

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
certain buildings as they burn is a nice

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
certain buildings as they burn is a nice
touch<00:01:41.310> actually<00:01:41.909> other<00:01:42.689> than<00:01:43.369> that<00:01:44.369> expect

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
touch actually other than that expect

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.270 
touch actually other than that expect
some<00:01:45.119> pretty<00:01:45.329> bland<00:01:45.689> graphics<00:01:46.290> not<00:01:46.500> terrible

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
some pretty bland graphics not terrible

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.819 
some pretty bland graphics not terrible
but<00:01:47.340> nothing<00:01:47.850> superb<00:01:48.420> either<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.590> would<00:01:49.740> be

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
but nothing superb either it would be

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.740 
but nothing superb either it would be
nice<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.100> see<00:01:50.250> Rhonda<00:01:50.430> media<00:01:50.790> invests<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.570> some

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
nice to see Rhonda media invests in some

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.780 
nice to see Rhonda media invests in some
new<00:01:51.899> graphical<00:01:52.350> assets<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.189> new<00:01:53.340> graphics

new graphical assets and a new graphics

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.870 
new graphical assets and a new graphics
engine<00:01:53.970> perhaps<00:01:54.659> if<00:01:54.899> they<00:01:55.020> talked<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.880> play
