this term we see to a tick or tobik

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.230 
this term we see to a tick or tobik
which<00:05:41.630> is<00:05:41.870> um<00:05:42.110> a<00:05:42.500> former<00:05:43.490> number<00:05:43.669> one<00:05:43.820> player

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
which is um a former number one player

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.770 
which is um a former number one player
in<00:05:44.270> the<00:05:45.110> German<00:05:45.650> leader<00:05:46.340> board<00:05:46.639> and<00:05:47.000> at<00:05:47.539> then

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
in the German leader board and at then
