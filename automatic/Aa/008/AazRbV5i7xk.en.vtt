00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.080
 And then guys, beauty is missing. 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.910
 You and I will start a new framework today. 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.099
 here on my channel that is called by 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.179
 called stupid yahoo questions 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.619
 answers 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.330
 It is in this picture with the name it says 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.039
 he's getting some questions to 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.830
 questions more stupid than the find and 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.359
 answer and answer and put that 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.130
 answer them the way I think 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.609
 interesting does not leave the mind of a 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.230
 the way I think it is and the right 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.329
 answer but a way I think 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.250
 interesting is one thing I can talk about 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.140
 that the idea that began in this idea of 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.559
 doing this picture went very well 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.210
 American call ac pop is she started 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.410
 this idea and so I asked to 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.059
 she has on youtube 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.890
 if I could use this idea she 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.079
 said that yes that's okay and for that 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.969
 reason the link to the channel of the channel 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.539
 This video's subscription is just you two talk 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.579
 English 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.649
 I recommend you trust because it is well 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.800
 cool, it's super funny, so give it a 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.170
 look there worth and that we 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.989
 begin with the first question, which is 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.890
 where 512 ram of memory down to the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.409
 my computer 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.479
 where low 512mb of memory for my 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.280
 computer can be in torrent in 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.630
 anywhere my pc is slow and 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.990
 to install windows vista ultimate 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.540
 I need a z from randy 512 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.220
 memory someone with n knows where i find 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.650
 download please send by email 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.610
 right here on yahoo please i need 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.979
 with z 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.680
 very help me I need a new cd of 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:35.520
 512 memory I beg with him 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:37.560
 thank you man you do not low of 2012 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.290
 you do not download 1 gb of ram you do not 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.299
 low 20 gb of ram low signal yesterday was 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.420
 but the run run the business that stands 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.369
 on your computer and you never or maybe 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.500
 a very distant future can download 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.259
 to your computer 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.149
 Okay, it's something you need to talk to is in 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.530
 general about this framework is that 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.719
 maybe sometimes people obviously 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.700
 Let's get down to those troll questions. 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.579
 nexon people ask questions without 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.020
 answer to make funny what are the 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.590
 people who come up with questions 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.849
 funny to do is to respond to 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.550
 same way, do not keep analyzing each 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.470
 ask if I think it's troll or not 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.150
 another case here I really think 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.340
 not because all Portuguese errors 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.590
 that you promised I do not know 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.810
 and I really think that a person who 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.970
 I was not going to make a damn joke. 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.890
 so many mistakes or maybe committee if I do not know 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.620
 It is good because we do not move to the 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.540
 second question that is where I buy a 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.050
 rocket that goes to the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.670
 moon 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.770
 Like I wanted to know where the 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.650
 rocket that goes to the 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.600
 but I do not want to pay in dollars and 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.020
 I want in reais I want it to be gasoline 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.820
 common for you besides wanting a 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.360
 rocket that goes from remote control to the 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.980
 moon 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.490
 You do not want to pay in dollars and he 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.380
 whether ordinary gasoline asking for much is not 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.030
 first you will never get a 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.940
 rocket going up to the control moon 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.650
 remote you will not be able to 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.560
 that it be the ordinary gasoline 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.840
 someday you might get them and 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.000
 got to buy but in the present you 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.160
 will not buy you will never have yours 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.530
 Yeah rocket going to the moon 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.910
 remote control and thus the most 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.950
 funny of that question do you think 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.350
 I caught her so that's why she 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.910
 puts some net restrictions on me, not me 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.989
 I want to have to pay in dollars next 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.459
 I want to pay in real 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.160
 but I also do not want to 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.080
 compete for added gasoline or some 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.390
 another type of fuel we I 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.660
 I want ordinary gasoline that's good text. 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.540
 Let's use her honest face. 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.000
 no serious no you will never have yours 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.130
 rocket that goes to the 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.370
 moon 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.140
 The third question that is this question 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.880
 is one of the most classic that the 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.890
 there are answers that seem only to everyone 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.170
 places I 've seen and it 's very 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.420
 Funny here is all the service I gave 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.080
 A little kiss but I ended up shitting that 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.660
 I do 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.540
 I'm afraid to leave here, man. 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.280
 I wonder if this is the question 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.870
 is one question that seems to me can be 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.070
 of a troll yes but that's how I do 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.590
 wondering if the person really is a 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.959
 work and will do this and it is not 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.700
 ends up getting really honest 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.769
 imagine the person's situation per person 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.269
 Is it there that she makes a living and let's go? 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.880
 return to work in a service that 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.709
 make sure g near those cubic nozzles 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.620
 nor with the people on your side and you 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.209
 out of macacada and stay with the old in 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.580
 kind of there not knowing what to do 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.280
 friend this morning if I were you I 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.950
 I would stand up and go screaming 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.690
 cara's filmic human gate that berg left 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.490
 running thus debandando when jÃ©ci 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.350
 very pissed with life because 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.400
 honestly and have used both have no 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.840
 as user 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.790
 it's a great technique and if it happens 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.770
 something like that with you guys 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.919
 those year is very pissed be a way 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.560
 that's just the way you 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.600
 will actually decrease at least one 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.960
 few of the situations could do with 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.310
 You, do not you? 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.010
 I really do not care if the person spoke. 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.260
 This technique is true or 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.490
 Let's go on the fourth question that is this 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.990
 question is very very good 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.550
 I'm a fan of Batman, will I? 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.410
 I could be like him 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.630
 how do I have superpowers want to be 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.580
 a superhero helps me then needing 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.910
 urgent and where can I buy a bat 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.070
 car guy needs to get powers 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.590
 Do you need anything from radiation? 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.140
 not so it is recommended that you go 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.640
 to chernobyl somewhere like this 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.860
 stay there live in time 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.700
 so you have two options to super events 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.710
 powers 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.810
 or you will get lots of information and 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.940
 your children also so is a net risk 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.690
 You want the risk, feel free. 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.460
 Let's go there, right. I recommend it. 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.890
 Do it, but if you want 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.630
 It's okay, Batman, if I 'm not mistaken. 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.370
 I'm not much of a fan but he does not 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.450
 have this power so you want to be the same 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.550
 to batman 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.080
 You will train very very very much and will 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.669
 be a supercomputer with several 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.460
 You can make wines from various gadgets that 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:53.070
 I'm not taking a world then. 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.770
 Batman I think it does not have that power, right? 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.150
 is also a tip you can buy 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.010
 a car on the open market if you do not 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.190
 cheating is giving a wanted I think you 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:04.440
 have low car got the woman worm 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.750
 wonder that some ships also 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.340
 legal side star wars is one thing 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.100
 enough in these things free market saw 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:14.370
 Do not buy there that is not worth the price. 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.710
 cheap, cool is the tip 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:20.090
 The fifth question is is there any 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:23.580
 surgery to reduce the eyes is the face 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:25.770
 There is hand sewing your eyes. 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.440
 tag take the line linked to culture 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:31.320
 clothes take your eye after them next to them 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.539
 and sewing so I can guarantee that 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.150
 they will be very tight that they will not 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:38.400
 Look, it's gonna be a lot 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.780
 legal recommends that you do this, my 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.940
 stay 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.670
 much of the time I look like it's kind of 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.650
 Japanese or that legal mix 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.560
 so mine if you want to have the smallest one 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.600
 to sew is to fix it easily 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.990
 does not solve with a small needle 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:56.990
 with a little line you do it here 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:58.370
 my tip for you is but I think 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.610
 that is what are the five questions 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:04.130
 pure episode is good or so 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.080
 I have to have a team play but that's it. 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.460
 People, I hope you liked it, tell me. 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.590
 in the comments that I think 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.200
 I can improve worsen worsen not right 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.760
 Let's improve it's a young favorite 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.940
 and follow on twitter short our page 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:19.990
 facebook is the registration exemption and is 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:22.990
 This people brigade there and even better 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.990
 said
