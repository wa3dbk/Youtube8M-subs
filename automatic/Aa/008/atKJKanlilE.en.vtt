how<00:00:57.180> dumb<00:00:57.629> video<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.559> said<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.340> white

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
how dumb video I said that the white

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.090 
how dumb video I said that the white
laces<00:00:59.820> wasn't<00:01:00.390> popping<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:00.960> them<00:01:01.100> since

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100

these<00:01:02.520> shoes<00:01:02.789> were<00:01:03.000> already<00:01:03.539> like<00:01:03.840> All<00:01:04.170> Whites

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
these shoes were already like All Whites

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.660 
these shoes were already like All Whites
decided<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:05.850> keep<00:01:06.689> one<00:01:07.049> white<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.799> then

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
decided to just keep one white and then

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.410 
decided to just keep one white and then
keep<00:01:09.119> another<00:01:09.450> one<00:01:09.750> reading<00:01:10.110> because<00:01:11.270> as<00:01:12.270> you

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
keep another one reading because as you

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.600 
keep another one reading because as you
can<00:01:12.450> see<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.680> real<00:01:13.920> aces<00:01:14.369> don't

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
can see it's like the real aces don't

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.670 
can see it's like the real aces don't
really<00:01:14.850> match<00:01:15.060> up<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.590> reader<00:01:17.840> swoosh<00:01:18.840> so
