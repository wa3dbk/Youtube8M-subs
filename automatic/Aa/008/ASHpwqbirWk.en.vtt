to<00:02:42.519> rearrange<00:02:43.030> them<00:02:43.419> a<00:02:43.569> little<00:02:43.840> bit<00:02:44.019> I'm<00:02:44.379> gonna

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
to rearrange them a little bit I'm gonna

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.159 
to rearrange them a little bit I'm gonna
do<00:02:44.889> this<00:02:45.129> by<00:02:45.459> taking<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:46.209> basic<00:02:46.629> positions

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:47.169 
do this by taking the basic positions

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:49.259 
do this by taking the basic positions
that<00:02:47.409> we<00:02:47.530> just<00:02:47.739> went<00:02:48.010> through<00:02:48.219> and<00:02:48.549> really

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
that we just went through and really

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.330 
that we just went through and really
exploring<00:02:49.780> how<00:02:50.049> I<00:02:50.079> can<00:02:50.379> take<00:02:50.590> away<00:02:50.889> add<00:02:51.099> notes

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
exploring how I can take away add notes

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.740 
exploring how I can take away add notes
add<00:02:51.790> notes<00:02:52.560> include<00:02:53.560> open<00:02:54.010> strings<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.790> just

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
add notes include open strings and just

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.839 
add notes include open strings and just
in<00:02:55.930> general<00:02:55.959> live<00:02:56.739> in<00:02:56.949> these<00:02:57.099> things<00:02:57.489> up<00:02:57.730> a

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
in general live in these things up a

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.689 
in general live in these things up a
little<00:02:58.000> bit<00:02:58.379> to<00:02:59.379> make<00:02:59.469> them<00:02:59.620> my<00:02:59.799> own<00:02:59.919> so<00:03:00.400> for<00:03:00.669> a

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:00.699 
little bit to make them my own so for a

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:02.699 
little bit to make them my own so for a
C<00:03:00.939> chord<00:03:01.180> for<00:03:01.480> instance<00:03:01.840> there's<00:03:02.469> an<00:03:02.590> any

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
C chord for instance there's an any

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.979 
C chord for instance there's an any
number<00:03:03.099> of<00:03:03.250> things<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:03.579> we<00:03:03.849> can<00:03:04.030> do<00:03:04.209> to<00:03:04.870> make

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
number of things that we can do to make

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.309 
number of things that we can do to make
that<00:03:05.169> happen

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.449 

probably<00:03:08.319> the<00:03:08.439> easiest<00:03:08.769> thing<00:03:09.040> is<00:03:09.189> just<00:03:09.219> to

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
probably the easiest thing is just to

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.789 
probably the easiest thing is just to
start<00:03:09.790> taking<00:03:10.090> things<00:03:10.239> away<00:03:10.629> if<00:03:11.199> I<00:03:11.379> take<00:03:11.620> my

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
start taking things away if I take my

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:18.479 
start taking things away if I take my
index<00:03:11.980> finger<00:03:12.459> away<00:03:15.299> I've<00:03:16.299> got<00:03:16.689> the<00:03:17.500> C<00:03:17.739> major<00:03:17.949> 7

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
index finger away I've got the C major 7

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.219 
index finger away I've got the C major 7
sound<00:03:18.819> there<00:03:19.030> really<00:03:19.209> it's<00:03:19.449> just<00:03:19.540> all<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:19.870> C

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:20.229 
sound there really it's just all a C

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:22.349 
sound there really it's just all a C
major<00:03:20.470> chord<00:03:20.680> we're<00:03:21.250> just<00:03:21.459> adding<00:03:21.970> different

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
major chord we're just adding different

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.300 
major chord we're just adding different
flavors<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.019> it<00:03:23.229> we're<00:03:23.560> adding<00:03:23.859> this<00:03:24.040> note<00:03:24.250> in

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
flavors to it we're adding this note in

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.440 
flavors to it we're adding this note in
maybe<00:03:27.310> adding<00:03:27.759> this<00:03:27.939> note<00:03:28.209> in

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.590 

when<00:03:32.450> I<00:03:32.480> go<00:03:32.720> to<00:03:32.750> an<00:03:33.020> escort

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
when I go to an escort

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.790 

instead<00:03:36.600> of<00:03:36.750> holding<00:03:37.170> it<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.410> way<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:37.560> we

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
instead of holding it the way that we

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.190 
instead of holding it the way that we
probably<00:03:38.160> learned<00:03:38.820> with<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.180> full<00:03:39.570> bar<00:03:39.870> here

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
probably learned with a full bar here

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.080 
probably learned with a full bar here
I'm<00:03:40.380> gonna<00:03:40.470> reach<00:03:40.740> around<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.430> change<00:03:41.850> how

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
I'm gonna reach around and change how

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.880 
I'm gonna reach around and change how
I'm<00:03:42.240> holding<00:03:42.690> this<00:03:42.870> I'm<00:03:43.110> gonna<00:03:43.260> hold<00:03:43.470> down<00:03:43.590> the

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
I'm holding this I'm gonna hold down the

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.970 
I'm holding this I'm gonna hold down the
root<00:03:44.130> note<00:03:44.370> with<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.820> thumb<00:03:45.710> and<00:03:46.710> I'm<00:03:46.830> gonna

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
root note with the thumb and I'm gonna

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.190 
root note with the thumb and I'm gonna
fret<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.550> rest<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.060> chord<00:03:48.300> like<00:03:48.570> so<00:03:48.870> and

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
fret the rest of the chord like so and

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:57.370 
fret the rest of the chord like so and
in<00:03:49.620> this<00:03:49.980> case<00:03:50.250> I<00:03:50.430> can<00:03:50.610> leave<00:03:50.760> string<00:03:51.150> v<00:03:51.420> open

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.930 

now<00:03:58.380> let's<00:03:58.590> add<00:03:58.800> our<00:03:58.830> pinkie<00:03:59.400> here<00:03:59.610> to<00:03:59.790> the

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
now let's add our pinkie here to the

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.290 
now let's add our pinkie here to the
third<00:04:00.210> fret<00:04:00.630> first<00:04:00.930> string<00:04:04.460> all<00:04:05.460> of<00:04:05.880> a<00:04:05.940> sudden

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
third fret first string all of a sudden

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.600 
third fret first string all of a sudden
we<00:04:06.420> have<00:04:06.600> some<00:04:06.870> new<00:04:07.110> flavors<00:04:07.560> inside<00:04:08.250> of<00:04:08.460> our

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
we have some new flavors inside of our

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.060 
we have some new flavors inside of our
chord<00:04:08.940> now<00:04:09.660> let's<00:04:09.990> change<00:04:10.290> it<00:04:10.530> a<00:04:10.620> little<00:04:10.740> more

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
chord now let's change it a little more

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.860 
chord now let's change it a little more
let's<00:04:11.370> take<00:04:11.550> away<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:11.850> middle<00:04:12.240> finger<00:04:12.600> but

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
let's take away the middle finger but

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.630 
let's take away the middle finger but
leave<00:04:13.020> everything<00:04:13.350> else<00:04:13.650> so<00:04:14.010> we're<00:04:14.190> adding<00:04:14.370> an

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
leave everything else so we're adding an

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:26.870 
leave everything else so we're adding an
open<00:04:14.970> string<00:04:15.270> by<00:04:15.570> subtracting<00:04:16.200> a<00:04:16.650> finger<00:04:25.880> you

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
open string by subtracting a finger you

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.640 
open string by subtracting a finger you
could<00:04:27.060> try<00:04:27.240> taking<00:04:27.660> away<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.960> pinky<00:04:28.320> finger

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
could try taking away the pinky finger

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.770 
could try taking away the pinky finger
on<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:28.950> top<00:04:29.160> string<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:30.240> make<00:04:30.420> the<00:04:30.570> first

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
on the top string to make the first

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.880 
on the top string to make the first
string<00:04:31.050> open<00:04:31.350> at<00:04:31.500> any<00:04:31.680> time<00:04:32.010> too<00:04:32.250> you<00:04:36.680> can<00:04:37.680> take

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
string open at any time too you can take

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.550 
string open at any time too you can take
that<00:04:38.130> basic<00:04:38.460> idea<00:04:38.790> here<00:04:39.480> where<00:04:39.750> we<00:04:39.930> converted

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
that basic idea here where we converted

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.940 
that basic idea here where we converted
our<00:04:40.860> Barre<00:04:41.130> chord<00:04:41.600> into<00:04:42.600> a<00:04:42.840> thumb<00:04:43.290> root<00:04:43.650> and

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
our Barre chord into a thumb root and

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.890 
our Barre chord into a thumb root and
then<00:04:44.310> adding<00:04:44.700> some<00:04:44.880> other<00:04:45.030> fingers<00:04:45.510> you<00:04:45.780> can

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
then adding some other fingers you can

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.130 
then adding some other fingers you can
do<00:04:46.020> that<00:04:46.140> up<00:04:46.290> here<00:04:46.470> at<00:04:46.560> g2<00:04:50.150> now<00:04:51.150> here<00:04:51.690> I<00:04:51.720> want<00:04:52.020> to

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
do that up here at g2 now here I want to

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.080 
do that up here at g2 now here I want to
block<00:04:52.440> string<00:04:52.860> 5<00:04:53.160> because<00:04:53.670> I<00:04:53.790> don't<00:04:53.970> really

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
block string 5 because I don't really

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.920 
block string 5 because I don't really
like<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.540> way<00:04:54.630> that<00:04:54.810> this<00:04:55.050> known<00:04:56.690> and<00:04:57.690> those

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
like the way that this known and those

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.770 
like the way that this known and those
notes<00:04:58.290> sound<00:04:59.040> together<00:04:59.370> it's<00:04:59.880> too<00:05:00.090> muddy<00:05:00.390> for

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
notes sound together it's too muddy for

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.930 
notes sound together it's too muddy for
my<00:05:00.900> ears<00:05:01.200> doesn't<00:05:01.710> mean<00:05:01.830> it's<00:05:02.010> wrong<00:05:02.190> it's<00:05:02.760> all

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
my ears doesn't mean it's wrong it's all

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.850 
my ears doesn't mean it's wrong it's all
just<00:05:03.180> a<00:05:03.300> matter<00:05:03.330> of<00:05:03.600> taste<00:05:03.900> but<00:05:04.620> I'm<00:05:04.740> gonna

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
just a matter of taste but I'm gonna

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.830 
just a matter of taste but I'm gonna
block<00:05:05.220> that<00:05:05.490> note<00:05:05.760> out<00:05:07.550> and<00:05:08.550> just<00:05:09.390> play<00:05:09.570> those

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
block that note out and just play those

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.000 
block that note out and just play those
notes<00:05:11.120> now<00:05:12.120> E<00:05:12.180> minor<00:05:12.750> can<00:05:13.080> be<00:05:13.230> as<00:05:13.350> simple<00:05:13.590> as

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
notes now E minor can be as simple as

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:21.610 
notes now E minor can be as simple as
just<00:05:14.340> adding<00:05:14.580> a<00:05:14.880> finger<00:05:17.180> so<00:05:18.180> here<00:05:19.730> to<00:05:20.730> here

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
just adding a finger so here to here

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.650 
just adding a finger so here to here
taking<00:05:22.620> fingers<00:05:22.980> away

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:33.030 

adding<00:05:26.500> and<00:05:26.800> taking<00:05:26.950> away<00:05:31.200> we<00:05:32.200> see<00:05:32.500> the<00:05:32.680> idea

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
adding and taking away we see the idea

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.460 
adding and taking away we see the idea
here<00:05:33.400> it's<00:05:33.610> just<00:05:33.700> to<00:05:34.000> be<00:05:34.180> creative<00:05:34.840> within<00:05:35.170> our

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
here it's just to be creative within our

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.600 
here it's just to be creative within our
forms<00:05:36.300> now<00:05:37.300> you<00:05:38.260> start<00:05:38.560> combining<00:05:38.740> these<00:05:39.340> in

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
forms now you start combining these in

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.820 
forms now you start combining these in
different<00:05:40.000> ways<00:05:40.150> maybe<00:05:41.080> go<00:05:41.320> through<00:05:41.650> it<00:05:41.770> a

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
different ways maybe go through it a

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.620 
different ways maybe go through it a
different<00:05:42.190> way<00:05:42.220> each<00:05:42.490> time<00:05:42.520> and<00:05:43.060> see<00:05:43.300> what<00:05:43.480> you

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
different way each time and see what you

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.050 
different way each time and see what you
like<00:05:43.810> so<00:05:44.140> if<00:05:44.560> I'm<00:05:44.740> starting<00:05:45.160> with<00:05:45.250> a<00:05:45.310> C<00:05:45.670> I'll

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
like so if I'm starting with a C I'll

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.090 
like so if I'm starting with a C I'll
state<00:05:46.900> the<00:05:47.140> basic<00:05:47.560> chord<00:05:49.530> go<00:05:50.530> to<00:05:50.590> an<00:05:50.830> open

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
state the basic chord go to an open

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.640 
state the basic chord go to an open
string<00:05:51.460> Avenue<00:05:54.090> go<00:05:55.090> to<00:05:55.150> my<00:05:55.330> F<00:05:55.480> chord<00:05:55.840> but<00:05:56.260> play

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
one of the modified versions maybe a

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.600 
one of the modified versions maybe a
basic<00:06:02.500> G<00:06:02.770> this<00:06:03.040> time

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.399

and now maybe I'll play this version of

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:15.189 
and now maybe I'll play this version of
my<00:06:09.590> E<00:06:09.620> minor<00:06:10.099> here<00:06:13.479> putting<00:06:14.479> things<00:06:14.900> together
