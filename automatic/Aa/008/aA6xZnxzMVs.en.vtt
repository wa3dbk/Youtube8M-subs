characters<00:04:32.520> of<00:04:32.820> nine<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.600> twelve<00:04:33.900> are<00:04:34.340> not

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
characters of nine and twelve are not

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.400 
characters of nine and twelve are not
too<00:04:35.520> shocking<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:36.030> me<00:04:36.270> since<00:04:36.930> this<00:04:37.080> is<00:04:37.200> from

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
too shocking to me since this is from

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.350 
too shocking to me since this is from
directors<00:04:37.800> Shinichiro<00:04:38.280> Watanabe<00:04:38.490> for<00:04:39.240> some

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
directors Shinichiro Watanabe for some

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.540 
directors Shinichiro Watanabe for some
odd<00:04:39.480> reason<00:04:39.510> it<00:04:40.020> sort<00:04:40.500> of<00:04:40.590> reminds<00:04:41.010> me<00:04:41.070> of<00:04:41.160> the

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
odd reason it sort of reminds me of the

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.060 
odd reason it sort of reminds me of the
characters<00:04:41.940> of<00:04:42.270> like<00:04:42.450> spike<00:04:42.810> and<00:04:43.200> jet<00:04:43.500> how

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
characters of like spike and jet how

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.650 
characters of like spike and jet how
completely<00:04:44.700> different<00:04:45.060> they<00:04:45.150> are<00:04:45.330> and<00:04:45.540> how

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
completely different they are and how

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.060 
completely different they are and how
yet<00:04:45.960> they're<00:04:46.170> sort<00:04:46.350> of<00:04:46.440> still<00:04:46.650> on<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:46.890> same

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
yet they're sort of still on the same

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.890 
yet they're sort of still on the same
mission<00:04:47.430> with<00:04:47.580> each<00:04:47.670> other<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.120> I<00:04:48.570> guess<00:04:48.750> I

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
mission with each other and I guess I

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.210 
mission with each other and I guess I
could<00:04:49.080> go<00:04:49.140> for<00:04:49.320> the<00:04:49.410> characters<00:04:49.770> in<00:04:49.890> samurai

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
could go for the characters in samurai

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.800 
could go for the characters in samurai
champloo<00:04:50.790> as<00:04:50.910> well<00:04:51.090> I<00:04:51.120> don't<00:04:51.420> know<00:04:51.480> if<00:04:51.570> I<00:04:51.630> could

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
champloo as well I don't know if I could

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.570 
champloo as well I don't know if I could
relate<00:04:52.050> them<00:04:52.230> to<00:04:52.260> anybody<00:04:52.770> from<00:04:52.890> space<00:04:53.280> dandy

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
relate them to anybody from space dandy

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.340 
relate them to anybody from space dandy
but<00:04:54.180> that's<00:04:54.330> only<00:04:54.480> because<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.930> show<00:04:55.080> seems

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
but that's only because the show seems

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.930 
but that's only because the show seems
to<00:04:55.440> be<00:04:55.620> grounded<00:04:55.980> in<00:04:56.100> a<00:04:56.190> little<00:04:56.370> more<00:04:56.520> realism

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
to be grounded in a little more realism

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.480 
to be grounded in a little more realism
the<00:04:57.630> the<00:04:57.990> artwork<00:04:58.350> in<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.560> animation<00:04:59.070> and<00:04:59.340> of

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
the the artwork in the animation and of

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.160 
the the artwork in the animation and of
course<00:04:59.700> the<00:04:59.850> opening<00:05:00.300> and<00:05:00.450> all<00:05:00.540> the<00:05:00.660> music<00:05:01.050> and

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
course the opening and all the music and

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.690 
course the opening and all the music and
everything<00:05:01.500> was<00:05:01.710> really<00:05:01.980> good<00:05:02.130> there<00:05:02.580> was

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
everything was really good there was

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.150 
everything was really good there was
also<00:05:02.820> this<00:05:03.000> one<00:05:03.330> flashback<00:05:04.020> which<00:05:04.710> had<00:05:04.950> these

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
also this one flashback which had these

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.610 
also this one flashback which had these
like<00:05:05.400> really<00:05:06.030> hard<00:05:06.360> guitar<00:05:06.870> riffs<00:05:07.140> going<00:05:07.500> on

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
like really hard guitar riffs going on

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.950 
like really hard guitar riffs going on
and<00:05:07.860> it<00:05:07.950> was<00:05:08.100> really<00:05:08.460> jarring<00:05:08.970> at<00:05:09.060> first<00:05:09.360> but

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
and it was really jarring at first but

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.690 
and it was really jarring at first but
the<00:05:10.080> more<00:05:10.230> I<00:05:10.290> watched<00:05:10.620> it<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:10.980> more<00:05:11.130> I<00:05:11.160> really

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
the more I watched it the more I really

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.010 
the more I watched it the more I really
liked<00:05:11.970> that<00:05:12.120> and<00:05:12.330> they<00:05:12.390> gave<00:05:12.510> it<00:05:12.600> a<00:05:12.660> lot<00:05:12.870> of

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
liked that and they gave it a lot of

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.290 
liked that and they gave it a lot of
distinctiveness<00:05:13.590> and<00:05:13.950> made<00:05:14.700> the<00:05:14.850> scene<00:05:15.060> all

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
distinctiveness and made the scene all

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.780 
distinctiveness and made the scene all
the<00:05:15.420> more<00:05:15.570> suspenseful<00:05:16.230> intense<00:05:16.650> I'm<00:05:17.610> not

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
the more suspenseful intense I'm not

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.160 
the more suspenseful intense I'm not
gonna<00:05:17.910> give<00:05:18.090> a<00:05:18.120> score<00:05:18.570> for<00:05:18.810> this<00:05:18.900> week's

episode I will just say that I'm

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.250 
episode I will just say that I'm
thoroughly<00:05:21.120> impressed<00:05:21.390> by<00:05:21.930> it<00:05:21.990> and<00:05:22.200> I

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
thoroughly impressed by it and I

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.870 
thoroughly impressed by it and I
honestly<00:05:22.560> didn't<00:05:22.890> expect<00:05:23.190> to<00:05:23.220> be<00:05:23.310> so<00:05:23.550> floored

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
honestly didn't expect to be so floored

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.290 
honestly didn't expect to be so floored
by<00:05:24.060> it

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
by it

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.180 
by it
but<00:05:24.840> the<00:05:24.960> art<00:05:25.140> direction<00:05:25.470> the<00:05:25.830> character

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
but the art direction the character

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.770 
but the art direction the character
designs<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:26.850> actual<00:05:27.180> characters<00:05:27.600> themselves

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
designs the actual characters themselves

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.710 
designs the actual characters themselves
and<00:05:28.230> the<00:05:28.290> entire<00:05:28.620> concept<00:05:29.190> of<00:05:29.340> the<00:05:29.400> story

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
and the entire concept of the story

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.720 
and the entire concept of the story
really<00:05:30.720> has<00:05:31.080> me<00:05:31.320> intrigued<00:05:31.800> and<00:05:32.070> I<00:05:32.400> think<00:05:32.610> this

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
really has me intrigued and I think this

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.130 
really has me intrigued and I think this
is<00:05:32.880> something<00:05:33.150> that<00:05:33.180> we<00:05:33.360> all<00:05:33.540> should<00:05:33.720> tune<00:05:33.960> in

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
is something that we all should tune in

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.870 
is something that we all should tune in
for<00:05:34.380> but<00:05:34.740> you<00:05:35.130> know<00:05:35.250> you're<00:05:35.490> definitely<00:05:35.640> gonna

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
for but you know you're definitely gonna

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.490 
for but you know you're definitely gonna
hear<00:05:36.210> about<00:05:36.240> it<00:05:36.600> I<00:05:36.690> really<00:05:36.960> do<00:05:37.110> think<00:05:37.290> this

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
hear about it I really do think this

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.020 
hear about it I really do think this
show<00:05:37.650> is<00:05:37.680> going<00:05:37.980> to<00:05:38.010> cause<00:05:38.220> a<00:05:38.250> small<00:05:38.640> amount<00:05:38.880> of

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
show is going to cause a small amount of

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.670 
show is going to cause a small amount of
controversy<00:05:39.660> with<00:05:39.810> some<00:05:39.840> people<00:05:40.440> and<00:05:40.650> I

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
controversy with some people and I

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.620 
controversy with some people and I
really<00:05:41.670> don't<00:05:41.790> know<00:05:41.970> too<00:05:42.030> much<00:05:42.270> about<00:05:42.330> the

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
episode was freakin fantastic and

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.830

probably<00:05:53.910> one<00:05:54.060> of<00:05:54.090> the<00:05:54.210> better<00:05:54.360> things<00:05:54.690> that

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840
