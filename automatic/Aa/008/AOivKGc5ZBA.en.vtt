00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
final training session together and

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.319 
final training session together and

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.559 
although Bella is still excited and I'm
using<00:03:36.569> a<00:03:36.930> little<00:03:37.109> food<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.769> help<00:03:38.040> her<00:03:38.160> out<00:03:38.569> you

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
using a little food to help her out you

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.660 
using a little food to help her out you
can<00:03:39.750> see<00:03:40.049> that<00:03:40.079> when<00:03:40.530> I<00:03:40.560> slow<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.130> food<00:03:41.370> down
