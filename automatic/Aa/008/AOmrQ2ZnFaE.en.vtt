00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 for arguing about what you could get 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.080
 Ukraine departure as you stayed in the shadows 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.970
 the question is what is needed from Ukraine to 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.550
 typical set of European requirements 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.860
 Ukraine does not hold out why is it so 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.470
 pressure on Kiev persistently offering more 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.900
 one more chance to think after orange 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.260
 revolution in Ukraine in the twenty-fifth 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.240
 year in the west has developed in relation to 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.350
 this country is also certain 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.619
 Nice picture 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.990
 what do ukrainian people want 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.630
 to the west wants a European Union what is it 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.180
 not so or not quite so in the west not 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.410
 see and began to state that 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.140
 Ukraine will need to feel the paw 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.730
 ferocious Russian bear and 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.670
 integrate to the west regardless 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.440
 which of course is in the west of the European Union 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.140
 now is still the hardest crisis 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.629
 Eurozone Prime Azarov laments for 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.789
 transition to the euro standard and need 165 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.370
 billion euros and there are offers only 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.230
 one with the fact that the holes of the budgets of Greece 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.870
 spain and portugal shut up amount 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.489
 almost half a trillion of them are not 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.710
 forgets but not charity 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.720
 engaged in pure pragmatism and he 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.729
 prompts in a crisis need not 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.530
 new sellers and new buyers 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.509
 Europeans held wallets but 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.000
 opening the market, you can drain the goods on 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.689
 Ukraine 45 million population is large 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.759
 sales market 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.490
 what will happen to Ukrainian goods euro 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.560
 pragmatists are not a wave but a huge scientific 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.360
 number of influential people in Ukraine 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.430
 I am talking in particular about the industrialist 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.560
 well understand that congress association 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.020
 completely destroy the country's economy as 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.210
 destroyed the economy of Bulgaria and others 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.079
 countries before they joined 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.850
 European Union 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.070
 these countries have gone through terrible 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.229
 tests and Ukraine in many ways 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.210
 more fragile region than all the rest 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.640
 so easily one beautiful morning 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.740
 wake up in europe will not work and about 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.479
 the abolition of visas in the agreement is not a word and 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.689
 economic benefits that supposedly 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.799
 such a wife will fall from Europe to the European Union 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.700
 experiencing not the best 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:02.520
 times therefore all programs are about 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.619
 help even taxi there so poor 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.110
 countries like Latvia there and so on 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.490
 these all programs are reduced if 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.640
 suppose so in debt 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.610
 bang Ukraine decide we go so here 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.110
 The answer is simple but if you hope that 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.780
 Europe will give resources money for 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.670
 upgrading but rebuilding it by 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.000
 at least the next nearest 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.560
 prospect will not be and you and those someone 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.660
 on this dress up and waiting huge 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.180
 disappointment but Latvia at least accepted 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.700
 in the EU but the association does not need anything Europe 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.560
 non- binding can last forever have 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.110
 such anecdotal I phrase after which 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.130
 the European Union decided to laugh sounds 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.260
 after turkey 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.120
 This is the answer to the question when this or that 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.720
 the state will accept the challenge simply 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.550
 never 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.380
 Turkey has signed an association agreement 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.900
 still with European economic 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.540
 half a century ago but never 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.130
 water Ukraine do you offer 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.040
 do so we talk about there and 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.110
 look prices east of Ukraine is not 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.360
 Ukraine joining the European Union 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.000
 Ukraine will not be allowed to European 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.250
 euro funds we will not be there I did not want 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.770
 say this but you drove me three 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.650
 years in a row since the tenth year to us 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.750
 promised 610 million euros of aid 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.420
 This candy in a beautiful wrap us 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.490
 showed the dawn of the year and you said them 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.140
 get when sign the contract with 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.690
 International Monetary Fund 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.670
 and the international monetary fund says 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.460
 raise public tariffs 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.890
 freeze salaries and pensions and so on 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.750
 you suggest that I go for it 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.820
 even those countries where europe is money 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.890
 singled out they could spend it in their 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.840
 it is not unreasonable to remind the interests of the Serbian 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.820
 an example of taking on Europe 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.970
 politicians in belgrade for 10 years got 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.640
 117 billion and 113 of them went to 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.100
 import of goods from the EU Europe gave 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.290
 european money and took a serbia with debts 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.750
 boneless without a shadow of autonomy and 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.590
 in line to the eu still after turkey 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:04:04.170
 server lured to european union 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:08.370
 so she was in control so she 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:11.130
 it was easier to hold on a short leash and 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.540
 so she just 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:18.770
 there was some kind of dependent territory on 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:23.460
 protectorate level which waits 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:27.330
 dressing room that her his or her allow 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.810
 inside it seems to me that the current serbia 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.790
 really is in some sense 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.800
 the future for Ukraine is a short leash 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.630
 that and financial noose convenient for 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.670
 Brussels means of communication with the East 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.100
 neighbors especially the countries of the former USSR 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.190
 and Ukraine is really key but not 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.950
 the subject of the big franchise policy on 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.440
 what are they such theorists as in life claims 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.510
 they say if Ukraine will break with Russia 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.670
 Russia for a long time is weak Colin. you 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.040
 mood in the eu as well as in the us 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.010
 the reason he wants to sign 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.910
 agreement with Ukraine is put 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.460
 geopolitical blow to Russia 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.440
 the European Union is indifferent to the interests of Ukraine 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.170
 it is important for him to expand his boundaries by 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.490
 Eastern Europe to enter the territory 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.920
 Historical Russia Ancient Russia 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.780
 so from my point of view there are no 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.300
 economic reasons for agreement 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.040
 exclusively geopolitically this is old 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.720
 how the world struggle for spheres of influence in 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.180
 which west never bothered not 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.860
 other people's interests have not been established for centuries 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.230
 economic and cultural ties 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.060
 they just break them and Ukraine as 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.250
 would not dream of equal dialogue with 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.800
 Europe was and remains for her only 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.880
 remedy in this fight 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.350
 Grigoriy Emelyanov and the matter that the head
