00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.680
 we understood that we could not play with 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.299
 them in open football 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.680
 deliberately played and the second number but 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:23.560
 did not retreat deep into the defense 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.630
 have tried 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.020
 as planned by us with the guys 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:32.140
 plan to build a general game then first 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.390
 half time in our gate was not at all 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.599
 and created nothing we had a good 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.940
 the moment Umarovich and the second half began with 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:44.380
 the fact that we had two counterattacks 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.840
 moment and are just two points when 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.709
 already the third moment in the match primacy obvious 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.450
 we had one hundred percent that's missing 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.269
 Condor counterattack where 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.080
 in general, an individual error themselves 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:03.160
 seen just unfortunately it happens and 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:09.420
 unfortunately most often we have the last 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:12.670
 tours after that we have of course played 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.299
 say revealed and such masters as 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.000
 Ananidze first of all there already was 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.680
 allowed a little more than necessary 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.069
 his second goal scored 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.030
 hence, in general, there was still a moment 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:31.510
 bad 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:34.090
 and 21 we after account 21 we climbed again 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.170
 forward but absolutely some kind there 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:41.980
 incomprehensible situation here already wanted 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.350
 the last minutes ran ahead and in 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.840
 In general, we ran into a counterattack where 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.569
 they included the very same ananidze 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.359
 everyone makes a good quality pass 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.639
 penetrating good completion 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:57.010
 from this composure in the end us 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:04:01.660
 so far unfortunately not enough because 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:04.750
 once again I say half the time was not well 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.060
 I know who watched would agree with me but 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.310
 moments were at this moment with us 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.440
 they were more in spite of the fact that 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.440
 probably rivals possessed a sword more
