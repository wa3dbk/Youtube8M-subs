00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.900
 a quarter of an hour already it's exactly 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.860
 what I was doing jean pierre elissalde 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.990
 it's gone with 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.730
 left from Cyprus where he started there are 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.139
 all these beautiful returns not the season 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.990

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.410
 me these cases 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.050
 yeah that goes in all directions 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.390
 maybe it will allow the teams and 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.060
 behind to disengage and evacuate this 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.320
 problem 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.710
 so low 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.710

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.519
 do cardinali 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.710

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.230
 Kenyan 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.370

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.230
 who are stopped 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.280
 it's good debate 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.860
 here 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.360
