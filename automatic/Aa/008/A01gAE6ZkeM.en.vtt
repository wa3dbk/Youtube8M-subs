 God 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.670
 Hi friends, how are you this time? 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.860
 I bring you news of what apple 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.730
 presented during the event double w if 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.009
 about ios 7 the expected new version 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.470
 includes important visual changes in 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.300
 the design of the operating system although 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.369
 the structure remains the same the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.099
 design of the icons and the system in their 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.649
 set is different with a tonality 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.480
 whiter and a flatter interface have 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.820
 changes occurred in the applications of 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.660
 pictures calendars messages game sender 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.210
 Siri time and safari with respect to 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.829
 the applications of ios 7 is important 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.829
 highlight and mention that all are 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.210
 will update automatically 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.969
 disappearing therefore the icon of 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.100
 corner notification although I do not know 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.780
 he commented a lot I imagine he will offer the 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.760
 option to control this kind of 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.750
 downloads and thus avoid a consumption 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.790
 high and unwanted data 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.519
 I will show you what are some of the 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.920
 new things that apple showed us of ios 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.869
 7 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.909
 one of the requests of many users 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.280
 for years and that today was made 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.110
 present was the simple way to 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.009
 access the wifi settings 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.450
 3g bluetooth take a picture 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.880
 Adjust the brightness of the screen between 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.380
 Other options 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.000
 just sliding any finger 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.299
 from the bottom of the screen 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.220
 up we will access the panel of the 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.619
 control center that includes all 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.200
 these options and others that were already in 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.420
 previous occasions also brings a 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.429
 new notification center just 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.890
 with sliding your finger down on the 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.869
 top part we can access the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.950
 notifications power options 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.990
 see them all today and the most reviewed 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.000
 multitasking assumes that 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.880
 applications that have not been closed 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.890
 appear now in the form of letters in a 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.750
 simple interface showing what 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.959
 we open inside the app as well as its 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.240
 icon on the bottom itunes radio 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:06.640
 now we can listen to varied music 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.739
 via streaming where we can create 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.780
 our playlist buy the 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.980
 song and search by genre artist or 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.000
 song 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.129
 among other options the photos 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.870
 main characteristics or changes 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.840
 are in the way of organizing the 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.790
 photographs an outdated system that 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.830
 had hardly received any changes in 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.010
 the latest versions and that concentrated 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.420
 all the photos in the gallery app 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.980
 all of our photographs will still be there 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.170
 but there are new ways of 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.110
 presentation and greater ease for 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.180
 create albums in addition to ordering our 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.610
 images we can also apply 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.690
 filters to the photos although this already 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.930
 we can do with other applications 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.030
 the next one is the drop if bad 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.510
 I remember they will only have it on the iphone 5 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.210
 and the ipad fourth generation ipad mini and 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.920
 the ipod toch fifth generation its 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.080
 main function is to share 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.350
 anything message mail pictures 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.920
 videos etc to facebook twitter 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.140
 messages and other services but with the 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.180
 novelty of having added contacts and 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.069
 select them to send them what 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.930
 we want 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.599
 in the camera we will see a new design 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.870
 simple and nice and very easy to 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.180
 use 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.760
 now safari we can see more 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.890
 clean fluid and occupying almost all the 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.170
 device screen we will find 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.879
 the options at the bottom and 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.580
 We will have a new way to change 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.830
 of pages 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.630
 in citi although I think it is not used 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.510
 a lot has changed in appearance and 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.550
 presentation can choose different 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.770
 voices to grab and apart from improving the 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.990
 user interface 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.840
 the mail application will now be more 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.730
 fluid white easy to use and 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.760
 we will find the options already known 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.070
 but in different design the application 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.780
 of the weather will be much more pleasant now 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.300
 When choosing some place or country we 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.370
 will show the temperature in degrees but 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.460
 with a very realistic animation we will see 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.890
 the rain snow a sunny or cloudy day 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.050
 and in messages when sending some writing 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.580
 it will come out from the bottom and it will 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.170
 there may be a half transparent keyboard 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.900
 also improving the design 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.940
 I must highlight other features very 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.310
 good to be sailing in a 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.200
 application we can slide your finger to the 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.080
 right or left and we will move 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.970
 within the app when accessing within 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.340
 an application folder we can 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.590
 just slide to the right or 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.020
 left and choose the app that we want 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.800
 with the characteristic that now it will be 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.600
 a half transparent folder ios 7 already 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.850
 is available in its beta version by 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.830
 if you want to try it this new version 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.389
 of the operating system comes structured 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.550
 and stable 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.830
 will be available later in 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.650
 fall for the following devices and 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.960
 its recent versions iphone 4 iphone 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:02.320
 4s iphone 5 ipod toch fifth generation 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.780
 ipad 2 on and the ipad mini 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.460
 in my opinion there is a 7 has exceeded my 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.740
 expectations although there could be 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.780
 added more features but still 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.210
 look good what do you think 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.240
 In this respect, this has been a brief 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.160
 summary of what's new in this I hope 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.780
 you liked it until later friends 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.780
