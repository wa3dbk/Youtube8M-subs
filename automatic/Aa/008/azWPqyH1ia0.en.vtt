some<00:02:23.070> people<00:02:23.400> aren't<00:02:23.700> comfortable<00:02:24.060> with<00:02:24.600> this

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
some people aren't comfortable with this

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.350 
some people aren't comfortable with this
and<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.800> want<00:02:26.070> to<00:02:26.160> try<00:02:26.430> more<00:02:26.670> graduated

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
and and want to try more graduated

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.940 
and and want to try more graduated
approach<00:02:27.660> now<00:02:28.050> there's<00:02:28.260> nothing<00:02:28.560> wrong<00:02:28.710> with

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
approach now there's nothing wrong with

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.320 
approach now there's nothing wrong with
crying<00:02:29.100> it<00:02:29.370> out<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:29.700> actually<00:02:29.850> it's<00:02:30.180> been

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
crying it out and actually it's been

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.970 
crying it out and actually it's been

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
proven to be a very effective method of

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.980 
proven to be a very effective method of
sleep<00:02:32.250> training<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:33.390> course<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:33.870> know

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
sleep training and of course you know

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.900 
sleep training and of course you know
you<00:02:34.410> need<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.740> listen<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.280> your<00:02:35.430> baby's<00:02:35.670> cries

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
and respond to them if necessary for

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.420 
and respond to them if necessary for
example<00:02:39.510> we<00:02:39.870> all<00:02:39.900> kind<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.320> know<00:02:40.500> how<00:02:41.160> our

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
example we all kind of know how our

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.160 
example we all kind of know how our
children<00:02:41.730> cry<00:02:42.150> when<00:02:42.420> they're<00:02:42.540> hurt<00:02:42.810> or<00:02:43.020> when

because he's in pain or in any immediate
need<00:02:49.950> then<00:02:50.280> that's<00:02:50.520> when<00:02:50.730> it's<00:02:50.850> okay<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.120> let

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
need then that's when it's okay to let

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.430 
need then that's when it's okay to let
him<00:02:51.390> cry<00:02:51.570> but<00:02:51.750> if<00:02:51.810> you<00:02:51.900> feel<00:02:52.050> like<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.290> need<00:02:52.410> to

him cry but if you feel like you need to

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.980 
him cry but if you feel like you need to
go<00:02:52.620> check<00:02:52.860> on<00:02:53.040> him<00:02:53.160> then<00:02:53.340> by<00:02:53.520> all<00:02:53.550> means<00:02:53.990> always

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
go check on him then by all means always

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.750 
go check on him then by all means always
do<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:55.440> if<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:56.070> want<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.310> try<00:02:56.490> a<00:02:56.520> more

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
do so if you want to try a more

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.120 
do so if you want to try a more
graduated<00:02:57.330> approach<00:02:57.600> though<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.560> can<00:02:58.740> go<00:02:58.950> in

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
graduated approach though you can go in

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.920 
graduated approach though you can go in

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
days but it pays off because then after

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.780 
days but it pays off because then after
that<00:03:40.350> you'll<00:03:40.530> all<00:03:40.770> be<00:03:40.980> getting<00:03:41.130> better<00:03:41.459> sleep
