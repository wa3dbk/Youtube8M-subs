00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.950 
yeah so how does the absorbing the
Dragons<00:02:41.100> is<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.370> like<00:02:42.670> leveling<00:02:43.120> up<00:02:43.300> or<00:02:43.810> does

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
Dragons is that like leveling up or does

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
to storm here to weaken it you can just

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.420 
to storm here to weaken it you can just
jump<00:03:30.640> straight<00:03:30.940> off<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.330> strength<00:03:31.870> jump

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
jump straight off the strength jump

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.399 
jump straight off the strength jump
yeah<00:03:33.909> he<00:03:34.299> just<00:03:34.329> sort<00:03:34.689> of<00:03:34.719> floats<00:03:35.370> down<00:03:37.409> our

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
yeah he just sort of floats down our

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.740 
yeah he just sort of floats down our
cause<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:42.400> when<00:03:42.609> it<00:03:42.730> takes<00:03:42.969> enough<00:03:43.269> damage
