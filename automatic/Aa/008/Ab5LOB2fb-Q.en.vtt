black<00:01:43.439> one<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.430> does<00:01:44.579> slide<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.299> lot

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
black one so it does slide in a lot

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.359 
black one so it does slide in a lot
tougher<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.200> do<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.680> say<00:01:46.860> but<00:01:46.920> once<00:01:47.220> it's

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
tougher I do have to say but once it's

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.639 
tougher I do have to say but once it's
in<00:01:47.520> there<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.850> fits<00:01:48.060> super<00:01:48.540> snug<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.380> let's<00:01:49.530> go

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
in there it fits super snug so let's go

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.590 
in there it fits super snug so let's go
ahead<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.009> put<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.460> one<00:01:51.119> thing<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.390> will

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
ahead and put this on one thing I will

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.940 
ahead and put this on one thing I will
say<00:01:51.780> from<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.049> start<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.380> because<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.860> get

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
say from the start is because you get

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.069 
say from the start is because you get
this<00:01:53.159> lay<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> table<00:01:53.700> design<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.540> I'll<00:01:54.899> go

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
this lay on the table design and I'll go

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.959 
this lay on the table design and I'll go
ahead<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.470> macro<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.579> guys<00:01:56.729> can

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
ahead and macro this in so you guys can

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.789 
ahead and macro this in so you guys can
see<00:01:57.149> here<00:01:57.420> because<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.229> get<00:01:58.380> on<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.590> lay<00:01:58.710> on

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
see here because you get on the lay on

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.289 
see here because you get on the lay on
the<00:01:58.890> table<00:01:59.009> design<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.640> they've<00:01:59.729> arced<00:02:00.149> this

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
the table design and they've arced this

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.350 
the table design and they've arced this
little<00:02:00.630> lip<00:02:00.840> kind<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.460> that<00:02:02.460> type<00:02:03.180> of

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
little lip kind of like a that type of

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.289 
little lip kind of like a that type of
look<00:02:03.509> around<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.320> sides<00:02:04.590> on<00:02:04.829> there<00:02:05.299> you

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
look around the sides on there you

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.440 
look around the sides on there you
cannot<00:02:06.840> absolutely<00:02:07.280> 100%<00:02:08.280> not<00:02:08.819> use<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.090> screen

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
cannot absolutely 100% not use a screen

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.999 
cannot absolutely 100% not use a screen
shield<00:02:09.629> with<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:09.989> guys<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:10.649> not<00:02:10.860> been

shield with this guys I have not been
using<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.400> screen<00:02:11.640> show<00:02:11.790> because<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.060> have<00:02:12.270> been

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
using a screen show because I have been

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.780 
using a screen show because I have been
rocking<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.140> case<00:02:13.349> and<00:02:13.560> one<00:02:13.890> other<00:02:14.069> one<00:02:14.310> by

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
rocking this case and one other one by

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.580 
rocking this case and one other one by
agent<00:02:15.150> 18<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.599> you<00:02:15.689> guys<00:02:15.870> will<00:02:16.109> see<00:02:16.319> very

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
agent 18 that you guys will see very

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.110 
agent 18 that you guys will see very
shortly<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.540> those<00:02:18.540> two<00:02:18.870> cases<00:02:19.109> together

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
shortly and those two cases together

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.030 
shortly and those two cases together
cannot<00:02:21.120> use<00:02:21.450> screen<00:02:21.959> shields<00:02:22.349> at<00:02:22.439> all<00:02:22.769> you

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
cannot use screen shields at all you

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.619 
cannot use screen shields at all you
would<00:02:23.189> need<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.370> custom-fit<00:02:23.939> screen<00:02:24.420> shield

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
would need a custom-fit screen shield

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.539 
would need a custom-fit screen shield
that<00:02:24.810> goes<00:02:25.049> around<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.680> inside<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.249> the<00:02:26.340> lip

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
that goes around the inside of the lip

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.459 
that goes around the inside of the lip
on<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:27.060> side<00:02:27.389> but<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.599> am<00:02:27.780> not<00:02:27.959> worried<00:02:28.260> at<00:02:28.319> all

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:28.469 
on that side but I am not worried at all

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.099 
on that side but I am not worried at all
the<00:02:28.680> glasses<00:02:29.159> very<00:02:29.400> resilient<00:02:29.879> on<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.750> iPhone

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
the glasses very resilient on the iPhone

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.990 
the glasses very resilient on the iPhone
4<00:02:31.409> and<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:31.709> I'm<00:02:31.829> not<00:02:31.980> worried<00:02:32.310> about<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.700> one

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
4 and so I'm not worried about that one

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.699 
4 and so I'm not worried about that one
bit<00:02:33.209> at<00:02:33.329> all<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.659> you<00:02:33.719> do<00:02:33.840> get<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.049> great<00:02:34.319> lay<00:02:34.590> on

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
bit at all and you do get a great lay on

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.470 
bit at all and you do get a great lay on
the<00:02:34.769> table<00:02:34.920> design<00:02:35.129> so<00:02:35.909> we'll<00:02:36.060> start<00:02:36.299> off<00:02:36.450> by

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
the table design so we'll start off by

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.330 
the table design so we'll start off by
simply<00:02:37.019> sliding<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.620> phone<00:02:37.799> in<00:02:38.010> from<00:02:38.219> the

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
simply sliding the phone in from the

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.659 
simply sliding the phone in from the
bottom<00:02:38.669> here<00:02:38.849> it<00:02:39.269> is<00:02:39.480> super<00:02:40.079> super<00:02:40.290> snug<00:02:40.709> I

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:41.669 
bottom here it is super super snug I

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.970 
bottom here it is super super snug I
have<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.269> push<00:02:42.540> with<00:02:42.780> quite<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.290> bit<00:02:43.499> of<00:02:43.709> effort

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
have to push with quite a bit of effort

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.509 
have to push with quite a bit of effort
to<00:02:44.099> get<00:02:44.219> it<00:02:44.370> in<00:02:44.519> but<00:02:45.090> like<00:02:45.689> I<00:02:45.870> said<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.379> spits<00:02:47.219> a

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
to get it in but like I said it spits a

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.409 
to get it in but like I said it spits a
lot<00:02:48.120> smoother<00:02:48.659> on<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.739> black<00:02:50.340> model<00:02:50.730> so

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:51.419 
lot smoother on the black model so

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.750 
lot smoother on the black model so
that's<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:51.810> back<00:02:52.019> is<00:02:52.290> on<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.889> now<00:02:53.459> we'll<00:02:53.639> go

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
that's the back is on and now we'll go

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.550 
that's the back is on and now we'll go
ahead<00:02:53.819> and<00:02:53.939> put<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.299> bottom<00:02:54.659> and<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.260> locked

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
ahead and put the bottom and that locked

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.470 
ahead and put the bottom and that locked
into<00:02:55.739> place<00:02:55.919> really<00:02:56.280> nicely<00:02:56.519> they've<00:02:57.030> got<00:02:57.209> two

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
into place really nicely they've got two

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.080 
into place really nicely they've got two
pegs<00:02:57.810> here<00:02:58.079> one<00:02:58.409> on<00:02:58.439> either<00:02:58.769> side<00:02:58.889> that<00:02:59.400> locks

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
pegs here one on either side that locks

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.420 
pegs here one on either side that locks
and<00:03:00.299> secures<00:03:00.719> this<00:03:00.870> bottom<00:03:01.290> piece<00:03:01.439> in<00:03:01.709> I<00:03:01.889> like

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
and secures this bottom piece in I like

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.979 
and secures this bottom piece in I like
that<00:03:02.639> so<00:03:03.030> much<00:03:03.329> better<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:03.780> was<00:03:03.900> an

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
that so much better that was an

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.259 
that so much better that was an
excellent<00:03:04.409> design<00:03:04.829> option<00:03:05.340> by<00:03:05.489> agent<00:03:05.939> 18

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
excellent design option by agent 18

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.030 
excellent design option by agent 18
compared<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.019> say<00:03:07.199> something<00:03:07.560> like<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.859> in

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
compared to say something like the in

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.099 
compared to say something like the in
case<00:03:08.280> slider<00:03:08.639> any<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.180> those<00:03:09.269> rebel<00:03:09.689> scholars

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
case slider any of those rebel scholars

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.050 
case slider any of those rebel scholars
because<00:03:10.590> they<00:03:10.889> did<00:03:11.069> not<00:03:11.099> have<00:03:11.219> a<00:03:11.430> locking

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
because they did not have a locking

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.420 
because they did not have a locking
mechanism<00:03:12.090> here<00:03:13.049> on<00:03:13.139> the<00:03:13.230> sides<00:03:13.469> the<00:03:13.980> bottom

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
mechanism here on the sides the bottom

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.580 
mechanism here on the sides the bottom
was<00:03:14.609> prone<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.239> falling<00:03:15.569> out<00:03:15.810> easily<00:03:16.079> in<00:03:16.469> it

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
was prone to falling out easily in it

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.569 
was prone to falling out easily in it
