the<00:00:48.190> same<00:00:48.430> thing<00:00:48.670> over<00:00:48.879> the<00:00:49.089> nine<00:00:49.299> key<00:00:49.600> I<00:00:49.659> have

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
the same thing over the nine key I have

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.509 
the same thing over the nine key I have
my<00:00:49.900> tread<00:00:50.140> width<00:00:50.320> stored<00:00:50.680> so<00:00:51.159> right<00:00:51.309> now<00:00:51.460> the

application let's use two hundred and
forty<00:00:56.019> millimeters<00:00:56.530> as<00:00:56.739> our<00:00:57.129> target<00:00:57.369> hit

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
forty millimeters as our target hit

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.789 
forty millimeters as our target hit
convert<00:00:58.180> nine<00:00:58.629> makes<00:00:59.019> it<00:00:59.199> millimeters

00:00:59.789 --> 00:00:59.799 
convert nine makes it millimeters

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:02.460 
convert nine makes it millimeters
I<00:00:59.830> say<00:01:00.430> store<00:01:00.790> that<00:01:01.059> in<00:01:01.239> the<00:01:01.269> nine<00:01:01.540> tread<00:01:02.320> width

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
I say store that in the nine tread width

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.090 
I say store that in the nine tread width
stored<00:01:02.799> 240<00:01:03.580> millimeters<00:01:04.059> so<00:01:04.780> that<00:01:04.960> will<00:01:05.920> stay

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
stored 240 millimeters so that will stay

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.859 
stored 240 millimeters so that will stay
in<00:01:06.250> there<00:01:06.460> semi-permanently<00:01:07.360> until<00:01:07.780> you

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
in there semi-permanently until you

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.870 
in there semi-permanently until you
either<00:01:08.020> pull<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.470> batteries<00:01:08.830> out<00:01:09.009> or<00:01:09.580> hit

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
either pull the batteries out or hit

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.640 
either pull the batteries out or hit
convert<00:01:10.090> all<00:01:10.509> clear<00:01:10.840> but<00:01:11.020> you<00:01:11.200> can<00:01:11.350> turn<00:01:11.500> it

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
convert all clear but you can turn it

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.680 
convert all clear but you can turn it
off<00:01:11.770> come<00:01:12.100> back<00:01:12.130> a<00:01:12.280> month<00:01:12.610> from<00:01:12.820> now<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:13.240> these

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
off come back a month from now and these

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.990 
off come back a month from now and these
values<00:01:14.140> will<00:01:15.040> still<00:01:15.280> be<00:01:15.430> in<00:01:15.550> there<00:01:15.670> as<00:01:15.820> you've

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
values will still be in there as you've

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.430 
values will still be in there as you've
stored<00:01:16.210> them<00:01:16.450> so<00:01:16.570> ordinarily<00:01:17.080> you'd<00:01:17.260> have

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
stored them so ordinarily you'd have

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.080 
stored them so ordinarily you'd have
those<00:01:17.590> already<00:01:17.800> done<00:01:18.220> so<00:01:18.640> we're<00:01:18.760> gonna<00:01:18.850> say

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
those already done so we're gonna say

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.310 
those already done so we're gonna say
that<00:01:19.270> they're<00:01:19.360> in<00:01:19.420> there<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:19.810> you<00:01:20.200> know

ordinarily start with a floor to floor

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.150 
ordinarily start with a floor to floor
rise<00:01:22.120> so<00:01:22.450> say<00:01:22.630> you've<00:01:22.750> got<00:01:23.040> twenty<00:01:24.040> eight

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
rise so say you've got twenty eight
