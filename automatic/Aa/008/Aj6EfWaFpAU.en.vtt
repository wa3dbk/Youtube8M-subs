the people around me and that's one of
the<00:05:08.130> worst<00:05:08.250> positions<00:05:08.789> to<00:05:08.940> be<00:05:09.120> in<00:05:09.270> is<00:05:09.419> just

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
the worst positions to be in is just

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.120 
the worst positions to be in is just
having<00:05:10.080> your<00:05:10.169> head<00:05:10.320> stuck<00:05:10.560> in<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:10.740> sand<00:05:10.979> like

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
having your head stuck in the sand like

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.159 
having your head stuck in the sand like
you're<00:05:11.370> some<00:05:11.520> sort<00:05:11.699> of<00:05:11.820> what<00:05:12.240> is<00:05:12.330> it<00:05:12.449> an<00:05:12.539> emu<00:05:12.930> or

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
you're some sort of what is it an emu or

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.370 
you're some sort of what is it an emu or
an<00:05:13.229> ostrich<00:05:13.710> or<00:05:13.889> whatever<00:05:14.100> animal<00:05:14.430> does<00:05:14.610> that

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
an ostrich or whatever animal does that

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.810 
an ostrich or whatever animal does that
it's<00:05:16.380> not<00:05:16.560> a<00:05:16.620> good<00:05:16.830> spot<00:05:17.100> to<00:05:17.130> be<00:05:17.430> and<00:05:17.610> you<00:05:17.669> want

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
it's not a good spot to be and you want

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.100 
it's not a good spot to be and you want
to<00:05:17.880> pull<00:05:18.060> your<00:05:18.180> head<00:05:18.330> out<00:05:18.449> of<00:05:18.479> the<00:05:18.599> sand<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:19.020> go

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
to pull your head out of the sand and go

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.500 
to pull your head out of the sand and go
back<00:05:19.289> to<00:05:19.410> playing<00:05:19.560> in<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:19.949> beach<00:05:20.190> and<00:05:21.180> I<00:05:21.270> think

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
back to playing in the beach and I think

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.930 
back to playing in the beach and I think
if<00:05:21.599> there<00:05:21.750> is<00:05:21.840> a<00:05:21.870> solution<00:05:22.139> to<00:05:22.979> douchebaggery

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
if there is a solution to douchebaggery

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.060 
if there is a solution to douchebaggery
and<00:05:24.389> people<00:05:24.840> acting<00:05:25.110> like<00:05:25.229> dicks<00:05:25.500> and<00:05:25.770> people

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
and people acting like dicks and people

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.159 
and people acting like dicks and people
being<00:05:26.190> mean<00:05:26.490> it's<00:05:27.240> that<00:05:27.509> they<00:05:27.690> need<00:05:27.900> to<00:05:28.050> be

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
being mean it's that they need to be

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:29.510 
being mean it's that they need to be
outed<00:05:28.590> and<00:05:28.740> they<00:05:28.979> need<00:05:29.160> to<00:05:29.190> be<00:05:29.280> held

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
outed and they need to be held

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.830 
outed and they need to be held
accountable<00:05:29.639> and<00:05:30.210> the<00:05:30.300> best<00:05:30.479> way<00:05:30.510> to<00:05:30.630> do<00:05:30.810> that

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
accountable and the best way to do that

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.839 
accountable and the best way to do that
following<00:05:31.380> the<00:05:31.410> beach<00:05:31.680> metaphor<00:05:32.280> try<00:05:32.789> to

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:32.849 
following the beach metaphor try to

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:34.820 
following the beach metaphor try to
stick<00:05:33.120> with<00:05:33.300> me<00:05:33.449> here<00:05:33.479> is<00:05:33.840> that<00:05:34.320> we<00:05:34.440> could<00:05:34.590> bury

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
stick with me here is that we could bury

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.969 
stick with me here is that we could bury
them<00:05:35.220> in<00:05:35.430> sand<00:05:36.180> up<00:05:36.510> to<00:05:36.900> their<00:05:37.080> heads<00:05:37.349> so<00:05:37.800> that's

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
them in sand up to their heads so that's

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.860 
them in sand up to their heads so that's
just<00:05:38.070> their<00:05:38.430> head<00:05:38.610> poking<00:05:39.060> out<00:05:39.180> and<00:05:39.449> then

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
just their head poking out and then

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.570 
just their head poking out and then
whatever<00:05:40.139> they<00:05:40.410> do<00:05:40.470> wrong<00:05:40.800> you<00:05:41.220> know<00:05:41.340> we<00:05:41.460> can

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
whatever they do wrong you know we can

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.790 
whatever they do wrong you know we can
kick<00:05:41.789> sand<00:05:42.090> in<00:05:42.210> their<00:05:42.360> face<00:05:42.570> or<00:05:42.840> we<00:05:42.960> can<00:05:43.139> I

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
kick sand in their face or we can I

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.950 
kick sand in their face or we can I
guess<00:05:44.490> that's<00:05:44.729> let's<00:05:45.090> go<00:05:45.240> you<00:05:45.659> should<00:05:45.840> have<00:05:45.930> a

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
guess that's let's go you should have a

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.360 
guess that's let's go you should have a
fight<00:05:46.169> fire<00:05:46.409> with<00:05:46.440> fire<00:05:46.650> I<00:05:46.889> think<00:05:47.039> it's

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
fight fire with fire I think it's

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.339 
fight fire with fire I think it's
