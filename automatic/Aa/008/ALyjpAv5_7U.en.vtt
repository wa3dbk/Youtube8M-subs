old<00:02:01.930> dangling<00:02:02.470> all<00:02:02.650> over<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.010> place<00:02:03.220> and<00:02:03.490> it's

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
old dangling all over the place and it's

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.790 
old dangling all over the place and it's
not<00:02:03.700> really<00:02:03.970> you<00:02:04.630> know<00:02:04.780> it<00:02:05.080> needs<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.470> be<00:02:05.560> work

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
not really you know it needs to be work

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.130 
not really you know it needs to be work
and<00:02:06.010> as<00:02:06.130> I<00:02:06.160> see<00:02:06.430> it<00:02:06.520> is<00:02:06.640> a<00:02:06.670> mod<00:02:06.970> and<00:02:07.210> I<00:02:07.870> think

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
and as I see it is a mod and I think

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.719 
and as I see it is a mod and I think
that's<00:02:08.289> why<00:02:08.500> he's<00:02:08.649> limited<00:02:09.039> to<00:02:09.190> third-person

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
that's why he's limited to third-person

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.430 
that's why he's limited to third-person
as<00:02:10.149> well<00:02:10.390> because<00:02:10.840> if<00:02:11.019> you<00:02:11.140> look<00:02:11.290> in

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
as well because if you look in

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.559 
as well because if you look in
third-person<00:02:11.950> it's<00:02:12.459> not<00:02:12.849> really<00:02:13.150> quite<00:02:13.300> right

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
third-person it's not really quite right

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.320 
third-person it's not really quite right
because<00:02:14.379> if<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.099> switch<00:02:15.310> if<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:16.030> switch<00:02:16.300> the

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
because if you switch if you switch the

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.369 
because if you switch if you switch the
weapon<00:02:16.840> loadouts

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
weapon loadouts

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.220 
weapon loadouts
to<00:02:17.860> like<00:02:18.010> an<00:02:18.190> AR<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.819> you're<00:02:19.690> basically<00:02:20.080> going

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
to like an AR and you're basically going

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.790 
to like an AR and you're basically going
to<00:02:20.290> go<00:02:20.410> first<00:02:20.800> person<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.519> doesn't<00:02:22.420> really

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
to go first person and doesn't really

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.229 
to go first person and doesn't really
fit<00:02:23.800> well<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.280> carrot<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:24.700> you've<00:02:24.879> your

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
fit well to the carrot and you've your

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.759 
fit well to the carrot and you've your
carrot<00:02:25.540> as<00:02:25.599> a<00:02:25.629> bit<00:02:25.810> all<00:02:25.900> over<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.230> place<00:02:26.440> it's

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
carrot as a bit all over the place it's

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.470 
carrot as a bit all over the place it's
not<00:02:27.159> quite<00:02:27.430> ideal<00:02:27.609> when<00:02:27.999> you<00:02:28.090> play<00:02:28.299> in<00:02:28.359> the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
not quite ideal when you play in the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.100 
not quite ideal when you play in the
game<00:02:28.659> and

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
game and

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.230 
game and
when<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.280> gives<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.060> better

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
when you it gives you a better

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.500 
when you it gives you a better
perspective<00:02:31.660> because<00:02:32.080> you've<00:02:32.380> got<00:02:32.560> like<00:02:32.740> more

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
perspective because you've got like more

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.420 
perspective because you've got like more
view<00:02:34.510> space<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:35.200> like<00:02:35.350> cover<00:02:35.680> because<00:02:35.890> in

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
view space that like cover because in

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.850 
view space that like cover because in
first<00:02:36.790> person<00:02:36.970> you're<00:02:37.240> pretty<00:02:37.480> much<00:02:37.630> like

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
first person you're pretty much like

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.840 
first person you're pretty much like
disorientated<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:38.920> you're<00:02:39.070> not<00:02:39.190> sure<00:02:39.490> where

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
disorientated and you're not sure where

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.960 
disorientated and you're not sure where
to<00:02:39.880> go<00:02:40.270> as<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.600> main<00:02:41.470> character<00:02:41.710> also<00:02:42.370> it's<00:02:42.820> like

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
to go as a main character also it's like

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.360 
to go as a main character also it's like
a<00:02:43.000> five<00:02:43.330> based<00:02:43.750> play<00:02:44.470> around<00:02:44.800> I<00:02:44.920> think<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.220> can

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
a five based play around I think you can

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.950 
a five based play around I think you can
customize<00:02:45.940> them<00:02:46.120> I've<00:02:46.210> tried<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.510> customize

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
customize them I've tried to customize

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.740 
customize them I've tried to customize
them<00:02:47.290> in<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.860> options<00:02:48.280> but<00:02:48.910> it's<00:02:49.210> not<00:02:49.510> really

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
them in the options but it's not really

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.080 
them in the options but it's not really
working<00:02:50.080> that<00:02:50.200> well<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:50.710> there<00:02:51.490> are<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:51.700> few

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
working that well so there are a few

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.390 
working that well so there are a few
bugs<00:02:52.330> with<00:02:52.630> it<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.050> but<00:02:53.890> anyway<00:02:53.980> it's<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.250> lot

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
bugs with it and but anyway it's a lot

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.710 
bugs with it and but anyway it's a lot
of<00:02:54.430> fun<00:02:54.640> I've<00:02:54.760> never<00:02:54.790> tried<00:02:55.270> I'll<00:02:55.540> need<00:02:55.690> a

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
of fun I've never tried I'll need a

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.840 
of fun I've never tried I'll need a
tried<00:02:56.080> in<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.380> split<00:02:56.860> screen<00:02:57.070> or<00:02:57.310> something<00:02:57.640> so

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
tried in a split screen or something so

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.340 
tried in a split screen or something so
I'd<00:02:57.940> give<00:02:58.150> it<00:02:58.240> a<00:02:58.270> good<00:02:58.420> test<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:58.780> don't<00:02:58.990> think<00:02:59.260> it

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
I'd give it a good test I don't think it

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.440 
I'd give it a good test I don't think it
works<00:02:59.650> on<00:02:59.830> a<00:02:59.890> network<00:03:00.220> I<00:03:00.700> think<00:03:01.210> it's<00:03:01.330> only

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
works on a network I think it's only

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.840 
works on a network I think it's only
like<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.780> local<00:03:02.290> connection<00:03:02.560> but<00:03:03.400> I<00:03:03.460> will<00:03:03.670> need

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
like a local connection but I will need

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.700 
like a local connection but I will need
to<00:03:03.970> have<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.120> look<00:03:04.330> into<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.200> see<00:03:05.500> what

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
to have a look into that and see what

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.460 
to have a look into that and see what
their<00:03:05.980> what<00:03:06.340> works<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:06.940> what<00:03:07.090> doesn't<00:03:07.420> work

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
their what works and what doesn't work

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.350 
their what works and what doesn't work
so<00:03:08.470> I<00:03:08.500> was<00:03:08.830> put<00:03:09.130> like<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:09.520> was<00:03:09.730> playing<00:03:10.060> as<00:03:10.330> a

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
so I was put like I was playing as a

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.850 
so I was put like I was playing as a
civilian<00:03:10.900> character<00:03:11.260> you've<00:03:11.380> got<00:03:11.560> quite<00:03:11.800> a

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
civilian character you've got quite a

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.220 
civilian character you've got quite a
limit<00:03:12.160> there<00:03:12.250> they're<00:03:12.900> quite<00:03:13.900> limited

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
limit there they're quite limited

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.140 
limit there they're quite limited
movements<00:03:14.680> you<00:03:14.830> thought<00:03:15.070> run<00:03:15.370> as<00:03:15.459> fast<00:03:15.730> IDO

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
movements you thought run as fast IDO

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.360 
movements you thought run as fast IDO
you<00:03:16.360> don't<00:03:16.600> jump<00:03:16.870> as<00:03:16.990> high<00:03:17.170> and<00:03:17.590> you<00:03:17.980> get<00:03:18.130> hit

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
you don't jump as high and you get hit

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.250 
you don't jump as high and you get hit
once<00:03:18.580> you're<00:03:18.880> dead<00:03:19.090> pretty<00:03:19.750> much<00:03:19.900> like<00:03:20.110> you're

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
once you're dead pretty much like you're

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.260 
once you're dead pretty much like you're
pretty<00:03:20.470> much<00:03:20.620> vulnerable<00:03:21.220> in<00:03:21.400> that<00:03:21.459> situation

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
pretty much vulnerable in that situation

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.620 
pretty much vulnerable in that situation
see<00:03:22.480> as<00:03:22.870> you<00:03:23.080> can<00:03:23.230> see<00:03:23.410> I<00:03:23.440> can<00:03:23.770> get<00:03:23.980> hit

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
see as you can see I can get hit

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.990 
see as you can see I can get hit
instantly<00:03:25.890> make<00:03:26.890> the<00:03:27.010> character<00:03:27.459> perspective

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
instantly make the character perspective

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.300 
instantly make the character perspective
kinda<00:03:28.270> reminds<00:03:28.570> me<00:03:28.720> of<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.200> dayz<00:03:29.410> mod<00:03:29.770> from<00:03:30.010> it

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
kinda reminds me of the dayz mod from it

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.850 
kinda reminds me of the dayz mod from it
Almer<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:31.209> looks<00:03:31.600> exactly<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:32.380> same<00:03:32.620> like

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
Almer it looks exactly the same like

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.500 
Almer it looks exactly the same like
where<00:03:33.070> you've<00:03:33.340> got<00:03:33.459> your<00:03:33.610> like<00:03:33.790> backpack<00:03:34.269> on

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
where you've got your like backpack on

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.560 
where you've got your like backpack on
