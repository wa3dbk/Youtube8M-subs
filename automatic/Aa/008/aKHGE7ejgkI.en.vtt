00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 
look fuller and longer and then I also

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.949 
look fuller and longer and then I also
got<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.129> lorac<00:02:25.519> behind<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.329> scenes<00:02:26.659> eye

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
got the lorac behind the scenes eye

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.170

primer<00:02:27.319> and<00:02:27.620> shadow<00:02:27.859> duo<00:02:28.159> so<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:28.670> primer<00:02:28.909> is

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
primer and shadow duo so the primer is

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.229 
primer and shadow duo so the primer is
full-size<00:02:30.049> and<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.920> guess<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.639> shadow<00:02:31.790> is<00:02:31.969> full

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239

full-size and I guess the shadow is full
size<00:02:32.450> 2<00:02:32.689> and<00:02:32.719> all<00:02:33.170> these<00:02:33.590> were<00:02:33.799> ten<00:02:34.069> dollars<00:02:34.400> I
