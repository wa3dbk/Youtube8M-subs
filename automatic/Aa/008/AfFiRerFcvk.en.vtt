00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:32.739
 Are you sure that you fill in the real 95 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.410
 accidentally pour the surrogate tank on 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.840
 any even branded request so far 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.550
 dishonest tankers boost 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.400
 octane number adding to fuel 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.860
 prohibited prize from the most efficient of 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.290
 such additives 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.370
 tetraethyl lead however this substance 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.650
 very poisonous to the same products 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.780
 and fires poison special 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.300
 catalytic to fuel burners 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.940
 which clean the car exhaust 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.699
 gases 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.420
 one more metal supplement organic 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.210
 iron compound ferro prices this additive 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.210
 not so poisonous 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.600
 however, when Fir is burned , c 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.450
 solid iron oxides are generally ordinary 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.000
 rust and they essentially can 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.340
 litter the engine with gasoline with 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.130
 metals appears snuff the candles and 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.530
 additive components precipitate as resin 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.750
 on valves and engine cylinders what 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.869
 quickly leads to expensive repairs from 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.700
 this gasoline temperature rises 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.039
 exhaust burning neutralizer 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.869
 look here so choose something 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.030
 neutralizer if gasoline contains 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.890
 add fuel correctly with metal 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.530
 metal containing compound is prohibited 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.960
 we know how to define and are dangerous for 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.600
 gasoline engine 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.610
 This portable test is very similar to 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.240
 pregnancy test and litmus test 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.619
 pieces of paper 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.790
 And you check 6 on the type and octane 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.189
 the number of patients is normal 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.210
 We did not remove the games of the capital 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.520
 refueled become 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.790
 and bought there three from opened up to venules 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.090
 stop i thought gasoline and 192 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:23.849
 I have three samples of 95 gasoline and 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:25.050
 one sample 92 turn it on 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.780
 four-stroke single cylinder 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.489
 gasoline engine and growth 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.980
 designed specifically for 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.290
 determine the exact octane number 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.569
 gasoline 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.090
 setting shows the moment of detonation from 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.640
 them and compression in cylinder g over these 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.510
 parameters are given octane number 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.780
 they are four samples to 3 of them 95 one 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.880
 92 on all samples match 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.500
 requirements of regulatory documents here 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.310
 we used additives 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.280
 to change the octane number 92 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.799
 and it matched 95 gasoline 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.650
 happened if we had written here that 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.739
 Ottawa gasoline number may increase 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.170
 by 56 units 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.150
 98 do it yourself 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.549
 92 gasoline expected octane rating 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.370
 should be no lower than 80 2 s 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:21.500
 half but really somewhere in the range 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.410
 82 and 583 and a half let's say on 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.900
 a half and maybe 2 units 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:31.410
 octane rose if you 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.500
 add this 92 petrol 95 last 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.450
 false missing 3 10 narrow promise 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.530
 noticeably raise the octane number 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.560
 turned out to be a hoax 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.560
 but 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.920
 wherever we add nothing there 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.230
 no metals in gasoline from German 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.800
 additive is really manganese 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.280
 only its concentration is 100 times greater 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:58.190
 what should be 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:01.370
 and if all this gets the engine 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.140
 get ready for yourself 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.560
 we know how to identify dangerous for 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.200
 gasoline engine 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.209
 This portable test is very similar to 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.720
 pregnancy test and setting up your 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.720
 a bun 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:21.459
 maybe 95 petrol 95 96 maybe even 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.669
 but for the rest of the parameters it brings 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.919
 does not pass a lot of gray 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:29.260
 10 times more than 000 open an alt fish 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.120
 100 times more so here it is when sulfur 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.949
 burning turns legs burns out 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.810
 valve and piston and whatever you want 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.750
 I understand that this piston should have been 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.030
 pass 400 500 thousand boldly because 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.820
 additive engine knock appeared 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.860
 it appeared to load 3 times 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.840
 more which should be natural in 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.199
 3 times faster he wore out 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.900
 about 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.150
 here's an example teacher's supplement 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.400
 We look at this filter which filters 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.130
 fuel it is completely clogged after that 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.919
 petrol pump fuel pump failed 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.419
 resource 100,000 and he passed the children given 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.340
 case, the octane number corresponds to 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.400
 norm 95 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.760
 even in the 90 second samples where added 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.650
 small amount prize from how same 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.260
 then determine which of the gasoline 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.110
 have these additives using expertise on 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:20.020
 octane cannot be determined 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:23.200
 the presence of additives we know how to determine 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.840
 and dangerous for motor gasoline 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.700
 This portable test is very similar to 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.360
 pregnancy test and your paw 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.360
 a bun 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.349
 this is a set of textile strips 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.689
 impregnated with a special compound 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:39.789
 which changes color depending on 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:42.520
 fuel quality is enough to drop 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:45.000
 gasoline and compare color scale 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.949
 yellow left good fuel 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.990
 turned green octane raised with 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:57.310
 using the pen of prices or other 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:06:01.710
 deadly for the engine these things 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.710
 additives kill motor and neutralizer 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:12.060
 in fact, the regulations are very hard 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:15.509
 presence of organometallic additives 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:18.379
 more than 2 5 m we also have a bad effect 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.379
 to work there
