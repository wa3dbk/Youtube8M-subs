 alves esposito and today we will show you a 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.080
 very special product because a 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.620
 product that goes both the bianchina and 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.020
 to the fiat 500 that to the fiat 600 and this 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:22.130
 and a kit we sell for assembly 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:25.070
 of the padding and of the di 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:29.480
 these cars are just three 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:33.280
 seat elastic strips that we see 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.720
 just install here on this seat 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:40.250
 here there are then three more from 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:43.640
 install go under the padding that 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:48.430
 the colleague is about to mount on the 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:51.530
 seat and serve as reinforcement once 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.980
 once the padding is in place, you will feel that 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.970
 the back is much more rigid much more 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.710
 reimbursements reinforced later go 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.590
 applied as it is showing the 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.009
 connect this stuffing this 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:10.990
 strip of this strip of 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:16.189
 blue padding that will go to define 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:18.829
 the profile is the outline of the 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:22.459
 backrest in a more precise way e 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:24.649
 lovari inflate and again on this will go 

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:27.200
 obviously the one that was pasted 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.030
 padded blue padding still on 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.909
 this clam should be placed at 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.729
 silicone this silicone sheet will go 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.310
 to make the upholstery slide better 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.240
 when it will be slipped on 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.109
 backrest so the kit is 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.959
 very important for the success of the 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:48.099
 upholstery assembly and will go to 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:51.799
