00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.410
 differential equations by separable variables 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.090
 to solve these types of issues 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.710
 what has to be done 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.929
 is to gather 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.099
 each variable with its differential 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:13.919
 taking care of bÃ©jar 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.919
 always the differentials in the numerator 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.810
 to eliminate spreads 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.939
 we integrate from each side 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.949
 resulting in a quarter 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.449
 of the natural ovary 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.890
 the Balearic give it to him that is equal 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.980
 to the natural ninth the absolute value of x 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.290
 more the constant interaction 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.970
 next example 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.120
 it is not so easy to notice 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.580
 that the variables are separable 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.800
 for this 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.800
 we have to factor the x on this side 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.600
 and a restless in this other term 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.150
 doing the separation of variables 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.880
 we obtain 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.890
 x 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.820
 by the differential of x 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.820
 about square x more pain 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.750
 and efficiency leslie 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.680
 and Ecuador 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.680
 all this is equal to zero 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.810
 we integrate 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.660
 making a change of variable we have to Cuba 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.900
 follow the x which also color 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.960
 itv is equal to 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.410
 2x 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.780
 in fact 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.960
 another change of variables b is equal to kiev which in addition or not 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.120
 must is equal and cie 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.480
 completing the differentials 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.710
 we have to 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.820
 one means 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.870
 the integral 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.270
 from uu 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.470
 about uu 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.600
 a medium 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.290
 the integral 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.050
 dbb 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.119
 about is equal to being 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.229
 solving the integrals 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:13.539
 we have to 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:17.139
 a half the natural ovallino of the absolute value of uu 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:20.999
 a medium 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.999
 the london natural 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.869
 the absolute value must equal the constant integration 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:31.869
 returning the values 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.919
 we have as a result 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.939
 mario de luna and hits natural with in a single month and a half of localism 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.029
 liquefied natural in its offensive of constant bullying
