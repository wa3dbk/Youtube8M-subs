00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.490 

okay<00:00:01.740> I'm<00:00:01.800> about<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.280> start<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.820> engine<00:00:03.500> it's

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
okay I'm about to start the engine it's

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.249 
okay I'm about to start the engine it's
cold<00:00:04.920> and<00:00:05.430> I<00:00:05.879> have<00:00:06.029> not<00:00:06.299> pumped<00:00:07.140> the

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
cold and I have not pumped the

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.320 
cold and I have not pumped the
accelerator<00:00:07.890> yet<00:00:08.220> I'm<00:00:08.820> going<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.090> get<00:00:09.179> in<00:00:09.269> the

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
accelerator yet I'm going to get in the

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.759 
accelerator yet I'm going to get in the
car<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.980> pump<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.130> accelerator<00:00:12.769> probably

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
car and pump the accelerator probably

00:00:13.769 --> 00:03:54.990 
car and pump the accelerator probably
three<00:00:14.130> times<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.820> try<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.059> start

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.440 

Damona<00:03:55.740> engines<00:03:56.740> a<00:03:56.920> little<00:03:57.250> bit's<00:03:57.460> pottery

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:35.519 

but<00:04:01.450> still<00:04:01.780> running

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:35.529 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:41.019 

yeah<00:04:36.529> I<00:04:36.559> tap<00:04:37.159> the<00:04:37.459> gas<00:04:37.699> right<00:04:38.179> there<00:04:38.479> and<00:04:40.029> it

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:41.029 
yeah I tap the gas right there and it

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:44.469 
yeah I tap the gas right there and it
died<00:04:41.499> sometimes<00:04:42.499> it<00:04:43.249> will<00:04:43.489> spin<00:04:43.879> way<00:04:44.149> down

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
died sometimes it will spin way down

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.589 
died sometimes it will spin way down
just<00:04:45.129> like<00:04:46.129> that<00:04:46.369> and<00:04:46.519> almost<00:04:46.909> die<00:04:47.179> and<00:04:47.509> then

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
just like that and almost die and then

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.779 
just like that and almost die and then
it'll<00:04:47.779> pick<00:04:47.989> back<00:04:48.199> up<00:04:48.259> again<00:04:48.799> and<00:04:48.829> oscillate

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
it'll pick back up again and oscillate

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.559 
it'll pick back up again and oscillate
between<00:04:49.969> almost<00:04:50.419> dying<00:04:50.959> and<00:04:51.289> revving<00:04:51.679> up<00:04:52.569> and

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:53.569 
between almost dying and revving up and

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:55.919 
between almost dying and revving up and
then<00:04:53.719> sometimes<00:04:54.169> it'll<00:04:54.409> die<00:04:54.559> just<00:04:54.859> like<00:04:54.949> that

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:55.929 
then sometimes it'll die just like that

00:04:55.929 --> 00:05:45.080 
then sometimes it'll die just like that
sorry<00:04:56.929> starting<00:04:57.439> it<00:04:57.529> again

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.150 

as<00:05:46.090> you<00:05:46.240> can<00:05:46.360> see<00:05:46.630> it<00:05:46.750> operates<00:05:47.290> at<00:05:47.470> high<00:05:47.620> rpm

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
as you can see it operates at high rpm

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.320 
as you can see it operates at high rpm
fine

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
fine

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.040 
fine
but<00:05:49.780> it<00:05:49.870> will<00:05:49.990> not<00:05:50.200> operate<00:05:50.500> an<00:05:51.100> idle<00:05:51.910> range<00:05:52.810> of

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
but it will not operate an idle range of

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.170 
but it will not operate an idle range of
rpm<00:05:53.500> without<00:05:55.200> dying<00:05:56.640> yesterday<00:05:57.640> it<00:05:57.970> would

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
rpm without dying yesterday it would

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.720 
rpm without dying yesterday it would
like<00:05:58.840> I<00:05:58.960> said<00:05:59.200> oscillate<00:05:59.800> between<00:05:59.950> low<00:06:00.280> rpm

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:00.730 
like I said oscillate between low rpm

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.200 
like I said oscillate between low rpm
and<00:06:00.910> high<00:06:01.030> rpm<00:06:01.390> today<00:06:02.290> it's<00:06:02.680> just<00:06:02.800> dying<00:06:03.210> and

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
and high rpm today it's just dying and

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.510 
and high rpm today it's just dying and
when<00:06:05.080> I'm<00:06:05.290> driving<00:06:05.560> on<00:06:05.800> the<00:06:05.920> highway<00:06:06.040> I<00:06:06.280> could

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
when I'm driving on the highway I could

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.620 
when I'm driving on the highway I could
drive<00:06:06.670> it<00:06:06.730> on<00:06:06.910> the<00:06:07.000> highway<00:06:07.330> because<00:06:07.450> it

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
drive it on the highway because it

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.660 
drive it on the highway because it
operates<00:06:07.750> lines<00:06:08.230> at<00:06:08.380> high<00:06:08.530> rpm<00:06:09.240> but<00:06:10.240> when<00:06:10.930> I

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
operates lines at high rpm but when I

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.950 
operates lines at high rpm but when I
let<00:06:12.670> off<00:06:12.820> the<00:06:13.030> gas<00:06:13.140> with<00:06:14.140> it<00:06:14.350> in<00:06:14.590> here<00:06:15.010> and

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
let off the gas with it in here and

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:22.530 
let off the gas with it in here and
decelerate<00:06:19.020> it<00:06:20.020> it<00:06:20.590> sputters<00:06:21.450> you<00:06:22.450> know

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
decelerate it it sputters you know

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.210 
decelerate it it sputters you know
obviously<00:06:22.930> a<00:06:23.050> high<00:06:23.200> rpm<00:06:23.590> it<00:06:23.740> doesn't<00:06:24.070> cause

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.220 
obviously a high rpm it doesn't cause

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.250 
obviously a high rpm it doesn't cause
the<00:06:24.430> car<00:06:24.670> to<00:06:24.700> stop<00:06:25.090> but<00:06:25.420> you<00:06:25.450> know<00:06:25.660> it<00:06:25.810> shudders

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 
the car to stop but you know it shudders

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.310 
the car to stop but you know it shudders
a<00:06:26.290> little<00:06:26.620> bit<00:06:26.830> you<00:06:27.520> know<00:06:27.610> around<00:06:27.850> 60<00:06:28.390> 55<00:06:28.930> miles

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
a little bit you know around 60 55 miles

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:37.830 
a little bit you know around 60 55 miles
an<00:06:29.470> hour<00:06:31.710> anyway<00:06:34.260> go<00:06:35.260> with<00:06:35.380> that<00:06:35.590> for<00:06:35.800> now
