00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.230
 because of doing that had everything 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.860
 just started with the schema 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.860
 Sweet potatoes 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.470
 what am I going to do what I'm going 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.470
 cut potatoes 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.490
 a cup and my water battles I was 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.570
 obliged to do something bigger 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.410
 because I realized that 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.110
 our team 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.339
 so here 's after think about doing it 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:08.030
 I'm going to add 2 spoons to 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.030
 olive oil soup 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.500
 after what I'm going to do what I 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.500
 add salt 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.670
 we will take but too much first we have 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.469
 just to put a little bit after 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.859
 when will be following the no I do not know 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:47.939
 salty enough where his body added I 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:49.500
 m a little bit of weight and I'm going 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.579
 also moving together is you 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.770
 must tell you I put people I like 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.060
 in everything I eat not of the same 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:39.569
 time I put a lot I like the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:41.250
 last I could invite a princess is 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.239
 so here I finished the season ahead and in 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.519
 did I do what I had 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.160
 preheat the oven to 4,150 degrees 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.980
 so fahrenheit its 230 degrees celsius 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.299
 so there now what am I doing that 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.519
 I like is actually the oven fries 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:58.650
 for 30 to 35 to 40 minutes 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.760
 so what I'm going to do in fact is 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.160
 if you actually want 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.540
 in the middle we're going to turn so here we go 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.730
 put the fries for 20 minutes after 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.049
 20 minutes opens on tour then 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.829
 then we still leave for 20 minutes 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.329
 in Cairo class and 40 minutes at this 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.750
 that I hope it's a story about my 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.750
 paws 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:28.870
 we will do so here is an end result 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.870
 french fries are ready 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.290
 lady without embarrassment that I made up 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.060
 present 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.170
 the combination made of seasoning 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.370
 that I did there you are not forgetting 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.530
 to season the same way because 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.690
 I do not have the same tastes 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.459
 but there for me it's going you already have the 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.860
 potel who is sweet these are the legs 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:07.440
 from his pear all a little bit the 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:09.330
 minister she serves it's good and in 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.170
 do that's what i'm doing is that ben 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.930
 for example times if ever to take 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.549
 taste it to people to take as a 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.680
 little or ten times I think of everything 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:26.090
 simply an accompaniment of some 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.090
