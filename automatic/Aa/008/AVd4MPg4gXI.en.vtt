00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.720 

I<00:02:02.270> think<00:02:02.840> everyone<00:02:03.170> is<00:02:03.380> more<00:02:03.680> involved<00:02:04.220> and

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
I think everyone is more involved and

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.770 
I think everyone is more involved and
and<00:02:05.480> it<00:02:06.350> just<00:02:06.680> has<00:02:06.830> everyone's<00:02:07.400> got<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:08.630> much

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
and it just has everyone's got so much

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.450 
and it just has everyone's got so much
input<00:02:09.020> into<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.890> everything<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.340> we're

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
input into to everything that we're

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:24.270 
input into to everything that we're
doing

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.280 

we've<00:02:24.850> always<00:02:25.060> set<00:02:25.720> out<00:02:25.750> when<00:02:26.020> we<00:02:26.110> made

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
we've always set out when we made

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.100 
we've always set out when we made
records<00:02:26.710> to<00:02:26.920> write<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.460> record<00:02:27.850> from<00:02:28.060> that<00:02:28.930> was

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
records to write a record from that was

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.020 
records to write a record from that was
great<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.740> listen<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.310> challenge<00:02:30.760> is

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
great to listen to the challenge is

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.550 
great to listen to the challenge is
always<00:02:31.210> like<00:02:31.480> let's<00:02:31.690> make<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:31.900> record<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.380> you

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
always like let's make a record that you

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.040 
always like let's make a record that you
can<00:02:32.770> put<00:02:33.760> on<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.180> leave<00:02:34.300> on<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:34.840> don't<00:02:34.990> have

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
can put on and leave on you don't have

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:43.680

to<00:02:35.170> touch<00:02:35.410> it

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.390 

I<00:02:43.720> think<00:02:44.349> we<00:02:44.470> would<00:02:44.680> all<00:02:44.769> agree<00:02:44.800> that<00:02:45.159> the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
I think we would all agree that the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.190 
I think we would all agree that the
album<00:02:45.730> has<00:02:45.879> to<00:02:45.909> stand<00:02:46.209> on<00:02:46.360> its<00:02:46.510> own<00:02:46.629> and<00:02:46.989> every

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
album has to stand on its own and every

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.500 
album has to stand on its own and every
song<00:02:47.379> has<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.739> stand<00:02:47.920> on<00:02:48.099> its<00:02:48.250> own<00:02:48.370> it<00:02:49.209> has<00:02:49.239> to
