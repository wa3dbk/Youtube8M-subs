00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.529
 once wanted italy was famous 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.240
 with their great universities and 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.760
 schools that gave the world famous 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.679
 scientists philosophers and artists but now 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.450
 the situation is reversed, more 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.429
 young people decide not to get higher 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.049
 education for one simple reason they 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.760
 can't afford it and 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.750
 teachers believe that they are guilty 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.850
 this government 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.590
 estimated by the national council 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.140
 Universities of Italy for 10 years 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.449
 applicants was 60 thousand less 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.920
 this is comparable to the closure of such a large 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.080
 educational institutions such as 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.239
 Milan State University 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.649
 Inter last six seven son for the last 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.050
 six to seven years the number of applicants 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.180
 decreased by 20 percent only 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.760
 imagine 20 percent for five 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.070
 years it means young people understand that 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.590
 even after graduating from university they cannot 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.250
 find a job at the booth and and motive yes and 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.210
 prepared the vidosik before it over the job files 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.800
 art historian toreza restorer 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.309
 continue to work even during 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.050
 interview 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.590
 normalized working day she 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.080
 perceives as luck to combine work 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.420
 and study is not easy before only the road 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.280
 it took me four hours to work 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.780
 I really have nothing to complain about 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.150
 very lucky that turned up such 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.890
 the opportunity to find a job is now very 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.810
 difficult as well as tuition fees 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.020
 raised I have to work to 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.759
 keep learning though the words of italy 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.950
 art is considered synonymous 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.420
 teresa says art critics rather 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.299
 just will not work by profession 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.549
 after graduation pro rome 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.439
 Antaran took the brand strongly mine 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.210
 specialty restorer but after 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.710
 I will search for graduation 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.240
 work in other areas 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.850
 after all get settled restorers 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.799
 virtually impossible to conclude 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.880
 long-term employment contract for good 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.350
 conditions are small 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.399
 so I will look for other ways 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.049
 earn a lemon and sits bizol him 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.700
 This situation has a negative effect 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.670
 only on students but also on 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.259
 teachers after choosing a center 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.390
 embarrassing to talk about it but we 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.369
 teachers felt what was happening on 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.890
 currently we did not raise wages 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.750
 ten years but we still have a pretty good life 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.000
 compared with students and ordinary 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.789
 families who no longer consider higher 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.830
 education is a step towards a better future they 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.930
 don't think it's worth spending on it 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.340
 money and many families simply do not have such 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.720
 funds 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.819
 Italy is a country that can be proud 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.739
 its history there were times when people 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.019
 here were ready to die of consciousness 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.190
 however, the new trend does not promise 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.470
 bright future 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.470
