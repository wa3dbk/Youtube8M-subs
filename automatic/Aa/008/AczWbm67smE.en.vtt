go<00:05:46.430> on<00:05:46.460> the<00:05:46.730> whole<00:05:47.090> I<00:05:47.420> guess<00:05:48.290> you<00:05:48.440> can<00:05:48.560> see<00:05:48.740> that

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
go on the whole I guess you can see that

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.750 
go on the whole I guess you can see that
it<00:05:49.130> reached<00:05:49.430> this<00:05:49.850> mini<00:05:50.300> forest<00:05:50.830> thing<00:05:51.830> here

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
it reached this mini forest thing here

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.230 
it reached this mini forest thing here
but<00:05:53.150> look<00:05:53.750> at<00:05:53.930> the<00:05:54.050> explosion<00:05:54.590> radius<00:05:55.240> that's

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
but look at the explosion radius that's

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.070 
but look at the explosion radius that's
a<00:05:56.450> huge<00:05:56.860> look<00:05:57.860> at<00:05:58.040> this

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.610
