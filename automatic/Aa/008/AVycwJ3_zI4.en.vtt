00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 and also made friends today I bring you 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.640
 an idea to give for the day of the 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.260
 mother 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.830
 we're going to need money if a can 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.660
 we will paint it with any 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.450
 this 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.720
 spray paint for crafts or 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.060
 it can be with color but an anti-oxide if 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.640
 not the common painting of crafts I 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.529
 here he gave him first he gave him a hand with 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:35.519
 yes and then I painted it with the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.440
 spray in this case good here I gave him 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.739
 acrylic so they can also see the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.410
 difference if the aerosol and the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:49.680
 Acrylic had also given him a hand 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:51.840
 of antioxide I put locks of clothes that are 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.390
 you're wooden, we're just going 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:00.899
 to see the hook come easy and we 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.510
 tickets are left and paint them with acrylic 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.460
 also if the acrylic that you 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.770
 they want to use an acrylic 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.810
 clarito in this case is dark is for 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.270
 the color of the wood but if it is a 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.869
 light color first give some hand of 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.090
 white base if it can be latex and 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.470
 then they paint it with the acrylic that 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.040
 want 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.330
 they can then cover it with a 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.320
 unvarnished protector then what are we going 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.320
 to simply do 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.540
 these are going to be a little different to 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.230
 these others because I was unfettered and 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.230
 this 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.370
 and I had to resort to buying other 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.810
 so good a minimal difference that 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:54.110
 usually it is not going to be noticed but 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.520
 they are simply sticking with the gun 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.409
 there is nothing else 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.530
 throw paste for gun 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.520
 let's go supporting ibn 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.689
 we support let's see 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.689
 both 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.760
 it is difficult sometimes to sometimes find 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.930
 these obstacles 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.239
 yes because they do not do them they are used a lot 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.170
 the plastic ones but these for the 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:31.069
 crafts this is a treasure really 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.799
 these sleepers are a treasure 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.260
 Look, it 's easy for them to arrive on the day 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.739
 of the mother 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.739
 yes 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.800
 If you can not find good tickets, look for 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.800
 palitos maderitas whatever 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.480
 until we go we're going to do I did 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.090
 a cartoncito what was I put wadding 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.910
 the medium can be wider and 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:06.550
 they're just going to stick one down here 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.760
 there they will cover the fund this serves 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.210
 for moms to put the pencils or 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.660
 to put what they like most then 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.600
 let's go covering 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.780
 the flowers these flowers highlights the 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.370
 tutorial where I taught them to do if 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.739
 they are easy you can do them so much with 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.860
 this 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:36.800
 'violence and like with polar 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:39.569
 and they are the monkeys with those who plunder 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.829
 what is it called 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.829
 there is no if you 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.800
 'fishbowl' 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.800
 with burlap 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.180
 and I'm going well 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:00.030
 they can do it with one or two 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.030
 little leaves can also be alternating 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:11.220
 look easy fast easy and cute 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.840
 and they can give it away they fit well with their 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.870
 mom 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.790
 or with any hand if you give them 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.790
 give a life 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.710
 the mother of the bride of the groom 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.830
 easy 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:38.470
 you do not have to be painting a lot here 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.470
 let's put with a leaf 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.220
 they are not going to tell me that it's not pretty 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.370
 and easy 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:05.370
 and with this I finish 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.610
 look at linda 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:11.550
 Do not tell me you're not beautiful 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.979
 beautiful is not true good I hope what 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.470
 let them tell me here they can 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:21.560
 put the color they want obviously if 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.560
 this color may be more beautiful 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:29.110
 I hope they do that they tell me 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:34.169
