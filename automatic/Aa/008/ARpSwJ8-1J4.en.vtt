or my physical therapist figured it out

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.469 
or my physical therapist figured it out
and<00:05:05.600> basically<00:05:06.600> it<00:05:06.750> is<00:05:07.020> my<00:05:07.380> hamstrings<00:05:08.100> are<00:05:08.479> so

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.650 
and basically it is my hamstrings are so
incredibly<00:05:10.350> tight<00:05:10.770> that<00:05:11.699> when<00:05:12.270> I<00:05:12.300> start

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
incredibly tight that when I start

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.870 
incredibly tight that when I start
walking<00:05:12.870> or<00:05:13.229> doing<00:05:13.349> anything<00:05:13.800> with<00:05:14.310> my<00:05:14.639> legs

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
walking or doing anything with my legs

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.320 
walking or doing anything with my legs
they<00:05:15.539> just<00:05:15.840> basically<00:05:16.470> seize<00:05:17.430> up<00:05:17.669> and<00:05:17.970> they

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
they just basically seize up and they

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.839 
they just basically seize up and they
pull<00:05:18.630> on<00:05:18.930> the<00:05:19.169> calf<00:05:19.349> muscles<00:05:19.830> and<00:05:20.039> so<00:05:20.580> those

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
pull on the calf muscles and so those

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:22.370 
pull on the calf muscles and so those
can't<00:05:21.300> do<00:05:21.479> anything<00:05:21.690> they<00:05:21.930> can't<00:05:22.169> contract

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
can't do anything they can't contract

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.430 
can't do anything they can't contract
and<00:05:22.800> experience<00:05:23.330> so<00:05:24.330> they<00:05:24.570> just<00:05:24.750> stop<00:05:24.960> working

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
and experience so they just stop working

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.200 
and experience so they just stop working
and<00:05:25.940> this<00:05:26.940> workout<00:05:27.900> is<00:05:28.340> the<00:05:29.340> first<00:05:29.760> one<00:05:30.030> I've

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
and this workout is the first one I've

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.719 
and this workout is the first one I've
done<00:05:30.650> well<00:05:32.010> in<00:05:32.130> years

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.589 
I gotta edit all the swear words in
years<00:05:36.479> but<00:05:36.900> really<00:05:37.229> I<00:05:38.180> didn't<00:05:39.180> feel<00:05:39.300> like<00:05:39.450> I

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
years but really I didn't feel like I

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:41.540 
years but really I didn't feel like I
could<00:05:39.870> do<00:05:40.020> anything<00:05:40.260> like<00:05:40.440> this<00:05:40.889> walking<00:05:41.280> or

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
could do anything like this walking or

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.070 
could do anything like this walking or
running<00:05:41.700> until<00:05:42.270> I<00:05:42.300> started<00:05:42.660> the<00:05:42.720> physical

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080

running until I started the physical
therapy<00:05:43.410> and<00:05:43.500> it's<00:05:43.620> been<00:05:43.770> getting<00:05:43.860> a<00:05:44.039> little

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
therapy and it's been getting a little

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.270 
therapy and it's been getting a little
bit<00:05:44.340> better<00:05:44.430> at<00:05:44.639> my<00:05:44.760> back<00:05:45.830> so<00:05:46.830> this<00:05:46.979> is<00:05:47.130> the

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
bit better at my back so this is the

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.860 
bit better at my back so this is the
first<00:05:47.460> work<00:05:47.669> I've<00:05:47.789> done<00:05:47.940> where<00:05:48.270> my<00:05:48.360> legs<00:05:48.570> have

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
first work I've done where my legs have

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.129 
first work I've done where my legs have
not<00:05:49.080> completely<00:05:50.030> seized<00:05:51.030> up<00:05:51.300> they<00:05:51.630> did<00:05:51.870> seize

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
not completely seized up they did seize

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:53.719 
not completely seized up they did seize
up<00:05:52.349> in<00:05:52.530> the<00:05:52.620> beginning<00:05:52.770> for<00:05:53.220> the<00:05:53.310> first<00:05:53.520> like

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
up in the beginning for the first like

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.909 
up in the beginning for the first like
ten<00:05:54.000> minutes<00:05:54.180> or<00:05:54.450> so<00:05:54.479> and<00:05:54.870> then<00:05:55.380> as<00:05:55.500> I<00:05:55.620> started

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
ten minutes or so and then as I started

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.370 
ten minutes or so and then as I started
running<00:05:56.250> they<00:05:56.669> actually<00:05:57.210> stopped<00:05:57.690> seizing

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
running they actually stopped seizing

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.990 
running they actually stopped seizing
they're<00:05:58.800> very<00:05:58.950> sore<00:05:59.400> but<00:05:59.729> they<00:05:59.849> aren't

they're very sore but they aren't
seizing<00:06:00.479> anymore<00:06:00.840> so<00:06:01.080> I<00:06:01.110> have<00:06:01.440> hope<00:06:01.830> for<00:06:02.190> the

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
seizing anymore so I have hope for the

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.270 
seizing anymore so I have hope for the
first<00:06:03.030> time<00:06:03.330> in<00:06:03.630> years<00:06:04.169> that<00:06:04.470> I<00:06:04.740> will<00:06:05.070> be<00:06:05.160> able

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
first time in years that I will be able

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.790 
first time in years that I will be able
to<00:06:05.460> do<00:06:05.580> this<00:06:05.729> and<00:06:06.320> actually<00:06:07.320> complete

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
to do this and actually complete

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.339 
to do this and actually complete
something<00:06:08.280> that<00:06:08.639> I<00:06:08.669> start<00:06:09.210> which<00:06:09.840> is<00:06:10.020> not<00:06:10.199> my

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349 
something that I start which is not my

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:12.260 
something that I start which is not my
strong<00:06:10.650> suit<00:06:10.710> up<00:06:11.099> until<00:06:11.400> this<00:06:11.520> point<00:06:11.760> I<00:06:12.000> have<00:06:12.240> a

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
strong suit up until this point I have a

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.900 
strong suit up until this point I have a
habit<00:06:12.599> of<00:06:12.979> starting<00:06:13.979> things<00:06:14.220> and<00:06:14.490> getting<00:06:14.669> up

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
habit of starting things and getting up

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.740 
habit of starting things and getting up
or<00:06:15.560> starting<00:06:16.560> things<00:06:16.800> and<00:06:17.070> then

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
or starting things and then

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.930 
or starting things and then
deciding<00:06:18.440> to<00:06:18.470> change<00:06:18.590> it<00:06:19.100> so<00:06:19.130> I<00:06:19.250> start<00:06:19.580> over

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
deciding to change it so I start over
