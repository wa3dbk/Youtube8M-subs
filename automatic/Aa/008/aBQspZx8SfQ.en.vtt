feel like since I set that budget for

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.630 
feel like since I set that budget for
myself<00:02:33.080> why<00:02:33.470> not<00:02:33.680> let<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.920> older<00:02:34.130> kids<00:02:34.310> enjoy

myself why not let the older kids enjoy
it<00:02:34.820> while<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.240> baby<00:02:35.420> doesn't<00:02:35.660> care<00:02:35.960> because

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
it while the baby doesn't care because

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.600 
it while the baby doesn't care because
next<00:02:36.560> year<00:02:36.710> is<00:02:36.800> gonna<00:02:36.860> be<00:02:36.980> different<00:02:37.460> he

same having all the same presents for
example<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.530> think<00:02:54.590> Malia<00:02:55.010> deserves<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.430> little

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
example I think Malia deserves a little

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.800 
example I think Malia deserves a little
bit<00:02:55.730> higher<00:02:55.850> than<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.150> twins<00:02:56.390> because<00:02:56.630> I

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
bit higher than the twins because I

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.199 
bit higher than the twins because I
wanted<00:02:57.020> to<00:02:57.140> make<00:02:57.320> sure<00:02:57.530> that<00:02:58.190> she<00:02:58.459> had<00:02:58.760> the

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
wanted to make sure that she had the

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.610 
wanted to make sure that she had the
same<00:02:59.390> amount<00:02:59.540> of<00:02:59.660> presents<00:02:59.990> to<00:03:00.020> open<00:03:00.110> as<00:03:00.440> the

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
same amount of presents to open as the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.680 
same amount of presents to open as the
twins<00:03:00.890> did<00:03:01.160> I<00:03:01.340> guess<00:03:01.610> I'm<00:03:01.730> trying<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.030> say<00:03:02.209> is<00:03:02.420> I

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
twins did I guess I'm trying to say is I

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.570 
twins did I guess I'm trying to say is I
don't<00:03:03.020> even<00:03:03.080> know<00:03:03.230> my<00:03:03.350> own<00:03:03.380> budget<00:03:03.860> I<00:03:04.220> have

that<00:03:10.610> budget<00:03:11.000> and<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.810> try<00:03:12.110> to<00:03:12.170> average<00:03:12.590> it<00:03:12.830> a

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
that budget and I try to average it a

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.920 
that budget and I try to average it a
hundred<00:03:13.400> hours<00:03:13.580> per<00:03:13.880> kid<00:03:14.090> but<00:03:14.300> it<00:03:14.420> seems<00:03:14.660> like

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
hundred hours per kid but it seems like

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.440
