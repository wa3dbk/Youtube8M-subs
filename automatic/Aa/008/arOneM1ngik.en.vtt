 hello friends this time I'm going to 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.539
 show how to install a converter 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:22.320
 hdmi consists to go out 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.320
 to this axis this is the presentation 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.890
 are examples of how to install 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.360
 let's take it out of its packaging 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.920
 ah 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.210
 this is the converter 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.350
 as we can see in the hdmi entry 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.140
 and this is where the cable goes and 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.140
 the exit 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.150
 two left and right audio cables 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.020
 video 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.109
 a power cable 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:29.289
 and here it tells us what kind of image 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:29.289
 we want to take out the television pal or ntsc 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.710
 it looks very simple we are going to connect a 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.520
 xbox one team 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:43.049
 a television that is not afraid not 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.049
 has an hdmi 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.900
 ah 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.060
 and how can you see 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.120
 in that television we do not have entrance 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.120
 hdmi 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.820
 so 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.690
 as you can see 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.700
 it's a television because it's already 10 years old 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.420
 of service works very well still 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.650
 It is a video projector 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.650
 but it does not have hdmi 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:33.230
 here we have our our xbox one 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.150
 and let's go to unpack what and when 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.390
 we unpack it we continue with this 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.390
 video 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.930
 Very good friends , we're done with the 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.930
 installation of our xbox one xbox 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.080
 now as you can see we already have here 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:57.090
 our converter we have a game of 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:00.380
 gea cables and we have our cable 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.390
 hdmi that comes with the equipment 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.670
 Xbox One 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.910
 now let's proceed to do the last 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.940
 connection already so that we see to see if 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.940
 works 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.720
 we bring a cable 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:24.220
 that gives energy to our team 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:27.850
 we connect it here where it says usb power 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:32.860
 and we connect the other end usb to 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:36.150
 USB port found 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.150
 behind the xbox 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.520
 with that and when you turn on we have 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.380
 let's have energy 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.930
 let's connect the other end 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.230
 the HDMI cable that comes with our 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.230
 team 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:01.319
 let's connect it to the hdmi port of 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.319
 exit 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:35.099
 here it says lukewarm out 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:40.139
 exit to the television ok 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:40.139
 now this we again accommodate 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:55.190
 and we connect 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:56.760
 this hdmi connector to the hdmi input of 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.230
 our team 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:04.529
 ok there are two tickets 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.359
 here it enters and this is going to be the exit ok 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:09.149
 as you can see the connectors have 

00:05:06.359 --> 00:05:10.619
 colors white yellow red too 

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:13.229
 Our team has the same colors 

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:16.579
 then there is no lose we put the 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.579
 connectors in each color 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.440
 we can easily buy this cable 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.370
 in any hardware store your vga cable 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:29.150
 normal have no greater science 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:33.310
 and finally we are going to connect our 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.310
 connectors through television 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.529
 where we still have the same number of 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:46.099
 yellow colors 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:46.099
 white and red ok we 're going to put it 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:53.940
 in the number 1 entry that is this 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:56.770
 let's put yellow first 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.849
 blank games 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.849
 and now not 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.820
 ok well with that we finished the 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.340
 collections 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.340
 now let's turn on the xbox 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:15.539
 and we are going to turn on our television 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.539
 to see 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.150
 at least 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.920
 we can not see the start already we have 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.920
 image 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.530
 if our equipment works 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.140
 this was the solution since we had 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:41.150
 bought a cable a converter cable 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:44.150
 hdmi vga and it did not work 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.910
 so then this is the solution as 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.360
 You can see our sun Juan has already 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.360
 Connection 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.730
 see our cables 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.690
 this is our team that is going to 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.690
 allow 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.490
 to make the connection 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:17.190
 of any computer that uses hdmi to 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:19.550
 a television that does not have this kind of 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.550
 tickets 

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:31.360
