have to find different shells they have
to<00:01:15.710> find<00:01:15.920> a<00:01:15.980> different<00:01:16.100> home<00:01:16.400> because<00:01:16.610> they

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
to find a different home because they

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.070 
to find a different home because they
get<00:01:16.880> bigger<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:17.360> their<00:01:17.510> shell<00:01:17.720> has<00:01:17.870> to<00:01:17.900> be

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
get bigger and their shell has to be

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.720 
get bigger and their shell has to be
bigger<00:01:18.260> so<00:01:18.920> we're<00:01:19.100> going<00:01:19.190> to<00:01:19.250> start<00:01:19.490> off<00:01:19.610> with

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
bigger so we're going to start off with

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.580 
bigger so we're going to start off with
a<00:01:19.760> pretty<00:01:20.060> big<00:01:20.270> shell<00:01:20.540> all<00:01:21.110> right<00:01:21.350> I'm<00:01:21.440> going

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
a pretty big shell all right I'm going

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.660 
a pretty big shell all right I'm going

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
to start right here in the middle and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.610 
to start right here in the middle and
I'm<00:01:22.730> going<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:22.940> draw<00:01:23.150> a<00:01:23.360> swirly<00:01:23.900> line<00:01:24.110> I'm

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.210 
this okay and now we're going to draw a
big<00:03:16.420> pincher<00:03:17.020> we're<00:03:17.560> just<00:03:17.770> going<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:17.950> curve

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
big pincher we're just going to curve

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.280 
big pincher we're just going to curve
around<00:03:21.300> okay<00:03:22.300> and<00:03:22.540> stop<00:03:22.780> right<00:03:22.990> here<00:03:23.110> so<00:03:23.260> that

around okay and stop right here so that
we<00:03:23.440> can<00:03:23.590> draw<00:03:23.770> a<00:03:23.950> V<00:03:26.580> all<00:03:27.580> right<00:03:27.820> there's<00:03:28.209> one

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
we can draw a V all right there's one

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.500 
we can draw a V all right there's one
let's<00:03:29.740> draw<00:03:29.950> another<00:03:30.160> one<00:03:30.370> I'm<00:03:31.060> going<00:03:31.209> to<00:03:31.270> draw

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.530 
a rectangle shape another one it's just
a<00:03:36.400> little<00:03:36.760> bit<00:03:36.880> inside<00:03:37.330> and<00:03:37.800> another<00:03:38.800> picture

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.880 

okay<00:03:43.540> now<00:03:43.690> he's<00:03:43.900> got<00:03:44.080> some<00:03:44.110> little<00:03:44.320> legs<00:03:44.709> and

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
okay now he's got some little legs and

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.590 
okay now he's got some little legs and
they<00:03:44.950> kind<00:03:45.130> of<00:03:45.160> tuck<00:03:45.430> under<00:03:45.760> his<00:03:45.910> shell<00:03:46.180> we're

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
they kind of tuck under his shell we're

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.880 
they kind of tuck under his shell we're
going<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.780> draw<00:03:46.959> them<00:03:47.050> like<00:03:47.080> this<00:03:47.320> but<00:03:47.560> much

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
going to draw them like this but much

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.220 
going to draw them like this but much
smaller<00:03:48.160> so<00:03:49.090> we're<00:03:49.720> going<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:49.900> end<00:03:50.050> a<00:03:50.140> little

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
smaller so we're going to end a little

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.900 
smaller so we're going to end a little
bit<00:03:50.380> longer<00:03:50.650> so<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.220> long<00:03:51.660> rectangle<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:53.620> long

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
bit longer so a long rectangle the long

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.000 
bit longer so a long rectangle the long
rectangle<00:03:54.910> and<00:03:55.120> then<00:03:55.750> a<00:03:55.810> long<00:03:56.200> pointy

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
rectangle and then a long pointy

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.240 
rectangle and then a long pointy
triangle<00:03:57.330> like<00:03:58.330> that<00:03:58.570> okay<00:03:59.410> I<00:03:59.620> think<00:04:00.040> we<00:04:00.130> can

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
triangle like that okay I think we can

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.800 
triangle like that okay I think we can
put<00:04:00.430> one<00:04:00.610> more<00:04:00.670> right<00:04:01.030> here<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:01.360> can<00:04:01.540> decide

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
put one more right here you can decide

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.960 
put one more right here you can decide
on<00:04:01.840> your<00:04:01.959> paper<00:04:02.260> if<00:04:02.530> you<00:04:02.560> can<00:04:02.800> fit<00:04:03.010> one<00:04:03.160> more<00:04:03.370> or

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
on your paper if you can fit one more or

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.120 
on your paper if you can fit one more or
not<00:04:04.770> one<00:04:05.770> two<00:04:06.489> and<00:04:06.970> then<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:07.720> long<00:04:08.080> triangle<00:04:08.920> and

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
not one two and then a long triangle and

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.800 
not one two and then a long triangle and
I<00:04:09.310> think<00:04:09.489> I<00:04:09.550> can<00:04:09.700> fit<00:04:09.880> one<00:04:10.120> more<00:04:10.150> under<00:04:10.660> his

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
I think I can fit one more under his

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.390 
I think I can fit one more under his
shell<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:13.530> you<00:04:14.530> don't<00:04:14.709> really<00:04:14.860> see<00:04:15.010> all<00:04:15.370> of

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
shell and you don't really see all of

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.860 
shell and you don't really see all of
them<00:04:15.640> at<00:04:15.700> a<00:04:15.760> time<00:04:15.820> because<00:04:16.209> they<00:04:16.359> like<00:04:16.540> to<00:04:16.570> kind

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
them at a time because they like to kind

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.270 
them at a time because they like to kind
of<00:04:16.930> hide<00:04:17.140> so<00:04:17.380> you<00:04:17.440> never<00:04:17.590> know<00:04:17.799> how<00:04:17.919> many<00:04:17.980> legs

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
of hide so you never know how many legs

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.470 
of hide so you never know how many legs
you're<00:04:18.459> going<00:04:18.489> to<00:04:18.609> see<00:04:18.790> so<00:04:18.970> whatever<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.450> can

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
you're going to see so whatever you can

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.230 
you're going to see so whatever you can
fit<00:04:19.780> in<00:04:19.900> is<00:04:20.080> great<00:04:20.680> all<00:04:21.280> right<00:04:21.669> now<00:04:21.850> we've<00:04:22.000> got

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
fit in is great all right now we've got

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.670 
fit in is great all right now we've got
our<00:04:22.390> hermit<00:04:22.690> crab<00:04:22.870> we<00:04:23.050> need<00:04:23.169> to<00:04:23.260> add<00:04:23.380> a<00:04:23.410> couple

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
our hermit crab we need to add a couple

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.250 
our hermit crab we need to add a couple
details<00:04:23.980> and<00:04:24.460> their<00:04:25.270> shell<00:04:25.570> this<00:04:25.900> is<00:04:25.960> going<00:04:26.200> to

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
details and their shell this is going to

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.390 
details and their shell this is going to
be<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:26.410> funnest<00:04:26.590> part<00:04:26.890> for<00:04:27.040> you<00:04:27.130> you<00:04:27.250> can

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
be the funnest part for you you can

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.090 
be the funnest part for you you can
decide<00:04:27.700> to<00:04:27.730> design<00:04:28.000> it<00:04:28.240> however<00:04:28.660> you<00:04:29.169> want<00:04:29.350> one

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
decide to design it however you want one

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.940 
decide to design it however you want one
idea<00:04:30.610> is<00:04:30.820> to<00:04:30.850> do<00:04:31.210> stripes<00:04:31.840> or<00:04:32.500> you<00:04:32.680> can<00:04:32.830> even

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
idea is to do stripes or you can even

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.469 
idea is to do stripes or you can even
try<00:04:33.130> wavy<00:04:33.430> stripes<00:04:33.820> let<00:04:34.000> me<00:04:34.090> show<00:04:34.270> you<00:04:34.360> how

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
try wavy stripes let me show you how

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.360 
try wavy stripes let me show you how
that's<00:04:34.630> done<00:04:35.190> so<00:04:36.190> if

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
that's done so if

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.370 
that's done so if
you<00:04:36.430> just<00:04:36.610> do<00:04:36.760> a<00:04:36.790> wiggly<00:04:37.330> line<00:04:37.570> like<00:04:37.780> this<00:04:38.080> and

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
you just do a wiggly line like this and

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.689 
you just do a wiggly line like this and
a<00:04:39.250> wiggly<00:04:39.639> line<00:04:39.820> next<00:04:40.180> to<00:04:40.360> it<00:04:40.630> like<00:04:40.960> that<00:04:41.699> then

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
a wiggly line next to it like that then

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.460 
a wiggly line next to it like that then
you've<00:04:42.850> got<00:04:43.000> a<00:04:43.030> weighty<00:04:43.270> stripe<00:04:43.600> and<00:04:43.810> you<00:04:44.290> just

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
you've got a weighty stripe and you just

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.280 
you've got a weighty stripe and you just
keep<00:04:44.680> going<00:04:44.889> around<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.400> shell<00:04:46.020> doing<00:04:47.020> wavy

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
keep going around the shell doing wavy

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
keep going around the shell doing wavy
lines<00:04:52.350> and<00:04:53.350> pretty<00:04:53.650> soon<00:04:56.820> you'll<00:04:57.820> have<00:04:57.850> it<00:04:58.150> all

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
lines and pretty soon you'll have it all

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.939 
lines and pretty soon you'll have it all
done<00:05:00.310> one<00:05:00.699> more<00:05:01.300> like<00:05:01.870> that<00:05:02.110> you<00:05:02.650> can<00:05:02.800> add<00:05:02.919> a

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
done one more like that you can add a

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.510 
done one more like that you can add a
couple<00:05:03.190> little<00:05:03.340> speckles<00:05:04.030> two<00:05:05.280> shells<00:05:06.280> have

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
couple little speckles two shells have

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.340 
couple little speckles two shells have
lots<00:05:06.760> of<00:05:06.910> different<00:05:07.330> colors<00:05:07.720> and<00:05:07.990> lots<00:05:08.139> of

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
lots of different colors and lots of

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.620 
lots of different colors and lots of
shapes<00:05:08.410> in<00:05:08.830> them<00:05:08.979> and<00:05:09.190> you<00:05:09.789> know<00:05:09.940> our<00:05:10.270> hermit

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
shapes in them and you know our hermit

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.360 
shapes in them and you know our hermit
crab<00:05:10.780> is<00:05:10.900> just<00:05:11.080> kind<00:05:11.260> of<00:05:11.320> floating<00:05:11.710> and<00:05:11.860> we

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
crab is just kind of floating and we

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.890 
crab is just kind of floating and we
need<00:05:12.520> to<00:05:12.610> give<00:05:12.760> them<00:05:12.820> a<00:05:12.940> little<00:05:13.090> a<00:05:13.389> place<00:05:13.690> to

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
need to give them a little a place to

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.810 
need to give them a little a place to
stand<00:05:14.199> or<00:05:14.380> place<00:05:14.560> to<00:05:14.590> be<00:05:14.860> so<00:05:15.340> hermit<00:05:15.610> crabs

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
stand or place to be so hermit crabs

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.120 
stand or place to be so hermit crabs
walk<00:05:16.030> on<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.270> bottom<00:05:16.630> of<00:05:16.720> the<00:05:16.840> ocean<00:05:17.260> in<00:05:17.440> sand

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
walk on the bottom of the ocean in sand

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.960 
walk on the bottom of the ocean in sand
so<00:05:18.850> what<00:05:19.240> we<00:05:19.360> want<00:05:19.539> to<00:05:19.630> do<00:05:19.810> is<00:05:20.080> draw<00:05:20.590> just<00:05:21.430> some

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
so what we want to do is draw just some

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.070 
so what we want to do is draw just some
really<00:05:22.539> soft<00:05:23.310> curved<00:05:24.310> lines<00:05:24.789> not<00:05:25.750> too

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
really soft curved lines not too

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.469 
really soft curved lines not too
straight<00:05:26.560> because<00:05:26.860> sand<00:05:27.160> isn't<00:05:27.370> straight<00:05:27.880> so

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
straight because sand isn't straight so

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:29.640 
straight because sand isn't straight so
we're<00:05:28.600> just<00:05:28.630> going<00:05:28.900> to<00:05:28.930> draw<00:05:29.110> kind<00:05:29.320> of<00:05:29.470> some

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
we're just going to draw kind of some

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.520 
we're just going to draw kind of some
curved<00:05:30.210> bumpy<00:05:31.210> lines<00:05:31.479> like<00:05:31.720> this<00:05:32.020> and<00:05:32.260> then

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
curved bumpy lines like this and then

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.590 
curved bumpy lines like this and then
the<00:05:32.620> important<00:05:33.039> part<00:05:33.280> is<00:05:33.430> lots<00:05:33.760> of<00:05:33.910> dots<00:05:34.180> and

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
the important part is lots of dots and
