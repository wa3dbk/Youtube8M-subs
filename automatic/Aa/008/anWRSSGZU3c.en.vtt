00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.220
 being uruguay 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.980
 hello good to all of us kids 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.680
 CALAIS because we are in account 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.780
 report and that I bring you here good 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.240
 Well, the summary of what I and my 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.890
 opinion of what I saw live from 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.380
 the conference that yes four of the e3 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.300
 of this year 2013 and well then let's go 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.270
 by parts not primarily the basics 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.370
 they have taught us the new design then 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.590
 leave in description all kinds of 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.780
 links so you can see the design of 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.110
 the play the photos finally we have 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.750
 taught is a cube no but with a 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.880
 line through and it's just in prism not 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.100
 diagonally in vÃ©lez I think it gives me the 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.450
 printing is not quite good but 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.360
 I like it better than good but xbox 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.250
 good then 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.920
 to second- hand games may be 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.170
 use in playstation 4 yes sir 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.160
 the price four hundred euros one hundred euros 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.160
 less than the xbox 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.190
 what more so than for the online for 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.190
 play multiplayer because you will see that 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.470
 for the playstation plus, so the 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.909
 online is paid as much as the 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.070
 difference that good to be fulfilled a 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.710
 plus it will cost many more things fail 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.869
 games and the whole story 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.670
 that more out there games that we 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.670
 they announced new ones that will come in 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.670
 2014 or out there in the spring of 2014 or 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.490
 later, for example, the end 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.770
 fantasy 14 versus 13 call us by 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.490
 final end fantasy instead of that game 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.300
 shifts and that did not interact was enough with 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.280
 in third or first person then 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.140
 start to take action and well a 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.869
 last would be a little gameplay and little a 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.820
 trailer and one pass in final fantasy 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.220
 more games out there was also the 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.140
 authentic destination where there are game 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.140
 new exclusive of playstation also 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.360

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.870

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.530
 what else out there so we saw in 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.210
 place the kill zone of 5th - a group and 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.070
 many things that had already seen drive 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.110

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.110
 It also highlights the kingdom hearts 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.670

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.080
 cilantro same 6 a trailer we saw some 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.110
 to get high that we had not seen a 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.790
 immigrant himself 6 and say nothing of a 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.769
 act itself for playstation 4 and we 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.200
 they said nothing of a great tourism of 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.850
 uncharted 4 for playstation 4 either 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.740
 for now 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.660
 I missed something you do not know 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.490
 why I'm on my feet from the islands 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.890
 Marianas and you I extra for you in 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.710
 here a summary of what I saw and if 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.230
 you want specific data and everything because 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.270
 see this video and the games page 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.890
 that there he will have everything to the detail that 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.930
 I am giving here my opinion of what I saw 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.060
 live and what I think and I 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.800
 It seems like a great Jesus and some more 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.150
 there that sure it escapes in des that 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.680
 we did leave a lot anyway 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.260
 of links so you can see trailers 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.319
 simple that you find out there as you go 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.060
 advancing time and 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.670
 well the console says it comes out in 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.370
 Christmas of this year in Europe 2013 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.760
 Christmas 2013 400 euros there is no need 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.290
 pay or is there is no can be followed by 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.090
 two second-hand 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.860
 and well it is all very well and I do 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.750
 he left the truth very happy 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.849
 this conference would be very many 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.530
 new games and I tell you it escapes me 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.090
 some out there I do not know now what the 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.730
 of order also looks very good 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.739
 that game 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.400
 well I tell you some who taught 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.140
 so many kids so many games and then 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.819
 they offered many indie games 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.709
 we design games for playstation 3 that 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.989
 the guaje is also coming 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.970
 we continue gameplay a new gameplay 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.720
 totally new images very handsome 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.960
 also web 2 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.800
 one pass and one pass a lot of 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:50.310
 tremendous games all the truth 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.280
 so this is my opinion 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.190
 I know I'm not giving everything to the 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.930
 detail but good more important if the 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.780
 that paying to play online is not going to be 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.430
 need to connect to the internet 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.010
 if you do not have internet, get used to 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.260
 playstation 4 and played games like no 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.870
 Like xbox taxi cainco every 24 hours 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.700
 they are without history not good because the only 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.590
 contras that I see that fate that you have to 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.660
 pay online for playstation cross 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.359
 to play online is the only 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.810
 against which I see him otherwise a whole 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:25.080
 day I decided to give already 10 19 one pass all 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.910
 kids in games the mad max left me 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.910
 impressed a web pass 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:36.820
 in this crisis where the stylist 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.950
 gorgeous also good an authentic 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.780
 good bye and I tell you if you see yourself staying 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.030
 over there 200 the hat you have two 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.830
 forms also the video that I was 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.390
 watching live watching the conference 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.430

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.970
 I say because I already did it when the other 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.770

 less then only data will be available because

 it's two hours and a lot of information and this 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.869
 is the summary as it has just finished 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:37.869
 the conference to sleep 

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:45.139
 24 hours without sleep and therefore there is no 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:46.519

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.529

 video and good because it left me very happy 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:08.240
 a pity of not knowing anything of a great 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.209
 tourism for playstation 4 nor much 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.289
 before but incredible truth all that 

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:15.360

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.639
 very well very well they left a good taste 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.399
 of mouths kids that take my money already 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:21.930
 those of sony playstation 4 ok well nothing 

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:24.499
 more kids there are no favorites for more 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.499
 videos like 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.009
 every corner that we are alone to all 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:38.419
 hours with the king and with the least I 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:38.419
 I convinced Carmen of all the laughter
