00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.810 
veterinary sense so we had him on
intravenous<00:02:01.590> fluids<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.220> we<00:02:02.280> also<00:02:02.430> had<00:02:02.790> to

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
intravenous fluids and we also had to

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.460 
intravenous fluids and we also had to
infuse<00:02:03.330> him<00:02:03.680> with<00:02:04.680> some<00:02:04.890> fresh<00:02:05.100> frozen<00:02:05.310> plasma

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
infuse him with some fresh frozen plasma

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.839 
infuse him with some fresh frozen plasma
right<00:02:07.470> there<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:07.890> we're<00:02:07.980> going<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.129> start<00:02:08.550> him

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
right there so we're going to start him

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.290 
right there so we're going to start him
with<00:02:09.119> his<00:02:09.679> plasma<00:02:10.679> drip<00:02:11.069> now<00:02:11.099> as<00:02:11.819> we<00:02:11.970> know<00:02:12.000> he

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
with his plasma drip now as we know he

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.280 
with his plasma drip now as we know he
was<00:02:12.330> collapsed<00:02:12.840> this<00:02:12.930> morning<00:02:13.319> for<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.560> while

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
was collapsed this morning for a while

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.020 
was collapsed this morning for a while
Bloods<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.709> review<00:02:14.950> these<00:02:15.280> quite<00:02:15.730> low<00:02:16.000> in

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
Bloods of review these quite low in

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.229 
Bloods of review these quite low in
albumin<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:18.069> we'll<00:02:18.250> run<00:02:18.430> this<00:02:18.610> into<00:02:18.819> over<00:02:19.150> the

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
albumin so we'll run this into over the

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.100 
albumin so we'll run this into over the
next<00:02:19.450> hour<00:02:20.140> or<00:02:20.319> so<00:02:21.269> hope<00:02:22.269> that<00:02:22.480> improves<00:02:22.959> the

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
next hour or so hope that improves the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.899 
next hour or so hope that improves the
albumin<00:02:23.439> situation<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.400> then<00:02:24.519> we'll<00:02:24.670> read

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
albumin situation and then we'll read

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.030 
albumin situation and then we'll read
blood<00:02:25.120> sampling<00:02:25.569> and<00:02:26.470> see<00:02:26.620> how<00:02:26.739> much<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:26.920> a

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
blood sampling and see how much of a

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.520 
blood sampling and see how much of a
difference<00:02:27.370> we've<00:02:27.519> actually<00:02:27.670> made<00:02:28.530> our

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
difference we've actually made our

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.910 
difference we've actually made our
initial<00:02:29.799> treatment<00:02:30.370> really<00:02:30.579> revolved<00:02:31.180> around

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
initial treatment really revolved around

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.619 
initial treatment really revolved around
keeping<00:02:32.920> him<00:02:33.040> on<00:02:33.159> an<00:02:33.280> intravenous<00:02:33.879> drip<00:02:34.150> with

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
keeping him on an intravenous drip with

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.930 
keeping him on an intravenous drip with
various<00:02:35.079> additives<00:02:35.379> and<00:02:35.709> drugs<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.220> try<00:02:36.760> and

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
various additives and drugs to try and

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.660 
various additives and drugs to try and
correct<00:02:37.299> the<00:02:37.480> problems<00:02:37.870> with<00:02:38.019> his<00:02:38.140> blood<00:02:38.670> to

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
correct the problems with his blood to

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.339 
correct the problems with his blood to
get<00:02:39.940> some<00:02:40.120> more<00:02:40.209> albumin<00:02:40.750> into<00:02:40.989> him<00:02:41.109> he<00:02:41.230> was

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
get some more albumin into him he was

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.979 
get some more albumin into him he was
very<00:02:41.530> hypoalbuminemia<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:43.450> very<00:02:43.629> low<00:02:43.840> in

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
very hypoalbuminemia so very low in

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.280 
very hypoalbuminemia so very low in
albumin<00:02:44.379> and<00:02:44.519> also<00:02:45.519> to<00:02:45.579> try<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.390> make<00:02:47.109> him

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
albumin and also to try and make him

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.050 
albumin and also to try and make him
feel<00:02:47.530> well<00:02:47.859> enough<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.430> he<00:02:48.579> would<00:02:48.700> actually

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
feel well enough that he would actually

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.420 
feel well enough that he would actually
start<00:02:49.359> to<00:02:49.540> eat<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:50.099> significant<00:02:51.099> amount<00:02:51.280> of

still a little early to say I'm still

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.710 
still a little early to say I'm still
quite<00:02:59.950> concerned<00:03:00.340> about<00:03:00.639> him<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.000> it<00:03:01.480> very

initial<00:03:09.540> critical<00:03:10.540> first<00:03:10.900> week<00:03:11.260> we<00:03:11.889> then

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
initial critical first week we then

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.270 
initial critical first week we then
concentrated<00:03:13.000> on<00:03:13.569> his<00:03:14.170> other<00:03:14.349> problems<00:03:15.010> like

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
concentrated on his other problems like

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.610 
concentrated on his other problems like
the<00:03:15.819> penile<00:03:16.359> paralysis<00:03:17.019> and<00:03:17.200> dealing<00:03:17.500> with

the penile paralysis and dealing with

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.460 
the penile paralysis and dealing with
that<00:03:17.769> and<00:03:17.980> then<00:03:18.459> later<00:03:18.699> on<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.660> main<00:03:20.049> thrust

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
that and then later on the main thrust

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.159 
that and then later on the main thrust
of<00:03:20.590> our<00:03:20.680> treatment<00:03:21.190> was<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.760> try<00:03:22.599> and<00:03:22.629> get<00:03:22.989> him

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169 
of our treatment was to try and get him

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.439 
of our treatment was to try and get him
to<00:03:23.199> eat<00:03:23.790> relatively<00:03:24.790> speaking<00:03:25.030> a<00:03:25.269> high

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:25.449 
to eat relatively speaking a high

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:27.449 
to eat relatively speaking a high
calorie<00:03:25.810> high<00:03:26.019> protein<00:03:26.590> diet<00:03:26.889> that<00:03:27.160> was<00:03:27.250> easy

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
calorie high protein diet that was easy

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.699 
calorie high protein diet that was easy
for<00:03:27.609> him<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:27.879> digest<00:03:28.359> and<00:03:28.540> therefore<00:03:28.930> made<00:03:29.560> it

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
for him to digest and therefore made it

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.860 
for him to digest and therefore made it
as<00:03:29.949> easy<00:03:30.069> as<00:03:30.280> possible<00:03:30.549> for<00:03:30.819> him<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.690> get

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
as easy as possible for him to to get

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.319 
as easy as possible for him to to get
his<00:03:31.959> weight<00:03:32.169> up<00:03:32.379> to<00:03:32.560> a<00:03:32.590> correct<00:03:32.859> level<00:03:33.160> so<00:03:34.000> in

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
his weight up to a correct level so in

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.839 
his weight up to a correct level so in
essence<00:03:34.720> after<00:03:35.109> the<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.919> sort<00:03:36.400> of<00:03:36.430> critical
