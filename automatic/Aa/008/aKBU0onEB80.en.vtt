00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
ops for this but you know i'm probably

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.679 
ops for this but you know i'm probably
not<00:01:59.610> going<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.880> talk<00:02:00.060> too<00:02:00.090> much<00:02:00.360> about<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
not going to talk too much about the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.389 
not going to talk too much about the
gameplay<00:02:00.869> unless<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.590> searching<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.130> story

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
gameplay unless it's searching the story

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.530 
gameplay unless it's searching the story
and<00:02:02.520> i<00:02:02.549> can<00:02:02.729> talk<00:02:02.880> about<00:02:03.030> maybe<00:02:03.299> some

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
and i can talk about maybe some

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.249 
and i can talk about maybe some
techniques<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:05.270> hopefully<00:02:06.270> will<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:07.140> know

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
techniques that hopefully will you know

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.430 
techniques that hopefully will you know
kind<00:02:07.710> of

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
kind of

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.370 
kind of
I<00:02:08.670> guess<00:02:09.670> kind<00:02:09.940> of<00:02:10.030> work<00:02:10.210> in<00:02:10.420> black<00:02:10.630> ops<00:02:10.869> I'm

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
I guess kind of work in black ops I'm

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.230 
I guess kind of work in black ops I'm
not<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.800> hundred<00:02:12.040> percent<00:02:12.250> striatum<00:02:12.760> what<00:02:13.150> I'm

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
not a hundred percent striatum what I'm

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.670 
not a hundred percent striatum what I'm
gonna<00:02:13.330> do<00:02:13.570> or<00:02:13.720> if<00:02:13.810> I'm<00:02:13.960> gonna<00:02:14.080> do<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.320> yet<00:02:14.470> but

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
gonna do or if I'm gonna do it yet but

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.070 
gonna do or if I'm gonna do it yet but
that's<00:02:15.040> possibility<00:02:15.790> I've<00:02:16.750> been<00:02:16.900> playing

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
that's possibility I've been playing

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
so easy for me just to play and record

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.350 
so easy for me just to play and record
at<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.570> same<00:02:28.840> time<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:30.100> did<00:02:30.310> yeah<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.180> that's

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
at the same time I did yeah and that's

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.060 
at the same time I did yeah and that's
why<00:02:31.480> I'm<00:02:31.570> doing<00:02:31.600> it<00:02:31.870> i<00:02:32.020> think<00:02:32.080> i<00:02:32.290> have<00:02:32.320> 27

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
why I'm doing it i think i have 27

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.940 
why I'm doing it i think i have 27
episodes<00:02:33.430> already<00:02:33.610> recorded<00:02:34.150> just<00:02:34.300> because

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
episodes already recorded just because

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.830 
episodes already recorded just because
every<00:02:35.950> time<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.220> play<00:02:36.400> you<00:02:36.610> know<00:02:37.060> what's<00:02:37.690> so

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
every time I play you know what's so

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.550 
every time I play you know what's so
hard<00:02:38.050> about<00:02:38.170> me<00:02:38.500> recording<00:02:39.310> my<00:02:39.400> audio<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:40.560> you

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
hard about me recording my audio and you

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.800 
hard about me recording my audio and you
know<00:02:41.650> saying<00:02:42.100> what<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.340> think<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:43.420> know<00:02:43.510> the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
know saying what I think you know the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.480 
know saying what I think you know the
game<00:02:43.990> is<00:02:44.020> so<00:02:44.260> awesome<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:44.920> makes<00:02:45.310> it

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
game is so awesome that it makes it

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.490 
game is so awesome that it makes it
easier<00:02:45.760> for<00:02:45.940> me<00:02:46.030> basically<00:02:46.240> you<00:02:47.050> know<00:02:47.170> and

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
easier for me basically you know and

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.280 
easier for me basically you know and
there<00:02:48.400> is<00:02:48.550> not<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:48.760> standard<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.780> guess<00:02:50.080> for

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
there is not a standard I guess for

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.080 
there is not a standard I guess for
Minecraft<00:02:50.770> like<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.100> can't<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.640> don't<00:02:51.880> have<00:02:51.970> to

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
Minecraft like I can't I don't have to

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.090 
Minecraft like I can't I don't have to
kill<00:02:52.300> so<00:02:52.600> many<00:02:52.660> exploding<00:02:53.290> penises<00:02:53.800> I<00:02:53.950> don't

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
kill so many exploding penises I don't

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.210 
kill so many exploding penises I don't
have<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:55.210> know<00:02:55.330> kill<00:02:56.230> so<00:02:56.410> many<00:02:56.440> pigs<00:02:57.040> I

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
have to you know kill so many pigs I

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.680 
have to you know kill so many pigs I
don't<00:02:57.370> have<00:02:57.460> to<00:02:57.550> dig<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:57.880> many<00:02:58.060> minerals<00:02:58.300> in<00:02:58.630> a

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
don't have to dig so many minerals in a

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.470 
don't have to dig so many minerals in a
certain<00:02:58.870> session<00:02:59.380> or<00:02:59.470> else<00:02:59.560> it's<00:02:59.770> trash<00:03:00.100> I

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
certain session or else it's trash I

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.210 
certain session or else it's trash I
guess<00:03:01.480> so<00:03:02.200> I<00:03:02.230> mean<00:03:02.410> that's<00:03:02.440> why<00:03:02.710> it<00:03:02.770> works<00:03:02.980> and

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
guess so I mean that's why it works and

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.130 
guess so I mean that's why it works and
i<00:03:03.280> love<00:03:03.490> it<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:04.690> that's<00:03:04.840> why<00:03:04.930> i've<00:03:05.020> been

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
i love it so that's why i've been

if you guys would even want to see a
second<00:05:07.990> channel<00:05:08.260> I<00:05:08.320> guess<00:05:08.500> let<00:05:09.160> me<00:05:09.220> know

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
second channel I guess let me know

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:13.260 
second channel I guess let me know
basically<00:05:10.449> what<00:05:10.660> it<00:05:10.720> would<00:05:10.870> do<00:05:11.020> is<00:05:11.229> just<00:05:12.270> stuff

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
basically what it would do is just stuff

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.070 
basically what it would do is just stuff
so<00:05:13.510> my<00:05:14.199> first<00:05:14.440> channel<00:05:14.800> wouldn't<00:05:15.160> get<00:05:15.280> flooded

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
so my first channel wouldn't get flooded

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.570 
so my first channel wouldn't get flooded
because<00:05:17.080> you<00:05:17.410> know<00:05:17.500> like<00:05:17.800> I<00:05:18.070> think<00:05:18.310> it's<00:05:18.430> been
