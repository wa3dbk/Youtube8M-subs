00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.319 
yourself into the ground non-stop and
just<00:03:32.530> like<00:03:32.769> a<00:03:32.799> soldier<00:03:33.189> to<00:03:33.760> get<00:03:33.939> it<00:03:34.060> off<00:03:34.180> the

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
just like a soldier to get it off the

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.539 
just like a soldier to get it off the
ground<00:03:34.409> there's<00:03:35.409> only<00:03:35.590> so<00:03:35.859> long<00:03:35.889> that<00:03:36.280> you<00:03:36.400> can

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
ground there's only so long that you can

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.420 
ground there's only so long that you can
do<00:03:36.669> that<00:03:36.849> so<00:03:37.859> once<00:03:38.859> you<00:03:38.950> get<00:03:39.069> it<00:03:39.189> off<00:03:39.280> the

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
do that so once you get it off the

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.559 
do that so once you get it off the
ground<00:03:39.459> you<00:03:39.760> get<00:03:39.909> the<00:03:40.000> plane<00:03:40.209> off<00:03:40.239> the<00:03:40.450> ground

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
ground you get the plane off the ground

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.140 
ground you get the plane off the ground
just<00:03:41.230> like<00:03:41.319> a<00:03:41.439> shuttle<00:03:41.889> a<00:03:42.010> rocket<00:03:42.310> uses<00:03:42.819> ninety

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
just like a shuttle a rocket uses ninety

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.119 
just like a shuttle a rocket uses ninety
percent<00:03:43.269> of<00:03:43.510> its<00:03:43.629> fuel<00:03:43.930> just<00:03:44.229> getting<00:03:44.650> into

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
percent of its fuel just getting into

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.129 
percent of its fuel just getting into
the<00:03:45.250> stratosphere<00:03:45.489> a<00:03:46.030> plane<00:03:46.479> using<00:03:46.750> so<00:03:46.989> much

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
the stratosphere a plane using so much

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:48.960 
the stratosphere a plane using so much
fuel<00:03:47.470> full<00:03:47.769> speed<00:03:48.069> to<00:03:48.190> get<00:03:48.340> off<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:48.669> runway

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
fuel full speed to get off the runway

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.670 
fuel full speed to get off the runway
but<00:03:49.449> once<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:49.810> get<00:03:49.989> up<00:03:50.169> there<00:03:50.199> and<00:03:50.409> you're

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
but once you get up there and you're

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.219 
but once you get up there and you're
starting<00:03:51.099> to<00:03:51.220> coast<00:03:51.519> a<00:03:51.699> little<00:03:51.970> let<00:03:52.900> off<00:03:53.049> the

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:53.229 
starting to coast a little let off the

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:55.500 
starting to coast a little let off the
gas<00:03:53.260> a<00:03:53.440> little<00:03:53.819> and<00:03:54.819> just<00:03:55.120> get<00:03:55.299> back<00:03:55.479> to

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
gas a little and just get back to

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.479 
gas a little and just get back to
enjoying<00:03:55.780> what<00:03:56.319> you're<00:03:56.439> doing<00:03:56.500> because<00:03:56.859> I
