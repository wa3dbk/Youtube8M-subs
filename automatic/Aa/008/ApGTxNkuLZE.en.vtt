into<00:00:46.840> the<00:00:46.870> assembly<00:00:47.350> line<00:00:47.380> and<00:00:47.740> now<00:00:47.860> it's

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
into the assembly line and now it's

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.650 
into the assembly line and now it's
benefit<00:00:48.580> of<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:48.730> consumer<00:00:49.180> all<00:00:49.360> our<00:00:49.480> hard
