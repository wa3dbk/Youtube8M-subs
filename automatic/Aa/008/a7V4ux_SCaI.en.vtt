00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.259
 new video we are here in a mini 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.759
 game that the blond source has created as 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.839
 I always say you have the channels of 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.490
 all the description in case you want 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.139
 take a look and today I will apply you 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.790
 I will explain what it is worth 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.679
 you are seeing the red team that is 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.509
 composed by valle elías and sophie 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.580
 against the yellow team that is 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.710
 composed of blond by bussi per bullet 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.330
 ok I'm going to take a helicopter and I'm going 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.710
 to explain now you are seeing that 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.660
 in front of you you have a ramp not 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.820
 you know if it's worth it then you have to try 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.090
 catch the one from where you are with all the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.560
 possible speed 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:38.780
 where are you start and go to the ramp 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.780
 it's worth little by little 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.879
 third 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.879
 the river 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.870
 it's a football game a team is 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.280
 on one side and the other on another and it consists 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.320
 in which with the cars you have to mark 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.180
 valuable goal and you go down the ramp is 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.040
 a goal so one has to defend 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.500
 and the others attack and if the rasp is like that 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.030
 álex and I will do while the goal but 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.500
 there will be someone defending it and the others 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.180
 attacking so you can doing 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.220
 strategy of how you are going to organize 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.940
 in the red team then we will be 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.890
 me or I part ship vale and valley diaz van 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.660
 to attack I guess I got a thing that I 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.369
 I forgot the red team when it fell and 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.229
 I could only climb up the ramp worth it 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.330
 once your vice you have to go to your 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.920
 field and one of your field you can already 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.179
 re- import that there is no car 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.179
 we have slow work 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.780
 shit 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.869
 all right 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.760

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.630
 free red team 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.520
 death teams 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.180
 remember you have to come back to be able 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.660
 hit goal 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.660
 we have a goalkeeper 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.260
 when he gets the goal you're telling me 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.260
 do not 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.290
 I have not seen it and it has been first so 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.790
 that counts the first goal so it goes 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.530
 winning the yellow team and reaching 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.600
 three goals the first one wins 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.600
 separated from the party three when you want 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.510
 often sofitu stand sideways here between 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.510

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.040

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.760

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.760
 shoves 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:10.770

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.480
 that you are going to play diego too 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.370

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.780

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.280

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.769
 3 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:57.979
 with a goal in the gaunas 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:04.249

 in winning has been the yellow and the 

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:53.149
