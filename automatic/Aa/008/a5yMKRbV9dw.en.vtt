00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
motor mount which i think is pretty

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.990 
motor mount which i think is pretty
inadequate<00:00:09.139> and<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.469> Skywalker<00:00:10.950> what<00:00:11.849> they

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
inadequate and the Skywalker what they

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.560 
inadequate and the Skywalker what they
want<00:00:12.269> you<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.480> do<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:13.620> use<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.849> single<00:00:15.299> piece

here now that this end this ripped apart

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.550 
here now that this end this ripped apart
Skywalker<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.600> not<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> result<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.350> crash

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560

all we had all it was keeping this the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.070 
all we had all it was keeping this the
motor<00:02:16.380> in<00:02:16.620> was<00:02:17.400> this<00:02:17.580> bit<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:18.030> styrofoam<00:02:18.510> here

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
motor in was this bit of styrofoam here

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.880 
motor in was this bit of styrofoam here
and<00:02:19.260> here<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:20.880> glue<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.440> use<00:02:22.710> I<00:02:22.740> think

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
and here the the glue that I use I think

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.880 
and here the the glue that I use I think
I<00:02:23.070> used<00:02:23.280> epoxy<00:02:23.900> along<00:02:24.900> here<00:02:25.200> didn't<00:02:25.710> really

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
I used epoxy along here didn't really

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.450 
I used epoxy along here didn't really
hold<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.220> in<00:02:26.370> too<00:02:26.580> well<00:02:27.110> so<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.340> wanted<00:02:29.340> a

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
hold it in too well so I wanted a

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.910 
hold it in too well so I wanted a
further<00:02:29.700> improvement<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.570> that<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.440> am

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
further improvement in that I am

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.580 
further improvement in that I am
continuing<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:32.820> approach<00:02:33.270> with<00:02:33.960> my<00:02:34.200> second

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
continuing this approach with my second

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.450 
continuing this approach with my second
Skywalker<00:02:35.100> here<00:02:35.990> and<00:02:36.990> I<00:02:37.680> will<00:02:37.950> take<00:02:38.220> this

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
Skywalker here and I will take this

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:49.430 
Skywalker here and I will take this
apart<00:02:44.990> to<00:02:45.990> I<00:02:47.090> will<00:02:48.090> use<00:02:48.330> this<00:02:48.630> piece<00:02:48.900> as<00:02:49.200> a

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
apart to I will use this piece as a

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.270 
apart to I will use this piece as a
filler<00:02:50.570> as<00:02:51.570> they<00:02:51.900> as<00:02:52.530> they<00:02:52.740> want<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.280> do

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
filler as they as they want you to do

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.300 
filler as they as they want you to do
and<00:02:58.550> but<00:02:59.550> I<00:02:59.880> cut<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.420> notch<00:03:00.690> here<00:03:01.590> on<00:03:01.830> both<00:03:02.010> sides

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
and but I cut a notch here on both sides

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:11.510 
and but I cut a notch here on both sides
of<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.060> fuselage<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:06.230> fit<00:03:08.600> these<00:03:10.220> these<00:03:11.220> which

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
of the fuselage to fit these these which

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.820 
of the fuselage to fit these these which
I<00:03:11.670> cut<00:03:11.910> out<00:03:11.940> how<00:03:12.570> do<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.750> cut<00:03:12.990> out<00:03:13.140> pieces<00:03:13.680> of

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
I cut out how do you cut out pieces of

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:22.760 
I cut out how do you cut out pieces of
wood<00:03:14.130> like<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.660> well<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:18.200> use<00:03:21.230> my<00:03:22.230> handy<00:03:22.739> dandy

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
wood like that well I use my handy dandy

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.560 
wood like that well I use my handy dandy
mill<00:03:23.400> walking<00:03:23.850> pole<00:03:24.420> saw<00:03:26.239> two<00:03:27.239> and<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.420> half

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
mill walking pole saw two and a half

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.660 
mill walking pole saw two and a half
inch<00:03:27.870> could<00:03:28.860> have<00:03:28.950> been<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.070> little<00:03:29.340> bit<00:03:29.459> bigger

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
inch could have been a little bit bigger

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:36.520 
inch could have been a little bit bigger
to<00:03:29.820> fit<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.239> but<00:03:33.980> put<00:03:34.980> this<00:03:35.100> in<00:03:35.280> your<00:03:35.400> drill<00:03:35.700> and

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
to fit it but put this in your drill and

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.580 
to fit it but put this in your drill and
you<00:03:37.530> can<00:03:37.739> drill<00:03:37.980> out<00:03:38.160> nice<00:03:39.320> circular<00:03:40.320> pieces

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
you can drill out nice circular pieces

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.160 
you can drill out nice circular pieces
of<00:03:40.860> wood<00:03:41.100> I<00:03:41.310> used<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.850> say<00:03:42.270> three<00:03:42.510> inch<00:03:42.900> plywood

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
of wood I used to say three inch plywood

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:54.770 
of wood I used to say three inch plywood
and<00:03:46.489> then<00:03:47.489> you<00:03:47.640> have<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.850> sand<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.180> down<00:03:53.780> so

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
and then you have to sand it down so

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.380 
and then you have to sand it down so
that's<00:03:55.410> how<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.650> three<00:03:56.459> inch<00:03:56.850> pieces<00:03:57.120> of

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
that's how a three inch pieces of

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.100 
that's how a three inch pieces of
plywood<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.200> fit<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.650> right<00:03:58.800> size<00:03:59.070> I<00:03:59.370> did<00:03:59.880> I<00:04:00.510> am

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
plywood to fit the right size I did I am

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.660 
plywood to fit the right size I did I am
the<00:04:01.290> on<00:04:01.590> this<00:04:01.920> one<00:04:02.220> which<00:04:02.459> goes<00:04:02.670> inside<00:04:02.970> I

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
the on this one which goes inside I

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.550 
the on this one which goes inside I
didn't<00:04:05.670> make<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:06.060> perfect<00:04:06.630> circle<00:04:07.080> I<00:04:07.200> cut<00:04:07.440> it

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
didn't make a perfect circle I cut it

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.710 
didn't make a perfect circle I cut it
near<00:04:07.770> the<00:04:07.800> edge<00:04:08.100> leaving<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:09.150> small<00:04:09.450> amount

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
near the edge leaving a small amount

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.280 
near the edge leaving a small amount
because<00:04:10.110> I<00:04:10.230> wanted<00:04:10.920> to<00:04:11.010> have<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:12.200> wanted<00:04:13.200> to

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
because I wanted to have I wanted to

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.099 
because I wanted to have I wanted to
have<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:13.890> did<00:04:14.070> not<00:04:14.100> want<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:15.090> bottom<00:04:15.540> of<00:04:18.109> the

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
have I did not want the bottom of the

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.640 
have I did not want the bottom of the
piece<00:04:19.320> of<00:04:19.350> wood<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:20.370> extend<00:04:20.820> into<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:22.350> slot

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
piece of wood to extend into the slot

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.969 
piece of wood to extend into the slot
where<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.479> motor<00:04:24.479> wires<00:04:24.750> had<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.169> go<00:04:25.320> so<00:04:25.620> I<00:04:25.650> I

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
where the motor wires had to go so I I

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.550 
where the motor wires had to go so I I
cut<00:04:26.460> that<00:04:26.550> off<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:26.760> little<00:04:26.970> bit

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
cut that off a little bit

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.100 
cut that off a little bit
I<00:04:27.650> cut<00:04:28.190> it<00:04:28.280> off<00:04:28.370> at<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.550> edge<00:04:28.820> so<00:04:29.690> that<00:04:29.840> part

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
I cut it off at the edge so that part

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.860 
I cut it off at the edge so that part
was<00:04:30.230> flat<00:04:30.580> and<00:04:31.580> it<00:04:31.700> will<00:04:31.790> go<00:04:31.880> in<00:04:32.060> like<00:04:32.270> this<00:04:32.540> and

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
was flat and it will go in like this and

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.810 
was flat and it will go in like this and
I'll<00:04:33.470> do<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:33.710> same<00:04:33.889> thing<00:04:34.160> as<00:04:34.370> I<00:04:34.460> did<00:04:34.490> before

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
I'll do the same thing as I did before

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.790 
I'll do the same thing as I did before
but<00:04:35.210> now<00:04:35.360> there's<00:04:35.540> now<00:04:36.080> what<00:04:36.260> about<00:04:36.350> the<00:04:36.650> whole

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
but now there's now what about the whole

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.150 
but now there's now what about the whole
thing<00:04:37.070> of<00:04:37.220> ripping<00:04:37.610> out<00:04:37.790> well<00:04:39.040> where<00:04:40.040> this

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
thing of ripping out well where this

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.890 
thing of ripping out well where this
just<00:04:40.460> ripped<00:04:40.760> away<00:04:40.880> even<00:04:41.389> though<00:04:41.480> I<00:04:41.510> had<00:04:41.750> all

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
just ripped away even though I had all

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.710 
just ripped away even though I had all
this<00:04:42.080> stuff<00:04:42.260> I<00:04:43.120> had<00:04:44.120> a<00:04:44.150> little<00:04:44.330> bit<00:04:44.510> more

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
this stuff I had a little bit more

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.909 
this stuff I had a little bit more
strength<00:04:45.080> and<00:04:45.380> I<00:04:45.919> I<00:04:46.310> drilled<00:04:47.090> a<00:04:47.360> hole<00:04:47.919> down

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
strength and I I drilled a hole down

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.570 
strength and I I drilled a hole down
through<00:04:48.950> here<00:04:49.820> and<00:04:50.830> extended<00:04:51.830> it<00:04:51.950> down

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
through here and extended it down

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.940 
through here and extended it down
you<00:04:53.240> came<00:04:53.480> came<00:04:53.810> out<00:04:53.990> about<00:04:54.139> here<00:04:54.470> I<00:04:54.530> had<00:04:54.770> to

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
you came came out about here I had to

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.129 
you came came out about here I had to
actually<00:04:55.460> have<00:04:55.820> the<00:04:55.940> trimness<00:04:56.270> with<00:04:56.690> a<00:04:56.720> an

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
actually have the trimness with a an

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.340 
actually have the trimness with a an
exacto<00:04:58.090> the<00:04:59.090> angle<00:04:59.450> was<00:04:59.570> such<00:04:59.780> it<00:04:59.930> came<00:05:00.169> out

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
exacto the angle was such it came out

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.530 
exacto the angle was such it came out
but<00:05:00.530> that's<00:05:00.680> okay<00:05:01.100> I<00:05:01.370> wanted<00:05:02.180> to<00:05:02.240> be<00:05:02.330> able<00:05:02.389> to

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
but that's okay I wanted to be able to

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.360 
but that's okay I wanted to be able to
get<00:05:02.690> it<00:05:02.840> be<00:05:03.139> able<00:05:03.200> to<00:05:03.290> put<00:05:03.500> glue<00:05:03.740> in<00:05:03.770> this<00:05:04.070> in

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
get it be able to put glue in this in

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.700 
get it be able to put glue in this in
this<00:05:04.520> slot<00:05:05.150> anyway<00:05:05.680> and<00:05:06.680> I<00:05:07.040> used<00:05:07.490> a<00:05:08.500> piece<00:05:09.500> of

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
this slot anyway and I used a piece of

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.240 
this slot anyway and I used a piece of
carbon<00:05:09.950> rod<00:05:10.310> cut<00:05:11.120> to<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.360> right<00:05:11.510> length<00:05:12.250> and

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
carbon rod cut to the right length and

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.040 
carbon rod cut to the right length and
then<00:05:13.370> I<00:05:13.780> glued<00:05:14.780> it<00:05:14.930> down<00:05:14.960> in<00:05:15.470> and<00:05:16.300> and<00:05:17.300> actually

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
then I glued it down in and and actually

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.200 
then I glued it down in and and actually
I<00:05:18.260> used<00:05:18.530> two<00:05:18.710> types<00:05:18.979> of<00:05:19.220> glue<00:05:19.520> I<00:05:19.729> used<00:05:19.940> hot<00:05:20.150> glue

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
I used two types of glue I used hot glue

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.969 
I used two types of glue I used hot glue
at<00:05:20.510> the<00:05:20.540> bottom<00:05:20.660> where<00:05:21.260> I<00:05:21.290> could<00:05:21.500> use<00:05:21.530> it<00:05:21.860> to

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
at the bottom where I could use it to

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:27.450 
at the bottom where I could use it to
build<00:05:22.220> up<00:05:23.560> where<00:05:24.560> it's<00:05:24.740> or<00:05:25.280> when<00:05:25.910> it<00:05:26.000> was<00:05:26.150> some

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
build up where it's or when it was some

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.140 
build up where it's or when it was some
cutaway<00:05:28.460> and<00:05:29.560> epoxy<00:05:30.560> at<00:05:30.919> the<00:05:31.040> top<00:05:31.280> five<00:05:31.820> minute

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
cutaway and epoxy at the top five minute

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.490 
cutaway and epoxy at the top five minute
epoxy<00:05:33.940> hot<00:05:34.940> hard<00:05:35.330> to<00:05:35.479> get<00:05:35.630> hard<00:05:35.960> to<00:05:36.169> get<00:05:36.289> hot

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
epoxy hot hard to get hard to get hot

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.960 
epoxy hot hard to get hard to get hot
glue<00:05:36.800> down<00:05:37.070> in<00:05:37.940> here<00:05:38.479> also<00:05:39.070> if<00:05:40.070> I<00:05:40.550> used<00:05:40.760> hot

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
glue down in here also if I used hot

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.940 
glue down in here also if I used hot
glue<00:05:41.030> for<00:05:41.390> the<00:05:41.450> whole<00:05:41.630> thing<00:05:42.080> I<00:05:42.350> discovered

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
glue for the whole thing I discovered

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.770 
glue for the whole thing I discovered
the<00:05:43.310> hot<00:05:43.460> glue<00:05:43.669> would<00:05:43.820> start<00:05:44.090> to<00:05:44.270> congeal

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
the hot glue would start to congeal

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.100 
the hot glue would start to congeal
before<00:05:46.240> and<00:05:47.240> before<00:05:47.600> I<00:05:47.660> can<00:05:47.720> get<00:05:47.840> it<00:05:47.930> all<00:05:48.020> the

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
before and before I can get it all the

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.430 
before and before I can get it all the
way<00:05:48.229> in<00:05:48.470> so<00:05:48.910> I've<00:05:49.910> put<00:05:50.210> them<00:05:50.479> these<00:05:50.840> rods<00:05:51.200> on

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
way in so I've put them these rods on

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.960 
way in so I've put them these rods on
both<00:05:51.680> halves<00:05:55.450> here's<00:05:56.450> the<00:05:56.600> other<00:05:56.720> half<00:05:56.810> and

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
both halves here's the other half and

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:04.210 
both halves here's the other half and
here's<00:05:58.970> the<00:05:59.180> rod<00:05:59.440> there<00:06:00.440> and<00:06:01.840> also<00:06:02.840> cut<00:06:03.770> away<00:06:03.979> a

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
here's the rod there and also cut away a

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.850 
here's the rod there and also cut away a
little<00:06:04.430> bit<00:06:04.550> sliced<00:06:05.240> it<00:06:05.450> so<00:06:05.600> I<00:06:05.660> could<00:06:05.900> put<00:06:06.620> glue

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
little bit sliced it so I could put glue

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.400 
little bit sliced it so I could put glue
in<00:06:07.039> here<00:06:07.250> and<00:06:07.400> hold<00:06:07.639> it<00:06:07.760> in<00:06:07.940> so<00:06:08.120> we'll<00:06:09.110> see<00:06:09.289> if

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
in here and hold it in so we'll see if

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.379 
in here and hold it in so we'll see if
that<00:06:09.470> adds<00:06:10.160> more<00:06:10.400> strength<00:06:10.910> of<00:06:11.000> course<00:06:11.210> the

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
that adds more strength of course the

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.240 
that adds more strength of course the
best<00:06:11.539> solution<00:06:12.050> is<00:06:12.169> just<00:06:12.200> not<00:06:12.560> to<00:06:12.680> crash<00:06:12.919> into

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
best solution is just not to crash into

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.730 
best solution is just not to crash into
trees<00:06:13.280> and<00:06:13.970> that<00:06:14.600> will<00:06:14.780> be<00:06:14.900> my<00:06:15.110> plan<00:06:15.380> for<00:06:15.680> my

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
trees and that will be my plan for my

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.240 
trees and that will be my plan for my
second<00:06:16.220> Skywalker<00:06:16.669> I<00:06:17.919> spent<00:06:18.919> too<00:06:19.039> much<00:06:19.190> time

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
second Skywalker I spent too much time

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.000 
second Skywalker I spent too much time
on<00:06:19.669> the<00:06:19.760> paint<00:06:19.970> job<00:06:20.090> and<00:06:20.539> on<00:06:21.289> everything<00:06:21.710> else

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010 
on the paint job and on everything else

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.219 
on the paint job and on everything else
to<00:06:22.400> crash<00:06:22.610> it<00:06:22.850> so<00:06:23.030> I<00:06:23.240> think<00:06:23.720> I'm<00:06:23.840> not<00:06:24.020> going<00:06:24.169> to

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:24.229 
to crash it so I think I'm not going to

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:28.450 
to crash it so I think I'm not going to
crash<00:06:24.440> anymore<00:06:26.620> but<00:06:27.620> anyway<00:06:27.950> that's<00:06:28.160> what

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
crash anymore but anyway that's what

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.129 
crash anymore but anyway that's what
I've<00:06:28.610> done<00:06:28.850> for<00:06:29.090> my<00:06:29.210> motor<00:06:29.450> mounting<00:06:29.990> to

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:30.139 
I've done for my motor mounting to

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:32.740 
I've done for my motor mounting to
strengthen<00:06:30.620> it
