00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.340
 this program what 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:20.090
 apologize because the doctor 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:22.790
 connects mind when I did so 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.700
 the literal tree doctor but then 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.920
 that we see that I am the trunk the case 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.530
 in my branch and where also branch are 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.470
 the roots of the tree are also 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:37.100
 educating the country literally 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.510
 as far as the arms reach or that already 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.520
 is here without getting to branch up here 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.070
 you have what is theoretically here 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.900
 the root and if you have a tree stuck 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.290
 from your house that are breaking the house to 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.290
 the root 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.770
 applause yet 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.770
 apparent position 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.559
 noticed that there are trees that have 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.969
 infinity the trunk and very very large and 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.280
 then how do you start on the side 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.869
 any really when this sows 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.240
 of trees for example here we have the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.729
 ning tree that is one the pharmacy of 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.190
 village then this tree mainly 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.740
 has columnar roots that go towards 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.750
 down does not have radical roots but that 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.409
 is what happens errors with trees 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.929
 the trees are 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.840
 and the oldest living beings of the 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.189
 planet was first with us and 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.829
 therefore we have to 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.929
 learn to manage them and to maintain and 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.759
 how we do it by forming them when 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:37.579
 you plant a tree you are not planting 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:41.240
 used a stick a broom but really 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:43.520
 this scolding because he watches over to plant here 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.319
 we have then this something have to 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.420
 this play because it also helps you 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.459
 avoid the problem of erosion but 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.679
 at the same time it has properties and 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:54.110
 medicinal active ingredients that 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.969
 also works with diabetes with 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.700
 cancer now is not how I explain 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.709
 always they are not magic but you have 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.369
 to do a series of treatments for 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:05.620
 be able to improve and mitigate their problems 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.500
 so, we have 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.640
 when you were always something 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.600
 mainly these mahogany trees 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.580
 come from guava that you have to very 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.190
 it's not like I'm always on something and you're going 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.260
 for the television station but that 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.330
 when you will not sow in your 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.040
 urbanization that by the way is good 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.140
 for your organization because in your 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.940
 organization they demand that you always 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.880
 cicus to put it to see correct 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.570
 then the best something to see the same 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:42.940
 because it does not have radical roots because 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:46.690
 it is correct to cut right but 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.340
 the root is a lot and fat so this 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.890
 will be a correct alternative is a 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.570
 alternative and for more than you can 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.970
 come I do not mean that the 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.570
 roots are not going to stretch we're going to continue 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.610
 growing 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.130
 You can do something, you can put it to two 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.000
 inches rather to 210 and those roots 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.530
 they will grow up to 45 feet but as 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.050
 plant these when they have the 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.210
 knowledge science or consciousness 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.380
 a establish that this has to be 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.880
 living that is dead 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.420
 because it has portrayed a version of 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.010
 Indian football took pictures of the trees and 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.560
 has energy united energy 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.200
 complete in white red and yellow 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.440
 all colors is documented in the 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.840
 book beyond sowing the love 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.270
 it's also structural you have to go 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.860
 carrying that why that's how it has a 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.650
 training pruning a training pruning 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.530
 is to eliminate me for example here all 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.540
 these little plants that you have down 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.090
 then you go up general you go up 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.220
 then if the work is extinguished cultivate 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.140
 the side pola so that it does not reach your 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.480
 house then you also have the form of 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.910
 lowering the cup it is important to lower the 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.710
 33 percent drink without permission 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.660
 department of natural resources you do not 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.360
 you can do when in a tree larger than 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.100
 age or go in the pruning of thinnings that 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.200
 is to remove some of the branches that are not 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.330
 they go with the art therefore either here 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.580
 has a charge that is not forming what are you going 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.110
 developing and then that something does not 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.490
 have problems in your house right now 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.140
 this has a practically balance 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.060
 perfect because on the sides is 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.470
 asymmetric 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.000
 where does it start to grow 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.440
 you can not help them stay well 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.240
 a little the rights are put a 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.820
 tutor a tutor is a stick that is 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.980
 puts more and binds it with pear but in 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.990
 this case this is a workshop that I'm going to 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.170
 do on the stones next Sunday 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.660
 May 19 9 in the morning this is in the 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.640
 road number 32 and how does it explain all 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.200
 these details of the different trees 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.390
 how to sow what is delivered as 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.110
 have it in an apartment in condominiums 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:51.110
 the deer and also how to produce the 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:52.100
 leaves but this is no longer used two 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.900
 daily hours 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.750
 are equivalent to one thousand milligrams and this 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.550
 helps to lower the rise by 50% and is 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.680
 approved with the doctor young with green 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.440
 who is the president of the foundation of 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.550
 same 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:16.980
 'There we have also 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:18.870
 this is that the soap 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:22.140
 we do it with our friend who is 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.350
 here also the friend maricel maricel yo 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:28.920
 I get the leaves or angela data is done 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:31.530
 with cocoa cream with flax oil 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.270
 olive oil as the recopa and fine 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.610
 for de matip and for a series of 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.920
 problems that acne has all that 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.450
 kind of things that you have of the skin then 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.490
 I can use it because this tree has 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.250
 properties and active principles that 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.710
 they have to do with raw antivirus like 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.510
 antibacterial anticancer fungi 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.210
 everything is all the wonder that another tree 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.340
 is the new moringa's cousin this year 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.350
 the wine also from india endemic to 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.870
 the girl but 100 years ago mistakes that 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.430
 is involved risk from here that's why 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.920
 is reactive here you can already then 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.500
 These anti anti virus anti virus 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.330
 anti cancer bacteria when I chew it 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.180
 so in this way I'm eating it 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.130
 then the reaction federica a problem 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.000
 that people have in the sale 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.950
 now 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.260
 content is good because we sow 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.820
 brings up to date of many things that one does not 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.010
 is used in life the second that 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.870
 have to move the 4th case is that that 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.000
 attitude also serves as an insecticide 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.980
 with a fungicide as a nuance and that 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.440
 people who have problems with the 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.390
 in the house with the insects they can 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.640
 make an insecticide of these from this 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.470
 tree and can advertise and 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.570
 besides that if they have arthritis that you 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.160
 you do not have it but you can take 60 hours 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.100
 of this and put it to a glass of alcohol 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.410
 have 71 or 90 percent alcohol 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.570
 and leave it for an hour and then what are we going 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.550
 to take we are going to make descriptions with 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.230
 that alcohol and that alcohol because it's going to 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.590
 help to some extent because as you 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:56.100
 I also explain having all of my own 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.419
 it even has proteins too 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.880
 magnesium has calcium an amazing thing 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:02.680
 and many of these, well, we have one with 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.140
 everything by torrico growing are made with 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.270
 he can make you can use 10 

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.400
 little eyes 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.039
 and that's me for a rate of 6 are 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:17.910
 healthy yesterday from the sheet 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:17.910
 and then deposited 15 minutes 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.710
 and for people who want to stop 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:23.639
 smoking cigarettes that do not main the 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.460
 people who want to stop smoking 

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:28.349
 cigarette that is what you can do 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.509
 how we apply tablets daily 

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:32.969
 and you to see how you are going to stop smoking 

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:35.969
 because it is a substance that is called 

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:42.950
 measure and this helps you partly to edit 

00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:45.860
 so it uses 

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.720
 I have been surprised every time you 

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.130
 I hear talk this has like two 

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.990
 artists also to keep talking 

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:53.060
 here with you, but we have 

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.350
 rafa ready let's go then to go with 

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.350
 rafa thanks to your work is 

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:59.350
 again with us 

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.350
 I take advantage
