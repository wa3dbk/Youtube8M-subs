00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
she may have small arms but when she

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.560 
she may have small arms but when she
lifts<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.159> up<00:01:44.250> there<00:01:44.520> could<00:01:44.670> be<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.790> lot<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.060> sag

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
lifts it up there could be a lot of sag

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.530 
lifts it up there could be a lot of sag
hanging<00:01:46.229> down<00:01:46.439> that's<00:01:47.040> because<00:01:47.490> gravity<00:01:48.210> over

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
hanging down that's because gravity over

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.990 
hanging down that's because gravity over
time<00:01:48.780> starts<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.380> pull<00:01:49.619> everything<00:01:50.220> down<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
time starts to pull everything down and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.109 
time starts to pull everything down and
you're<00:01:51.720> losing<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.380> muscle<00:01:52.829> mass

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
you're losing that muscle mass

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.460 
you're losing that muscle mass
unfortunately<00:01:54.119> other<00:01:54.390> things<00:01:54.780> start<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.140> sag

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
unfortunately other things start to sag

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.800 
unfortunately other things start to sag

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
exercises that makes all the difference

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.120

I<00:02:35.880> used<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.510> make<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.870> same<00:02:37.140> mistake<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.770> would

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
I used to make the same mistake I would

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.100 
I used to make the same mistake I would
go<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.610> spend<00:02:38.820> hours<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.540> hours<00:02:39.630> at<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.080> gym

go and spend hours and hours at the gym
and<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.860> cardio<00:02:41.280> machines<00:02:41.730> work<00:02:42.060> in<00:02:42.240> my

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
and on the cardio machines work in my

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.140 
and on the cardio machines work in my
butt<00:02:42.690> but<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:43.410> never<00:02:43.740> got<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.490> but<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:44.880> I<00:02:44.910> want

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
butt but I never got the but that I want

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.150 
butt but I never got the but that I want
it<00:02:45.270> in<00:02:45.360> fact<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:45.750> only<00:02:45.780> got<00:02:46.170> worse<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.890> worse

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
it in fact it only got worse and worse

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.180 
it in fact it only got worse and worse
so<00:02:47.760> I<00:02:47.790> started<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.480> think<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.900> wonder<00:02:49.230> why<00:02:49.710> is

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
so I started to think and wonder why is

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.040 
so I started to think and wonder why is
it<00:02:50.340> my<00:02:50.460> bucketing<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.120> any<00:02:51.330> bigger<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:51.870> I

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
it my bucketing and any bigger and I

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.660 
it my bucketing and any bigger and I
started<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.500> really<00:02:52.740> pay<00:02:52.980> attention<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.580> I

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
started to really pay attention and I

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.850 
started to really pay attention and I
noticed<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.360> my<00:02:54.660> legs<00:02:55.020> were<00:02:55.230> getting<00:02:55.470> bigger

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
noticed that my legs were getting bigger

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.010 
noticed that my legs were getting bigger
instead<00:02:56.460> of<00:02:56.580> my<00:02:56.730> butt<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.210> that<00:02:57.690> got<00:02:57.990> me

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
instead of my butt and that got me

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.650 
instead of my butt and that got me
thinking<00:02:58.170> what<00:02:59.070> if<00:02:59.280> i'm<00:02:59.580> actually<00:02:59.910> using<00:03:00.180> my

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
thinking what if i'm actually using my

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.050 
thinking what if i'm actually using my
legs<00:03:00.930> instead<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.590> my<00:03:01.740> butt<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.310> that's<00:03:02.850> how<00:03:03.030> i

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
legs instead of my butt and that's how i

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.810 
legs instead of my butt and that's how i
discovered<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.260> problem<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:05.100> most<00:03:05.340> people

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
discovered the problem that most people

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.090 
discovered the problem that most people
have<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.510> i<00:03:06.690> was<00:03:06.930> having<00:03:07.140> with<00:03:07.620> getting

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
have and that i was having with getting

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.640 
have and that i was having with getting
a<00:03:08.310> great<00:03:08.580> but<00:03:08.820> I<00:03:09.060> was<00:03:09.420> focusing<00:03:09.930> on<00:03:10.110> my<00:03:10.290> legs

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
a great but I was focusing on my legs

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.440 
a great but I was focusing on my legs
and<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.190> can<00:03:11.400> be<00:03:11.520> a<00:03:11.550> really<00:03:11.640> big<00:03:12.210> problem

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
and this can be a really big problem

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.360 
and this can be a really big problem
because<00:03:12.810> as<00:03:13.110> your<00:03:13.260> legs<00:03:13.560> get<00:03:13.770> stronger<00:03:14.160> and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
because as your legs get stronger and

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.580 
because as your legs get stronger and
stronger<00:03:14.640> over<00:03:15.120> time<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.630> start<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.110> use<00:03:16.410> your

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
stronger over time you start to use your

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.460 
stronger over time you start to use your
butt<00:03:16.860> muscles<00:03:17.100> less<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.120> less<00:03:18.540> okay<00:03:19.320> the

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
butt muscles less and less okay the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.530 
butt muscles less and less okay the
first<00:03:19.710> tip<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.280> knowing<00:03:20.670> if<00:03:20.880> you're<00:03:21.090> using

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
first tip to knowing if you're using

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.480 
first tip to knowing if you're using
your<00:03:21.810> butt<00:03:22.050> muscle<00:03:22.410> is<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.740> actually<00:03:22.890> feel<00:03:23.460> it

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
your butt muscle is to actually feel it

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.090 
your butt muscle is to actually feel it
if<00:03:23.880> you're<00:03:24.180> doing<00:03:24.570> a<00:03:24.660> lunch<00:03:24.960> or<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.320> squat<00:03:25.830> and

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
if you're doing a lunch or a squat and

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.890 
if you're doing a lunch or a squat and
you<00:03:26.250> feel<00:03:26.490> it<00:03:26.520> in<00:03:26.730> your<00:03:26.760> legs<00:03:27.180> then<00:03:27.570> guess<00:03:27.810> what

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
you feel it in your legs then guess what

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.810 
you feel it in your legs then guess what
you're<00:03:28.260> not<00:03:28.290> working<00:03:28.830> you're<00:03:28.860> but<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.640> want

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
you're not working you're but you want

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.370 
you're not working you're but you want
to<00:03:29.850> make<00:03:29.970> sure<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.360> can<00:03:30.510> really<00:03:30.810> feel<00:03:30.930> those

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
to make sure you can really feel those

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.040 
to make sure you can really feel those
glute<00:03:31.710> muscles<00:03:32.070> firing<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.790> every<00:03:33.540> time<00:03:33.780> you

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
glute muscles firing and every time you

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.800 
glute muscles firing and every time you
squeeze<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:35.220> come<00:03:35.430> up<00:03:35.610> feel<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.360> in<00:03:36.450> your<00:03:36.570> butt

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
squeeze and come up feel it in your butt

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.750 
squeeze and come up feel it in your butt
most<00:03:37.380> people<00:03:37.680> are<00:03:37.770> only<00:03:37.950> feeling<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.460> in<00:03:38.580> their

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
most people are only feeling it in their

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.310 
most people are only feeling it in their
legs<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.240> that's<00:03:39.480> why<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.720> legs<00:03:40.020> are<00:03:40.230> getting

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
legs and that's why the legs are getting

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.530 
legs and that's why the legs are getting
stronger<00:03:40.740> and<00:03:41.070> stronger<00:03:41.370> over<00:03:41.790> time<00:03:41.820> while

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
stronger and stronger over time while

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.840 
stronger and stronger over time while
the<00:03:42.690> but<00:03:42.930> just<00:03:43.350> get<00:03:43.500> sad<00:03:43.770> here<00:03:44.130> inside<00:03:44.550> year

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
the but just get sad here inside year

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.300 
the but just get sad here inside year
okay<00:03:45.270> so<00:03:45.330> once<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:45.870> made<00:03:46.140> this<00:03:46.320> discovery<00:03:46.770> it

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
okay so once I made this discovery it

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.460 
okay so once I made this discovery it
really<00:03:48.060> started<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:48.450> change<00:03:48.540> things<00:03:49.020> for<00:03:49.170> me

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
really started to change things for me

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.560 
really started to change things for me
but<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:50.130> didn't<00:03:50.580> give<00:03:50.730> me<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:50.850> results<00:03:51.360> that<00:03:51.540> i

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
but it didn't give me the results that i

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.050 
but it didn't give me the results that i
wanted<00:03:52.110> i<00:03:52.260> wanted<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.830> really<00:03:53.100> lift<00:03:53.460> my<00:03:53.640> butt

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
wanted i wanted to really lift my butt

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.480 
wanted i wanted to really lift my butt
and<00:03:54.270> get<00:03:54.960> that<00:03:55.110> round<00:03:55.620> but<00:03:56.010> that<00:03:56.190> i<00:03:56.250> had<00:03:56.340> always

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
and get that round but that i had always

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.640 
and get that round but that i had always
seen<00:03:56.970> on<00:03:57.180> fitness<00:03:57.630> models<00:03:58.050> and<00:03:58.320> in<00:03:58.410> magazines

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
seen on fitness models and in magazines

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.980 
seen on fitness models and in magazines
I<00:03:59.280> believed<00:03:59.880> that<00:03:59.910> I<00:04:00.180> could<00:04:00.210> have<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.600> and<00:04:00.930> I've

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
I believed that I could have it and I've

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.140 
I believed that I could have it and I've
put<00:04:01.350> my<00:04:01.560> attention<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:02.160> focus<00:04:02.370> on<00:04:02.730> how<00:04:02.940> could

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
put my attention and focus on how could

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.450 
put my attention and focus on how could
I<00:04:03.210> get<00:04:03.360> it<00:04:03.480> faster<00:04:04.050> I<00:04:04.260> started<00:04:04.860> realizing<00:04:05.040> okay

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
I get it faster I started realizing okay

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.640 
I get it faster I started realizing okay
if<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.060> focus<00:04:06.330> more<00:04:06.660> on<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.900> but<00:04:07.110> that<00:04:07.320> i<00:04:07.380> am

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
if I focus more on the but that i am

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.140 
if I focus more on the but that i am
going<00:04:07.920> to<00:04:08.010> actually<00:04:08.220> get<00:04:08.610> more<00:04:08.850> from<00:04:09.210> it<00:04:09.390> but

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
going to actually get more from it but

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.470 
going to actually get more from it but
if<00:04:10.269> i<00:04:10.569> were<00:04:10.750> to<00:04:10.989> maximize<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.370> time<00:04:12.610> tension

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
if i were to maximize the time tension

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.839 
if i were to maximize the time tension
on<00:04:13.689> the<00:04:14.260> butt<00:04:14.470> muscle<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.220> that's<00:04:15.640> how<00:04:15.819> I

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
on the butt muscle and that's how I

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.479 
on the butt muscle and that's how I
discovered<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.780> time<00:04:17.079> tension<00:04:17.709> principle<00:04:18.310> is

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
discovered the time tension principle is

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.249 
discovered the time tension principle is
a<00:04:18.549> principle<00:04:18.820> that<00:04:19.419> I<00:04:19.509> accidentally

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:20.259 
a principle that I accidentally

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:22.439 
a principle that I accidentally
discovered<00:04:20.829> where<00:04:21.250> you<00:04:21.370> isolate<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:22.270> butt

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
discovered where you isolate the butt

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.140 
discovered where you isolate the butt
muscles<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.410> don't<00:04:23.800> relax<00:04:24.220> them<00:04:24.610> so<00:04:25.090> you

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
muscles and you don't relax them so you

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.540 
muscles and you don't relax them so you
use<00:04:25.509> more<00:04:25.990> of<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.199> butt<00:04:26.410> muscle<00:04:26.800> in<00:04:26.979> less<00:04:27.250> time

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
use more of the butt muscle in less time

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.999 
use more of the butt muscle in less time
so<00:04:28.090> whenever<00:04:28.479> you're<00:04:28.630> doing<00:04:28.810> a<00:04:29.050> lunge<00:04:29.350> most

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
so whenever you're doing a lunge most

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.760 
so whenever you're doing a lunge most
people<00:04:30.370> would<00:04:30.850> lunge<00:04:31.449> and<00:04:31.900> then<00:04:31.960> step

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
people would lunge and then step

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.830 
people would lunge and then step
together<00:04:32.979> you<00:04:33.550> can<00:04:33.699> tell<00:04:33.880> I'm<00:04:34.090> relaxed<00:04:34.690> right

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
together you can tell I'm relaxed right

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.909 
together you can tell I'm relaxed right
here<00:04:35.169> but<00:04:35.560> what<00:04:35.740> if<00:04:35.860> I<00:04:35.979> were<00:04:36.220> to<00:04:36.280> lunge<00:04:37.240> and

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
here but what if I were to lunge and

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.999 
here but what if I were to lunge and
never<00:04:38.919> take<00:04:39.370> a<00:04:39.400> break<00:04:39.789> you<00:04:40.630> see<00:04:40.840> I'm<00:04:41.009> keeping

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
never take a break you see I'm keeping

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.580 
never take a break you see I'm keeping
those<00:04:42.370> butt<00:04:42.729> muscles<00:04:43.180> contracted<00:04:43.930> and<00:04:44.110> this

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
those butt muscles contracted and this

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.189 
those butt muscles contracted and this
is<00:04:44.800> the<00:04:45.039> time<00:04:45.340> tension<00:04:45.910> principle<00:04:46.449> and<00:04:46.690> it's

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
is the time tension principle and it's

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.830 
is the time tension principle and it's
best<00:04:47.560> I<00:04:47.860> noticed<00:04:48.580> that<00:04:48.669> my<00:04:48.910> butt<00:04:49.180> started<00:04:49.630> to

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
best I noticed that my butt started to

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.320 
best I noticed that my butt started to
lift<00:04:50.110> up<00:04:50.380> as<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:51.130> butt<00:04:51.400> fat<00:04:51.699> started<00:04:52.210> to

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
lift up as the butt fat started to

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.990 
lift up as the butt fat started to
disappear<00:04:53.020> this<00:04:53.470> time<00:04:53.530> tension<00:04:54.370> principle<00:04:54.850> is

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
disappear this time tension principle is

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.529 
disappear this time tension principle is
so<00:04:55.360> simple<00:04:55.750> and<00:04:56.050> it's<00:04:56.470> so<00:04:56.770> easy<00:04:57.070> to<00:04:57.340> do<00:04:57.550> and<00:04:57.789> you

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
so simple and it's so easy to do and you

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.510 
so simple and it's so easy to do and you
get<00:04:58.720> twice<00:04:59.289> the<00:04:59.350> results<00:04:59.979> in<00:05:00.070> half<00:05:00.310> the<00:05:00.490> time

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
get twice the results in half the time

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.700 
get twice the results in half the time
and<00:05:01.000> if<00:05:01.180> you're<00:05:01.330> not<00:05:01.419> ready<00:05:01.690> to<00:05:01.840> do<00:05:01.960> a<00:05:01.990> squat<00:05:02.440> or

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710

a lunge just yet here's another way that

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.540 
a lunge just yet here's another way that
you<00:05:04.900> can<00:05:05.020> experience<00:05:05.590> the<00:05:05.860> time<00:05:06.099> tension

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
you can experience the time tension

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.700 
you can experience the time tension
principle<00:05:07.060> just<00:05:07.510> lift<00:05:07.720> your<00:05:07.810> arms<00:05:08.229> up<00:05:08.349> once

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
principle just lift your arms up once

principle just lift your arms up once
and<00:05:08.979> then<00:05:09.130> lower<00:05:09.340> them<00:05:09.520> down<00:05:09.580> just<00:05:10.330> like<00:05:10.419> a

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
and then lower them down just like a

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.089 
and then lower them down just like a
bird<00:05:10.840> flapping<00:05:11.229> your<00:05:11.530> wings<00:05:11.590> you<00:05:11.979> could

bird flapping your wings you could

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.279 
bird flapping your wings you could
probably<00:05:12.310> do<00:05:12.669> this<00:05:12.849> many<00:05:13.330> many<00:05:13.449> times<00:05:13.690> right

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
probably do this many many times right

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.230 
probably do this many many times right
because<00:05:14.919> you're<00:05:15.130> contracting<00:05:15.789> the<00:05:15.910> muscle

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
because you're contracting the muscle

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.939 
because you're contracting the muscle
and<00:05:16.360> then<00:05:16.510> you're<00:05:16.690> relaxing<00:05:17.169> it<00:05:17.289> contracting

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
and then you're relaxing it contracting

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.520 
and then you're relaxing it contracting
and<00:05:18.130> then<00:05:18.280> relaxing<00:05:18.760> so<00:05:19.180> now<00:05:19.360> do<00:05:19.419> this<00:05:19.810> lift

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
and then relaxing so now do this lift
