00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
innovative whatever they ask the game I

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.789 
innovative whatever they ask the game I
just<00:03:06.239> hope<00:03:06.390> they<00:03:06.540> innovate<00:03:07.019> I<00:03:07.230> know<00:03:07.500> they're

having<00:03:08.099> a<00:03:08.430> new<00:03:08.849> rendering<00:03:09.420> engine<00:03:09.720> which

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
having a new rendering engine which

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.630 
having a new rendering engine which
means<00:03:10.470> probably<00:03:10.650> better<00:03:11.010> graphics<00:03:11.400> for<00:03:11.549> us

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
means probably better graphics for us

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.970 
means probably better graphics for us
but<00:03:12.629> we<00:03:12.780> really<00:03:13.079> haven't<00:03:13.110> had<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.590> breakthrough

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
but we really haven't had a breakthrough

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.509 
but we really haven't had a breakthrough
a<00:03:14.220> feature<00:03:14.430> since<00:03:14.879> probably<00:03:15.739> bra<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:16.920> war<00:03:17.160> to

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519
