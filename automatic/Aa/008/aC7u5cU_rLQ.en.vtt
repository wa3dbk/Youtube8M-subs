was on these first ones at the point on
it<00:00:56.769> like<00:00:57.769> just<00:00:57.949> about<00:00:58.100> every<00:00:58.460> 70s<00:00:58.940> machine<00:01:00.040> so

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
it like just about every 70s machine so

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.210 
it like just about every 70s machine so

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
pilot control it's with the longer

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:00.780 
pilot control it's with the longer
leavers<00:02:54.870> that's<00:02:55.870> not<00:02:56.079> that<00:02:56.230> awful<00:02:59.519> well<00:03:00.519> for

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
leavers that's not that awful well for

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.740 
leavers that's not that awful well for
the<00:03:00.849> modern<00:03:01.060> excavator<00:03:01.659> operator<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.439> I

the modern excavator operator it is I
learned<00:03:04.750> on<00:03:04.900> this<00:03:05.079> kind<00:03:05.319> of<00:03:05.379> stuff<00:03:05.680> link-belt

learned on this kind of stuff link-belt

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.519 
learned on this kind of stuff link-belt
mid-80s<00:03:08.010> it's<00:03:09.010> not<00:03:09.189> too<00:03:09.340> bad
