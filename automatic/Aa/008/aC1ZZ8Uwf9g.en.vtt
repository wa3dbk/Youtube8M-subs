00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello dear viewers and welcome to garden 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.150
 Zero bowl presents 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.150
 prune lavender in spring 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.139
 normally around the end of March 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.269
 mid- April the lavender must 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.840
 be pruned all the way back after it 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.090
 trim in the late summer and autumn 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.400
 the bottom of the bush is good to see 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.869
 then small buttons present that 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.970
 once as a more light in the tailbone 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.680
 comes running out and provide a 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.449
 new plot 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.360
 roughly at fist level, that is 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.390
 about ten and fifteen centimeters the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.710
 leftovers of winter be cut 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.899
 so that the light is good inside the fight 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.430
 can come 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.710
 you can do that like i do here 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.739
 thanks for twig with the secateurs 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.840
 are neatly controlled take away 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.680
 of course you can also do something by hand 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.850
 grab larger breasts and whatever 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.489
 faster 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.199
 take everything back a great way if 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.420
 it for one two or a few plants 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.949
 you have more plants is it 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.149
 maybe easy to get the hedge trimmer 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.519
 to use 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.240
 and as soon as you are more certain of yourself 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.619
 matter 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.939
 and know that you can get the right height 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.350
 determine 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.890
 it goes my too harris go there of course 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.890
 a lot faster 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.830
 they gave us the last picking away 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.759
 becomes the last mess from bush 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.430
 achieved 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.170
 old leaves sometimes make out paper or plastic 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.340
 In the winter months get what has been initiated 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.549
 you well away so the sun and the light 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.170
 well into the fight 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.930
 all the small buttons that are present 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.810
 will definitely grow into one 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.100
 nice compact new shrub and so new 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.560
 shrub you will also in the summer months 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.189
 excellent flowering important do it 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.009
 prune by mid April at the latest 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.009
 the chance of flowering is less in the 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.110
 summer and pruning farther there is 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.770
 of course, possibilities to substantially 10 still 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.770
 cause damage 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.549
 so far thanks for watching and see you soon 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.549
