it kind of flat nice thing about it is
it's<00:05:10.230> pretty<00:05:10.500> transparent<00:05:11.340> off<00:05:11.960> on

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.570 

not<00:05:16.140> too<00:05:16.320> much<00:05:16.440> so<00:05:16.500> what<00:05:16.920> I<00:05:16.950> usually<00:05:17.160> do<00:05:17.430> is<00:05:17.460> I

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
not too much so what I usually do is I

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.030 
not too much so what I usually do is I
usually<00:05:17.880> lead<00:05:18.030> with<00:05:18.180> a<00:05:18.210> little<00:05:18.420> extra<00:05:18.660> game

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
usually lead with a little extra game

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:30.380 
usually lead with a little extra game
touch<00:05:20.040> extra<00:05:20.310> base<00:05:20.580> and<00:05:21.330> some<00:05:21.540> volumes<00:05:29.390> yeah

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
touch extra base and some volumes yeah

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.880 
touch extra base and some volumes yeah
it's<00:05:30.510> like<00:05:30.600> it<00:05:30.720> my<00:05:30.870> lead<00:05:31.380> sound<00:05:31.710> no<00:05:31.860> matter

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
it's like it my lead sound no matter

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.090 
it's like it my lead sound no matter
what<00:05:32.250> so<00:05:32.790> when<00:05:32.910> I'm<00:05:33.000> using<00:05:33.180> on<00:05:33.390> top<00:05:33.570> of<00:05:33.750> it<00:05:34.100> this

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
what so when I'm using on top of it this

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.280 
what so when I'm using on top of it this
is<00:05:35.280> a<00:05:35.310> confidence<00:05:36.270> booster<00:05:36.660> from<00:05:36.870> build<00:05:37.140> your

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
is a confidence booster from build your

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.270 
is a confidence booster from build your
own<00:05:37.350> clone<00:05:37.680> that<00:05:37.950> I<00:05:38.060> put<00:05:39.060> in<00:05:39.210> a<00:05:39.270> box<00:05:39.450> I<00:05:40.130> just<00:05:41.130> got

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
own clone that I put in a box I just got

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:59.260 
own clone that I put in a box I just got
one<00:05:41.460> knob<00:05:41.640> which<00:05:41.850> is<00:05:41.970> volume<00:05:42.870> or<00:05:43.020> boost

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:08.389 

it's<00:06:00.270> not<00:06:00.419> super<00:06:00.869> clean<00:06:06.949> that's<00:06:07.949> kind<00:06:08.189> of<00:06:08.219> cool

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:08.399 
it's not super clean that's kind of cool

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:28.100 
it's not super clean that's kind of cool
it's<00:06:09.210> more<00:06:09.330> like<00:06:09.389> treble<00:06:09.899> booster<00:06:26.930> it<00:06:27.930> just

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
it's more like treble booster it just

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.899 
it's more like treble booster it just
turned<00:06:28.349> this<00:06:28.589> more<00:06:29.009> volume<00:06:29.369> it's<00:06:29.550> got<00:06:29.699> a<00:06:29.729> lot

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:29.909 
turned this more volume it's got a lot

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:35.469 
turned this more volume it's got a lot
of<00:06:29.969> headroom

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:39.159 

deafeningly<00:06:36.479> loud<00:06:36.570> yeah<00:06:37.410> pedal<00:06:38.130> comparison

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 
deafeningly loud yeah pedal comparison

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.800 
deafeningly loud yeah pedal comparison
that's<00:06:40.169> the<00:06:40.970> forum<00:06:41.970> build<00:06:42.180> we<00:06:42.300> did<00:06:42.449> the<00:06:42.600> mark

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 
that's the forum build we did the mark

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.040 
that's the forum build we did the mark
to<00:06:43.220> fuzz<00:06:44.220> pedal<00:06:44.610> versus<00:06:45.330> the<00:06:45.419> stone<00:06:45.660> bender

to fuzz pedal versus the stone bender

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.810 
to fuzz pedal versus the stone bender
which<00:06:46.350> is<00:06:46.500> kind<00:06:46.710> of<00:06:46.740> like<00:06:46.830> the<00:06:47.070> kind<00:06:47.669> of<00:06:47.729> a

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:47.820 
which is kind of like the kind of a
