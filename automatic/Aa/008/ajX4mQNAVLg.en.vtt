00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
be very precise it's just going to be

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:20.910 
be very precise it's just going to be
covering<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.780> top

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.359 

these<00:01:21.549> right<00:01:21.850> is<00:01:22.090> square<00:01:22.479> of<00:01:23.040> fabric<00:01:24.040> and<00:01:24.220> that

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
these right is square of fabric and that

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.359 
these right is square of fabric and that
will<00:01:24.610> be<00:01:24.759> going<00:01:24.939> on<00:01:25.650> top<00:01:26.650> so<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:26.950> get<00:01:27.189> that

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
will be going on top so you get that

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.600 
will be going on top so you get that
nice<00:01:27.729> color<00:01:28.180> now<00:01:28.900> I<00:01:29.140> would<00:01:29.530> secure<00:01:29.890> it<00:01:30.070> with<00:01:30.310> an

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
nice color now I would secure it with an

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.710 
nice color now I would secure it with an
elastic<00:01:30.729> band

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
elastic band

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.679 
elastic band
first<00:01:31.990> what<00:01:32.649> elastic<00:01:33.310> bands<00:01:33.610> can<00:01:34.090> just<00:01:34.509> be

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
first what elastic bands can just be

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.630 
first what elastic bands can just be
another<00:01:35.080> form<00:01:35.380> of<00:01:35.500> decoration<00:01:35.680> if<00:01:36.280> you've<00:01:36.430> got

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.290

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.530 
then you might want to just place it in
on<00:03:40.710> top<00:03:41.390> that's<00:03:42.390> one<00:03:42.840> way<00:03:43.020> of<00:03:43.050> doing<00:03:43.320> it<00:03:44.540> okay

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
on top that's one way of doing it okay

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.630 
on top that's one way of doing it okay
so<00:03:45.600> that's<00:03:46.260> stickier<00:03:46.800> at<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.040> second<00:03:47.460> one

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
so that's stickier at the second one

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.730 
so that's stickier at the second one
this<00:03:48.450> one's<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.780> bit<00:03:48.930> smaller<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.410> I'm<00:03:49.530> going

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
this one's a bit smaller and I'm going

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
this one's a bit smaller and I'm going
