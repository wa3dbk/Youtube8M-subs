00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:30.840
 hello my dear today my 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:35.579
 info for beginners just recently 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.380
 girlfriend she asked despite her 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.230
 employment plans nearest 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.600
 time to start mastering and width and 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.180
 skill and she asked me guys with 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.190
 what would you recommend to start 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.760
 learn to sew I replied that in my 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.410
 opinion 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.289
 You can start learning sewing with 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.420
 Topics or tunics are simple in fit and 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.600
 processing what it means simple is 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.280
 model provides 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.990
 there is no need and figure that is it 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.080
 some kind of volume model 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.330
 an hour a lot of models and tunics and 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.369
 Topics for such very simple models and 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.610
 advantages of using fabrics that are not 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.369
 requires some special knowledge of sewing about 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.659
 which is easy to handle and in this then 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.549
 have you invest bad with that i am her 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.049
 recommended to start sewing but here's a 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.759
 then I think that you need to go to 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.829
 sewing 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:38.070
 straight classic narrowed down skirts 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.780
 rubella and patterns are much easier 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.380
 than building a dress pattern or blouse 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.360
 this is the first second 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.600
 mistakes are used so much 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.860
 technological nodes that is let's 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.760
 calculate the first is the treatment darts 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.580
 the second is the back connection 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.730
 and he points broadcast somehow and connection 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.460
 while their processing is higher 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.290
 this is a side zipper processing either 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:14.440
 average rear cloth bus 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:16.950
 is it a cut treatment or a wider color in 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.890
 rear panel skirt is processing 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.440
 lower stress and this treatment is upper 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.470
 cut skirt belt or pumping for what 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.500
 six such basic technological 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:33.040
 nodes and 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.780
 only you process enough now 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.640
 information honestly on the internet yes 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.620
 if you contact you will easily find but 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.470
 accordingly I will already do my homework 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.610
 on processing these technological nodes 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:50.950
 so the pattern is easier to build 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:53.410
 otshit easy enough but back to 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.220
 the very beginning of the bull for all this 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:01.390
 make the necessary thread pattern 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.350
 pattern skirt on an individual 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.470
 the pattern. 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.290
 Oswin figure by their standards on their 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.830
 a figure 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:16.380
 to facilitate you this task i 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:24.970
 Background sheet help q shape and build 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:27.870
 primula pencil skirts download this little 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.360
 Calcutta checklist form build 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.600
 print write in specially 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:38.700
 allotted places of their measure and gave 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.810
 step by step clearly following function 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:46.739
 fitting in my need for measuring 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.739
 missed places build pattern 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.130
 build the pattern what you get in 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.850
 As a result, the first thing you get 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.970
 the result is a straight skirt pattern 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:02.510
 pencil and standing which should be in 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.720
 every woman's wardrobe I think that 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.489
 it should be for different colors because 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.310
 what is right or what is kadash basic 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:13.640
 but the thing that is necessary for 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.100
 full wardrobe drafting and she 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.609
 maybe you have different lengths that she and 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.480
 is good 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:23.240
 This is the first thing that grants you. 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:28.480
 get the so-called pattern-based 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.860
 straight skirts that is on further on 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.440
 I use this pattern-based 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.690
 and using simulation that is 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.040
 cutting apart 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.990
 details you will be able to 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.840
 model a huge variety 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:48.710
 different models of skirts that originally 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:54.979
 it seems that it is all different but they build the same 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:58.810
 it is on you based on the pattern and so I 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:03.440
 I wish you now download the check only 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:07.430
 print it build and crack to 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.260
 You did it easily and quickly, but 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.030
 next we will meet with you in order 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:17.689
 to continue learning to sew this 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:21.519
 remarkable creative and assart for 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:21.519
 see you soon
