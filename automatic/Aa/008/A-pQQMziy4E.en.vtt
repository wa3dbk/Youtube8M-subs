teams<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.780> things<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.440> you<00:02:30.500> need<00:02:31.000> more<00:02:32.000> of

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
teams and things so you need more of

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.390 
teams and things so you need more of
course<00:02:32.390> factory<00:02:32.870> teams<00:02:33.140> but<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.860> car<00:02:34.070> has<00:02:34.220> to

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
course factory teams but the car has to

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.210 
course factory teams but the car has to
be<00:02:34.430> so<00:02:34.850> that<00:02:35.120> built<00:02:35.660> that<00:02:35.959> it's<00:02:36.170> April<00:02:36.890> that

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
be so that built that it's April that

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.070 
be so that built that it's April that
you<00:02:37.430> can<00:02:37.670> if<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:38.030> have<00:02:38.060> a<00:02:38.209> good<00:02:38.450> people<00:02:38.720> good

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
you can if you have a good people good

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.960 
you can if you have a good people good
mechanics<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:40.130> can<00:02:40.310> build<00:02:40.489> a<00:02:40.640> world<00:02:40.790> rally

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
mechanics you can build a world rally

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.440 
mechanics you can build a world rally
car<00:02:41.090> here<00:02:42.250> you<00:02:43.250> don't<00:02:43.459> need<00:02:43.610> factory<00:02:44.120> teams

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
car here you don't need factory teams

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.170 
car here you don't need factory teams
and<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.290> can<00:02:45.500> take<00:02:45.680> part<00:02:45.890> or<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.880> world

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
and you can take part or the world

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.110 
and you can take part or the world
champions<00:02:47.630> if<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:47.959> with<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.590> cough<00:02:48.860> it<00:02:49.549> to<00:02:49.820> ideal

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
champions if it with a cough it to ideal

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.020 
champions if it with a cough it to ideal
has<00:02:50.299> to<00:02:50.510> be<00:02:50.660> first<00:02:50.959> at<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.650> bring<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.820> cost

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
has to be first at and bring the cost

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.840 
has to be first at and bring the cost
down<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.540> things<00:02:53.799> also<00:02:54.799> there<00:02:55.430> is<00:02:55.519> too<00:02:55.730> many

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
down and things also there is too many

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.620 
down and things also there is too many
analogies<00:02:56.239> so<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.640> correct<00:02:58.850> road<00:02:59.330> rally

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
analogies so the the correct road rally

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.870 
analogies so the the correct road rally
so<00:03:00.110> that<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:01.580> which<00:03:02.150> one<00:03:02.360> goes<00:03:02.570> wrong<00:03:02.930> is<00:03:03.290> that

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
so that the which one goes wrong is that

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.050 
so that the which one goes wrong is that
they<00:03:04.880> make<00:03:05.120> regulations<00:03:05.570> and<00:03:06.140> bring<00:03:06.560> them<00:03:07.060> to

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
they make regulations and bring them to

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.900 
they make regulations and bring them to
every<00:03:08.330> rally<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:08.930> think<00:03:09.680> about<00:03:09.980> that<00:03:10.250> Finland

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
every rally and think about that Finland

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.840 
every rally and think about that Finland
is<00:03:11.030> to<00:03:11.180> same<00:03:11.360> like<00:03:11.630> Australia<00:03:12.290> it's<00:03:12.470> not<00:03:12.850> it

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
is to same like Australia it's not it

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.810 
is to same like Australia it's not it
has<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.120> be<00:03:14.330> other<00:03:14.480> way<00:03:14.660> around<00:03:14.930> that<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:16.280> the

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
has to be other way around that the the

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.820 
has to be other way around that the the
regulation<00:03:17.540> for<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.780> wrongly<00:03:18.019> but<00:03:18.290> rally<00:03:18.620> has

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
regulation for the wrongly but rally has

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.220 
regulation for the wrongly but rally has
to<00:03:19.010> be<00:03:19.160> that<00:03:19.519> it<00:03:19.670> fits<00:03:19.910> into<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.390> country<00:03:20.810> yeah

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
to be that it fits into the country yeah

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.620 
to be that it fits into the country yeah
because<00:03:22.100> you<00:03:22.340> know<00:03:22.400> Chris<00:03:22.790> is<00:03:22.970> different<00:03:23.420> role

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
because you know Chris is different role

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.259 
because you know Chris is different role
the<00:03:23.780> Kenyan<00:03:24.080> is<00:03:24.200> different<00:03:24.620> only<00:03:24.950> compared<00:03:25.790> to

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
the Kenyan is different only compared to

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.830 
the Kenyan is different only compared to
Finland<00:03:26.780> or<00:03:26.989> Sweden<00:03:27.019> or<00:03:27.769> or<00:03:28.519> whatever<00:03:29.390> Tomic

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
Finland or Sweden or or whatever Tomic

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.930 
Finland or Sweden or or whatever Tomic
release<00:03:30.290> or<00:03:30.530> things<00:03:30.769> so<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.160> character<00:03:31.730> has

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
release or things so the character has

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.540 
release or things so the character has
to<00:03:31.970> stay<00:03:32.360> so<00:03:33.170> you<00:03:33.320> know<00:03:33.380> I<00:03:33.440> mean

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
to stay so you know I mean

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.580 
to stay so you know I mean
it's<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:34.820> little<00:03:35.030> bit<00:03:35.180> step<00:03:35.450> backwards<00:03:35.960> but<00:03:36.320> but

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
it's a little bit step backwards but but

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.670 
it's a little bit step backwards but but
make<00:03:37.190> everything<00:03:37.840> easier<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:38.990> more<00:03:39.200> simple

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
make everything easier and more simple

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.940 
make everything easier and more simple
and<00:03:39.920> get<00:03:40.160> to<00:03:40.460> get<00:03:40.670> rolling<00:03:41.000> interest<00:03:41.720> back<00:03:41.990> you

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
and get to get rolling interest back you

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.100 
and get to get rolling interest back you
know<00:03:43.100> that<00:03:43.400> you<00:03:43.550> get<00:03:43.790> smaller<00:03:44.360> teams<00:03:44.660> could

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
know that you get smaller teams could

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.730 
know that you get smaller teams could
cost<00:03:45.380> but<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.830> car<00:03:46.040> has<00:03:46.070> to<00:03:46.250> be<00:03:46.520> still<00:03:46.820> fast

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
cost but the car has to be still fast

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.210 
cost but the car has to be still fast
nice-looking<00:03:48.740> and<00:03:48.920> and<00:03:49.550> and<00:03:50.510> you<00:03:50.720> know<00:03:51.220> noisy

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
nice-looking and and and you know noisy

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.250 
nice-looking and and and you know noisy
and<00:03:52.370> powerful<00:03:52.910> because<00:03:53.300> that's<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.780> idea

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
and powerful because that's the idea

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.210 
and powerful because that's the idea
yeah<00:03:54.410> but<00:03:54.590> they're<00:03:55.280> building<00:03:56.470> RC<00:03:57.470> will<00:03:57.620> be<00:03:57.800> one

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
yeah but they're building RC will be one

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.720 
yeah but they're building RC will be one
point<00:03:58.400> six<00:03:58.700> two<00:03:58.850> moves<00:03:59.090> no<00:03:59.360> problem<00:04:00.400> BMW<00:04:01.400> made

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
point six two moves no problem BMW made

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.080 
point six two moves no problem BMW made
with<00:04:02.510> the<00:04:02.690> turbo<00:04:03.110> they<00:04:03.410> made<00:04:04.090> 1,100

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
with the turbo they made 1,100

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.080 
with the turbo they made 1,100
horsepower<00:04:05.240> out<00:04:05.960> from<00:04:06.200> Formula<00:04:06.650> One<00:04:06.830> with<00:04:07.310> 1.5

horsepower out from Formula One with 1.5
liter<00:04:08.540> engine<00:04:08.900> so<00:04:09.560> that's<00:04:09.740> not<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.100> problem

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
liter engine so that's not the problem

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.370 
liter engine so that's not the problem
it's<00:04:10.790> only<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.300> question<00:04:11.750> about<00:04:12.050> the<00:04:12.350> the

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
it's only the question about the the

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.210 
it's only the question about the the
cost<00:04:13.310> of<00:04:13.520> the<00:04:14.260> doto<00:04:15.260> his<00:04:15.380> dick<00:04:15.590> device

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
cost of the doto his dick device

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.610 
cost of the doto his dick device
okay<00:04:16.850> you<00:04:17.180> put<00:04:17.360> picky<00:04:17.600> stricter<00:04:18.260> and<00:04:18.380> you<00:04:18.440> get

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
okay you put picky stricter and you get

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.620 
okay you put picky stricter and you get
easily<00:04:18.799> 350<00:04:19.760> horsepower<00:04:20.000> of<00:04:20.480> the<00:04:20.510> engine

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
easily 350 horsepower of the engine

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.810 
easily 350 horsepower of the engine
which<00:04:21.020> still<00:04:21.260> be<00:04:21.440> strong<00:04:21.770> enough<00:04:22.040> yeah<00:04:22.520> to

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
which still be strong enough yeah to

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.310 
which still be strong enough yeah to
take<00:04:23.000> that<00:04:23.240> no<00:04:23.540> problem<00:04:23.960> yeah<00:04:24.170> and<00:04:25.160> also<00:04:26.320> just

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
take that no problem yeah and also just

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.980 
take that no problem yeah and also just
to<00:04:27.470> use<00:04:27.710> you<00:04:28.460> have<00:04:28.610> do<00:04:28.760> you<00:04:28.790> think<00:04:28.970> about<00:04:29.690> the

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
to use you have do you think about the

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.470 
to use you have do you think about the
economical<00:04:30.620> side<00:04:30.890> as<00:04:31.070> well<00:04:31.280> just<00:04:31.910> use<00:04:32.180> normal

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
economical side as well just use normal

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.120 
economical side as well just use normal
98<00:04:33.730> step<00:04:34.730> to<00:04:34.970> from<00:04:35.420> the<00:04:35.510> better<00:04:35.660> space<00:04:36.020> not<00:04:36.950> to

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
98 step to from the better space not to
