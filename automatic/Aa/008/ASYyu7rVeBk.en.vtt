00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
centimeter squared and I have actually

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.220 
centimeter squared and I have actually
put<00:00:38.040> interfacing<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.910> back<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.360> mine<00:00:39.660> then

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
put interfacing on the back of mine then

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.190 
put interfacing on the back of mine then
you'll<00:00:40.440> also<00:00:40.710> need<00:00:41.190> your<00:00:42.180> two<00:00:42.450> back<00:00:42.719> panels

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
you'll also need your two back panels

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.910 
you'll also need your two back panels
and<00:00:43.520> they<00:00:44.520> measure<00:00:44.879> 41<00:00:45.539> centimeters<00:00:45.989> by<00:00:46.530> 30

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
and they measure 41 centimeters by 30

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.389 
and they measure 41 centimeters by 30
and<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.760> haven't<00:00:48.180> interfaced<00:00:48.750> those<00:00:49.399> you'll

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
and I haven't interfaced those you'll

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.510 
and I haven't interfaced those you'll
also<00:00:50.640> need<00:00:51.090> your<00:00:51.539> felt<00:00:51.870> letters<00:00:52.289> cut<00:00:52.649> out<00:00:52.680> with

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
also need your felt letters cut out with

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.170 
also need your felt letters cut out with
the<00:00:53.789> fusible<00:00:54.180> webbing<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.500> back<00:00:56.120> you<00:00:57.120> can

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
the fusible webbing on the back you can

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.750 
the fusible webbing on the back you can
see<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.570> there<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.440> start<00:00:58.949> with<00:00:59.280> we're

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
see that there so to start with we're

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.599 
see that there so to start with we're
going<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.969> set<00:01:00.239> those<00:01:00.480> aside<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.920> our<00:01:02.309> first

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
going to set those aside and our first

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.780 
going to set those aside and our first
task<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.870> simply<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.739> join<00:01:04.979> together<00:01:05.460> right

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
task is simply to join together right

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.170 
task is simply to join together right
sides<00:01:06.119> together<00:01:06.920> our<00:01:08.780> front<00:01:09.780> panel<00:01:10.020> squares

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
sides together our front panel squares

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.899 
sides together our front panel squares
so<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.659> sew<00:01:12.840> along<00:01:13.170> one<00:01:14.130> side<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.520> each

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
so just to sew along one side of each

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.929 
so just to sew along one side of each
and<00:01:15.500> just<00:01:16.500> make<00:01:16.710> two<00:01:17.100> matching<00:01:17.970> pairs<00:01:19.729> so<00:01:20.729> just

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
and just make two matching pairs so just

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.850 
and just make two matching pairs so just
on<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> machine<00:01:21.570> your<00:01:21.780> seam<00:01:21.990> allowance<00:01:22.560> is

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
on the machine your seam allowance is

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.280 
on the machine your seam allowance is
around<00:01:23.189> about<00:01:23.400> half<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.390> centimeter<00:01:25.080> so

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
around about half the centimeter so

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.609 
around about half the centimeter so
about<00:01:25.530> 5<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.280> 6<00:01:26.490> millimeters<00:01:27.200> so<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.259> can<00:01:28.470> see

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
about 5 to 6 millimeters so you can see

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.620 
about 5 to 6 millimeters so you can see
I've<00:01:28.799> signed<00:01:29.130> those<00:01:29.460> two<00:01:29.850> seams<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.479> I've

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
I've signed those two seams and I've

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.060 
I've signed those two seams and I've
also<00:01:30.869> pressed<00:01:31.590> those<00:01:32.280> seams<00:01:32.759> out<00:01:33.240> flat<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.799> our

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
also pressed those seams out flat so our

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.660 
also pressed those seams out flat so our
next<00:01:35.520> task<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.930> join<00:01:37.170> those<00:01:38.130> two

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
next task is just to join those two

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.440 
next task is just to join those two
pairs<00:01:39.240> together<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.439> see<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.890> I've

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
pairs together and you can see that I've

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.940 
pairs together and you can see that I've
alternated<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.259> we've<00:01:43.409> got<00:01:43.649> our

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
alternated it so that we've got our

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.090 
alternated it so that we've got our
little<00:01:44.310> four<00:01:44.850> patch<00:01:45.149> style<00:01:45.630> there<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.290> make

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
little four patch style there and make

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.450 
little four patch style there and make
sure<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.850> pin<00:01:48.350> those<00:01:49.350> centres<00:01:49.950> together

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
sure that you pin those centres together

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.899 
sure that you pin those centres together
right<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.540> seam<00:01:51.869> line<00:01:52.170> there<00:01:52.700> right<00:01:53.700> at

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
right on the seam line there right at

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.990 
right on the seam line there right at
that<00:01:54.090> Junction<00:01:55.040> so<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.189> when<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.460> sew<00:01:56.729> that

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
that Junction so that when you sew that

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.889 
that Junction so that when you sew that
seam<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:58.380> all<00:01:58.619> nicely<00:01:58.890> centered<00:01:59.780> so<00:02:00.780> it's

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
seam it's all nicely centered so it's

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.450 
seam it's all nicely centered so it's
just<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> matter<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.439> staying<00:02:02.130> with<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.430> same

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
just a matter of staying with the same

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.170 
just a matter of staying with the same
seam<00:02:03.030> allowance<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:04.430> sewing<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:05.850> seam

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
seam allowance and sewing just this seam

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.139 
seam allowance and sewing just this seam
here<00:02:06.829> so<00:02:07.829> our<00:02:08.009> front<00:02:08.190> panels<00:02:08.640> are<00:02:08.789> all<00:02:08.910> sewn

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
here so our front panels are all sewn

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.330 
here so our front panels are all sewn
together<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.660> knife<00:02:09.869> pressed<00:02:10.229> open<00:02:10.890> those

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
together a knife pressed open those

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.390 
together a knife pressed open those
seams

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
seams

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.479 
seams
also<00:02:13.239> you<00:02:13.720> can<00:02:13.900> see<00:02:14.170> there<00:02:14.470> so<00:02:15.040> now<00:02:15.220> it's<00:02:15.430> a

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
also you can see there so now it's a

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.970 
also you can see there so now it's a
matter<00:02:15.520> of<00:02:15.790> positioning<00:02:15.970> our<00:02:16.420> letters<00:02:16.980> onto

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
matter of positioning our letters onto

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.210 
matter of positioning our letters onto
our<00:02:18.190> squares<00:02:18.730> now<00:02:19.239> I<00:02:19.270> find<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:20.680> two

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
our squares now I find that two

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.040 
our squares now I find that two
centimetres<00:02:22.319> from<00:02:23.489> this<00:02:24.489> center<00:02:25.000> line<00:02:25.030> is<00:02:25.780> the

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
centimetres from this center line is the

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.900 
centimetres from this center line is the
best<00:02:26.260> measurement<00:02:26.830> for<00:02:27.040> these<00:02:27.190> letters<00:02:27.640> so

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
best measurement for these letters so

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.570 
best measurement for these letters so
two<00:02:27.970> centimetres<00:02:28.720> this<00:02:28.900> way<00:02:29.110> two<00:02:30.069> centimetres

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
two centimetres this way two centimetres

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.650 
two centimetres this way two centimetres
this<00:02:30.760> way<00:02:31.290> same<00:02:32.290> with<00:02:32.470> this<00:02:32.620> one's<00:02:33.660> because

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
this way same with this one's because

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.589 
this way same with this one's because
the<00:02:34.780> letters<00:02:35.080> are<00:02:35.319> different<00:02:35.739> widths<00:02:36.599> you

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
the letters are different widths you

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.120 
the letters are different widths you

all<00:03:40.540> around<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.049> outside<00:03:41.200> if<00:03:41.680> you<00:03:41.799> do<00:03:41.950> a

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
all around the outside if you do a

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.129 
all around the outside if you do a
zig-zag<00:03:42.280> stitch<00:03:42.819> I<00:03:43.329> would<00:03:43.540> recommend<00:03:44.049> that

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
zig-zag stitch I would recommend that

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.309

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
so go ahead and sew those letters on in

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.729 
so go ahead and sew those letters on in
your<00:03:51.130> preferred<00:03:51.549> way<00:03:52.319> there<00:03:53.319> we<00:03:53.440> have<00:03:53.620> our

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
letters all sewing on so we can pop that

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:02.490

one<00:03:56.290> aside<00:03:56.739> and<00:03:57.930> our<00:03:58.930> next<00:03:59.350> step<00:03:59.620> is<00:04:00.220> to<00:04:01.500> hem

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
one aside and our next step is to hem

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.420 
one aside and our next step is to hem
one<00:04:03.370> side<00:04:03.790> of<00:04:04.150> each<00:04:04.450> of<00:04:04.720> our<00:04:04.840> back<00:04:05.230> pieces<00:04:06.100> now
