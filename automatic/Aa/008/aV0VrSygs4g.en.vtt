00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
let's take a look at Asus is m2 in E now

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.740 
let's take a look at Asus is m2 in E now
this<00:00:05.640> is<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.879> answer<00:00:06.210> line<00:00:06.450> there's<00:00:06.690> a

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
this is the answer line there's a

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.810 
this is the answer line there's a
regular<00:00:07.259> version<00:00:07.589> but<00:00:07.740> hey<00:00:07.859> they<00:00:08.010> said<00:00:08.220> some

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
regular version but hey they said some

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.580 
regular version but hey they said some
people<00:00:08.910> want<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.269> graphics<00:00:09.630> cards<00:00:09.870> so<00:00:10.440> we're

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
people want to graphics cards so we're

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.410 
people want to graphics cards so we're
gonna<00:00:10.710> give<00:00:10.920> them<00:00:11.040> two<00:00:11.519> graphics<00:00:12.030> cards<00:00:12.090> now

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
gonna give them two graphics cards now

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.900 
gonna give them two graphics cards now
you've<00:00:12.540> got<00:00:12.690> two<00:00:12.900> PCI<00:00:13.830> Express<00:00:14.160> slots<00:00:14.519> on<00:00:14.730> this

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
you've got two PCI Express slots on this

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.090 
you've got two PCI Express slots on this
one<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.240> that's<00:00:15.360> nice<00:00:15.690> it's<00:00:16.199> also<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.650> socket

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
one so that's nice it's also a socket

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.760 
one so that's nice it's also a socket
am2<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.000> AMT<00:00:18.869> right<00:00:19.020> now<00:00:19.140> it's<00:00:19.350> probably<00:00:19.500> the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
am2 and AMT right now it's probably the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.950 
am2 and AMT right now it's probably the
best<00:00:19.949> way<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.100> go<00:00:20.310> as<00:00:20.520> far<00:00:20.789> as<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> price<00:00:21.630> and

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
best way to go as far as a price and

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.349 
best way to go as far as a price and
performance<00:00:22.109> ratio<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.029> lot<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.119> their<00:00:24.210> new

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
performance ratio a lot of their new

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.880 
performance ratio a lot of their new
processors<00:00:25.019> are<00:00:25.140> really<00:00:25.380> fast<00:00:25.619> they're

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
processors are really fast they're

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.970 
processors are really fast they're
mathletics<00:00:26.519> twos<00:00:27.060> they're<00:00:27.390> FX's<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.769> can<00:00:28.890> use

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
mathletics twos they're FX's you can use

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.160 
mathletics twos they're FX's you can use
the<00:00:29.099> Athlon<00:00:29.429> 64<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.539> sim<00:00:30.750> Pranav

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
the Athlon 64 in this and the sim Pranav

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.359 
the Athlon 64 in this and the sim Pranav
well<00:00:31.349> as<00:00:31.560> well<00:00:31.769> if<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:31.980> want<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.130> save<00:00:32.309> a

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
well as well if you want to save a

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.970 
well as well if you want to save a
little<00:00:32.460> power<00:00:32.700> but<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.570> Athlon<00:00:33.840> FX<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.620> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
little power but the Athlon FX and the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.000 
little power but the Athlon FX and the
x2<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.480> they're<00:00:36.870> gonna<00:00:37.050> produce<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.590> very

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
x2 in this they're gonna produce a very

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.680 
x2 in this they're gonna produce a very
powerful<00:00:38.610> gaming<00:00:39.000> machine<00:00:39.360> some<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
powerful gaming machine some of the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.299 
powerful gaming machine some of the
newer<00:00:39.840> x2<00:00:40.200> processors<00:00:40.739> are<00:00:40.860> getting<00:00:41.100> some

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
newer x2 processors are getting some

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.310 
newer x2 processors are getting some
really<00:00:41.610> good<00:00:41.760> results<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.780> DirectX<00:00:43.110> 10

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
really good results and the DirectX 10

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.900 
really good results and the DirectX 10
games<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> lot<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.070> DirectX<00:00:44.399> 9<00:00:44.640> games

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
games and a lot of the DirectX 9 games

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.819 
games and a lot of the DirectX 9 games
so<00:00:45.629> that's<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.960> nice<00:00:46.110> feature<00:00:46.140> as<00:00:46.469> well

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
so that's a nice feature as well

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.950 
so that's a nice feature as well
now<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.250> frontside<00:00:47.969> bus<00:00:48.030> speed<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.809> a

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
now the frontside bus speed on this is a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.069 
now the frontside bus speed on this is a
thousand<00:00:49.500> megahertz<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:51.480> RAM<00:00:51.960> that

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
thousand megahertz and the RAM that

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.910 
thousand megahertz and the RAM that
you're<00:00:52.199> gonna<00:00:52.289> use<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.710> can<00:00:52.829> use

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
you're gonna use in this you can use

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.950 
you're gonna use in this you can use
ddr2<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.610> up<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.820> 800<00:00:54.210> megahertz<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.660> uses<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
ddr2 it up to 800 megahertz it uses a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.560 
ddr2 it up to 800 megahertz it uses a
you<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.680> use<00:00:55.710> ECC<00:00:56.250> Ram<00:00:56.280> no<00:00:56.820> problem<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.449> can

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
you can use ECC Ram no problem you can

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.970 
you can use ECC Ram no problem you can
even<00:00:57.719> use<00:00:57.930> dual<00:00:58.289> channel<00:00:58.559> RAM<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.829> this

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
even use dual channel RAM in this

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.319 
even use dual channel RAM in this
alright<00:00:59.399> let's<00:00:59.550> take<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.699> little<00:00:59.850> tour<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.149> this

there<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.110> socket<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.770> said

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
there is the socket it's like I said

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.270 
there is the socket it's like I said
it's<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.220> m2<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.049> this<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> zip<00:01:16.830> meaning<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
it's a m2 and this is a zip meaning a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.950 
it's a m2 and this is a zip meaning a
zero<00:01:17.700> insertion<00:01:18.060> force<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.720> lay<00:01:18.840> it

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
zero insertion force you just lay it

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.149 
zero insertion force you just lay it
down<00:01:18.990> there<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.409> should<00:01:19.560> sink<00:01:19.799> right<00:01:19.890> into<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
down there it should sink right into the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.039 
down there it should sink right into the
holes<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.880> fine<00:01:21.090> alright<00:01:21.720> moving<00:01:21.930> on

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
holes and be just fine alright moving on

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.749 
holes and be just fine alright moving on
up<00:01:22.200> high<00:01:22.470> there's<00:01:22.650> reinstall<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.159> RAM<00:01:23.310> you

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
up high there's reinstall the RAM you

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.460 
up high there's reinstall the RAM you
got<00:01:23.880> four<00:01:24.090> slots<00:01:24.420> there<00:01:24.689> if<00:01:25.049> you're<00:01:25.170> using<00:01:25.290> a

got four slots there if you're using a
64-bit<00:01:26.040> OS<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.490> could<00:01:26.610> install<00:01:26.909> eight

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
64-bit OS you could install eight

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.789 
64-bit OS you could install eight
gigabytes<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.990> memory<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:28.409> using<00:01:28.710> a

32-bit<00:01:29.220> OS<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:30.060> can<00:01:30.180> install<00:01:30.479> four<00:01:30.990> gigabytes

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
32-bit OS you can install four gigabytes

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.140 
32-bit OS you can install four gigabytes
of<00:01:31.680> memory<00:01:31.740> sometimes<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.549> only<00:01:32.640> sees<00:01:32.909> three

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.880 
of memory sometimes it only sees three
and<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> half<00:01:33.420> that's<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.470> nature<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
and a half that's the nature of the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.740 
and a half that's the nature of the
32-bit<00:01:35.369> OS<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.820> all<00:01:36.210> right<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.540> we<00:01:36.630> have

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
32-bit OS is all right up here we have

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.350 
32-bit OS is all right up here we have
the<00:01:36.869> connectors<00:01:37.290> for<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.560> IDE<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.549> top<00:01:38.759> I'm

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
the connectors for the IDE on top I'm

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.499 
the connectors for the IDE on top I'm
moving<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.780> along<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.049> over<00:01:40.979> here<00:01:41.159> we<00:01:41.280> have

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
moving on along here over here we have

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.120 
moving on along here over here we have
four<00:01:42.509> set<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.899> 2.0<00:01:43.290> ports<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.770> supports

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
four set of 2.0 ports and this supports

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.469 
four set of 2.0 ports and this supports
raid<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.579> it's<00:01:44.700> got<00:01:44.820> an<00:01:44.880> onboard<00:01:45.270> raid

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
raid so it's got an onboard raid

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.109 
raid so it's got an onboard raid
controller<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.259> can<00:01:46.380> use<00:01:46.470> raid<00:01:46.649> 1<00:01:46.890> raid<00:01:47.189> 0

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
controller you can use raid 1 raid 0

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.899 
controller you can use raid 1 raid 0
raid<00:01:48.210> 0+1<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.590> raid<00:01:49.979> 5<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:50.640> use<00:01:50.759> all

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
raid 0+1 and raid 5 so you can use all

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.760 
raid 0+1 and raid 5 so you can use all
those<00:01:51.119> there's<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.079> little<00:01:52.290> risers<00:01:52.590> here<00:01:52.619> on

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
those there's a little risers here on

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.139 
those there's a little risers here on
the<00:01:52.829> side<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.220> connect<00:01:53.520> your<00:01:53.610> front<00:01:53.850> panels

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
the side to connect your front panels

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.209 
the side to connect your front panels
and<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.600> USB<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.350> sort<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.590> thing<00:01:55.740> I'm

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
and and USB and that sort of thing I'm

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.520 
and and USB and that sort of thing I'm
moving<00:01:56.549> on<00:01:56.670> down<00:01:56.880> here<00:01:57.630> we<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.930> couple<00:01:58.140> PCI

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
moving on down here we have a couple PCI

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.910 
moving on down here we have a couple PCI
slots<00:01:59.189> here<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.610> then<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.210> those<00:02:00.360> two

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
slots here and then we have those two

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.410 
slots here and then we have those two
PCI<00:02:01.920> Express<00:02:02.250> slots<00:02:02.579> here<00:02:02.700> now<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:02.969> can<00:02:03.270> run

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
PCI Express slots here now you can run

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.719 
PCI Express slots here now you can run
one<00:02:04.200> graphics<00:02:04.560> card<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.860> sixteen<00:02:05.310> speed<00:02:05.579> when

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
one graphics card in sixteen speed when

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.130 
one graphics card in sixteen speed when
you<00:02:05.790> run<00:02:05.939> two<00:02:06.119> graphics<00:02:06.509> cards<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.810> shares<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
you run two graphics cards it shares the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.820 
you run two graphics cards it shares the
bandwidth<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.740> they<00:02:08.550> run<00:02:08.700> at<00:02:08.819> 8x<00:02:09.209> +<00:02:09.420> 8<00:02:09.929> X<00:02:10.229> then

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
bandwidth and they run at 8x + 8 X then

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.260 
bandwidth and they run at 8x + 8 X then
we<00:02:10.920> have<00:02:11.039> two<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.370> ones<00:02:11.940> be

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
we have two of the ones be

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.850 
we have two of the ones be
PCI<00:02:12.600> Express<00:02:12.840> slots<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.320> may<00:02:13.470> want<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.710> put<00:02:13.830> a

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
PCI Express slots you may want to put a

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.440 
PCI Express slots you may want to put a
physics<00:02:14.490> card<00:02:14.700> or<00:02:14.820> something<00:02:14.940> like<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.300> in

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
physics card or something like that in

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.360 
physics card or something like that in
there<00:02:15.630> just<00:02:16.200> install<00:02:16.530> right<00:02:16.740> there<00:02:16.920> no

there just install right there no
problem<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.510> if<00:02:18.690> you're<00:02:18.810> running<00:02:18.900> two

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
problem and if you're running two

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.080

graphics cards one one big graphics card
like<00:02:21.180> an<00:02:21.270> 8800<00:02:21.810> or<00:02:21.870> something<00:02:22.080> like<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.200> it

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
like an 8800 or something like that it

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.050 
like an 8800 or something like that it
might<00:02:22.860> cover<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.250> first<00:02:23.430> slot<00:02:23.670> there<00:02:23.910> but

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
might cover the first slot there but

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.890 
might cover the first slot there but
you'll<00:02:24.180> still<00:02:24.330> be<00:02:24.420> able<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.600> install<00:02:24.780> a

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
you'll still be able to install a

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.350 
you'll still be able to install a
physics<00:02:25.230> card<00:02:25.440> right<00:02:25.650> here<00:02:25.890> or<00:02:26.150> physics<00:02:27.150> card

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
physics card right here or physics card

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.090 
physics card right here or physics card
over<00:02:27.570> in<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.720> PCI<00:02:28.170> slots<00:02:28.500> over<00:02:28.650> here<00:02:28.830> so<00:02:28.980> no

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
over in the PCI slots over here so no

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.560 
over in the PCI slots over here so no
problem<00:02:29.460> let's<00:02:30.000> take<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.150> look<00:02:30.270> at<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.420> back

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
problem let's take a look at the back

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.530 
problem let's take a look at the back
here<00:02:30.600> now<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:32.340> audio<00:02:32.730> controller<00:02:33.120> on<00:02:33.270> this<00:02:33.390> is

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
here now the audio controller on this is

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.780 
here now the audio controller on this is
really<00:02:33.750> nice<00:02:33.870> it's<00:02:34.230> 7.1<00:02:35.190> channel<00:02:35.220> that's<00:02:35.640> a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
really nice it's 7.1 channel that's a

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.970 
really nice it's 7.1 channel that's a
channel<00:02:36.090> audio<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.260> get<00:02:37.470> full<00:02:37.680> surround

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
channel audio so you get full surround

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.060 
channel audio so you get full surround
sound<00:02:38.160> with<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:38.910> know<00:02:39.000> up<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.150> 8<00:02:39.720> speakers<00:02:40.320> and

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
sound with you know up to 8 speakers and

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.500 
sound with you know up to 8 speakers and
that's<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.520> nice<00:02:41.640> feature<00:02:41.850> now<00:02:42.060> one<00:02:42.240> thing<00:02:42.390> I

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
that's a nice feature now one thing I

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.760 
that's a nice feature now one thing I
did<00:02:42.660> notice<00:02:42.870> I've<00:02:43.110> been<00:02:43.260> getting<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.530> couple

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
did notice I've been getting a couple

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.050 
did notice I've been getting a couple
emails<00:02:43.920> some<00:02:44.220> people<00:02:44.430> said<00:02:44.580> that<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.790> audio

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
emails some people said that the audio

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.910 
emails some people said that the audio
wasn't<00:02:45.270> working<00:02:45.600> correctly<00:02:45.780> one<00:02:46.710> thing<00:02:46.830> I

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
wasn't working correctly one thing I

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.350 
wasn't working correctly one thing I
might<00:02:47.010> want<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.190> make<00:02:47.340> note<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.580> depending<00:02:48.270> on

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
might want to make note of depending on

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.940 
might want to make note of depending on
your<00:02:48.450> configuration<00:02:48.660> with<00:02:49.170> your<00:02:49.290> system<00:02:49.560> you

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
your configuration with your system you

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.200 
your configuration with your system you
might<00:02:50.070> need<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.310> go<00:02:50.400> into<00:02:50.520> setup<00:02:50.790> first<00:02:51.030> and

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
might need to go into setup first and

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.150 
might need to go into setup first and
just<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.810> know<00:02:51.930> put<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.260> checkmark<00:02:52.500> on<00:02:52.770> enable

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
just you know put a checkmark on enable

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.250

when I'm building my system is sometimes
you<00:03:22.260> know<00:03:22.320> I've<00:03:22.410> had<00:03:22.740> a<00:03:22.800> system<00:03:23.070> it's<00:03:23.220> almost

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
you know I've had a system it's almost

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.850 
you know I've had a system it's almost
finished<00:03:24.210> the<00:03:24.720> only<00:03:25.050> thing<00:03:25.200> left<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.500> plug<00:03:25.710> in

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
finished the only thing left to plug in

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.890 
finished the only thing left to plug in
are<00:03:25.950> like<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.280> power<00:03:26.640> led<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.390> power<00:03:27.600> switch

are like the power led the power switch

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.540 
are like the power led the power switch
and<00:03:28.230> all<00:03:28.710> those<00:03:28.860> little<00:03:29.010> front<00:03:29.340> connectors

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
and all those little front connectors

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.070 
and all those little front connectors
those<00:03:29.910> drive<00:03:30.090> me<00:03:30.240> crazy<00:03:30.390> because<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:30.960> know

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
those drive me crazy because you know

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.570 
those drive me crazy because you know
they're<00:03:31.230> hard<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.770> get<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:32.010> them<00:03:32.130> sometimes<00:03:32.490> I

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
they're hard to get to them sometimes I

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.650 
they're hard to get to them sometimes I
just<00:03:32.760> leave<00:03:32.910> it<00:03:32.940> there<00:03:33.090> for<00:03:33.150> like<00:03:33.330> two<00:03:33.450> days

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
just leave it there for like two days

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.380 
just leave it there for like two days
well<00:03:34.320> they<00:03:34.980> include<00:03:35.520> something<00:03:35.730> called<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.090> Q

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
well they include something called the Q

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.480 
well they include something called the Q
connector<00:03:36.780> this<00:03:37.020> is<00:03:37.110> really<00:03:37.470> cool<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.920> plug

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
connector this is really cool you plug

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.070 
connector this is really cool you plug
everything<00:03:39.180> I've<00:03:39.420> just<00:03:39.540> mentioned<00:03:39.690> into<00:03:39.990> this

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
everything I've just mentioned into this

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.810 
everything I've just mentioned into this
you<00:03:40.290> plug<00:03:40.500> you<00:03:40.860> know<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.040> speaker<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.640> power

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
you plug you know the speaker the power

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.510 
you plug you know the speaker the power
LED<00:03:42.330> the<00:03:43.260> reset<00:03:43.590> switch<00:03:43.740> everything<00:03:44.310> into

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
LED the reset switch everything into

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.190 
LED the reset switch everything into
this<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:44.970> then<00:03:45.360> this<00:03:45.480> plugs<00:03:45.900> into<00:03:46.050> the

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
this and then this plugs into the

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.870 
this and then this plugs into the
motherboard<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:47.250> that<00:03:47.460> that's<00:03:47.610> really<00:03:47.670> cool

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
motherboard so that that's really cool

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.280 
motherboard so that that's really cool
if<00:03:48.030> you<00:03:48.090> want<00:03:48.210> to<00:03:48.270> make<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.420> change<00:03:48.660> this<00:03:49.080> just

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
if you want to make a change this just

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.180 
if you want to make a change this just
plugs<00:03:49.410> right<00:03:49.560> into<00:03:49.710> the<00:03:49.800> motherboard<00:03:50.040> right

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
plugs right into the motherboard right

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.190 
plugs right into the motherboard right
here<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.700> then<00:03:51.210> when<00:03:51.360> you're<00:03:51.480> ready<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.720> you

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
here and then when you're ready to you

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.660 
here and then when you're ready to you
know<00:03:52.230> if<00:03:52.350> you<00:03:52.440> need<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.740> pull<00:03:53.370> these<00:03:53.460> out<00:03:53.610> or

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
know if you need to pull these out or

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.330 
know if you need to pull these out or
something<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.150> pull<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.600> entire<00:03:54.840> thing<00:03:55.170> out

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
something you pull the entire thing out

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.440 
something you pull the entire thing out
so<00:03:56.340> you<00:03:56.400> don't<00:03:56.550> have<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.820> pull<00:03:57.150> each

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
so you don't have to pull each

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.940 
so you don't have to pull each
individual<00:03:57.960> cable<00:03:58.260> out<00:03:58.350> and<00:03:58.470> plug<00:03:58.650> them<00:03:58.800> all

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
individual cable out and plug them all

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.500 
individual cable out and plug them all
back<00:03:59.190> in<00:03:59.250> that's<00:03:59.850> something<00:04:00.060> that<00:04:00.180> drives<00:04:00.360> me

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
back in that's something that drives me

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.020 
back in that's something that drives me
crazy<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.770> coolest<00:04:02.190> this<00:04:02.970> is

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
crazy and this is the coolest this is

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.010 
crazy and this is the coolest this is
probably<00:04:03.240> my<00:04:03.450> favorite<00:04:03.720> part<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:03.930> the

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
probably my favorite part of the

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.720 
probably my favorite part of the
motherboard<00:04:04.350> is<00:04:04.410> it's<00:04:04.590> obviously<00:04:05.520> not<00:04:05.670> the

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
motherboard is it's obviously not the

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.920 
motherboard is it's obviously not the
best<00:04:05.970> part<00:04:06.180> of<00:04:06.210> the<00:04:06.300> motherboard<00:04:06.630> but<00:04:06.750> it

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
best part of the motherboard but it

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.380 
best part of the motherboard but it
really<00:04:07.230> makes<00:04:07.440> my<00:04:07.590> life<00:04:07.770> easy<00:04:08.520> now<00:04:08.850> the

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
really makes my life easy now the

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.250 
really makes my life easy now the
motherboard<00:04:09.720> is<00:04:09.780> very<00:04:09.959> good<00:04:10.110> for

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
motherboard is very good for

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.440 
motherboard is very good for
overclocking<00:04:10.730> you<00:04:11.730> can<00:04:11.850> go<00:04:11.910> into<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.150> BIOS

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
overclocking you can go into the BIOS

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.940 
overclocking you can go into the BIOS
and<00:04:12.720> then<00:04:12.810> change<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.230> voltages<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:13.830> that

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
and then change the voltages and that

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.099 
and then change the voltages and that
sort<00:04:14.160> of<00:04:14.190> thing<00:04:14.340> so<00:04:14.520> that<00:04:15.330> that's<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.600> plus<00:04:15.959> as

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
sort of thing so that that's a plus as

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.080 
sort of thing so that that's a plus as
well<00:04:16.140> and<00:04:16.830> like<00:04:17.040> I<00:04:17.070> said<00:04:17.280> this<00:04:17.340> is<00:04:17.459> also<00:04:17.609> a<00:04:17.760> very

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
well and like I said this is also a very

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.000 
well and like I said this is also a very
good<00:04:18.570> way<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:18.840> go<00:04:19.020> as<00:04:19.140> far<00:04:19.290> as<00:04:19.440> cost<00:04:19.709> and

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
good way to go as far as cost and

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.170 
good way to go as far as cost and
performance<00:04:20.220> cuz<00:04:20.700> you're<00:04:20.820> gonna<00:04:20.880> be<00:04:21.030> able<00:04:21.090> to

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
performance cuz you're gonna be able to

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.120 
performance cuz you're gonna be able to
build<00:04:21.330> a<00:04:21.419> great<00:04:21.630> budget<00:04:21.840> rig<00:04:22.140> that's<00:04:22.860> going<00:04:23.070> to

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
build a great budget rig that's going to

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.480
