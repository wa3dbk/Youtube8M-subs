curve and we also have a hamster switch
on<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.760> hamster<00:01:10.180> switch<00:01:10.330> is<00:01:10.540> very<00:01:10.690> important

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
on the hamster switch is very important

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.990 
on the hamster switch is very important
for<00:01:11.320> some<00:01:11.470> of<00:01:11.500> those<00:01:11.620> scratch<00:01:11.890> DJs<00:01:12.400> and<00:01:12.640> they

for some of those scratch DJs and they

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.700 
for some of those scratch DJs and they
really<00:01:13.360> really<00:01:13.540> like<00:01:13.630> to<00:01:13.780> see<00:01:13.930> that<00:01:14.110> on<00:01:14.290> the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
really really like to see that on the

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.750 
really really like to see that on the
mixer<00:01:14.979> face<00:01:15.220> exactly<00:01:16.090> and<00:01:16.420> so<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:17.260> the<00:01:17.980> most

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
mixer face exactly and so the the most

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.350 
mixer face exactly and so the the most
advanced<00:01:19.180> feature<00:01:19.510> of<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.890> device<00:01:21.220> is<00:01:21.520> DBS

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
advanced feature of the device is DBS

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.160 
advanced feature of the device is DBS
input<00:01:22.810> so<00:01:23.290> we've<00:01:23.470> added<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:25.060> we've<00:01:25.210> added<00:01:25.480> DBS

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
input so we've added if we've added DBS

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.670 
input so we've added if we've added DBS
to<00:01:26.440> this<00:01:26.650> so<00:01:27.010> we<00:01:27.250> can<00:01:27.460> we<00:01:27.760> can<00:01:27.790> actually<00:01:28.680> start

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
to this so we can we can actually start

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.700 
to this so we can we can actually start
up<00:01:29.770> our<00:01:29.950> dent<00:01:30.220> on<00:01:30.310> 39<00:01:30.850> hundredths<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:31.480> get<00:01:32.410> we

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
up our dent on 39 hundredths and get we

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.560 
up our dent on 39 hundredths and get we
can<00:01:32.860> get<00:01:32.980> some<00:01:33.160> scratch<00:01:33.430> go<00:01:33.670> in<00:01:33.820> here<00:01:34.060> nice<00:01:34.330> hot

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
can get some scratch go in here nice hot

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.420 
can get some scratch go in here nice hot
on<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:34.900> screen<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:38.380> you<00:01:38.470> got<00:01:38.620> full<00:01:38.860> DVS

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
on the screen so so you got full DVS

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.520 
on the screen so so you got full DVS
control<00:01:39.970> right<00:01:40.570> here<00:01:40.630> right<00:01:41.020> out<00:01:41.110> of<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.320> box

really<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:01.720> lot<00:04:01.930> of<00:04:02.049> political<00:04:02.260> and<00:04:02.799> then

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
really a lot of political and then

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.640 
really a lot of political and then
sampler<00:04:03.700> mode<00:04:03.940> all<00:04:04.329> of<00:04:04.600> our<00:04:04.720> sample<00:04:05.170> pads<00:04:05.380> are

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
sampler mode all of our sample pads are

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.620 
sampler mode all of our sample pads are
velocity-sensitive<00:04:06.579> so<00:04:07.150> if<00:04:07.269> you're<00:04:07.450> in<00:04:07.540> the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
velocity-sensitive so if you're in the

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.420 
velocity-sensitive so if you're in the
second<00:04:08.019> mode<00:04:08.170> now<00:04:08.470> you've<00:04:08.650> got<00:04:08.859> velocity

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
second mode now you've got velocity

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.069 
second mode now you've got velocity
sensitivity<00:04:09.970> on

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
sensitivity on

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.140 
sensitivity on
you<00:04:12.079> also<00:04:12.230> have<00:04:12.530> this<00:04:12.680> little<00:04:12.890> funny<00:04:13.670> icon

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
you also have this little funny icon

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.729 
you also have this little funny icon
right<00:04:14.390> here<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:14.810> that<00:04:14.989> and<00:04:15.260> I<00:04:15.349> was<00:04:15.500> just

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
right here and that and I was just

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:16.509 
right here and that and I was just
getting<00:04:16.039> to<00:04:16.070> that

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
getting to that

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.990 
getting to that
so<00:04:16.729> so<00:04:17.530> cerrado<00:04:18.530> just<00:04:18.859> announced<00:04:19.340> clip<00:04:19.669> which

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
so so cerrado just announced clip which

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.999 
so so cerrado just announced clip which
is<00:04:20.030> a<00:04:20.209> new<00:04:20.509> feature<00:04:21.199> inside<00:04:21.709> of<00:04:21.769> their

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:22.009 
is a new feature inside of their

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.390 
is a new feature inside of their
software<00:04:22.509> and<00:04:23.509> flip<00:04:24.080> comes<00:04:24.470> with<00:04:24.770> with<00:04:25.190> the<00:04:25.370> a

and make it seamless nice actually we
also<00:04:49.160> have<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.940> ability<00:04:50.030> to<00:04:50.449> save<00:04:50.780> flips

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
also have the ability to save flips

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.290 
also have the ability to save flips
after<00:04:51.440> you've<00:04:51.830> recorded<00:04:52.190> them<00:04:52.550> so<00:04:53.030> you'll

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
after you've recorded them so you'll

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.450 
after you've recorded them so you'll
have<00:04:53.449> up<00:04:53.720> to<00:04:53.870> six<00:04:54.169> slots<00:04:54.470> to<00:04:54.800> be<00:04:54.889> able<00:04:55.099> to<00:04:55.190> save

your flips and then be able to play your

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
your flips and then be able to play your
flips<00:04:57.500> back<00:04:57.830> just<00:04:58.250> like<00:04:58.460> their<00:04:58.669> hot<00:04:58.820> cue<00:04:59.060> nice

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
flips back just like their hot cue nice

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.040 
flips back just like their hot cue nice
it's<00:05:01.070> excellent<00:05:01.430> new<00:05:01.639> feature<00:05:01.880> so<00:05:02.509> we<00:05:02.870> also

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
it's excellent new feature so we also

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.320 
it's excellent new feature so we also
getting<00:05:03.530> back<00:05:03.740> up<00:05:03.800> to<00:05:04.130> the<00:05:04.220> top<00:05:04.400> we<00:05:04.789> have<00:05:04.820> strip

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
getting back up to the top we have strip

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.150 
getting back up to the top we have strip
search<00:05:05.599> which<00:05:06.169> is<00:05:06.320> actually<00:05:06.710> three<00:05:07.009> different

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
search which is actually three different

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.909 
search which is actually three different
ways<00:05:07.669> of<00:05:07.970> using<00:05:08.000> now<00:05:08.509> so<00:05:08.930> we<00:05:09.080> have<00:05:09.110> strip

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
ways of using now so we have strip

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.740 
ways of using now so we have strip
search<00:05:10.190> which<00:05:10.610> lets<00:05:10.849> us<00:05:10.970> range<00:05:11.330> through<00:05:11.660> the

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
search which lets us range through the

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.950 
search which lets us range through the
track<00:05:12.130> we<00:05:13.130> have<00:05:13.340> pinched<00:05:13.759> wood<00:05:14.300> so<00:05:14.449> let<00:05:14.599> us<00:05:14.630> do

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
track we have pinched wood so let us do

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.050 
track we have pinched wood so let us do
a<00:05:14.990> momentary<00:05:15.590> pitch<00:05:15.919> up<00:05:16.190> in<00:05:16.340> a<00:05:16.520> momentary

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
a momentary pitch up in a momentary

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.230 
a momentary pitch up in a momentary
pitch<00:05:17.360> down<00:05:17.919> and<00:05:18.919> then<00:05:19.159> the<00:05:19.460> effects<00:05:20.000> which

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
pitch down and then the effects which

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.640 
pitch down and then the effects which
gives<00:05:20.900> us<00:05:21.050> an<00:05:21.229> effect<00:05:21.560> macro<00:05:22.120> with<00:05:23.120> the<00:05:23.650> any

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
gives us an effect macro with the any

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.830 
gives us an effect macro with the any
any<00:05:25.159> active<00:05:25.639> effect<00:05:26.000> when<00:05:26.210> you<00:05:26.300> sweep<00:05:26.570> this

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
any active effect when you sweep this

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.020 
any active effect when you sweep this
will<00:05:27.080> actually<00:05:27.470> sweep<00:05:27.830> habu<00:05:28.400> with<00:05:28.849> the

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
will actually sweep habu with the

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.719 
will actually sweep habu with the
