that<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.739> been<00:00:58.829> thrown<00:00:59.010> there<00:00:59.340> with<00:00:59.910> some

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
that have been thrown there with some

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.310 
that have been thrown there with some
bird<00:01:00.270> marks<00:01:00.719> running<00:01:01.680> all<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.070> way<00:01:02.100> back<00:01:02.430> down

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
bird marks running all the way back down

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.510 
bird marks running all the way back down
on<00:01:04.320> into<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.129> back<00:01:06.170> checking<00:01:07.170> each<00:01:07.520> terminal

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
on into the back checking each terminal

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.120 
on into the back checking each terminal
because<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.450> lot<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.780> times<00:01:09.990> these<00:01:10.619> terminals

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
because a lot of times these terminals

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.350 
because a lot of times these terminals
can't<00:01:11.340> handle<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> juice<00:01:11.939> that's<00:01:12.150> running

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
can't handle the juice that's running

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.090 
can't handle the juice that's running
through<00:01:12.630> them<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.200> they'll<00:01:13.350> actually<00:01:13.500> spark

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
through them so they'll actually spark

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.160 
through them so they'll actually spark
part<00:01:14.430> fairly<00:01:15.420> easy<00:01:15.570> fix

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
part fairly easy fix

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.410 
part fairly easy fix
now<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.159> everything<00:01:17.400> checks<00:01:17.820> out<00:01:17.970> there<00:01:18.240> go

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
now if everything checks out there go

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.070 
now if everything checks out there go
ahead<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.750> put<00:01:18.900> your<00:01:18.930> screws<00:01:19.290> back<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:21.080> now

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
ahead and put your screws back in now

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.550 
ahead and put your screws back in now
we're<00:01:22.200> going<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.380> flip<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.890> stove<00:01:23.130> around

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
we're going to flip the stove around

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.070 
we're going to flip the stove around
on<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.460> back<00:01:25.640> here<00:01:25.940> it<00:01:26.510> looks<00:01:26.659> like<00:01:26.810> we<00:01:26.930> have

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
on the back here it looks like we have

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.649 
on the back here it looks like we have
quarter-inch<00:01:27.920> screws<00:01:28.640> holding<00:01:29.150> it<00:01:29.240> in<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:29.630> we

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
quarter-inch screws holding it in so we

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:30.969 
quarter-inch screws holding it in so we
want<00:01:29.869> to<00:01:29.930> go<00:01:29.990> ahead<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:30.260> take<00:01:30.380> this<00:01:30.530> top<00:01:30.799> panel

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
want to go ahead and take this top panel

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:43.090 
want to go ahead and take this top panel
off<00:01:40.210> now<00:01:41.210> again<00:01:41.540> you<00:01:42.259> have<00:01:42.290> a<00:01:42.440> bunch<00:01:42.740> of<00:01:42.860> wires

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
off now again you have a bunch of wires

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.440 
off now again you have a bunch of wires
running<00:01:43.430> through<00:01:43.550> here<00:01:43.820> so<00:01:44.030> you<00:01:44.119> want<00:01:44.300> to<00:01:44.360> go

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
running through here so you want to go

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.060 
running through here so you want to go
ahead<00:01:44.540> and<00:01:44.750> check<00:01:44.869> every<00:01:45.320> single<00:01:45.500> terminal

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
ahead and check every single terminal

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.370 
ahead and check every single terminal
end<00:01:46.250> making<00:01:47.000> sure<00:01:47.149> you<00:01:47.450> don't<00:01:47.690> have<00:01:47.840> any<00:01:48.020> burnt

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
end making sure you don't have any burnt

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.660 
end making sure you don't have any burnt
terminal<00:01:48.860> ends<00:01:49.149> you<00:01:50.149> can<00:01:50.299> check<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:50.720> back<00:01:50.960> of

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
terminal ends you can check the back of

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.950 
terminal ends you can check the back of
this<00:01:52.670> circuit<00:01:53.119> board<00:01:53.330> here<00:01:53.479> make<00:01:53.659> sure<00:01:53.690> there

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
this circuit board here make sure there

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.289 
this circuit board here make sure there
isn't<00:01:54.080> any<00:01:54.320> charred<00:01:54.680> marks<00:01:55.040> if<00:01:55.220> there<00:01:55.490> are<00:01:55.640> you
