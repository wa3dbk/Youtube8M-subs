00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
thing we just were kind of playing for

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.039 
thing we just were kind of playing for
fun<00:00:11.370> you<00:00:11.610> can<00:00:11.759> tell<00:00:11.880> he's<00:00:12.090> playing<00:00:12.330> random<00:00:12.780> and

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
fun you can tell he's playing random and

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.620 
fun you can tell he's playing random and
I<00:00:13.830> just<00:00:14.190> decided<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.849> know<00:00:15.000> why<00:00:15.210> not<00:00:15.420> make

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
I just decided you know why not make

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.150 
I just decided you know why not make
some<00:00:15.660> kind<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.230> pseudo<00:00:16.560> series<00:00:16.890> out<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.100> this

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
some kind of pseudo series out of this

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.620 
some kind of pseudo series out of this
so<00:00:17.310> that's<00:00:17.490> exactly<00:00:17.640> what<00:00:18.090> I'm<00:00:18.210> doing<00:00:18.240> let<00:00:18.539> me

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
so that's exactly what I'm doing let me

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.060 
so that's exactly what I'm doing let me
adjust<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:19.109> sound<00:00:19.380> those<00:00:19.590> here<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.859> think

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
adjust to sound those here I think

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.640 
adjust to sound those here I think
they're<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.220> bit<00:00:20.340> high<00:00:20.520> actually<00:00:21.109> there<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.470> go

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
they're a bit high actually there we go

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.490 
they're a bit high actually there we go
and<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> catch<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.300> Spanish<00:00:24.900> hua<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.230> not

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
and so the catch is Spanish hua is not

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.769 
and so the catch is Spanish hua is not
going<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.800> play<00:00:25.949> zerg<00:00:26.939> every<00:00:27.359> single<00:00:27.599> time

something crazy he loves the cheese with

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.600 
something crazy he loves the cheese with
the<00:01:45.030> terran<00:01:45.270> protoss<00:01:45.659> he<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.500> toorak<00:01:47.250> seeing

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
the terran protoss he is toorak seeing

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.030 
the terran protoss he is toorak seeing
but<00:01:48.119> not<00:01:48.329> next<00:01:48.780> day<00:01:48.990> his<00:01:49.170> ramp<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.649> he's<00:01:49.829> kind

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
but not next day his ramp so he's kind

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.710 
but not next day his ramp so he's kind
of<00:01:50.100> hiding<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.970> what<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.450> going<00:01:51.600> to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
of hiding it and what this is going to

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.510 
of hiding it and what this is going to
do<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.110> when<00:01:52.290> i<00:01:52.320> come<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.799> eat<00:01:52.890> when<00:01:53.159> i<00:01:53.189> come<00:01:53.399> in

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
do is when i come and eat when i come in

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.219 
do is when i come and eat when i come in
and<00:01:53.700> actually<00:01:53.820> scout<00:01:54.299> him<00:01:54.479> i'll<00:01:54.960> probably

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
and actually scout him i'll probably

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.560 
and actually scout him i'll probably
like<00:01:55.770> not<00:01:56.070> say<00:01:56.280> anything<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.790> then<00:01:56.850> i'll<00:01:57.360> run

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
like not say anything and then i'll run

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.090 
like not say anything and then i'll run
out<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.750> his<00:01:57.960> base<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.439> just<00:01:58.530> try<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.740> scout

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
out of his base and just try to scout

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.249 
out of his base and just try to scout
like<00:01:59.310> maybe<00:01:59.790> some<00:02:00.030> rocks<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.450> down<00:02:00.600> here<00:02:01.049> or

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
like maybe some rocks is down here or

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.289 
like maybe some rocks is down here or
over<00:02:01.560> here<00:02:01.610> something<00:02:02.610> like<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.180> i'll

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
over here something like that and i'll

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.240 
over here something like that and i'll
never<00:02:03.479> be<00:02:03.630> able<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.810> scout<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.079> but<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.070> only

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
never be able to scout it but the only

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.310 
never be able to scout it but the only
downside<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.719> while<00:02:07.020> he<00:02:07.200> is

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
downside this to this is while he is

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.900 
downside this to this is while he is
hiding<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.829> he's<00:02:08.039> going<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.280> have<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.459> lift<00:02:08.729> off

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
hiding it he's going to have to lift off

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.460 
hiding it he's going to have to lift off
and<00:02:09.119> probably<00:02:09.330> land<00:02:09.599> right<00:02:09.899> here<00:02:09.929> which<00:02:10.349> I'm

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
and probably land right here which I'm

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.999 
and probably land right here which I'm
assuming

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
assuming

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.770 
assuming
do<00:02:11.220> otherwise<00:02:11.909> Marines<00:02:12.269> will<00:02:12.390> have<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.599> run

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
do otherwise Marines will have to run

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.720 
do otherwise Marines will have to run
much<00:02:13.049> much<00:02:13.590> further<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.220> his<00:02:14.400> two<00:02:14.549> wrecks

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
much much further and his two wrecks

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.429 
much much further and his two wrecks
will<00:02:14.849> be<00:02:14.939> a<00:02:14.970> lot<00:02:15.120> slower<00:02:15.299> is<00:02:15.900> he<00:02:16.019> gonna<00:02:16.140> live<00:02:16.319> up

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
will be a lot slower is he gonna live up

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.319 
will be a lot slower is he gonna live up
no<00:02:16.620> he's<00:02:16.799> gonna<00:02:16.950> go<00:02:17.129> straight<00:02:17.519> into<00:02:17.760> Marines

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
no he's gonna go straight into Marines

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.059 
no he's gonna go straight into Marines
and<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.959> don't<00:02:19.140> agree<00:02:19.349> with<00:02:19.439> this<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.769> think<00:02:19.980> he

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
and I don't agree with this I think he

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.440 
and I don't agree with this I think he
would<00:02:20.159> be<00:02:20.280> better<00:02:20.430> off<00:02:20.549> lifting<00:02:20.970> up<00:02:21.090> landing

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
would be better off lifting up landing

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.240 
would be better off lifting up landing
down<00:02:21.540> here<00:02:21.870> or<00:02:22.290> just<00:02:22.560> building<00:02:22.890> down<00:02:23.010> here<00:02:23.189> in

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
down here or just building down here in

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.649 
down here or just building down here in
the<00:02:23.340> first<00:02:23.519> place<00:02:23.610> we're<00:02:24.030> just<00:02:24.209> building<00:02:24.329> over

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
the first place we're just building over

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.149 
the first place we're just building over
here<00:02:24.689> this<00:02:24.989> is<00:02:25.170> kind<00:02:25.409> of<00:02:25.500> strange<00:02:25.739> he<00:02:26.069> is

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
here this is kind of strange he is

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.160 
here this is kind of strange he is
hiding<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.579> but<00:02:26.730> actually<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.750> don't<00:02:27.959> think<00:02:28.110> I

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
hiding it but actually I don't think I

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.500 
hiding it but actually I don't think I
even<00:02:28.200> scouted<00:02:29.069> no<00:02:29.549> i<00:02:29.579> have<00:02:29.849> not<00:02:29.879> scattered<00:02:30.420> at

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
couple of reasons one I went gasps first

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.319 
couple of reasons one I went gasps first
which<00:02:44.069> is<00:02:44.190> pretty<00:02:44.340> much<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.670> hard<00:02:44.909> can<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.150> to

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
which is pretty much a hard can it to

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.390 
which is pretty much a hard can it to

any fast barracks build as long as you

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.770 
any fast barracks build as long as you
don't<00:02:47.549> get<00:02:47.640> bunker<00:02:47.940> doubt<00:02:48.090> which<00:02:48.390> actually

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
don't get bunker doubt which actually

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.099 
don't get bunker doubt which actually
might<00:02:49.200> happen<00:02:49.680> oh<00:02:50.329> look<00:02:51.329> sees<00:02:51.690> going<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.019> push

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
might happen oh look sees going to push

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.530 
might happen oh look sees going to push
up<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.290> try<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.500> do<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.769> and<00:02:52.920> secondly<00:02:53.730> I

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
up and try to do it and secondly I

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.030 
up and try to do it and secondly I
figure<00:02:55.139> what<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.290> was<00:02:55.379> gonna<00:02:55.470> say<00:02:55.560> this<00:02:55.799> map<00:02:56.010> is

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
figure what I was gonna say this map is

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.940 
figure what I was gonna say this map is
so<00:02:56.280> huge<00:02:56.639> that's<00:02:56.819> why<00:02:57.049> this<00:02:58.049> map<00:02:58.290> is<00:02:58.319> gigantic

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
so huge that's why this map is gigantic

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.740 
so huge that's why this map is gigantic
