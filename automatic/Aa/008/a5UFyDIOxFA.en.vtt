00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.480
 but 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.190
 hello everyone with you fil and alfen matte 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.230
 I didn't wait for the bridegroom warrant 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.379
 laid on this game no special 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.960
 hope turns out to be in vain because the game 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.059
 It turned out just gorgeous real 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.760
 yum and in this video I will tell 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.760
 why alone 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.540
 the game begins at the time of the second 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.970
 world war when if young captain 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.460
 blaskowitz with his bravo team 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.810
 went on a combat mission where he 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.570
 should be destroyed 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.159
 Nazi's super dangerous weapon and lingering 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.560
 the first nucleus seemed to me 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.810
 boring and i 'm like that i'm in vain 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.049
 everything started to play here we first 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.729
 throw off the extra load of a falling plane 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.420
 here we run from two mechanical 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.119
 dogs 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.460
 we lay out the Nazis here we already need 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.770
 love with a huge cannon huge 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.710
 the robot then from the water from some building 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.630
 where is the general dash itself 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.130
 be it sounds cool but really 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.959
 played tasty 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.880
 In general, in the end this whole mission 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:45.990
 failed the team was our hero 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.360
 tormenting where 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.959
 and the captain himself rules a serious injury 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 heads 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:53.729
 is in a mental hospital, he spends 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.399
 there are already 14 years old watching everything 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.830
 happening every time the Nazi 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.450
 will dismiss patients on experiments each time 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.110
 more and more people don't 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.300
 come back for the most 14 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.610
 years blaskowitz falls in love with one of 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.190
 nurses and here one fine moment 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.650
 Nazi can on experiences and and 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.410
 and finally after this terrible for 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.870
 the main 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.690
 events he comes so to speak in 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.690
 consciousness and here the real meat begins 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.690
 brutal eye forges knife cuts 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.720
 the throat is full is a weighty shotgun and 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.420
 gone-gone early we clean crazy 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.030
 the hospital from the nazis doused her with blood and 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.130
 scattering pieces of fritz meat then on 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.630
 the street we find the beloved eye 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.900
 seems named anna 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:57.820
 I take the girl to her parents and here 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.340
 it is already clear that the new 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.830
 wolfenstein is really quite good how 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.870
 cool-developed characters in the game all 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.450
 shown and told just on the highest 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.340
 level you can see that the characters are alive 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.340
 humane and unique 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.960
 want to eat this x3 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:28.900
 to that you take arman Lare yuri 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.900
 visor 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.849
 the plot of the developments is the field 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.489
 games are all right 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.350
 playing is very interesting and exciting but 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.229
 in addition to the excellent plot in the game 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.870
 Of course there is an action and it is necessary here 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:27.660
 say hurricane cheerful and with huge 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.479
 abundance of blood in general, then that's the way 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.150
 Gainer loves you waiting for a liter of blood the way 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.430
 regarded and not transmitted message from 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.039
 boevki generally enjoy 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.500
 Kills Fritz will help you a small but 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:43.020
 quite good arsenal shotgun two 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.870
 types of guns and name guns over the years 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.120
 Perhaps the most interesting thing is that almost all 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.580
 types of weapons can be taken in two hands and 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.889
 arrange a real bloodbath 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.190
 by the way besides the main arsenal here 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.840
 there is also a piece that can be cut 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.360
 metal grates and go through 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.400
 unfortunately almost all of them 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.190
 are placed strictly places 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.080
 location still ulf rishtan senor 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.090
 impossible not to love for style and 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.740
 atmosphere on psychic britain by 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.270
 the course of the game you will meet many 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.210
 records with music 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.190
 campaign posters of old advertising and 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.199
 other attributes of those times 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.060
 sometimes you just want to take a walk 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.550
 city ​​and look at the surrounding 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.889
 we do not kill the area but to 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.900
 Unfortunately this can not be done well, 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.360
 of course you will like the famous 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.880
 peripetia songs in german 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.400
 I for example went through Dracula for a couple of weeks 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.380
 back and still listening to the soundtrack from 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.780
 games did not like wolfenstein the new 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.960
 order perhaps only that the boss in it 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.060
 Well, it's very sad and 1 type seems to be and 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.260
 there is one giant robot seemingly and 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.840
 there are bosses 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.330
 yes smaller but perhaps the problem is 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.500
 that this is a robot and they look the same 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.990
 and boring 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.480
 hope was for the main villain very 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.280
 charismatic general skull but 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.440
 final battle with him anyway 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.660
 It turned out to be some kind of picked and tightened 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.600
 I would like to say separately about the graphics 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.010
 what is fat there is but nothing special 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.770
 and expect not to 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.800
 watched the whole game pleasant but no more 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.680
 that picture however that should be 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.630
 at present not joking again and in fact in 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.320
 shooters grafon perhaps not the most important 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:25.710
 and so what do we end up with at this 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.220
 moment is one of the best games of 2014 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.160
 of the year 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.710
 and certainly the best shooter for this year 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.230
 if you still think no brothers then my 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.630
 The answer will definitely not take 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:39.420
 wondering get not only smart 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:42.150
 boevko but also a great plot expressive 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.940
 characters and cool soundtrack to boot 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:47.370
 the game wolfenstein order themselves I will leave 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.350
 deserved 9 points out of 10 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.750
 Well, that's all if you liked it 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.180
 video do not forget to like and 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.130
