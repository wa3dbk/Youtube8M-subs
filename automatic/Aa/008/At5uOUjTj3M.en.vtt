00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.110
 hello everyone like I'm the doctor swim 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.180
 I bring a new video from the series of 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.580
 thyroid as promised on the page 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.320
 facebook channel 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.419
 remember to subscribe to the channel here 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.520
 the button below to the page 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.680
 facebook that I leave the link in the 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.930
 description here every day play 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.960
 trivial medical cycles and asses by the 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.150
 style and do not forget to like the video 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.160
 that's why it's very important for 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.160
 make these videos that enjoy it 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.729
 the thyroid is wrapped in a thin 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.619
 connective tissue capsule figured 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.110
 elastic that helps maintain the 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.750
 gland in your position and you can see 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.590
 here surrounding the gland 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.679
 in white 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.750
 under this southern line in turn this 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:21.670
 capsule 50 rolls by a pod by 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.130
 from the external neurotic 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.609
 cervical aponeurosis middle pre trachea 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.819
 which we illustrate here with this line 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:29.819
 blue 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.369
 on the posterior side the gland is 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.350
 attached to the thyroid cartilage at 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.850
 trachea and the muscles click or pharynx 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.040
 by means of a thickening of the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.210
 aponeurosis that forms the ligament 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.210
 barry suspensory 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.159
 this is the typical histological aspect of 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.579
 the thyroid gland in an attention of 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.710
 matos and linneo without the capsule emits some 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.869
 fine fibrous partitions between which 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.590
 travel the blood and lymphatic vessels 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.179
 and nervous inside the thyroid 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.250
 these same partitions divide the 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.440
 thyroid parenchyma in 'low beds of 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.989
 various sizes separated by tissue 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.849
 connecting each of these lobules 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.580
 or so it is not formed by a single 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.130
 specialized thyroid epithelium layer 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.950
 or follicular epithelium that rests on the 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.900
 basal lamina which in turn are 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.209
 formed by the functional unit and 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.980
 structural of the gland that is the 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.690
 thyroid follicle and that we see here 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.849
 also here you can observe the 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.239
 variability in shape and size of 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.590
 follicles the follicle morphology 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.510
 varies in relation to the activity of the 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.129
 gland when it is in 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.900
 state of intense activity 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.360
 the cells are bulky and the 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.459
 Follicle color material is sparse 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.190
 while in idle state the 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.739
 colon volume what is this pink that 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.410
 there is here is increased and the cells 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.150
 follicles are flattened this is 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.549
 because the color d is the place of 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.959
 reserve of thyroid hormones that 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.000
 they are synthesized by the cells 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.280
 epithelial globulin shot 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.099
 when the organism through the 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.049
 hormone threw trophic pituitary otc well 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.209
 it requires the release of hormones 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.430
 thyroid cells are extracted from 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.500
 color of the globulin shot that is 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.239
 directed to the bloodstream of this 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.370
 form during the active phase of 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.980
 secretion the cells increase in size 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.660
 when they are in the phase of activity and 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.640
 they decrease when they are working 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.829
 reduced pace under normal conditions 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.260
 the color that can accumulate up to 30 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.129
 times the necessary amount of hormones 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.129
 thyroid 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.470
 here you can see the thyroid follicle 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.720
 the follicle is a unique structure 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.370
 between the endocrine glands because 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.430
 can hold a lot of hormone 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.659
 inactive in an extracellular space this 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.480
 it means that they are essentially 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:02.950
 Storage compartments 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.930
 inside out they are composed by the 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.060
 color of which is the central cavity 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.190
 occupied by a physical material support 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.590
 gym composed mainly by 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.409
 thyroglobulin that stores the hormone 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.289
 thyroid in inactive form cells 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:19.030
 follicular sotirios scalar milestones 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.620
 on the basal lamina where 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.620
 they find blood capillaries and 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.020
 lymphatics and nerves these cells 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.539
 their height is regularly arranged 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.520
 it depends on the functional state being 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:34.210
 cubic in the absence of stimulation by 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.910
 13h and cylindrical in presence 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.800
 and finally the last component of 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.009
 thyroid follicles are the cells for 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.900
 follicular or cells that are cells 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.849
 clear that participate in the regulation 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.440
 of calcium administration and 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:49.830
 phosphorus through the production of 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.830
 calcitonin 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.169
 here we have another histological preparation 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.349
 of thyroid tissue where you see a lot 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.789
 better then the follicle components 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:02.860
 we are going to enlarge this follicle here 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.210
 so that we write the characteristics 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.620
 histological features of each of the 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.900
 components of it 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.180
 let's start with ecological 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.949
 remember that the color of this 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.710
 composed of a material protein action 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:17.030
 amorphous rich in globulin shot that 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.910
 contains the residues of the future 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.370
 thyroid hormones in their inactive form 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.800
 it is like this or intense edge and therefore of 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.660
 dyed rose with it without and is this 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.880
 what we see here 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.160
 the follicular cells that are all 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.560
 what are we seeing here forming 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.300
 a simple cubic epithelium is to say that 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.580
 are arranged in a single layer as 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.890
 I already showed you and are united by desmo 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.740
 shadows remember that they produce the 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.950
 hormone 374 have a plasma site 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.510
 phylum acid and a spherical basal nucleus 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.280
 they have short micro villi in the 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.500
 extreme applies the and the color of that 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.870
 here we can not observe and have 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.970
 abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.270
 and secretory vesicles and pines and tics 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.550
 of color resorption 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.040
 another component are the cells for 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.410
 follicular that are these that they see by 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.810
 here that are part of the follicle but not 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.180
 they contact the color of and you are 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:15.090
 in the basal lamina secrete calcitonin 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.090
 he made a row row and lonely acid 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.960
 to finish from this preparation 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.630
 count the structures of the follicles 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.630
 of colors 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.940
 from facebook so you can discard it 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.280
 this has been all for today they can 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.860
 subscribe malaysia we go for growing 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.080
 information about the new videos 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.300
 I promise that each of these best 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.340
 follow us on facebook and naut medicines 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:50.650
 from smell it does a description and not 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.650
 forget we'll see each other
