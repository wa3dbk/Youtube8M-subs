00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.890
 the way this magnets are ordinary such here 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.710
 office magnets bought them in the usual 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.969
 the stationery store is called something 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.190
 there magnets are colored for magnetic boards 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.510
 I did a master class I will give a reference 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.010
 to this master class 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.960
 there are all very easy to understand and I'm already 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.879
 even surprised because the usual 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.129
 master class doing nothing in not 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.859
 hands-hooks I canâ€™t do anything 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.610
 Here is on this master class the author his 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.520
 Galina is housed at a craft fair and 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.200
 crafts fairs 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.530
 here's a reference I will leave everything there 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.049
 I understand the main thing that I understood it so that 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.990
 magnets there was such a hollow where 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.170
 canvas can be attached 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.520
 glue more precisely glue used 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.070
 moment crystal 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.340
 very good glue it is recommended for 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.640
 fabrics and for different surfaces here 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.600
 get a train there master class 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.150
 another train is given another scheme and you 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.360
 kids khimki have a whole story made to me 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.509
 her masha well you know waving and remember and 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.659
 which did not know me pepe yes that 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.960
 Masha herself and she made me more precise 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.170
 bought not this scheme she can just 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.390
 make the letters raise the child and so 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.009
 I will not leave the schemes for sale either 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:05.399
 can credit and I even higher it was on and 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.429
 at probably 2013 I bought konfu 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.069
 went to the store and bought a canvas gamma 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.760
 gamma strings and went out and here is such a miracle 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.340
 a train 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.690
 here of course is a cross 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.300
 oblique curves can see them like this 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.690
 so I embroidered of course this thing to me 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.239
 I did not like everything, I decided that after 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.510
 zhid may sometime send somehow 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:32.629
 hands reach and now fate decreed 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.260
 in such a way that my hands reached me 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.340
 did 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.930
 caught my eye this master class 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.849
 the only thing that changed it 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:46.670
 I embroidered it on go 20 accounts and so 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.310
 I didn't like colored magnets 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.290
 so they shine through the fabric and I 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.360
 planted embroidery on non-woven fabric 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.930
 Well, you see, they don't care how 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.049
 a little bit so shine well a whole not 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.260
 I like it very well 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:05.959
 I think the baby's mother will like it too 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.230
 today I want or donate and I want 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:12.230
 hang on the fridge secretly from her 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.410
 while we are visiting, we will see how 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.370
 quickly she will notice the appearance of being evicted a 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.530
 who trains and only very cool 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.380
 you can not only train to embroider at all 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.810
 you just need letters just a digit either 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:31.700
 some faces or something else 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.230
 cool and well i guess i'm all 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.040
 told if you have any questions 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:40.569
 ask on this all until new meetings 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.569
