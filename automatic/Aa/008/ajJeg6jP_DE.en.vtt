 I'm very happy to be with you once 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.459
 more because I had not had the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.349
 willingness to upload videos or the 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:16.080
 creativity so to speak but good 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.060
 I'm very pleased because I'm once 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.610
 more with you as they already know me 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.740

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.580
 today I come to bring you another 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:33.500
 video tutorial in which I will show you 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.510
 how to put password to an usb without the 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.540
 need for any program using the 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.610
 windows 7 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.360
 well the first thing we're going to do is go 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.550
 at the beginning then let's go to a team 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.090
 team time as you see here is already my 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.670
 usb memory we will identify and be 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.040
 connected then we 're going to go to the panel 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.610
 control once in control panel 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:02.410
 let's go to security system 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.410
 here we are going to go to bitlocker 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.520
 here bit longer encryption and as you see 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.020
 here we see my hard drive which is the 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.970
 local cálculo ce and my diamantes usbmical 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.180
 let's do is give activate bitlocker 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.590
 in your usb memory you already identify 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.840
 with the name that you have 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.329
 and he's going to load this and it's going to come out 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.900
 a message saying do not remove the 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.030
 usb 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.940
 well now we just wait for it to finish 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.980
 to load the analysis when it's finished 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.870
 of loading we will leave this what 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.050
 Let's do is give 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:45.870
 use a password to block the 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.870
 unit and here we put our password 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.840
 and below we repeat 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.880
 Now let's give the following 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.159
 this is going to come out of here I would 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.860
 I recommend in keeping great key of 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.410
 recovery of a file just in case 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.220
 in case they forgot to forget their 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.690
 key 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.180
 have a 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.640
 recovery file then I will 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.100
 I'm going to give you and text files 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.780
 and they keep it where you want 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.550
 and in this case I'm going to save it in 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.530
 desk and we give next 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.480
 and once ready for this we are going to give 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.750
 start encryption 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.299
 here it is going to load us this alone 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.340
 we wait for all this to load up and 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.260
 well this is a bit slow then 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.670
 I will pause and see you when you are 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.980
 loaded and good guys now I'm not going to 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.459
 let it load everything because it's a good 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.500
 time and then right now as I said 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.959
 I did not have much availability with 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.599
 I'm doing this video but 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.970
 all for you because then as I already 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.750
 I mentioned before thanks to you and 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.780
 I am a partner 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.310
 but well, I will simply explain what 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.980
 what will happen when I finish loading 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.710
 when you finish you will have this 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.290
 symbol here 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.050
 When you insert your s vélez you will ask for the 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.170
 Password when you insert the password 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.480
 will decompress something like all 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.670
 the files that the memory contains and 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.080
 Well, your files would be as if 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.650
 nothing but if someone does not know the 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.770
 password can not see or enter your 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.770
 usb well and good I hope you served them
