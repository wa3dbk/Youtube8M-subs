12-point tip that goes into the
Volkswagen<00:00:19.760> axles<00:00:20.779> bolts<00:00:23.269> and<00:00:24.269> just<00:00:24.930> use<00:00:25.109> my

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
Volkswagen axles bolts and just use my

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.060 
Volkswagen axles bolts and just use my
air<00:00:25.410> tool<00:00:25.680> on<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.279> end<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.609> whip<00:00:26.939> them<00:00:27.029> off

air tool on the end and whip them off

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.859 
air tool on the end and whip them off
then<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.160> can<00:00:29.340> pull<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.730> motor<00:00:29.910> out<00:00:30.029> while<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
then I can pull the motor out while the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.530 
then I can pull the motor out while the
axle<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.349> just<00:00:31.560> drop<00:00:31.830> down<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.189> hang<00:00:32.540> then

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
axle is just drop down and hang then

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.260 
axle is just drop down and hang then
once<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.989> motors<00:00:34.290> pulled<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.920> can<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:35.760> shove

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
once the motors pulled I can just shove

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.330 
once the motors pulled I can just shove
the<00:00:36.450> axle<00:00:36.870> through<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.800> drop<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.309> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the axle through and drop it on the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.310 
the axle through and drop it on the
ground<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.879> don't<00:00:39.090> even<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.660> undo<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
ground I don't even have to undo the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.860 
ground I don't even have to undo the
steering<00:00:41.219> knuckle<00:00:41.579> or<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.210> ball<00:00:42.390> joint<00:00:42.629> nut

steering knuckle or the ball joint nut
at<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.110> bottom<00:00:43.320> much<00:00:44.250> more<00:00:44.460> simpler<00:00:44.820> than

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
at the bottom much more simpler than

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.959 
at the bottom much more simpler than
doing<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.300> with<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.750> Chrysler<00:00:45.989> style

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
doing it with like the Chrysler style

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.970 
doing it with like the Chrysler style
and<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.360> mentioned<00:00:48.750> before<00:00:48.780> if<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.770> was

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
and like I mentioned before if this was

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.160 
and like I mentioned before if this was
a<00:00:50.010> Chrysler<00:00:50.340> motor<00:00:50.700> there<00:00:51.570> would<00:00:51.719> be<00:00:51.750> three

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
a Chrysler motor there would be three

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.959 
a Chrysler motor there would be three
bolts<00:00:52.530> here<00:00:52.680> holding<00:00:53.100> up<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> transmission

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
bolts here holding up the transmission

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.510 
bolts here holding up the transmission
on<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.829> modification<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.980> made<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
on the modification I made on the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.279 
on the modification I made on the
Volkswagen<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.180> put<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> new<00:00:57.629> motor<00:00:57.809> mount<00:00:58.140> on

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
Volkswagen I put a new motor mount on

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.439 
Volkswagen I put a new motor mount on
where<00:00:58.530> there<00:00:58.649> didn't<00:00:58.949> used<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.190> be<00:00:59.399> one<00:00:59.640> but

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
where there didn't used to be one but

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.819 
where there didn't used to be one but
there<00:01:00.629> was<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.780> good<00:01:01.020> place<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.289> put<00:01:01.559> one<00:01:01.739> in

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
there was a good place to put one in

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.260 
there was a good place to put one in
there<00:01:01.949> anyways<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:03.660> has<00:01:03.840> two<00:01:04.019> bolts<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
there anyways and it has two bolts and

there anyways and it has two bolts and
there's<00:01:06.270> one<00:01:06.510> bolt<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.080> hole<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:08.220> can

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
there's one bolt in this hole you can

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.920 
there's one bolt in this hole you can
get<00:01:08.460> access<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.299> take<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.659> plastic

got the tool in place every time I

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.770 
got the tool in place every time I
install<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.950> little<00:01:53.280> bit<00:01:53.509> into<00:01:54.509> one<00:01:54.659> of

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780

here<00:04:49.110> and<00:04:50.110> that's<00:04:50.590> one<00:04:51.130> bolt<00:04:51.400> that<00:04:51.580> broke<00:04:51.820> it

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
here and that's one bolt that broke it

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:53.760 
here and that's one bolt that broke it
looks<00:04:52.720> like<00:04:52.840> the<00:04:52.960> other<00:04:53.080> bolt<00:04:53.320> didn't<00:04:53.620> break

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
looks like the other bolt didn't break

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.159 
looks like the other bolt didn't break
it<00:04:53.919> was<00:04:54.039> a<00:04:54.070> piece<00:04:54.310> of<00:04:54.340> the<00:04:54.550> flange<00:04:54.849> and<00:04:55.210> then

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
it was a piece of the flange and then

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.350 
it was a piece of the flange and then
another<00:04:56.409> one<00:04:56.650> broke<00:04:56.889> back<00:04:57.159> there<00:04:57.490> I<00:04:57.669> think<00:04:58.240> I

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
another one broke back there I think I

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.790 
another one broke back there I think I
can<00:04:58.509> get<00:04:58.630> them<00:04:58.780> all<00:04:58.930> out<00:04:58.960> looks<00:04:59.380> all<00:04:59.620> you

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
can get them all out looks all you

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.450 
can get them all out looks all you
enough<00:05:00.039> that<00:05:00.190> they're<00:05:00.310> not<00:05:00.430> seized<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:03.370> of

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
enough that they're not seized and of

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.570 
enough that they're not seized and of
course<00:05:03.699> it's<00:05:03.880> turbo<00:05:04.740> that's<00:05:05.740> a<00:05:05.889> good<00:05:06.130> turbo

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
course it's turbo that's a good turbo

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.080 
course it's turbo that's a good turbo
the<00:05:07.240> way<00:05:07.389> you<00:05:07.449> tell<00:05:07.780> is<00:05:08.190> almost<00:05:09.190> no<00:05:09.490> side<00:05:09.820> play

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
the way you tell is almost no side play

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.900 
the way you tell is almost no side play
on<00:05:10.240> the<00:05:10.360> shaft<00:05:10.659> and<00:05:11.099> it<00:05:12.099> spins<00:05:12.430> free

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
on the shaft and it spins free

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.130 
on the shaft and it spins free
and<00:05:13.840> you<00:05:14.800> don't<00:05:15.010> see<00:05:15.310> like<00:05:16.270> grinding<00:05:16.780> marks

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
and you don't see like grinding marks

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.380 
and you don't see like grinding marks

still uses the VW alternator that they
wire<00:05:47.380> pretty<00:05:47.680> much<00:05:47.860> the<00:05:47.980> same<00:05:48.130> as<00:05:48.310> a<00:05:48.340> Chrysler

the<00:05:55.330> part<00:05:55.600> with<00:05:55.750> all<00:05:55.870> the<00:05:56.020> bolts<00:05:56.320> I<00:05:56.440> showed<00:05:56.710> you

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
the part with all the bolts I showed you

that bolts to those flanges this

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.550 
that bolts to those flanges this
Volkswagen<00:06:00.030> and<00:06:01.030> I<00:06:01.420> machined<00:06:01.840> a<00:06:01.990> coupler<00:06:02.380> on<00:06:02.530> a

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
Volkswagen and I machined a coupler on a

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.190 
Volkswagen and I machined a coupler on a
lathe<00:06:02.970> at<00:06:03.970> a<00:06:04.090> different<00:06:04.480> size<00:06:04.660> hole<00:06:04.960> in<00:06:05.110> the

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
lathe at a different size hole in the

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.020 
lathe at a different size hole in the
coupler<00:06:05.590> here<00:06:05.830> in<00:06:06.010> a<00:06:06.220> different<00:06:06.580> size<00:06:06.700> hole

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
coupler here in a different size hole

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.730 
coupler here in a different size hole
here<00:06:07.300> because<00:06:07.630> Chrysler<00:06:08.020> and<00:06:08.170> Volkswagen

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
here because Chrysler and Volkswagen

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.710 
here because Chrysler and Volkswagen
have<00:06:08.890> different<00:06:09.310> diameter<00:06:09.730> axles<00:06:10.240> and<00:06:10.480> that's

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
have different diameter axles and that's

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.500 
have different diameter axles and that's
the<00:06:10.870> Chrysler<00:06:11.140> outer<00:06:11.560> end<00:06:12.210> then<00:06:13.210> it's<00:06:13.360> just

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
the Chrysler outer end then it's just

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.410 
the Chrysler outer end then it's just
welded<00:06:13.990> and<00:06:14.110> balanced<00:06:14.820> same<00:06:15.820> thing<00:06:16.090> with<00:06:16.240> that

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.420 
welded and balanced same thing with that

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.960 
welded and balanced same thing with that
axle<00:06:16.930> it<00:06:17.470> looks<00:06:17.680> factory<00:06:18.130> like<00:06:18.310> a<00:06:18.340> complete

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
axle it looks factory like a complete

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.540 
axle it looks factory like a complete
axle<00:06:19.390> but<00:06:19.570> actually<00:06:20.050> if<00:06:20.590> you<00:06:20.680> look<00:06:20.770> down<00:06:21.070> here

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
axle but actually if you look down here

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.670 
axle but actually if you look down here
there's<00:06:21.850> a<00:06:22.060> weld<00:06:22.360> and<00:06:22.840> this<00:06:22.960> is<00:06:23.110> a<00:06:23.140> hollow<00:06:23.410> axle

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
there's a weld and this is a hollow axle

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.250 
there's a weld and this is a hollow axle
so<00:06:24.520> I<00:06:24.550> did<00:06:24.790> the<00:06:24.910> same<00:06:24.940> thing<00:06:25.180> but<00:06:25.570> opposite<00:06:26.110> a

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 
so I did the same thing but opposite a

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.220 
so I did the same thing but opposite a
machined<00:06:26.890> a<00:06:27.010> solid<00:06:27.490> plug<00:06:28.030> that<00:06:28.660> went<00:06:28.840> inside

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:29.230 
machined a solid plug that went inside

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.590 
machined a solid plug that went inside
the<00:06:29.500> axle<00:06:29.920> different<00:06:30.850> diameter<00:06:31.210> here<00:06:31.420> and

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
the axle different diameter here and

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.320 
the axle different diameter here and
different<00:06:31.720> diameter<00:06:32.260> here<00:06:32.730> then<00:06:33.730> pressed

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
different diameter here then pressed

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.290 
different diameter here then pressed
both<00:06:34.540> pieces<00:06:34.900> together<00:06:35.640> and<00:06:36.640> welded<00:06:37.060> it<00:06:37.150> all

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
both pieces together and welded it all

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.530 
both pieces together and welded it all
the<00:06:37.420> way<00:06:37.510> around<00:06:37.600> and<00:06:38.790> balanced<00:06:39.790> it<00:06:39.970> well<00:06:40.510> I

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540 
the way around and balanced it well I

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.990 
the way around and balanced it well I
was<00:06:40.780> welding<00:06:40.990> it<00:06:41.370> did<00:06:42.370> all<00:06:42.520> about<00:06:42.730> nine<00:06:42.970> years

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 
was welding it did all about nine years

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000 
was welding it did all about nine years
ago<00:06:43.360> never<00:06:43.960> knew<00:06:44.230> if<00:06:44.380> it<00:06:44.440> was<00:06:44.560> going<00:06:44.740> to<00:06:44.800> last

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.010 
ago never knew if it was going to last

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.830 
ago never knew if it was going to last
because<00:06:45.280> I<00:06:45.520> never<00:06:45.910> welded<00:06:46.150> front<00:06:46.510> wheel<00:06:46.630> drive

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
because I never welded front wheel drive
