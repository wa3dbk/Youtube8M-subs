really had to to take a look at what is
a<00:03:02.330> size<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:03.110> we<00:03:03.260> can<00:03:03.440> manage<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:04.129> try<00:03:05.120> to

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
a size that we can manage and try to

a size that we can manage and try to
make<00:03:05.840> Halloween<00:03:06.340> smaller

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.199 

well<00:03:28.860> I<00:03:28.890> think<00:03:28.980> we<00:03:29.430> accomplished<00:03:29.970> our<00:03:30.150> goals

35,000 people a great team effort again

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.220 
35,000 people a great team effort again

administration and students and our
businesses<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:58.140> think<00:03:59.069> that<00:03:59.370> partnership

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
businesses I think that partnership

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.460 
businesses I think that partnership
proves<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:00.570> be<00:04:00.600> pretty<00:04:01.280> powerful<00:04:03.230> so<00:04:04.230> I<00:04:04.260> think

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
proves to be pretty powerful so I think

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.690 
proves to be pretty powerful so I think
a<00:04:05.720> lot<00:04:06.720> more<00:04:06.750> costumes<00:04:07.440> it<00:04:07.920> looked<00:04:08.190> like<00:04:08.370> this

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
a lot more costumes it looked like this

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.850 
a lot more costumes it looked like this
year<00:04:09.030> when<00:04:09.510> we<00:04:09.690> did<00:04:10.140> closed<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.650> street

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
year when we did closed the street

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.150 
year when we did closed the street
earlier<00:04:11.750> people<00:04:12.750> left<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.590> all<00:04:13.709> those<00:04:13.890> some

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
earlier people left and all those some

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.909 
earlier people left and all those some
grumbling<00:04:14.670> mostly<00:04:15.540> in<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.109> good<00:04:16.260> mood<00:04:16.500> about

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
grumbling mostly in a good mood about

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.610 
grumbling mostly in a good mood about
doing<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.370> so<00:04:18.239> that<00:04:18.450> means<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:19.019> me<00:04:19.169> that<00:04:19.200> they

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
doing that so that means to me that they

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.640 
doing that so that means to me that they
got<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:19.950> message<00:04:20.419> this<00:04:21.419> is<00:04:21.600> all<00:04:21.720> about<00:04:21.840> being

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
got the message this is all about being

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.000 
got the message this is all about being
safer<00:04:23.100> I<00:04:23.520> think<00:04:24.480> that's<00:04:24.690> a<00:04:25.010> major

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
safer I think that's a major

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.820 
safer I think that's a major
accomplishment<00:04:27.140> the<00:04:28.140> starting<00:04:28.530> point<00:04:28.740> is

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
accomplishment the starting point is

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.670 
accomplishment the starting point is
that<00:04:28.950> we<00:04:29.160> had<00:04:29.400> half<00:04:29.640> as<00:04:29.820> many<00:04:30.030> people<00:04:30.680> less

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
that we had half as many people less

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.200 
that we had half as many people less
than<00:04:31.919> half<00:04:32.130> as<00:04:32.280> many<00:04:32.430> people<00:04:32.820> so<00:04:32.970> it's<00:04:33.120> a

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
than half as many people so it's a

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.250 
than half as many people so it's a
smaller<00:04:33.540> crowd<00:04:34.100> therefore<00:04:35.100> easier<00:04:35.580> to<00:04:35.760> manage

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
smaller crowd therefore easier to manage

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.590 
smaller crowd therefore easier to manage
but<00:04:37.260> we<00:04:37.380> also<00:04:37.560> did<00:04:38.040> things<00:04:38.400> like<00:04:38.610> take<00:04:39.360> more

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
but we also did things like take more

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.680 
but we also did things like take more
control<00:04:40.020> of<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.320> event<00:04:40.620> like<00:04:41.490> announcing<00:04:42.479> we

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
control of the event like announcing we

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.300

leave the street when we told them we

were getting ready to
they're<00:04:52.520> back<00:04:52.669> up<00:04:52.910> so<00:04:53.660> we<00:04:54.110> didn't<00:04:54.380> have<00:04:54.410> to

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
they're back up so we didn't have to

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.310 
they're back up so we didn't have to
wait<00:04:54.860> to<00:04:55.790> see<00:04:56.030> when<00:04:56.300> the<00:04:56.449> crowd<00:04:56.690> was<00:04:56.990> willing

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
wait to see when the crowd was willing

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.590 
wait to see when the crowd was willing
to<00:04:57.350> leave<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:57.919> I<00:04:58.190> think<00:04:59.060> that's<00:04:59.240> a<00:04:59.360> testament

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
to leave and I think that's a testament

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.830

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
sure that the Public Works workers are

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.379 
sure that the Public Works workers are
safe<00:05:34.910> as<00:05:35.240> they<00:05:35.539> do<00:05:35.600> their<00:05:35.870> job<00:05:36.970> it<00:05:37.970> feels<00:05:38.180> good

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
safe as they do their job it feels good

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.500 
safe as they do their job it feels good
it<00:05:38.780> looks<00:05:39.380> good<00:05:39.590> it<00:05:39.830> looks<00:05:40.060> like<00:05:41.060> people<00:05:41.360> know

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
it looks good it looks like people know

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.570 
it looks good it looks like people know
what<00:05:41.660> they're<00:05:41.810> doing<00:05:41.840> and<00:05:42.350> so<00:05:43.220> I<00:05:43.280> think<00:05:43.370> the

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
what they're doing and so I think the

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.960 
what they're doing and so I think the
reaction<00:05:44.090> reflects<00:05:44.600> that<00:05:44.810> and<00:05:45.580> we<00:05:46.580> want<00:05:46.789> to

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
reaction reflects that and we want to

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.390 
reaction reflects that and we want to
keep<00:05:47.510> what<00:05:47.810> it<00:05:48.320> looked<00:05:48.620> like<00:05:48.770> on<00:05:48.979> the<00:05:49.010> street

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
keep what it looked like on the street

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.900 
keep what it looked like on the street
which<00:05:49.639> was<00:05:49.880> a<00:05:49.910> parade<00:05:50.600> of<00:05:50.840> costumes<00:05:51.440> that<00:05:51.910> it

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
which was a parade of costumes that it

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.820 
which was a parade of costumes that it
felt<00:05:53.180> much<00:05:53.389> more<00:05:53.600> that<00:05:53.930> way<00:05:54.110> this<00:05:54.350> year<00:05:54.410> than

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
felt much more that way this year than

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.550 
felt much more that way this year than
it<00:05:54.979> did<00:05:55.130> last<00:05:55.520> year<00:05:55.669> in<00:05:56.000> the<00:05:56.090> year<00:05:56.240> before<00:05:56.530> so<00:05:57.530> I

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
it did last year in the year before so I

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.360 
it did last year in the year before so I
think<00:05:58.660> our<00:05:59.660> goal<00:05:59.900> was<00:06:00.050> to<00:06:00.110> achieve<00:06:00.620> and<00:06:01.220> get

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
think our goal was to achieve and get

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.070 
think our goal was to achieve and get
back<00:06:01.550> to<00:06:01.760> a<00:06:01.789> homegrown<00:06:02.240> Halloween<00:06:02.780> and<00:06:02.990> I

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
back to a homegrown Halloween and I

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.170 
back to a homegrown Halloween and I
think<00:06:03.320> we<00:06:03.470> made<00:06:03.650> giant<00:06:03.950> steps<00:06:04.430> towards<00:06:04.970> that

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
think we made giant steps towards that

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.020 
think we made giant steps towards that
this<00:06:05.810> year
