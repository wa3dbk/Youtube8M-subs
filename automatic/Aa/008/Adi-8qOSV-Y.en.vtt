00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:12.679
 [Music] 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:16.880
 good tickets we go there with the hair 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:19.650
 wet and well unraveled we comb it 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.230
 everything back 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.620
 and what to say and repeat that there is nothing 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.390
 like a hairdressing cut 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.160
 and me when I have my hair already 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.080
 long that I like I always do in 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.850
 hairdresser because they leave me a cut that 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.250
 is going to eat face that goes with my face that 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:38.120
 It leaves me feeling great I love no 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.680
 there's nothing like that but if you have a 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.750
 imperative to cut us 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.489
 tips you are simply leaving 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.620
 grow hair like me and you do not want to go to 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.090
 the hairdresser because to make you a 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.280
 pretty cut usually always have 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.809
 that cut enough length and if what 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.850
 you are letting it grow so if you do not want 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.309
 they cut you so much then you can 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.410
 go doing at home and then already when 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.699
 have the length as you wish and 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.790
 you can go to the hairdresser that you do 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.400
 a very cool cut but as I am 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.720
 also letting me grow as well so 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.030
 I'm cutting the ends for 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.210
 keep them healthy good what are you going to 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.090
 need is little you need a comb 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.040
 very narrow barbs and with a stick of 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.460
 these for we can do the divisions 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.400
 you're going to need about two gummies 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.229
 small and they fit pretty well and 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.960
 of course a hairdressing scissors 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.820
 that are scissors that you only use them for 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.230
 your hair please no 6 scissors 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.150
 nor that you use to cut 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.870
 and to cut the paper a lot less for 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.260
 cut other kinds of things because you're going to 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.730
 damage the blades and then they will not 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.130
 cut the hair as they have to cut it 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.110
 The hair scissors are only for the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.910
 hair are not used for anything else and 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.190
 you need normal ones and then 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.260
 optionally comes I like to use the 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.190
 some of download that are these that 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.140
 they have 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.750
 that have one side of the blade that is 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.540
 like a good comb the step number one 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.190
 is that you give me about three fingers 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.130
 on top of your ear 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.830
 and right there up there you're going to do the 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.960
 first division 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.820
 using the stick of our hair 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.790
 then how is the division the division 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.800
 it's all right right right right 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.390
 right back and on the other side 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.640
 turned right right right 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.280
 right right until back and already with 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.210
 this division made what we have to 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.980
 to do is to comb this hair very 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.870
 well up if it's easier for you 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.850
 throw them down and put everything 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.310
 very well in a pigtail very high in the 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.650
 crown and now what we do is with 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.549
 the gummy 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.280
 look good a queue with this 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.750
 first division what are you going to have to 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.769
 do next is go up to this 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.170
 pigtail well high and now I'm going to upload the 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.909
 camera so you can see it well combing very 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.909
 right straight hair up 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.720
 and once the cut is made with the scissors 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.819
 to download we're going to pass it a little bit 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.150
 so do not worry that this does not cut 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:20.120
 a lot just to make a little 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.220
 and that there is no straight cut 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.650
 [Music] 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.840
 now the next division we're going to 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.010
 do half of the ear and we come back 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.800
 to do the same 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.110
 we divide with our stick and what 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.720
 we do all the success right up to 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.810
 back down and then back 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.310
 to go up all together and put it together to this 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.770
 pigtail 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:48.020
 [Music] 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:51.830
 and now with the hair already loose what 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.330
 we go back to brush everything down and 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.070
 backwards 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.440
 and now again with our comb what 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.260
 what we are going to do is divide the 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.540
 line in half until down and get 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:27.779
 the hair sideways 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:27.779
 [Music] 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:37.220
 with this and a cake we have our 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:40.640
 layers made our tips sanitized 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:44.170
 and we can move on to fix that 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:48.380
 hair good beauties and this is the 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:52.550
 result is a cut as you see you 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.260
 recover the layers here we can see the 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.170
 shorter layer that is what has 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.450
 what we did upwards 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.220
 then there is some more below that is 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.220
 the second we did and finally the 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.520
 last and as you can see we have lost 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:11.150
 very little hair length is still 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.240
 quite long is the ends even 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:17.510
 they look crowded they do not look like they were 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.400
 and horrible fringes because 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.680
 they needed a cut but now 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.900
 They are full they are beautiful they are 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.490
 couples afterwards when we have it 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.110
 how we want to have it then what 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.450
 we can cut at the hairdresser and see 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.370
 so a cut that comes to us wonderful 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.849
 as you can see also has a bit of 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.999
 parade milestone 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.199
 from the front not very exaggerated but there 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:39.509
 it goes as well as I 'm leaving 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.219
 grow this was my old bangs that 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:42.959
 I started letting it grow to leave 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:44.610

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:45.950
