wires first of all open the car USB
charger<00:00:39.110> by<00:00:39.440> unscrewing<00:00:39.830> it

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:46.859 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.279 

who<00:00:47.859> will<00:00:47.980> get<00:00:48.100> a<00:00:48.160> device<00:00:48.399> like<00:00:48.609> this<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:50.140> is

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
who will get a device like this this is

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.529 
who will get a device like this this is
the<00:00:50.320> posturing<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.910> this<00:00:52.180> is<00:00:52.269> the<00:00:52.390> negative

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
the posturing and this is the negative

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.689 
the posturing and this is the negative
end<00:00:52.870> roughly<00:00:53.620> our<00:00:53.860> arrangement<00:00:54.399> would<00:00:54.550> be

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
end roughly our arrangement would be

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.330 
end roughly our arrangement would be
like<00:00:54.850> this

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.970 

by<00:01:00.330> using<00:01:00.540> the<00:01:00.780> sharp<00:01:00.960> knife<00:01:01.200> cutting<00:01:01.740> holes

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
by using the sharp knife cutting holes

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.240 
by using the sharp knife cutting holes
wherever<00:01:02.400> required<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:04.130> remove<00:01:05.130> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
wherever required like this remove the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.980 
wherever required like this remove the
unused<00:01:05.489> area<00:01:05.820> from<00:01:05.940> the<00:01:06.090> cardboard<00:01:06.300> box

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
unused area from the cardboard box

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.410 
unused area from the cardboard box
and<00:01:08.290> it<00:01:08.560> would<00:01:08.740> be<00:01:08.860> like<00:01:09.040> this<00:01:09.190> when<00:01:10.060> placed<00:01:10.299> on

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
and it would be like this when placed on

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.410 
and it would be like this when placed on
a<00:01:10.479> single<00:01:10.810> box<00:01:14.340> bed<00:01:15.340> where<00:01:15.520> is<00:01:15.640> forced<00:01:16.000> to<00:01:16.030> and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
black where is negative by using the

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.359 
black where is negative by using the
wires<00:01:19.510> to<00:01:19.960> connect<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.320> battery<00:01:20.650> switch<00:01:20.979> and
