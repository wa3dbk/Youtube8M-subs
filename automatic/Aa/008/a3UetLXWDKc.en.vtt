00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.340 
January 2012 I think I forgot why I
picked<00:00:25.400> it<00:00:25.520> up<00:00:25.670> I<00:00:25.940> and<00:00:26.810> I'm<00:00:26.900> pretty<00:00:27.140> sure<00:00:27.320> I

picked it up I and I'm pretty sure I

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.679 
picked it up I and I'm pretty sure I
paid<00:00:27.650> under<00:00:27.860> $15<00:00:28.730> so<00:00:29.860> anyways<00:00:30.860> it's<00:00:31.100> got<00:00:31.310> uh

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
paid under $15 so anyways it's got uh

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.380 
paid under $15 so anyways it's got uh
can<00:00:32.689> you<00:00:32.840> blast<00:00:33.140> the<00:00:33.410> ghosts<00:00:33.980> it's<00:00:34.820> a<00:00:35.059> gravity

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
can you blast the ghosts it's a gravity

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.829 
can you blast the ghosts it's a gravity
said<00:00:36.200> so<00:00:36.680> as<00:00:36.800> you<00:00:36.949> see<00:00:37.190> here<00:00:37.519> well<00:00:38.359> you<00:00:38.449> get<00:00:38.659> one

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:38.839 
said so as you see here well you get one

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:41.200 
said so as you see here well you get one
car<00:00:39.170> you<00:00:39.199> get<00:00:39.499> this<00:00:39.710> governor<00:00:40.219> there's<00:00:40.969> your

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
car you get this governor there's your

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.680 
car you get this governor there's your
car<00:00:41.449> got<00:00:41.899> a<00:00:41.960> gravity<00:00:42.440> launch<00:00:42.739> and<00:00:43.480> here's<00:00:44.480> your

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
car got a gravity launch and here's your

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.950 
car got a gravity launch and here's your
clamp<00:00:45.730> no<00:00:46.730> batteries<00:00:47.210> required<00:00:49.629> as<00:00:50.629> we<00:00:50.809> look

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
clamp no batteries required as we look

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.079 
clamp no batteries required as we look
on<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:51.260> back<00:00:51.289> see<00:00:51.920> there's<00:00:52.129> the<00:00:52.280> gravity

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
on the back see there's the gravity

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.660 
on the back see there's the gravity
launch<00:00:54.789> glow-in-the-dark<00:00:56.019> spinning<00:00:57.019> ghost

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
launch glow-in-the-dark spinning ghost

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.709 
launch glow-in-the-dark spinning ghost
yeah<00:00:59.229> got<00:01:00.229> a<00:01:00.260> little<00:01:00.350> uh<00:01:00.699> knob<00:01:01.699> here<00:01:01.999> you<00:01:02.449> turn

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
yeah got a little uh knob here you turn

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.509 
yeah got a little uh knob here you turn
it<00:01:02.839> up<00:01:02.989> I<00:01:03.170> guess<00:01:03.379> that<00:01:03.559> makes<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:03.889> ghost<00:01:04.129> spin

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
it up I guess that makes the ghost spin

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.350 
it up I guess that makes the ghost spin
and<00:01:04.820> then<00:01:06.340> you<00:01:07.340> try<00:01:07.580> to<00:01:07.640> hit<00:01:07.940> them<00:01:08.090> as<00:01:08.240> they

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
and then you try to hit them as they

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:18.810 
and then you try to hit them as they
come<00:01:08.570> across<00:01:08.720> right<00:01:09.110> here<00:01:09.170> let's<00:01:10.010> open<00:01:10.190> it<00:01:10.460> up

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.850 

when<00:01:19.820> you<00:01:19.970> open<00:01:20.270> it<00:01:20.300> up<00:01:20.480> it<00:01:21.260> should<00:01:21.440> contain<00:01:21.800> a

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
when you open it up it should contain a

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.840 
when you open it up it should contain a
haunted<00:01:22.340> house

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
haunted house

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.110 
haunted house

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
know if I'm supposed to put both sides

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.360 
know if I'm supposed to put both sides
of<00:02:01.550> the<00:02:01.610> rubber<00:02:01.760> band<00:02:02.000> or<00:02:02.150> just<00:02:02.650> one<00:02:03.650> I'm<00:02:04.159> gonna

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
of the rubber band or just one I'm gonna

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.800 
of the rubber band or just one I'm gonna
put<00:02:04.550> one<00:02:05.060> on<00:02:05.420> one<00:02:05.800> yeah<00:02:06.800> I<00:02:06.860> think<00:02:06.980> just<00:02:07.340> one

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
put one on one yeah I think just one

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:16.140 
put one on one yeah I think just one
there's<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:09.019> other<00:02:09.110> one<00:02:09.379> there<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:10.489> go

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.150 

it<00:02:17.150> seems<00:02:17.360> like<00:02:17.540> all<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.780> reset<00:02:18.560> Hot<00:02:18.950> Wheels

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
it seems like all the reset Hot Wheels

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.559 
it seems like all the reset Hot Wheels
track<00:02:19.310> sets<00:02:19.790> are<00:02:19.910> coming<00:02:20.209> with<00:02:20.360> this

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
track sets are coming with this

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.220 
track sets are coming with this
connector<00:02:21.110> that's<00:02:21.860> already<00:02:22.250> plugged<00:02:23.150> in<00:02:23.540> it's

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
connector that's already plugged in it's

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.229 
connector that's already plugged in it's
about<00:02:24.800> half<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.160> size<00:02:25.550> as<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.819> normal

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
about half the size as a normal

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.140 
about half the size as a normal
connector<00:02:26.720> but<00:02:27.440> at<00:02:27.620> least<00:02:27.800> you<00:02:28.069> know<00:02:28.099> most<00:02:29.030> of

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
connector but at least you know most of

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.640 
connector but at least you know most of
the<00:02:29.209> time<00:02:29.510> you're<00:02:29.780> they're<00:02:30.110> not<00:02:30.290> going<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.530> be

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
the time you're they're not going to be

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.339 
the time you're they're not going to be
missing<00:02:31.130> into<00:02:31.340> play<00:02:31.550> set<00:02:31.849> and<00:02:32.230> you're<00:02:33.230> not

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
missing into play set and you're not
