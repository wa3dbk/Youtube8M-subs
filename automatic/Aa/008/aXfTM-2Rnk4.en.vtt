00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
page which will tell you the platform

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.439 
page which will tell you the platform
version<00:00:28.529> which<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.920> 1.1<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.119> software

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
version which is 1.1 the software

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.520 
version which is 1.1 the software
version<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.990> 11<00:00:31.740> point<00:00:31.980> 1<00:00:32.189> point<00:00:32.460> 1<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.090> is

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
version is 11 point 1 point 1 so this is

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.860 
version is 11 point 1 point 1 so this is
different<00:00:34.530> than<00:00:34.680> 10<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.460> which<00:00:36.120> there<00:00:36.660> was<00:00:36.809> a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
different than 10 in which there was a

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.000 
different than 10 in which there was a
security<00:00:37.829> hole<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.610> we<00:00:38.910> exploited<00:00:39.770> we<00:00:40.770> all

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
security hole that we exploited we all

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.240 
security hole that we exploited we all
exploited<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.850> root<00:00:42.390> out<00:00:42.540> phones<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.590> after

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
exploited to root out phones but after

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.160 
exploited to root out phones but after
the<00:00:44.340> update<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.730> has<00:00:44.879> been<00:00:45.090> fixed<00:00:45.360> but<00:00:45.930> there

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the update it has been fixed but there

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.010 
the update it has been fixed but there
is<00:00:46.289> yet<00:00:46.500> another<00:00:46.620> way<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.730> exploit<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.390> so

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
is yet another way to exploit this so

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.389 
is yet another way to exploit this so
that's<00:00:49.170> what<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.590> are<00:00:49.680> going<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.890> see<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.250> this

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
that's what we are going to see in this

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.220 
that's what we are going to see in this
video<00:00:50.610> how<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.000> root<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.420> nokia<00:00:51.750> X<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
video how to root the nokia X in the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.770 
video how to root the nokia X in the
latest<00:00:52.500> software<00:00:52.680> update<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:54.149> we<00:00:54.660> have

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
latest software update so we have

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.529 
latest software update so we have
already<00:00:55.020> rooted<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.280> unrooted<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:57.180> so

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
already rooted this and unrooted this so

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.569 
already rooted this and unrooted this so
you're<00:00:57.719> gonna<00:00:57.870> see<00:00:58.140> all<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.620> steps<00:00:59.160> right

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
you're gonna see all the steps right

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.240 
you're gonna see all the steps right
away<00:00:59.820> what<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.660> do<00:01:00.840> first<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.890> make

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
away what you do first is that you make

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.340 
away what you do first is that you make
sure<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.670> update<00:01:02.879> your<00:01:03.180> phone<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.930> should<00:01:03.960> be

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
sure you update your phone it should be

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.289 
sure you update your phone it should be
on<00:01:04.559> eleven<00:01:04.920> point<00:01:05.159> one<00:01:05.400> point<00:01:05.610> one<00:01:05.790> that

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
on eleven point one point one that

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.280 
on eleven point one point one that
software<00:01:06.659> version<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.430> then<00:01:08.840> mainly<00:01:09.840> you

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
software version and then mainly you

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.929 
software version and then mainly you
have<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.500> go<00:01:10.590> into<00:01:10.740> developer<00:01:11.250> options<00:01:11.640> inside

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
have to go into developer options inside

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.870 
have to go into developer options inside
the<00:01:12.119> settings<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.630> enable<00:01:13.260> USB<00:01:13.710> debugging<00:01:13.890> so

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
the settings and enable USB debugging so

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.969 
the settings and enable USB debugging so
that's<00:01:15.090> definitely<00:01:15.689> mandatory<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.799> want

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
that's definitely mandatory if you want

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.070 
that's definitely mandatory if you want
to<00:01:17.070> do<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.340> routing<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.150> last<00:01:18.509> time<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:18.750> did

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
to do the routing so last time we did

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.469 
to do the routing so last time we did
one<00:01:19.110> click<00:01:19.500> root<00:01:19.710> from<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> phone<00:01:20.670> but<00:01:21.270> this

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
one click root from the phone but this

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.630 
one click root from the phone but this
time<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:22.290> gonna<00:01:22.530> be<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.740> little<00:01:23.130> bit<00:01:23.430> more

so that's what we are going to do the
process<00:04:17.229> of<00:04:17.859> rooting<00:04:18.579> is<00:04:18.789> mentioned<00:04:19.510> here<00:04:19.720> and

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
process of rooting is mentioned here and

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.550 
process of rooting is mentioned here and
it<00:04:20.919> will<00:04:21.039> install<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.579> supersu<00:04:22.180> app<00:04:22.630> on<00:04:22.960> the
