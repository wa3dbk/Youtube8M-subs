00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 two 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.090
 it was the maximum magic rock of movie part 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.520
 one the king's is a movie of the year 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.410
 2012 that compiles and exhibits in the cinema the 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.720
 first 8 chapters and beginning of the 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.460
 ninth of a homonymous series being thus 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.920
 well the first film that would compose a 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.289
 trilogy 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.000
 the story we have a plot 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.589
 interesting strong and above all 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.229
 entertaining despite its turbulent 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.359
 he developed his most notorious problem as 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:53.979
 I already explained to you this is a compilation of 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.719
 the anime chapters and therefore 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.789
 we have a plot that has a 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.350
 narrative of series not of film what 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.850
 makes it much slower and even true 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.070
 difficult point to digest so 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.449
 episodic that it becomes as if from a 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.610
 pull you look at the first eight 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.020
 true anime episodes that you're 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.000
 almost two hours approximately 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.009
 that has a duration can become 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.570
 something songs and this before as for 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.610
 show them in a movie theater without 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.190
 no pause at least to go stretch 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.390
 the legs the characters the five 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.850
 protagonists are quite 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.500
 endearing and charismatic the movie 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.000
 presents them to us in an appropriate way and 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.770
 although it is clear that practically not 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.119
 we know nothing about them I guess everything 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.459
 its background is an element that 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.289
 They decided to leave for future deliveries or 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:34.229
 at least I hope so because of what 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.000
 otherwise we will have serious problems 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.009
 the music composed basically by 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.840
 Orchestra tunes mixed with rhythms 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.340
 electronic and even rock not only 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.409
 it is a complete delight for the 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.850
 ears but that accompanies every scene of 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.649
 exemplary form to the point of 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.120
 become unforgettable melodies and 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.670
 power 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.550
 loaded with a great feeling the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.780
 animation and technical section in general 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.980
 dazzling and glorious the movement of 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.780
 the characters is not only 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.220
 surprisingly fluid from the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.140
 moments calmed down to the same 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.660
 battles but their own designs 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.490
 They are charming and striking good 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.870
 at least most of these the 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.850
 saturation of colors in environments 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.830
 exteriors as well as the use of dyes 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.360
 atypical and psychodelia in habitats of 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.400
 nightmare as it is the world of 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.870
 Witches is magnificent and gives it a style 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.640
 Own the franchise 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.230
 simply splendid and spectacular 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.260
 although somewhat variant in counted 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.240
 Sometimes the magical doca of movie path 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.250
 one is a very audiovisual work 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.530
 impressive and highly recommended that 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.270
 knows how to establish a very magical atmosphere 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.580
 immersive thanks to its animation and its 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.380
 soundtrack and that at the same time knows 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.060
 present and establish perfectly 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.220
 the characters conflict in which 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.050
 they come undoubtedly wrapped a piece 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.730
 interesting that dares to touch subjects 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.319
 by which their current homonyms in the 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.659
 gender have always lagged 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.099
 for the moment I have to say is 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.099
 the white magician fired fast
