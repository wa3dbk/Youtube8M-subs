00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.670
 several months doing this combination 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.320
 of videos and at the moment I have done well and 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.560

 there are always screams and I'm playing call of 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.110
 I'm very angry, it's something 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.570
 natural that happens to me and I can not 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.649
 control it is something that I get because 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.570
 yes I mean and I do not do it without being conscious 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.009
 about it and well I know that many like it 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.140

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.240
 having gameplays with screams in my 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.880

 that the connection is not that I'm gone 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.330
 All right because I eat all the 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.010
 upload speed while I'm 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.930
 doing the streaming and at the time of 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.850
 I play online it will be fatal or 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.070
 because I only have 12 megabytes I do not have 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.440

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.690
 famous that have 50 up I 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.320

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.080
 limitations 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.760

 the big one and it's about to end 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.270
 you can see that for a moment the 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.490
 starting I threw one of those tubes 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.260
 what's out there to kill myself and do 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.540
 a challenge and more than anything to go up fast 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.770
 the level and as you see, I finish 2110 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.300

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.759
 by teams 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.250
