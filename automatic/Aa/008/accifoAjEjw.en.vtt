hey<00:00:00.930> guys

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.440 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.260 

here<00:00:26.440> we<00:00:26.590> go<00:00:26.770> but<00:00:27.070> first<00:00:27.400> of<00:00:27.550> all<00:00:27.640> I<00:00:27.850> think<00:00:27.940> I'm

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
here we go but first of all I think I'm

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.200 
here we go but first of all I think I'm
missing<00:00:28.630> something<00:00:28.870> okay<00:00:29.680> so<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:31.000> isn't

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
missing something okay so this isn't

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.660 
missing something okay so this isn't
quite<00:00:31.630> what<00:00:31.810> I<00:00:31.869> had<00:00:31.930> in<00:00:32.080> mind<00:00:32.230> but<00:00:32.710> anyway

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
quite what I had in mind but anyway

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.510 
quite what I had in mind but anyway
we'll<00:00:33.910> go<00:00:34.120> with<00:00:34.300> it<00:00:34.420> so<00:00:34.840> here<00:00:35.410> is<00:00:35.440> the<00:00:36.070> design

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
we'll go with it so here is the design

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.500 
we'll go with it so here is the design
and<00:00:36.880> as<00:00:37.840> you<00:00:38.080> can<00:00:38.200> see<00:00:38.230> it's<00:00:38.530> a<00:00:38.650> CNC<00:00:39.340> cage<00:00:39.670> so

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
and as you can see it's a CNC cage so

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.440 
and as you can see it's a CNC cage so
the<00:00:41.020> measurements<00:00:41.770> I'm<00:00:41.980> not<00:00:42.250> sure<00:00:42.309> exactly<00:00:43.300> on

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
the measurements I'm not sure exactly on

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.420 
the measurements I'm not sure exactly on
what<00:00:43.480> they<00:00:43.780> would<00:00:43.960> be<00:00:44.200> in<00:00:44.440> real<00:00:44.620> life<00:00:44.830> but<00:00:44.860> I

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
what they would be in real life but I

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.410 
what they would be in real life but I
have<00:00:45.970> done<00:00:46.180> it<00:00:46.360> five<00:00:46.809> square<00:00:47.559> cubes<00:00:47.890> by<00:00:48.420> 2

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
have done it five square cubes by 2

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.260 
have done it five square cubes by 2
square<00:00:49.720> cube<00:00:50.170> so<00:00:50.650> yeah<00:00:51.370> it's<00:00:51.550> pretty<00:00:51.850> spacious

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
square cube so yeah it's pretty spacious

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.750 
square cube so yeah it's pretty spacious
and<00:00:52.809> although<00:00:53.710> they<00:00:53.860> requested<00:00:54.370> it<00:00:54.489> for<00:00:54.670> our

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
and although they requested it for our

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.720 
and although they requested it for our
two<00:00:54.970> guinea<00:00:55.300> pigs<00:00:55.390> I<00:00:55.870> put<00:00:56.409> it's<00:00:56.739> like<00:00:57.489> a

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
two guinea pigs I put it's like a

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.299 
two guinea pigs I put it's like a
suitable<00:00:58.210> for<00:00:58.540> like<00:00:58.839> 3<00:00:59.470> plus<00:00:59.739> guinea<00:01:00.010> pigs

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
suitable for like 3 plus guinea pigs

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.820 
suitable for like 3 plus guinea pigs
because<00:01:00.550> I<00:01:01.000> think<00:01:01.780> it<00:01:01.989> will<00:01:02.140> be<00:01:02.199> ashamed<00:01:02.589> just

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
because I think it will be ashamed just

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.520 
because I think it will be ashamed just
to<00:01:02.920> keep<00:01:03.070> two<00:01:03.280> guinea<00:01:03.550> pigs<00:01:03.610> in<00:01:04.120> this<00:01:04.330> huge<00:01:05.199> run

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
to keep two guinea pigs in this huge run

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.200 
to keep two guinea pigs in this huge run
but<00:01:05.800> if<00:01:05.920> you<00:01:06.040> still<00:01:06.280> want<00:01:06.460> just<00:01:06.729> to<00:01:06.850> keep<00:01:07.000> two

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
but if you still want just to keep two

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.910 
but if you still want just to keep two
guinea<00:01:07.479> pigs<00:01:07.570> in<00:01:07.900> it<00:01:07.990> then<00:01:08.140> you<00:01:08.290> can<00:01:08.530> obviously

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
guinea pigs in it then you can obviously

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.670 
guinea pigs in it then you can obviously
minimize<00:01:09.909> the<00:01:10.120> space<00:01:10.360> of<00:01:10.659> it<00:01:10.780> like<00:01:11.140> five

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
minimize the space of it like five

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.360 
minimize the space of it like five
taking<00:01:12.190> a<00:01:12.510> square<00:01:13.510> cube<00:01:14.290> section<00:01:14.799> off<00:01:14.950> as<00:01:15.310> that

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
taking a square cube section off as that

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.789 
taking a square cube section off as that
will<00:01:15.940> make<00:01:16.600> them<00:01:16.720> feel<00:01:16.870> more<00:01:17.140> secure<00:01:17.409> because

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
will make them feel more secure because

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.740 
will make them feel more secure because
with<00:01:18.520> guinea<00:01:18.760> pigs<00:01:19.060> it's<00:01:19.240> not<00:01:19.390> always<00:01:19.540> about

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
with guinea pigs it's not always about

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.830 
with guinea pigs it's not always about
the<00:01:20.620> space<00:01:20.950> because<00:01:21.430> they<00:01:21.640> do<00:01:21.700> like<00:01:22.120> to<00:01:22.150> feel

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
the space because they do like to feel

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.510 
the space because they do like to feel
like<00:01:23.200> they<00:01:23.409> know<00:01:23.590> their<00:01:23.770> surroundings<00:01:24.310> all

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
like they know their surroundings all

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.359 
like they know their surroundings all
the<00:01:24.610> time<00:01:24.850> so<00:01:25.810> yeah<00:01:26.229> that's<00:01:26.380> just<00:01:26.680> totally<00:01:27.280> up

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
the time so yeah that's just totally up

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.670 
the time so yeah that's just totally up
to<00:01:27.610> you<00:01:27.640> but<00:01:27.759> this<00:01:28.090> is<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.539> designer<00:01:29.229> came<00:01:29.500> up

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
to you but this is the designer came up

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.730 
to you but this is the designer came up
with<00:01:29.890> so<00:01:30.219> basically<00:01:31.170> there's<00:01:32.170> a<00:01:32.259> shelf<00:01:32.530> up

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
with so basically there's a shelf up

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.260 
with so basically there's a shelf up
here<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:34.140> there's<00:01:35.140> a<00:01:35.289> ramp<00:01:35.590> which<00:01:36.159> is<00:01:36.490> holding

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
here and there's a ramp which is holding

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.639 
here and there's a ramp which is holding
their<00:01:38.640> which<00:01:39.960> enables<00:01:40.960> the<00:01:41.109> guinea<00:01:41.289> pigs<00:01:41.500> to

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
their which enables the guinea pigs to

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.730 
their which enables the guinea pigs to
get<00:01:41.799> up<00:01:41.890> and<00:01:42.039> down<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:42.579> so<00:01:43.539> yeah<00:01:43.869> I<00:01:44.140> just<00:01:44.380> felt

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
get up and down and so yeah I just felt

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.980 
get up and down and so yeah I just felt
like<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:44.890> few<00:01:45.280> toys<00:01:45.549> in<00:01:45.820> there<00:01:46.030> just<00:01:46.270> like<00:01:46.509> for

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
like a few toys in there just like for

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.660 
like a few toys in there just like for
an<00:01:47.079> example<00:01:47.140> of<00:01:47.740> what<00:01:48.039> it<00:01:48.189> could<00:01:48.399> look<00:01:48.609> like

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
an example of what it could look like

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.870 
an example of what it could look like
and<00:01:49.409> down<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.619> bottom<00:01:50.979> this<00:01:51.100> blue<00:01:51.369> stuff<00:01:51.399> is

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
and down the bottom this blue stuff is

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.300 
and down the bottom this blue stuff is
actually<00:01:52.000> called<00:01:52.539> chloroplasts<00:01:53.289> and<00:01:53.619> if

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
actually called chloroplasts and if

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.039 
actually called chloroplasts and if
you're<00:01:54.820> not<00:01:54.969> going<00:01:55.210> to<00:01:55.329> have<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.450> wooden<00:01:55.810> base

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
you're not going to have a wooden base

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.740 
you're not going to have a wooden base
wrong<00:01:56.710> which<00:01:56.950> I<00:01:57.280> have<00:01:57.729> then<00:01:58.030> you'll<00:01:58.270> need<00:01:58.450> car

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
wrong which I have then you'll need car

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.349 
wrong which I have then you'll need car
pass<00:01:58.990> to<00:01:59.229> line<00:01:59.409> it<00:01:59.579> especially<00:02:00.579> if<00:02:00.909> you<00:02:01.090> using

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
pass to line it especially if you using

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.209 
pass to line it especially if you using
wood<00:02:01.810> shavings<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.590> stuff<00:02:02.829> because<00:02:02.950> you

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
wood shavings and stuff because you

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:04.679 
wood shavings and stuff because you
don't<00:02:03.399> want<00:02:03.549> everything<00:02:03.820> going<00:02:04.210> over<00:02:04.329> the

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
don't want everything going over the

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.469 
don't want everything going over the
carpet<00:02:04.929> and<00:02:05.350> whatnot<00:02:06.189> so<00:02:06.219> yeah<00:02:07.060> that's

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
carpet and whatnot so yeah that's

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:16.400 
carpet and whatnot so yeah that's
basically<00:02:07.840> all<00:02:08.619> I've<00:02:09.220> got<00:02:09.490> here

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.410 

so<00:02:17.410> yeah<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.710> hope<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:18.190> like<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.760> enclosure

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
so yeah I hope you like the enclosure

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.260 
so yeah I hope you like the enclosure
design<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.200> I'm<00:02:20.350> now<00:02:20.710> going<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.130> show<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:22.000> how

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
design and I'm now going to show you how

00:02:22.270 --> 00:03:28.759 
design and I'm now going to show you how
to<00:02:22.330> construct<00:02:22.960> this

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.830 

okay<00:03:29.769> so<00:03:29.830> this<00:03:30.280> is<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:30.730> design<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.420> what<00:03:31.659> it

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
okay so this is the design and what it

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.270 
okay so this is the design and what it
would<00:03:31.989> look<00:03:32.140> like<00:03:32.400> with<00:03:33.400> toys<00:03:33.879> bedding<00:03:34.810> and

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
would look like with toys bedding and
