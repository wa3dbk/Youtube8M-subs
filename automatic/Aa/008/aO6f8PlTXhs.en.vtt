00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.210 
yellow and if I was below twenty percent
this<00:02:57.120> this<00:02:57.540> number<00:02:57.840> would<00:02:57.959> be<00:02:58.020> red<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:59.040> just

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
this this number would be red so it just

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.220
