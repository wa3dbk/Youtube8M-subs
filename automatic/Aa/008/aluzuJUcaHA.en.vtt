00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
we did we worked out that the first

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.060 
we did we worked out that the first
generation<00:00:46.489> known<00:00:47.489> as<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.789> f1<00:00:48.450> were<00:00:49.050> all<00:00:49.379> red

generation known as the f1 were all red

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.270 
generation known as the f1 were all red
and<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:51.120> calculation<00:00:51.899> revealed<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:53.070> they

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
and the calculation revealed that they

and the calculation revealed that they
were<00:00:53.629> heterozygous<00:00:56.420> for<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.449> allele<00:00:58.020> for

were heterozygous for the allele for

were heterozygous for the allele for
petal<00:00:59.129> color<00:01:00.500> in<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.910> demonstration<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:03.570> are

this<00:01:59.450> is<00:01:59.660> the<00:01:59.900> same<00:02:00.200> for<00:02:00.800> this<00:02:00.980> parent<00:02:01.430> here<00:02:02.800> so

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
this is the same for this parent here so

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.970 
this is the same for this parent here so
they<00:02:05.770> by<00:02:06.770> golly<00:02:07.280> oh<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:09.410> little<00:02:09.560> are<00:02:09.950> a

which by the way is covered in three two
he's<00:03:27.409> demonstrated<00:03:28.190> by<00:03:28.670> drawing<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.239> table
