00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
try to cut straight across and I've

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.510 
try to cut straight across and I've
always<00:00:37.900> had<00:00:38.110> you<00:00:38.920> know<00:00:38.949> like<00:00:39.219> the<00:00:39.370> regular

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:42.609 
side swept bangs but I thought it would

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.490 
side swept bangs but I thought it would
be<00:00:42.760> time<00:00:43.000> for<00:00:43.030> a<00:00:43.239> change<00:00:43.300> and<00:00:43.870> it<00:00:43.989> looks<00:00:44.170> so

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
be time for a change and it looks so

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.029 
be time for a change and it looks so
