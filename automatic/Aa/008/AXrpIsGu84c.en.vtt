art because it's been going on long like
a<00:00:39.360> long<00:00:39.690> time<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.489> park<00:00:41.820> was

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
a long time like this this park was

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.200 
a long time like this this park was
still<00:00:42.180> going<00:00:42.420> around<00:00:42.710> like<00:00:43.760> like<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.940> believe

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
still going around like like I believe

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.040

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
2013 and then it ended like it's still

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.880 
2013 and then it ended like it's still
going<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.230> right<00:00:55.260> now

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
going on right now

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.270 
going on right now
like<00:00:56.480> like<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.690> nice<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.320> like<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.100> is

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
like like it nice and like this is

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.180 
like like it nice and like this is
probably<00:00:59.460> like<00:00:59.760> one<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.149> longest<00:01:00.690> arcs

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
probably like one of the longest arcs

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.579 
probably like one of the longest arcs
Oda's<00:01:02.190> done<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:02.940> piece<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.510> think<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.290> think

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
Oda's done in one piece I think I think

Skype heals the whole earth at but I

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.190 
Skype heals the whole earth at but I
think<00:01:08.040> dressrosa<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.030> if<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.659> hits<00:01:09.990> like

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
think dressrosa it is if it hits like

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.070 
think dressrosa it is if it hits like
100<00:01:10.770> chapters<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:12.030> would<00:01:12.510> be<00:01:12.630> amazing

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.450 
goal you have to have sad past because
everyone<00:05:42.530> has<00:05:42.800> one<00:05:43.040> on<00:05:43.250> on<00:05:43.820> the<00:05:44.000> ship<00:05:44.240> and

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
everyone has one on on the ship and

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.040 
everyone has one on on the ship and
that's<00:05:46.460> about<00:05:46.640> it<00:05:46.820> something<00:05:47.270> or<00:05:47.570> some<00:05:47.870> kind

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
that's about it something or some kind

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.930 
that's about it something or some kind
of<00:05:48.080> skill<00:05:48.380> that<00:05:48.560> can<00:05:48.710> help<00:05:48.980> them<00:05:49.130> out<00:05:49.280> in<00:05:49.700> a

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
of skill that can help them out in a

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.960 
of skill that can help them out in a
near<00:05:50.150> future<00:05:50.390> but<00:05:51.230> but<00:05:52.130> some<00:05:52.280> rooster<00:05:52.670> I<00:05:52.730> asked

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
near future but but some rooster I asked

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.670 
near future but but some rooster I asked
me<00:05:53.120> what<00:05:53.630> if<00:05:53.720> we<00:05:53.810> get<00:05:53.960> some<00:05:54.080> new<00:05:54.200> straw<00:05:54.440> has<00:05:54.650> a

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
me what if we get some new straw has a

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.879 
me what if we get some new straw has a
big<00:05:55.310> cost<00:05:55.520> and<00:05:55.760> we<00:05:55.850> need<00:05:56.030> that

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
big cost and we need that

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:01.619 
big cost and we need that
new<00:05:57.340> strategies<00:05:58.229> so<00:05:59.460> that<00:06:00.460> I<00:06:00.729> guess<00:06:01.449> that

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:01.629 
new strategies so that I guess that

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:03.719 
new strategies so that I guess that
terrorize<00:06:02.050> all<00:06:02.379> wait<00:06:02.620> there<00:06:03.069> is<00:06:03.249> one<00:06:03.280> more

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
terrorize all wait there is one more

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:06.659 
terrorize all wait there is one more
thing<00:06:03.939> I<00:06:04.120> was<00:06:04.389> wondering<00:06:04.749> about<00:06:05.129> what<00:06:06.129> if<00:06:06.370> in

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
thing I was wondering about what if in

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.249 
thing I was wondering about what if in
2015<00:06:07.599> we<00:06:07.779> don't<00:06:08.020> get<00:06:08.229> Luffy<00:06:08.650> versus<00:06:09.039> Kaito<00:06:09.340> or

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 
2015 we don't get Luffy versus Kaito or

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.010 
2015 we don't get Luffy versus Kaito or
Luffy<00:06:11.259> versus<00:06:11.560> Kaito<00:06:11.800> what<00:06:12.610> if<00:06:12.939> we<00:06:13.330> get<00:06:13.569> Luffy

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020

you were still trying to figure out who
is<00:06:37.750> he<00:06:37.840> targeting<00:06:38.139> which<00:06:39.129> i<00:06:39.370> think<00:06:39.819> it's<00:06:39.939> big

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150 
is he targeting which i think it's big

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.649 
is he targeting which i think it's big
man<00:06:40.330> i<00:06:40.389> think<00:06:40.569> and<00:06:41.849> what<00:06:42.849> if<00:06:43.029> we<00:06:43.210> get<00:06:43.330> luffy

man i think and what if we get luffy

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:45.779 
man i think and what if we get luffy
versus<00:06:44.080> Captain<00:06:44.830> Kidd<00:06:45.009> that'd<00:06:45.159> be<00:06:45.250> cool<00:06:45.520> and

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:45.789 
versus Captain Kidd that'd be cool and

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:47.519 
versus Captain Kidd that'd be cool and
maybe<00:06:46.270> like<00:06:46.569> something<00:06:46.840> like<00:06:46.930> Zorro<00:06:47.110> versus

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:47.529 
maybe like something like Zorro versus

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:50.360 
maybe like something like Zorro versus
killer<00:06:47.800> maybe<00:06:48.550> law<00:06:49.000> versus<00:06:49.449> Hawkins

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
killer maybe law versus Hawkins

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.219 
killer maybe law versus Hawkins
Sanji<00:06:51.370> versus<00:06:51.789> Appu<00:06:52.240> that<00:06:52.779> that<00:06:52.990> would<00:06:53.110> be

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:53.229 
Sanji versus Appu that that would be

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:55.260 
Sanji versus Appu that that would be
pretty<00:06:53.589> beast<00:06:53.979> maybe<00:06:54.339> it<00:06:54.490> might<00:06:54.610> be<00:06:54.669> better

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
pretty beast maybe it might be better

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.010 
pretty beast maybe it might be better
than<00:06:55.509> just<00:06:55.659> Rosa<00:06:56.020> maybe<00:06:56.379> but<00:06:57.659> that<00:06:58.659> that's<00:06:58.870> my

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.020 
than just Rosa maybe but that that's my

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.390 
than just Rosa maybe but that that's my
theory<00:06:59.289> that's<00:06:59.529> my<00:06:59.650> theory<00:06:59.830> right<00:07:00.039> there<00:07:00.189> is<00:07:00.370> a

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 
theory that's my theory right there is a

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.820 
theory that's my theory right there is a
straw<00:07:00.699> hat<00:07:00.849> fan<00:07:01.120> I<00:07:01.360> would<00:07:01.750> like<00:07:02.110> to<00:07:02.229> see<00:07:02.379> that<00:07:02.589> I

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
straw hat fan I would like to see that I

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.390 
straw hat fan I would like to see that I
would<00:07:03.669> like<00:07:03.789> to<00:07:03.909> see<00:07:04.060> that<00:07:04.240> so<00:07:04.779> on<00:07:05.080> with<00:07:05.439> 2015

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 
would like to see that so on with 2015

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.330 
would like to see that so on with 2015
in<00:07:06.550> for<00:07:06.819> one<00:07:07.029> piece
