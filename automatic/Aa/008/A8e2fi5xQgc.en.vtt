in<00:00:31.970> the<00:00:32.090> description<00:00:33.130> and<00:00:34.130> basically<00:00:34.940> it's<00:00:35.270> a

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
in the description and basically it's a

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.060 
in the description and basically it's a
component<00:00:36.920> that<00:00:36.950> inverts<00:00:37.880> the<00:00:37.930> output

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
component that inverts the output

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:46.240 
component that inverts the output
whenever<00:00:40.070> its<00:00:40.280> input<00:00:40.790> goes<00:00:41.780> on<00:00:42.110> and<00:00:42.830> off<00:00:44.140> so<00:00:45.250> if

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
whenever its input goes on and off so if

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.310 
whenever its input goes on and off so if
I<00:00:46.690> toggle<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:48.020> input<00:00:48.290> the<00:00:48.500> output<00:00:49.220> toggles

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
I toggle the input the output toggles

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.010 
I toggle the input the output toggles
for<00:00:51.320> do<00:00:51.410> it<00:00:51.530> again<00:00:52.810> it<00:00:53.810> goes<00:00:53.930> on<00:00:54.970> again<00:00:55.970> it<00:00:56.900> goes

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
for do it again it goes on again it goes

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.700 
for do it again it goes on again it goes
off<00:00:57.490> and<00:00:58.600> so<00:00:59.600> on<00:00:59.750> and<00:01:00.590> it's<00:01:01.280> used<00:01:01.670> for<00:01:02.710> countess

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
off and so on and it's used for countess

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.249 
off and so on and it's used for countess
and<00:01:04.840> basically<00:01:05.840> anywhere<00:01:06.320> where<00:01:07.310> you<00:01:07.460> need<00:01:07.700> a

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
and basically anywhere where you need a

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:17.530 
and basically anywhere where you need a
half<00:01:09.259> flip<00:01:09.530> flop

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.330 

this<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.690> the<00:01:18.810> basic<00:01:19.020> design<00:01:20.180> it's<00:01:21.180> too

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
this is the basic design it's too

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.510 
this is the basic design it's too
ordinary<00:01:23.340> pistols<00:01:25.070> opposite<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.190> each<00:01:26.280> other

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
ordinary pistols opposite to each other

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:35.030 
ordinary pistols opposite to each other
and<00:01:28.520> redstone<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:31.130> whole<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:33.740> on<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.830> top<00:01:35.010> of

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
and redstone in whole and on the top of

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.460 
and redstone in whole and on the top of
a<00:01:35.280> edge<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:38.070> basically<00:01:38.430> whenever<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.479> send<00:01:40.320> a

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
a edge and basically whenever you send a

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.280 
a edge and basically whenever you send a
signal<00:01:43.160> only<00:01:44.160> one<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.640> these<00:01:44.760> Pistons<00:01:45.330> will

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
signal only one of these Pistons will

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.080 
signal only one of these Pistons will
move<00:01:46.760> because<00:01:47.760> the<00:01:48.690> whetstone<00:01:49.430> can<00:01:50.430> only<00:01:50.580> go

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
move because the whetstone can only go

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.560 
move because the whetstone can only go
down<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.890> bottom<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.880> hole

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
down to the to the bottom of this hole

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:06.850 
down to the to the bottom of this hole
at<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.619> other<00:01:56.040> side<00:01:56.369> sorry<00:01:56.820> ah

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.830 

let<00:02:07.490> me<00:02:07.550> go<00:02:07.730> down<00:02:08.800> where<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.920> block<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:11.660> the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
let me go down where the block of the

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.640 
let me go down where the block of the
opposite<00:02:12.140> end<00:02:12.260> of<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.440> block<00:02:14.470> so<00:02:15.470> now<00:02:15.590> the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
opposite end of the block so now the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.880 
opposite end of the block so now the
redstone<00:02:16.340> connects<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:17.120> this<00:02:17.570> block<00:02:17.890> and

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
redstone connects to this block and

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.920 
redstone connects to this block and
that's<00:02:19.070> powers<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:20.750> piston<00:02:21.970> send<00:02:22.970> signal

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
that's powers this piston send signal

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.980 
that's powers this piston send signal
and<00:02:24.940> let's<00:02:25.940> no<00:02:26.090> night<00:02:26.270> relates<00:02:26.540> to<00:02:26.720> this<00:02:26.960> block

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
and let's no night relates to this block

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.420 
and let's no night relates to this block
and<00:02:29.990> so<00:02:30.200> on<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:30.740> we'll<00:02:30.890> move<00:02:31.040> back<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.640> forth

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
and so on so we'll move back and forth

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.270 
and so on so we'll move back and forth
like<00:02:34.430> that<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:36.200> can<00:02:36.350> also<00:02:36.470> power<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.250> other

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
like that you can also power the other

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.100 
like that you can also power the other
side<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:39.050> is<00:02:39.110> supposed<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.770> be<00:02:39.920> used<00:02:40.360> for<00:02:41.360> door

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
side it is supposed to be used for door

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.800 
side it is supposed to be used for door
sometimes<00:02:44.770> but<00:02:45.790> what<00:02:46.790> we<00:02:46.970> need<00:02:47.180> is<00:02:47.420> some<00:02:47.600> kind

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
sometimes but what we need is some kind

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.979 
sometimes but what we need is some kind
of<00:02:47.930> some<00:02:48.920> way<00:02:49.040> of<00:02:49.190> getting<00:02:49.570> output<00:02:50.570> signal

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
of some way of getting output signal

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.850 
of some way of getting output signal
from<00:02:51.290> this<00:02:52.190> design<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:53.560> unless<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:54.680> have<00:02:54.830> a

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
from this design and unless you have a

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.820 
from this design and unless you have a
detector<00:02:55.340> block<00:02:55.880> block<00:02:56.570> didn't<00:02:56.900> detect<00:02:57.260> the

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
detector block block didn't detect the

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.229 
detector block block didn't detect the
air<00:02:58.790> block<00:02:59.709> you<00:03:00.709> need<00:03:00.890> some<00:03:01.100> way<00:03:01.250> of<00:03:01.280> sending<00:03:01.880> a

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
air block you need some way of sending a

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.680 
air block you need some way of sending a
signal<00:03:02.540> through<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.580> more<00:03:04.580> than<00:03:04.730> one<00:03:05.270> way<00:03:05.390> doing

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
signal through a more than one way doing

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.510 
signal through a more than one way doing
that<00:03:05.810> is<00:03:06.020> to<00:03:06.850> invert<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:08.390> input<00:03:09.380> so<00:03:10.280> that<00:03:10.310> you

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
that is to invert the input so that you

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.370 
that is to invert the input so that you
always<00:03:10.730> have<00:03:11.620> powered<00:03:12.620> signal<00:03:14.080> if<00:03:15.080> I<00:03:15.230> now

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
always have powered signal if I now

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:23.590 
always have powered signal if I now
click<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.850> blind<00:03:17.709> cheat<00:03:18.709> button<00:03:18.980> I<00:03:22.540> allow<00:03:23.540> the

click the blind cheat button I allow the

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.710 
click the blind cheat button I allow the

flip<00:03:37.940> flop<00:03:42.610> but<00:03:43.610> it<00:03:43.730> is<00:03:43.820> a<00:03:43.850> problem<00:03:44.739> whenever

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
flip flop but it is a problem whenever

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.650 
flip flop but it is a problem whenever
the<00:03:45.950> signal<00:03:46.400> goes<00:03:46.790> off<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.570> the<00:03:48.470> door<00:03:48.500> closes

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
the signal goes off and the door closes

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.680 
the signal goes off and the door closes
this<00:03:50.660> short<00:03:51.049> moment<00:03:51.500> where<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.610> arm<00:03:52.910> signal

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
this short moment where the arm signal

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.600 
this short moment where the arm signal
can<00:03:54.200> pass<00:03:54.530> through<00:03:56.709> they<00:03:57.709> have<00:03:57.920> a<00:03:58.190> short<00:03:59.140> burst

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
can pass through they have a short burst

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.040 
can pass through they have a short burst
whenever<00:04:01.750> signal<00:04:02.750> goes<00:04:03.019> off

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
whenever signal goes off

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.450 
whenever signal goes off
we<00:04:05.710> can<00:04:05.890> propose<00:04:06.730> reverse<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.900> output<00:04:08.230> if<00:04:09.070> the

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
we can propose reverse the output if the

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.020 
we can propose reverse the output if the
ledge<00:04:09.610> stone<00:04:09.730> goes<00:04:11.070> it's<00:04:12.070> taken<00:04:12.460> from<00:04:12.700> this

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
ledge stone goes it's taken from this

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.039 
ledge stone goes it's taken from this
and<00:04:13.330> you<00:04:14.200> have<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:14.470> opposite<00:04:14.920> problem<00:04:17.220> so

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
and you have the opposite problem so

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.470 
and you have the opposite problem so
this<00:04:20.049> might<00:04:20.320> be<00:04:20.400> okay<00:04:21.400> if<00:04:21.580> you<00:04:21.730> do<00:04:22.090> before

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
this might be okay if you do before

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.800 
this might be okay if you do before
dealing<00:04:22.750> with<00:04:23.020> door<00:04:23.400> we<00:04:24.400> don't<00:04:24.610> care<00:04:24.940> it's

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
you might want to avoid this design and

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.310 
you might want to avoid this design and
instead<00:04:38.440> use<00:04:39.070> something<00:04:39.400> like<00:04:39.430> this<00:04:39.790> I<00:04:40.320> have

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
instead use something like this I have

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
instead use something like this I have
extended<00:04:41.980> the<00:04:42.130> design<00:04:42.520> by<00:04:43.300> adding<00:04:43.750> to<00:04:44.470> cobble

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
extended the design by adding to cobble

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.300 
extended the design by adding to cobble
stone<00:04:45.550> and<00:04:45.820> a<00:04:46.270> glass<00:04:46.420> block<00:04:46.890> and<00:04:47.890> a<00:04:48.130> glass

stone and a glass block and a glass

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.020 
stone and a glass block and a glass
block<00:04:48.640> acts<00:04:49.120> as<00:04:49.780> a<00:04:49.840> stopper<00:04:50.500> it<00:04:51.490> blocks<00:04:51.790> the

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
block acts as a stopper it blocks the

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.800 
block acts as a stopper it blocks the

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
signal from a redstone torch now the

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.960 
signal from a redstone torch now the
signal<00:04:59.200> it's<00:05:00.030> sent<00:05:01.030> through<00:05:02.820> now<00:05:03.820> it's

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
signal it's sent through now it's

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:12.180 
signal it's sent through now it's
blocked<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:06.810> this<00:05:07.810> is<00:05:09.330> necessary<00:05:10.330> to<00:05:11.190> remove

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
blocked and this is necessary to remove

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.240 
blocked and this is necessary to remove
the<00:05:12.370> Redstone<00:05:12.760> away<00:05:13.180> from<00:05:13.480> the<00:05:13.570> torch<00:05:13.980> as<00:05:14.980> to

not be interfere that's not interfere
with<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.430> torch<00:05:21.360> so<00:05:22.360> basically<00:05:22.720> a<00:05:23.080> glass
