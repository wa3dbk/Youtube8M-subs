00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
got an RPM range from 1500 to about

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.119 
got an RPM range from 1500 to about
5,500<00:00:43.030> rpm<00:00:43.420> when<00:00:44.410> you<00:00:44.590> get<00:00:44.770> into<00:00:45.010> their

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
5,500 rpm when you get into their

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.549 
5,500 rpm when you get into their
performer<00:00:45.520> rpm<00:00:45.640> series<00:00:46.300> that<00:00:46.660> goes<00:00:47.230> from

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
performer rpm series that goes from

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.040 
performer rpm series that goes from
1,500<00:00:48.280> to<00:00:48.309> 6,500<00:00:49.180> really<00:00:49.510> it's<00:00:49.600> just<00:00:49.629> a<00:00:49.809> little

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
1,500 to 6,500 really it's just a little

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.750 
1,500 to 6,500 really it's just a little
taller<00:00:50.230> as<00:00:50.620> far<00:00:50.860> as<00:00:50.980> the<00:00:51.070> intake<00:00:51.309> deck<00:00:51.579> height

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
taller as far as the intake deck height

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.299 
taller as far as the intake deck height
itself<00:00:52.120> when<00:00:53.079> it<00:00:53.170> gets<00:00:53.350> to<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.739> higher<00:00:54.070> end

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
itself when it gets to the higher end

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:55.889 
itself when it gets to the higher end
side<00:00:54.520> of<00:00:54.670> things<00:00:54.820> we<00:00:55.000> have<00:00:55.120> our<00:00:55.239> air<00:00:55.390> gap<00:00:55.629> here

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
side of things we have our air gap here

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.840 
side of things we have our air gap here
and<00:00:56.050> basically<00:00:56.620> what<00:00:56.829> the<00:00:56.950> air<00:00:57.070> gap<00:00:57.219> is<00:00:57.460> as<00:00:57.730> you

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
and basically what the air gap is as you

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.549 
and basically what the air gap is as you
can<00:00:58.000> see<00:00:58.210> it<00:00:58.539> actually<00:00:58.719> just<00:00:59.079> allows<00:00:59.320> air<00:00:59.530> to

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
can see it actually just allows air to

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.200 
can see it actually just allows air to
go<00:00:59.739> underneath<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.160> runners<00:01:00.460> it<00:01:00.760> keeps<00:01:01.000> the

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
go underneath the runners it keeps the

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.330 
go underneath the runners it keeps the
oil<00:01:01.510> that's<00:01:01.960> on<00:01:02.260> the<00:01:02.620> bottom<00:01:02.920> of<00:01:02.980> the<00:01:03.070> intake

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
oil that's on the bottom of the intake

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.129 
oil that's on the bottom of the intake
from<00:01:03.550> splashing<00:01:04.180> up<00:01:04.299> and<00:01:04.479> putting<00:01:04.689> heat<00:01:04.929> on

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:05.139 
from splashing up and putting heat on

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:06.660 
from splashing up and putting heat on
those<00:01:05.289> runners<00:01:05.529> gives<00:01:06.069> you<00:01:06.189> a<00:01:06.219> cooler<00:01:06.520> denser

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
those runners gives you a cooler denser

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.249 
those runners gives you a cooler denser
charge<00:01:07.119> allows<00:01:07.509> you<00:01:07.719> to<00:01:07.810> have<00:01:07.929> a<00:01:07.959> lot<00:01:08.109> more

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
charge allows you to have a lot more

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:09.690 
charge allows you to have a lot more
horsepower<00:01:08.409> when<00:01:09.159> you're<00:01:09.279> running<00:01:09.490> down<00:01:09.520> the

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
horsepower when you're running down the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.760 
horsepower when you're running down the
road<00:01:09.850> you've<00:01:10.659> been<00:01:10.779> to<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:10.959> operating<00:01:11.319> rpm

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
road you've been to the operating rpm

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.649 
road you've been to the operating rpm
for<00:01:12.009> both<00:01:12.159> the<00:01:12.310> air<00:01:12.459> gap<00:01:12.700> and<00:01:13.029> the<00:01:13.090> performers

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
for both the air gap and the performers

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.989 
for both the air gap and the performers
around<00:01:14.229> 6500<00:01:14.979> rpm<00:01:15.310> that's<00:01:15.609> ground<00:01:15.849> but<00:01:15.939> you

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:15.999 
around 6500 rpm that's ground but you

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:17.010 
around 6500 rpm that's ground but you
get<00:01:16.119> somebody<00:01:16.299> who<00:01:16.450> wants<00:01:16.599> to<00:01:16.689> spin<00:01:16.899> a<00:01:16.929> little

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
get somebody who wants to spin a little

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.389 
get somebody who wants to spin a little
higher<00:01:17.229> than<00:01:17.439> that<00:01:17.499> well<00:01:17.770> so<00:01:17.889> you<00:01:18.009> have<00:01:18.039> we

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
higher than that well so you have we

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:19.769 
higher than that well so you have we
actually<00:01:18.700> have<00:01:18.819> a<00:01:18.849> victor<00:01:19.179> series<00:01:19.539> we<00:01:19.630> don't

00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:19.779 
actually have a victor series we don't

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.539 
actually have a victor series we don't
have<00:01:19.899> it<00:01:19.990> here<00:01:20.020> today<00:01:20.349> to<00:01:20.529> show<00:01:20.859> but<00:01:21.189> the

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
have it here today to show but the

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.190 
have it here today to show but the
victor<00:01:21.759> series<00:01:22.060> is<00:01:22.240> a<00:01:22.270> single<00:01:22.599> plane<00:01:22.749> manifold

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
victor series is a single plane manifold

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.289 
victor series is a single plane manifold
with<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.469> little<00:01:23.679> higher<00:01:23.829> carburetor<00:01:24.729> deck<00:01:24.909> and

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
with a little higher carburetor deck and

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.419 
with a little higher carburetor deck and
a<00:01:25.359> lighter<00:01:25.569> spin<00:01:25.840> it<00:01:25.929> up<00:01:26.049> to<00:01:26.139> about<00:01:26.319> 8500<00:01:27.039> or<00:01:27.219> if

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
a lighter spin it up to about 8500 or if

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:28.499 
a lighter spin it up to about 8500 or if
you<00:01:27.520> want<00:01:27.639> to<00:01:27.700> port<00:01:27.880> that<00:01:27.999> thing<00:01:28.179> out<00:01:28.329> I've

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
you want to port that thing out I've

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.050 
you want to port that thing out I've
seen<00:01:28.689> it<00:01:28.779> go<00:01:28.869> as<00:01:28.959> high<00:01:29.079> as<00:01:29.109> 10,000<00:01:29.889> rpm<00:01:30.219> and<00:01:30.819> are

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
seen it go as high as 10,000 rpm and are

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.489 
seen it go as high as 10,000 rpm and are
all<00:01:31.209> your<00:01:31.389> different<00:01:31.689> manifolds<00:01:32.109> available
