00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.200
 the materials that we need only 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.570
 they follow flat color is a crochet 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.520
 according to the thickness of the wool and 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.180
 scissors let's start the scarf 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.940
 doing 300 chains in this case 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.390
 let's leave a long piece of yarn 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.690
 to make the first fringe we make a 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.690
 knot 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.350
 and we make 300 chains in this case 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.790
 we are going to make fewer chains so that 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.790
 see how the tissue is 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.160
 once we have all the chains 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.920
 we do the following 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.129
 two chains 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:56.460
 and just in the last chain we have 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.460
 made of the 300 we make half a crochet 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.559
 and we are doing half a crochet in each 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.580
 one of the chains until you reach the 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.580
 chain of initiation 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.479
 once we have all the stockings 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.590
 made we make a chain and we can 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.659
 cut the thread and we leave it 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.420
 about the same extent as 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.329
 we have left the first one for us 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.640
 the fringes of the same measure remain 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.819
 we hook the next color in the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.180
 second chain that we have made to 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.910
 start of this round 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.940
 and before hooking we leave a piece 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:02.300
 about the same length 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.960
 that we have left in the other beginning for 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.540
 make the fringe 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.700
 we hook the thread 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.480
 and we make two chains 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.480
 we throw 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:22.690
 and we will make in each half vareta 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.690
 of the points from the previous round 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.680
 once we have reached the end 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.200
 we do the same thing we have done 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.900
 made in the previous turn a chain 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.780
 and we pull the thread and we can already 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.730
 cut in this case we want all 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.100
 the half ends are left 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.690
 right if it does not matter that you stay 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.790
 a turn of the right and a return of the 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.000
 backwards once we get to the end here 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.730
 you can make two chains and go back 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.530
 the other side to start the next 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.200
 back we do the same we hook the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.690
 thread in the second chain 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.120
 that we have done at the beginning leaving a 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.120
 long piece to make the fringe 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:16.010
 and we make one and two chains we throw 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.530
 this thread and we're going to make half a crochet 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.530
 at all points of the turn 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.300
 Previous this scarf is very simple since 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.400
 that we only use the chains for the 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.400
 start of the round and half-thighs 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.409
 and we have to go repeating in each 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.450
 turn the stockings and we can 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:38.989
 make the scarf 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.980
 as wide as we want to do more 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.620
 turns of stockings varetas 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.720
 If you want to make the scarf longer or 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.090
 shorter you just have to modify the 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.930
 number of initial chains in this 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:57.810
 case we have done 300 but you can do 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.810
 350 200 the most convenient for you 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.890
 this is the way that the 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.260
 scarf we see that we have the fringes on 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.750
 each of the sides if you want you can 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.580
 add more fringes in this case we 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.710
 we like you to have good little 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.709
 remember if we want the scarf more 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.870
 wide we have to do more laps of 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.590
 stockings and if we want more 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.080
 long we have to make more chains to the 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.860
 start and we already have the basic scarf 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.860
 completed
