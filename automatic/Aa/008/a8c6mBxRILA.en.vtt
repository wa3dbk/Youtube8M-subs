alright<00:00:45.559> now<00:00:45.739> let's<00:00:46.039> see<00:00:46.160> if<00:00:46.250> we<00:00:46.340> can<00:00:46.489> set<00:00:46.699> a

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
alright now let's see if we can set a

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.729 
alright now let's see if we can set a
record<00:00:47.000> for<00:00:47.390> how<00:00:47.570> many<00:00:47.629> times<00:00:47.809> we<00:00:48.260> can<00:00:48.379> use<00:00:48.530> the

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
record for how many times we can use the

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.850

high gear a turbo velocity that never

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:20.410 
high gear a turbo velocity that never
runs<00:01:19.700> out<00:01:19.880> of<00:01:19.940> juice

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
runs out of juice

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.870 
runs out of juice
and<00:01:20.509> you'll<00:01:21.140> hit<00:01:21.289> a<00:01:21.350> totally<00:01:21.860> rad<00:01:22.130> max<00:01:22.550> speed

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
and you'll hit a totally rad max speed

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.330 
and you'll hit a totally rad max speed
of<00:01:23.170> 255<00:01:24.170> miles<00:01:24.500> per<00:01:24.860> hour

of 255 miles per hour

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.219 
of 255 miles per hour
I<00:01:25.369> guess<00:01:25.909> that's<00:01:26.149> as<00:01:26.300> much<00:01:26.479> as<00:01:26.690> the<00:01:26.899> Nintendo

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
I guess that's as much as the Nintendo

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.380 
I guess that's as much as the Nintendo
can<00:01:27.679> handle<00:01:28.039> you'll<00:01:28.729> need<00:01:28.940> to<00:01:29.060> safely

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
can handle you'll need to safely

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.389 
can handle you'll need to safely
navigate<00:01:29.929> the<00:01:30.080> twists<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:30.560> turns<00:01:30.679> of<00:01:31.130> every

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
navigate the twists and turns of every

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.730 
navigate the twists and turns of every
course<00:01:31.670> avoid<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.509> other<00:01:32.630> cars<00:01:32.929> and<00:01:33.200> reach

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
course avoid the other cars and reach

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.440 
course avoid the other cars and reach
checkpoints<00:01:34.399> before<00:01:34.520> running<00:01:35.060> out<00:01:35.149> of<00:01:35.179> time

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
checkpoints before running out of time

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.169 
checkpoints before running out of time
usually<00:01:36.319> if<00:01:36.649> you<00:01:36.770> crash<00:01:37.039> more<00:01:37.310> than<00:01:37.490> twice<00:01:37.759> you

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
usually if you crash more than twice you

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.600 
usually if you crash more than twice you
can<00:01:38.360> expect<00:01:38.750> a<00:01:38.899> game<00:01:39.080> over<00:01:39.409> but<00:01:39.920> sometimes<00:01:40.399> you

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
can expect a game over but sometimes you

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.520 
can expect a game over but sometimes you
might<00:01:40.729> get<00:01:40.909> lucky<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:41.479> can<00:01:41.690> coast<00:01:42.020> through<00:01:42.259> to

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
might get lucky and can coast through to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:51.560 
might get lucky and can coast through to
the<00:01:42.649> next<00:01:42.950> checkpoint<00:01:43.210> Brad

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.170 

so<00:01:52.170> haha<00:01:52.350> rad<00:01:53.070> racer<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.640> pretty<00:01:53.940> challenging

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
so haha rad racer is pretty challenging

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.300 
so haha rad racer is pretty challenging
but<00:01:54.900> it's<00:01:55.020> addictive<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.590> fun<00:01:55.830> enough<00:01:56.100> to

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
but it's addictive and fun enough to

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.550 
but it's addictive and fun enough to
warrant<00:01:56.550> many<00:01:56.910> playthroughs<00:01:57.570> part<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.440> that

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
warrant many playthroughs part of that

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.900 
warrant many playthroughs part of that
excitement<00:01:58.950> probably<00:01:59.430> comes<00:01:59.640> from<00:01:59.760> the

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
excitement probably comes from the
