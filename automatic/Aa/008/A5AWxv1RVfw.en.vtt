way I can get my um nonstick pan to fit
and<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.759> what<00:01:47.880> we're<00:01:47.970> going<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.149> use<00:01:48.329> to

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
and this is what we're going to use to

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.830 
and this is what we're going to use to
steam<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:50.700> noodles<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.060> put<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> ring<00:01:51.810> back

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
steam the noodles so put the ring back

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.929 
steam the noodles so put the ring back
on<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.189> put<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.729> next

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
on this is just so I can put the next

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.080 
on this is just so I can put the next
layer<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.689> top<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.770> we're<00:01:55.860> going<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.040> steam<00:01:56.310> two

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
layer on top so we're going to steam two

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.350 
layer on top so we're going to steam two
pans<00:01:57.630> at<00:01:58.590> once<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.490> for<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.759> impatient

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
pans at once this is for the impatient

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.230 
pans at once this is for the impatient
people<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.810> cannot<00:02:01.140> wait<00:02:01.909> keep<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.030> mind

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
people that cannot wait keep in mind

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.450 
people that cannot wait keep in mind
that<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.719> way<00:02:04.070> you're<00:02:05.070> going<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.369> to

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
that this way you're going to have to

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.830 
that this way you're going to have to
watch<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.030> bottom<00:02:06.299> layer<00:02:06.450> will<00:02:06.659> cook

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
watch that the bottom layer will cook

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.479 
watch that the bottom layer will cook
quicker<00:02:07.049> than<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.380> top<00:02:07.560> layer<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:08.310> I'm<00:02:08.369> going

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
quicker than the top layer so I'm going

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.249 
quicker than the top layer so I'm going
to<00:02:08.550> repeat<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.849> process<00:02:09.000> here<00:02:09.569> same<00:02:10.229> thing

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
to repeat the process here same thing

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.520 
to repeat the process here same thing
glass<00:02:11.039> pie<00:02:11.760> Bowl<00:02:12.000> or<00:02:12.270> pie<00:02:12.629> dish

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
then another this is a Nordic where I

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.720 
then another this is a Nordic where I

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.940 
and then you want to do one layer at a
time<00:05:36.820> so<00:05:37.420> it's<00:05:37.690> extra<00:05:38.230> work<00:05:38.410> you're<00:05:38.620> not<00:05:38.650> to<00:05:38.830> do

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
time so it's extra work you're not to do

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.560 
time so it's extra work you're not to do
it<00:05:39.040> that<00:05:39.190> way<00:05:39.370> but<00:05:39.730> that's<00:05:39.910> to<00:05:40.000> ensure<00:05:40.120> each

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
it that way but that's to ensure each

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.200 
it that way but that's to ensure each
layer<00:05:40.870> comes<00:05:41.230> out<00:05:41.440> perfect<00:05:42.340> and<00:05:42.460> you<00:05:42.970> don't<00:05:43.120> to

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
layer comes out perfect and you don't to

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.150 
layer comes out perfect and you don't to
pull<00:05:43.390> apart<00:05:43.510> anything<00:05:43.870> cuz<00:05:44.590> even<00:05:44.800> with<00:05:44.950> me

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160
