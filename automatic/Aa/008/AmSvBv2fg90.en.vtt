00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.809
 very good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.370
 new video today I want to tell you the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.860
 little story that I have had with this 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.049
 frog a few days ago to those who follow me 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.509
 on facebook I uploaded a photo commenting 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.460
 a little bit what happened is that this 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.900
 little frog was stowed between 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.480
 vegetables that were bought that day 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.520
 when they were suddenly soaked 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.980
 something moved and go surprise to see that 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.880
 it was a live frog I took the camera and here 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.880
 you can see the moment 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.470
 ah 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.160
 provisionally I put it in a 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.170
 small boat as it would have come up 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.640
 here because with all the movement that 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.240
 suffer the vegetables until you reach 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.830
 consumer 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.690
 the frog could have jumped in 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.990
 any time however it arrived 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.990
 to my house 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.120
 before eating me escape one point a 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.190
 Chinese and buy a fish holder of 5 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.100
 liters since there at least it would be more 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.659
 comfortable and would have better ventilation the 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.659
 frog would get about 3 centimeters 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.570
 I spent all afternoon looking 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.610
 information to see if he could know what 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.260
 species was at the end thanks to the 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.150
 mates I think we could 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.150
 classify it within the common frog 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.310
 I was seriously considering taking care of her 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.860
 but I do not have time knowledge nor 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.080
 right place for her I was worried 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.210
 especially the subject of food 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.009
 they only eat live food after half 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.170
 hour trying to combine flies of the 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.850
 fruit without success I realized that no 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.100
 I was prepared to have an animal 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.399
 well at home and that nature would be 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.399
 best 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.550
 so the next day I changed the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.230
 water since in just one day the water 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.810
 it had become cloudy as well as 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.700
 whitish and I took it to the river is the 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.330
 same river in which I found myself gambusia 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.330
 it's last summer 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.820
 I was looking for an ideal place to 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.820
 drop it and finally I decided on this 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.450
 ah 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.300
 here you can see the frog observing what 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.640
 that would be his new house 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.740
 before releasing it I was feeding the one 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.330
 little with the water of the river itself so that 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.140
 outside taking the same temperature and 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.140
 the parameters 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.010
 while the frog was acclimating 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.290
 I realized that at the bottom of the river 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.760
 there was a dead river congress so 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.760
 I tried to take it out to see it better 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.210
 it turned out to be the American crayfish 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.340
 an invasive species that destroys the 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.750
 rivers in spain and that is included in the 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.320
 Spanish catalog of exotic species 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.320
 invaders 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.900
 Y 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.720
 I also found some snails 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.720
 that you put us are very familiar 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.310
 finally it was time to let go 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.290
 Our friend at the beginning was very 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.460
 still surely I would be scared and 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.460
 stressed out by all the fuss 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.319
 a little bit of help and it's already started 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.319
 move and be free again 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.200
 and this has been the story of the frog 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.700
 that appeared between the vegetables I hope 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.560
 that you have liked and for any 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.510
 thing you can leave a comment 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.510
 see you in the next video bye bye
