00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
which that should be alright

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.929 
which that should be alright
grab<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.619> skeleton<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.520> because<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:29.909> a

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
grab the skeleton and because it's a

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.690 
grab the skeleton and because it's a
base<00:01:30.150> page<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:31.100> adjust<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> size<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.549> it

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
base page you can adjust the size of it

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.980 
base page you can adjust the size of it

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
keep it at this one actually I won't do

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.690 
keep it at this one actually I won't do
the<00:04:13.620> normal<00:04:13.890> one<00:04:13.980> because<00:04:14.280> this<00:04:14.400> is<00:04:14.459> what

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
the normal one because this is what

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.510 
the normal one because this is what
usually<00:04:14.910> is<00:04:15.150> um<00:04:15.770> see<00:04:16.770> ya<00:04:16.919> and<00:04:17.250> then<00:04:17.370> you've

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
usually is um see ya and then you've

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.659 
usually is um see ya and then you've
what<00:04:17.700> you<00:04:17.760> can<00:04:17.880> do<00:04:18.030> is<00:04:19.250> scale<00:04:20.250> it<00:04:20.400> down

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
what you can do is scale it down

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.700 
what you can do is scale it down
but<00:04:21.879> most<00:04:22.330> models<00:04:22.689> about<00:04:22.840> this<00:04:23.139> size<00:04:23.379> I<00:04:23.560> would

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
but most models about this size I would

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.929 
but most models about this size I would
have<00:04:23.860> thought<00:04:24.069> but<00:04:24.340> if<00:04:24.460> not<00:04:24.639> you<00:04:24.759> can<00:04:24.909> just

00:04:24.929 --> 00:04:24.939 
have thought but if not you can just
