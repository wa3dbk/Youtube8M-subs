00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.260
 hello everybody on this video, I'll show you 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.450
 for you as a battery is inside 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.519
 I'm going to open a battery about the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.949
 source association in addition to a battery 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.980
 is an association of several small 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:25.260
 daughters for this I'm going to wear a 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.060
 protection and I will wear gloves because 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.970
 battery has chemicals 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.560
 dangerous corrosive for that I go 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.090
 wear gloves 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.649
 Take care with that experience 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.390
 What do I do at home? 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.790
 if you are using 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.640
 Protection required Goggles 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.410
 nothing inspired by your eye and gloves 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.110
 not to contact the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.390
 beauty chemicals I'll show you 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.280
 you 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.870
 personally I'm here with two batteries will 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.480
 choose one of them for me i'll open 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.190
 take this here of the duration and in that part 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.340
 side of the battery here 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.050
 we have a trait zin ok I put that 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.809
 weighs the show that most likely 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.270
 It is going to take us use the show 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.460
 so I'm going to put this battery in the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.229
 show 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.439
 and then I forced this cap here 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.939
 For me to be able to remove it so I 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.939
 I started to lift my cap 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.880
 here I can use pliers to go 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:31.460
 Opening here I found the position that you 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:35.790
 It opens and then I can get people 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.640
 remove this metal cover and there we 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.400
 will see that inside the battery what the 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.030
 people have are stacks or open that with 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.030
 caution 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:57.690
 has that plastic cover there reminds you that 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.390
 I told you a video that one 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.210
 The 9-volt battery consisted of 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.380
 series of six daughters from one 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.610
 email 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:12.390
 so here you have six batteries associated with 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.550
 make a splint attached to the negative 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.860
 other have six batteries here will take the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.750
 reason I'll show you 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.620
 the folks if I call my last day 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.660
 here on the continuous voltage scale because 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.630
 here on the scale of 20 and get my 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:32.310
 association that inserts one in the 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.990
 tip another in the other I will have 6.56 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.130
 This battery I took, she was 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.410
 unloaded 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.130
 then the association is an association of 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.230
 six batteries of a 69 volt our case 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.260
 How are you downloading tadano 6? 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.270
 can be assumed that each cell zinha 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.760
 This will be about a volt 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.350
 we cut one that the association or 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.910
 Let's take it out here, let's see. 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:02.790
 while each stack of that has is 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:04.980
 plus a stack that has zero point 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.940
 a little there was almost there. 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.650
 volt 0.86 you can see that I am 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.120
 taking a summation now as I am 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.550
 decreasing the batteries 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.880
 I'm decreasing the sum you think 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.390
 It's crowded a '45 port almost a pile of 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.390
 an e-mail 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.610
 This I can do for all of this. 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.610
 folks 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.410
 all will be a pile of 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.950
 approximately 6 that is more 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.900
 loaded 1.39 you can see that they 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.300
 do not unload an equal amount are 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:46.470
 discharged from the others 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:48.930
 is 1.42 and the latter here a point 38 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.680
 then the staff as seen there in the 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.860
 video on the association of sources of 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.680
 a 9-volt battery is one of the 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.330
 association of six stacks of one email 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.640
 So we can see that the 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.440
 format of a stack even then the 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.810
 My personal tip is for you guys. 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.850
 like you like comments and shares 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.830
 Let's spread the electric world channel 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.700
 and for more people to learn electrical 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.650
 with us 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.650
 a personal hug and until the next video
