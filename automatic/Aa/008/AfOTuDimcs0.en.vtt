this was that the way it combines the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.279 
this was that the way it combines the
good<00:00:27.269> quality<00:00:27.720> video<00:00:27.990> with<00:00:29.869> this<00:00:30.869> activity

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
good quality video with this activity

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.729

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
they're going on in the video so as you

here<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:49.579> guess<00:00:50.660> you<00:00:51.660> could<00:00:51.840> say<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.469> it's

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
here I guess you could say that it's

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.420 
here I guess you could say that it's
also<00:00:54.539> sort<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.170> distracting<00:00:55.829> from<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.070> video

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
also sort of distracting from the video

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.590 
also sort of distracting from the video
because<00:00:57.390> as<00:00:57.600> good<00:00:58.579> just<00:00:59.579> pause<00:00:59.820> here<00:00:59.850> this

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
because as good just pause here this

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.200 
because as good just pause here this
task<00:01:01.230> really<00:01:01.559> has<00:01:01.829> nothing<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.370> do<00:01:02.699> with<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
task really has nothing to do with the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.289 
task really has nothing to do with the
content<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.409> pure<00:01:04.710> sort<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.610> race<00:01:05.880> to

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
content it's just a pure sort of race to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.460 
content it's just a pure sort of race to
recognize<00:01:06.840> things<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:09.020> am<00:01:10.020> doing<00:01:10.229> pretty<00:01:10.380> well

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470
