00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:07.110
 Or Hello Did you know it is Crystal arm today 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:11.000
 Tempered glass famous crystal armor 0.2 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:15.559
 I think that I want to introduce in was the most thin body 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.270
 It's 0.2 incense type, so it's about 0.4 mm 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:22.849
 There were many, but iphone 5 s because this 0.2mm thinner 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:28.820
 There is fingerprint authentication, or this 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:30.520
 Firmly you can press will look like in the still mind thickness as the thing this still hot until now 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.690
 It is quite network 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.800
 But this button press not or Toka goods button seal it was a mandatory need thereof 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.590
 lost 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.680
 Let's see it immediately 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.930
 I think I do not know quite a little video, but here 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.320
 Krista run is any bad 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.790
 I have this on my right hand 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.770
 This is the 0.55 days 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:58.670
 Well, you can see that the thickness is quite different 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:04.570
 If you touch it, it's quite obvious 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.570
 I think that I want to convey this thinness in the sound of the first hot thing 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.159
 I feel quite heavy-I think lively 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.030
 continue 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.030
 Rainy 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:21.560
 This really has been the sound of Las handle feeling 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.560
 It will feel like perapperapera 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.740
 I know this glass we have dropped this Ne Te such Perapera' 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.740
 Let's say goodbye to glass 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.670
 I think I understand 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.650
 It is not necessary 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:45.440
 I think it feels like you, but it became thinner and it became weaker 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:50.810
 I also I first I I thought so the cat that represents the strength of the glass, which is said to be code 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:56.720
 The value and the 0.55 mm it's Chris Turner of the original exactly the same of 9 h of code 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:59.670
 It may be said that it becomes the hardest and strongest model to say 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.470
 Such a thing does not have the I Day pen is is here. 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.920
 It is a 5 mm crystal armor 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.920
 Please keep a close look at the book Do you have any part of this edge 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.520
 Touch and eyes 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.520
 I do not feel like I put it 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:22.030
 Really thin 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.970
 I'm almost there is no interference between the case and say what happy by this I thin 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.730
 Because 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.050
 The metal blamber of glamour I am using 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.050
 Compatibility with this is also very good 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.910
 There is almost no level difference 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.200
 It is here is what was stretched 0.4 mm Crystal Armor 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.650
 By comparison 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.650
 You can see immediately if you watch the pre-war video 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.140
 You will understand immediately if you shave 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:57.100
 Absolutely 0.2 mm is easier to press 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:59.510
 The hardness is 9 h. Of course , even if you go to Kofu with a cutter , no scratches will occur. 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:05.150
 It's funny I really use the wound 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:07.239
 Also I do mess strongly wipe or faint say that line to enter is what is also at all function 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.239
 By this 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.430
 If it does not get damaged 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.409
 It is such a sound 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.409
 Even if it's like this, it wo n't hurt you 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.070
 I can't see scratches 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.850
 Not hurt at all 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.080
 When it comes out, it looks like a little depression spiral enters but if you wipe it off 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.770
 Ne 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:48.150
 Yes it could not be scratched 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.530
 Really easy to push Noto Home button Tteyuu nicely with what to say I also case 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.740
 It is to say 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.000
 There is no problem at all in combination with such a bumper 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.540
 Ah 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.930
 I would like to have a gap in Shibuya 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.350

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.100
