move it around with the camera if you

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:28.849 
move it around with the camera if you

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
think about it when you're moving

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.620 
think about it when you're moving
objects<00:00:29.189> around<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.699> let's<00:00:30.000> say<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.240> walk

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
objects around so let's say you walk

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.749 
objects around so let's say you walk
over<00:00:30.689> here<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.560> pillar<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.579> think

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
over here to this pillar and you think

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:33.889 
over here to this pillar and you think
you<00:00:32.880> know<00:00:32.969> what<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.239> pillar<00:00:33.510> needs<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.809> be

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
you know what this pillar needs to be

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.350 
you know what this pillar needs to be
lifted<00:00:34.260> up<00:00:34.440> into<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.770> air<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.640> grab<00:00:36.329> my

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
lifted up into the air so I grab my

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.040 
lifted up into the air so I grab my
translation<00:00:37.260> widget<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:38.149> I<00:00:39.149> slide<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.930> up

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
translation widget and I slide it up

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.630 
translation widget and I slide it up
that's<00:00:40.290> kind<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.559> like<00:00:40.739> moving<00:00:41.040> an<00:00:41.250> object

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
that's kind of like moving an object

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.850 
that's kind of like moving an object
with<00:00:41.790> your<00:00:41.940> mind<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.960> real<00:00:43.140> world<00:00:43.410> you

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
with your mind in the real world you

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.470 
with your mind in the real world you
would<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.250> walk<00:00:44.399> over<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.940> object

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
would have to walk over to that object

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.360 
would have to walk over to that object
and<00:00:45.600> actually<00:00:45.660> lift<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.230> up<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.559> that's<00:00:46.890> kind

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
and actually lift it up and that's kind

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.010 
and actually lift it up and that's kind
of<00:00:47.550> how<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.760> lock<00:00:48.149> selected<00:00:48.360> actors<00:00:48.690> to

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
of how the lock selected actors to

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.260 
of how the lock selected actors to
camera<00:00:49.140> button<00:00:49.620> works<00:00:49.890> what<00:00:50.640> I'm<00:00:50.730> gonna<00:00:50.879> do<00:00:51.030> is

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
camera button works what I'm gonna do is

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.150 
camera button works what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:00:51.510> gonna<00:00:51.600> pick<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.440> little<00:00:52.739> tiny

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
I'm gonna pick on this little tiny

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.490 
I'm gonna pick on this little tiny
pedestal<00:00:54.090> mesh<00:00:54.329> that's<00:00:54.930> right<00:00:55.199> here<00:00:55.320> at<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
pedestal mesh that's right here at the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.139 
pedestal mesh that's right here at the
end<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.800> stairwell<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.820> make<00:00:57.000> it

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
end of the stairwell and to make it

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.209 
end of the stairwell and to make it
really<00:00:57.629> easy<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:58.230> see<00:00:58.379> what's<00:00:58.530> going<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.980> I'm

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
really easy to see what's going on I'm

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.910 
really easy to see what's going on I'm
gonna<00:00:59.430> move<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> top<00:01:00.090> view<00:01:00.329> around<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.739> it's

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
gonna move the top view around so it's

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.740 
gonna move the top view around so it's
also<00:01:02.160> looking<00:01:02.520> at<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> same<00:01:03.149> little<00:01:03.420> pedestal

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
also looking at the same little pedestal

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.030 
also looking at the same little pedestal
mesh<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:06.390> down<00:01:06.810> here<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.140> perspective<00:01:07.830> I'm

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
mesh so down here in perspective I'm

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.789 
mesh so down here in perspective I'm
going<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.970> with<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.510> mesh<00:01:10.020> selected<00:01:10.409> notice

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
going to with this mesh selected notice

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.440 
going to with this mesh selected notice
I<00:01:10.950> do<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.340> selected<00:01:11.729> I'm<00:01:11.850> gonna<00:01:12.000> click<00:01:12.299> on

I'm just going to start to move the
camera<00:01:17.220> just<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.610> little<00:01:17.820> bit<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.060> watch

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
camera just a little bit and watch

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.600 
camera just a little bit and watch
really<00:01:18.540> closely<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:19.080> happens<00:01:22.189> if<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.400> take<00:01:23.549> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
really closely what happens if we take a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.520 
really closely what happens if we take a
look<00:01:23.880> up<00:01:24.090> here<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> top<00:01:24.659> view<00:01:24.930> our<00:01:25.170> mesh

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.590 
look up here in the top view our mesh
has<00:01:25.740> jumped<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.610> location<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:27.240> my<00:01:27.330> view

has jumped to the location in my view

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.149 
has jumped to the location in my view
now<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.020> really<00:01:28.409> make<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.590> clear<00:01:28.950> I'm<00:01:29.040> gonna

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
now to really make it clear I'm gonna

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.800 
now to really make it clear I'm gonna
switch<00:01:29.369> over<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> real-time<00:01:30.000> mode<00:01:30.299> up<00:01:30.630> here

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
switch over in a real-time mode up here

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.810 
switch over in a real-time mode up here
in<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.960> top<00:01:31.140> viewport<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.740> watch<00:01:32.310> as<00:01:32.579> I

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
in the top viewport and watch as I

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.069 
in the top viewport and watch as I
rotate<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> camera<00:01:34.610> that<00:01:35.610> mesh<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.390> following

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
rotate the camera that mesh is following

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.210 
rotate the camera that mesh is following
my<00:01:37.320> camera<00:01:37.680> around<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.930> I<00:01:39.930> could<00:01:40.409> just<00:01:40.560> fly<00:01:40.979> my

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
my camera around so I could just fly my

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.830 
my camera around so I could just fly my
camera<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.729> wherever<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.030> needed<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.420> mesh<00:01:42.659> to

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
camera to wherever I needed this mesh to

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.630 
camera to wherever I needed this mesh to
go<00:01:42.990> when<00:01:43.560> I'm<00:01:43.680> done<00:01:43.890> when<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.460> thing

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
go when I'm done when I have the thing

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.920 
go when I'm done when I have the thing
pretty<00:01:44.850> much<00:01:45.000> where<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.180> think<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.420> need<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.630> I

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
pretty much where I think I need it I

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.410 
pretty much where I think I need it I
can<00:01:46.710> switch<00:01:47.009> off<00:01:47.220> lock<00:01:47.520> selected<00:01:47.729> actors<00:01:48.090> to

can switch off lock selected actors to

follow this guy over here in the top
view<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.750> as<00:01:52.170> soon<00:01:52.290> as<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.500> switch<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.920> off<00:01:53.100> and

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
view so as soon as I switch this off and

view so as soon as I switch this off and
I<00:01:53.759> slide<00:01:54.030> back<00:01:54.470> that's<00:01:55.470> where<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> mesh<00:01:55.890> is

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
I slide back that's where the mesh is

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.740 
I slide back that's where the mesh is
placed

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
placed

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.929 
placed
now<00:01:57.750> that's<00:01:58.049> one<00:01:58.439> way<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.280> can<00:01:59.399> use<00:01:59.700> this

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
now that's one way that you can use this

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.209 
now that's one way that you can use this
tool<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:01.020> you'll<00:02:01.469> notice<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> workflow<00:02:02.189> that

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
tool so you'll notice the workflow that

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.249 
tool so you'll notice the workflow that
I<00:02:02.399> did<00:02:02.579> was<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.939> selected<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.689> object

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
I did was I selected the object

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.620 
I did was I selected the object
I<00:02:04.430> clicked<00:02:05.430> lock<00:02:05.640> selected<00:02:05.850> actors<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.509> camera

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
I clicked lock selected actors to camera

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.540 
I clicked lock selected actors to camera
and<00:02:06.990> then<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.229> move<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.619> camera<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.129> that'll

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
and then I move the camera and that'll

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.279 
and then I move the camera and that'll
make<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.849> object<00:02:09.270> pop<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.840> location<00:02:10.229> of

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
make the object pop to the location of

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.839 
make the object pop to the location of
the<00:02:10.379> camera<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:10.950> if<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.400> move<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.700> camera

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
the camera so if you move the camera

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.040 
the camera so if you move the camera
first

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
first

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.360 
first
the<00:02:13.080> object<00:02:13.470> will<00:02:13.560> jump<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.010> camera

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
the object will jump to the camera

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.740 
the object will jump to the camera
however<00:02:14.760> there's<00:02:14.940> another<00:02:14.970> way<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.300> use<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.480> -

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
however there's another way to use it -

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.100 
however there's another way to use it -
if<00:02:16.160> we<00:02:17.160> jump<00:02:17.970> into<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.450> mode<00:02:18.600> so<00:02:18.750> if<00:02:18.840> we<00:02:18.930> click

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
if we jump into the mode so if we click

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.350 
if we jump into the mode so if we click
lock<00:02:19.560> selected<00:02:19.800> actors<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.430> camera<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.910> then

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
lock selected actors to camera and then

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.810 
lock selected actors to camera and then
click<00:02:21.660> on<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.900> object<00:02:22.290> we<00:02:22.980> actually<00:02:23.340> pop<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
click on the object we actually pop the

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.020 
click on the object we actually pop the
camera<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.510> location<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.170> object<00:02:26.030> so

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
camera to the location of the object so

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.310 
camera to the location of the object so
it<00:02:27.150> just<00:02:27.300> depends<00:02:27.570> on<00:02:27.690> which<00:02:27.810> way<00:02:27.960> you<00:02:28.020> want<00:02:28.260> to

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
it just depends on which way you want to

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.290 
it just depends on which way you want to
go<00:02:28.440> if<00:02:28.650> you'd<00:02:28.800> like<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.250> object<00:02:29.730> come<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.150> you

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
go if you'd like the object come to you

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.360 
go if you'd like the object come to you
then<00:02:30.840> just<00:02:31.080> move<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.410> camera<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:31.980> it'll<00:02:32.160> jump

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
then just move the camera and it'll jump

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.860 
then just move the camera and it'll jump
right<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.820> if<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.330> want<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.570> take<00:02:33.720> the

camera to the location of the object

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.250 
camera to the location of the object
then<00:02:35.820> click<00:02:35.850> on<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.300> object<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.810> it'll<00:02:37.050> jump

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
not to get too far ahead of ourselves

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.100 
not to get too far ahead of ourselves
there<00:02:41.400> is<00:02:41.430> one<00:02:41.820> place<00:02:42.060> where<00:02:42.240> this<00:02:42.390> is<00:02:42.600> really
