Oh

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:03.800 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:10.720 

II<00:00:03.830> a<00:00:04.670> sports<00:00:05.540> it's<00:00:05.960> in<00:00:06.050> the<00:00:06.170> game<00:00:09.400> when<00:00:10.400> we<00:00:10.430> sat

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
II a sports it's in the game when we sat

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.220 
II a sports it's in the game when we sat
down<00:00:10.910> and<00:00:11.150> we<00:00:11.240> started<00:00:11.570> thinking<00:00:11.750> about<00:00:11.959> the

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
down and we started thinking about the

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.810 
down and we started thinking about the
design<00:00:12.530> for<00:00:12.740> this<00:00:12.860> year's<00:00:13.100> game<00:00:13.340> one<00:00:13.610> of<00:00:13.639> the

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
design for this year's game one of the

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.340 
design for this year's game one of the
things<00:00:14.030> that<00:00:14.240> we<00:00:14.330> thought<00:00:14.570> was<00:00:14.719> missing<00:00:15.139> from

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
things that we thought was missing from

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.010 
things that we thought was missing from
that<00:00:15.379> game<00:00:15.740> was<00:00:16.039> the<00:00:16.699> whole<00:00:16.880> experience<00:00:17.420> of<00:00:17.750> an

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
that game was the whole experience of an

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.860 
that game was the whole experience of an
interaction<00:00:18.800> between<00:00:18.830> a<00:00:19.430> golf<00:00:19.940> pro<00:00:20.240> and<00:00:20.600> his

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:20.870 
interaction between a golf pro and his

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.140 
interaction between a golf pro and his
caddie<00:00:21.170> we've<00:00:21.680> been<00:00:21.830> studying<00:00:22.070> this<00:00:22.370> for<00:00:22.640> for

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
caddie we've been studying this for for

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.610 
caddie we've been studying this for for
a<00:00:23.180> significant<00:00:23.780> amount<00:00:23.810> of<00:00:23.990> time<00:00:24.170> and<00:00:24.230> we<00:00:24.410> want

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:24.620 
a significant amount of time and we want

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.200 
a significant amount of time and we want
to<00:00:24.710> make<00:00:24.860> sure<00:00:25.010> that<00:00:25.130> we<00:00:25.250> delivered<00:00:25.640> something

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
to make sure that we delivered something

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.390 
to make sure that we delivered something
where<00:00:26.650> once<00:00:27.650> you<00:00:27.770> played<00:00:27.980> with<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:28.160> caddie

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
where once you played with the caddie

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.000 
where once you played with the caddie
you'd<00:00:28.820> never<00:00:29.330> ever<00:00:29.480> want<00:00:30.320> to<00:00:30.380> play<00:00:30.619> without

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.010 
you'd never ever want to play without

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.040 
you'd never ever want to play without
what<00:00:31.369> you've<00:00:31.610> played<00:00:31.940> a<00:00:31.970> number<00:00:32.329> of<00:00:32.480> a

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
previous Tiger Woods PGA Tour games when

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.660 
previous Tiger Woods PGA Tour games when
you've<00:00:35.989> got<00:00:36.170> to<00:00:36.380> this<00:00:36.500> year's<00:00:36.770> game<00:00:37.070> you<00:00:37.460> would

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
you've got to this year's game you would

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.700 
you've got to this year's game you would
say<00:00:38.030> to<00:00:38.090> yourself<00:00:38.480> this<00:00:38.930> is<00:00:39.110> very<00:00:39.470> much<00:00:39.680> a

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
say to yourself this is very much a

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.770 
say to yourself this is very much a
different<00:00:40.130> experience<00:00:40.520> yeah<00:00:41.450> I<00:00:41.480> think<00:00:41.570> a

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
different experience yeah I think a

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.630 
different experience yeah I think a
player<00:00:42.260> kind<00:00:42.500> of<00:00:42.590> relationships<00:00:43.010> vital

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
player kind of relationships vital

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.389 
player kind of relationships vital
I<00:00:44.290> certainly<00:00:45.290> have<00:00:45.590> leaned<00:00:45.800> on<00:00:45.890> my<00:00:46.070> caddies

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
I certainly have leaned on my caddies

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.069 
I certainly have leaned on my caddies
throughout<00:00:46.640> the<00:00:46.790> years<00:00:46.970> for<00:00:47.239> information

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
throughout the years for information

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.490 
throughout the years for information
their<00:00:48.290> opinions<00:00:49.809> you<00:00:50.809> know<00:00:50.870> obviously<00:00:51.260> the

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
their opinions you know obviously the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.700 
their opinions you know obviously the
player<00:00:51.770> off<00:00:52.100> makes<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:52.940> last<00:00:53.120> call<00:00:53.470> but<00:00:54.470> I

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
player off makes the last call but I

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.200 
player off makes the last call but I
think<00:00:55.040> it's<00:00:55.130> nice<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:55.399> get<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:55.640> input<00:00:55.760> we

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
think it's nice to get the input we

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.729 
think it's nice to get the input we
spend<00:00:56.420> a<00:00:56.450> lot<00:00:56.600> of<00:00:56.630> time<00:00:56.930> studying<00:00:57.380> our

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
spend a lot of time studying our

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.470 
spend a lot of time studying our
audience<00:00:58.130> how<00:00:58.579> they<00:00:58.610> interacted<00:00:59.239> with<00:00:59.360> the

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
audience how they interacted with the

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.940 
audience how they interacted with the
game<00:00:59.690> and<00:00:59.899> one<00:01:00.050> of<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.230> things<00:01:00.440> that<00:01:00.620> we<00:01:00.710> found

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
game and one of the things that we found

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.700 
game and one of the things that we found
was<00:01:01.520> they<00:01:02.180> weren't<00:01:02.660> seeing<00:01:03.170> all<00:01:03.469> the

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
was they weren't seeing all the

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.010 
was they weren't seeing all the
different<00:01:03.829> elements<00:01:04.250> of<00:01:04.759> being<00:01:05.600> out<00:01:05.750> on<00:01:05.780> the

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020
