00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.180
 to get here I am again, I wanted 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:10.070
 always the function or just playing 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:12.080
 show is just about to rinse again 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:19.880
 as we almost go up to it 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:21.910
 so users open once easier 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.910
 handling 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.619
 flap is open 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.579
 the gutters 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.480
 it would something light 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.220
 so 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.220
 that's how it all starts from the inside 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.390
 so automatic rinsing is this 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.980
 small narrow slits thought of 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.909
 the outside something bad recognize the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.670
 mother that the whole one sheet remains high 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.510
 and push down 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.229
 a little bit more 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.300
 influence 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:19.430
 I'm doing it this way that I once 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.430
 shortly trigger a flush opens 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.580
 all in one 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.470
 so now 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.030
 is the swimmer because of swimmer can 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.800
 you actually set it automatically 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.680
 when he should play 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.750
 at which level on the same so 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.630
 feed the drums themselves 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:46.600
 Cleaning can also vary 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.600
 and that shows that 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.880
 so 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.530
 and here are a few 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.659
 valve for adjustment 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.930
 for the third hand 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:09.470
 you can also recognize the thing 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.950
 so simple resolution myWeight on 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.950
 the swimmer 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.300
 miller 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.740
 that he believe my feeling here ali
