00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
twice in the two major scale we're using

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.810

best<00:02:22.110> bet<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.530> just<00:02:22.680> copy<00:02:23.040> exactly<00:02:23.519> how<00:02:23.880> I

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
best bet is to just copy exactly how I

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.110 
best bet is to just copy exactly how I
do<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.860> because<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.519> means<00:02:26.670> your<00:02:26.849> fingers

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
do it because that means your fingers

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.300 
do it because that means your fingers
you<00:02:27.180> want<00:02:27.299> no<00:02:27.450> more<00:02:27.690> advice<00:02:28.019> go<00:02:28.440> get<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.099> bad

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
you want no more advice go get it bad

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.089 
you want no more advice go get it bad
habit<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:30.299> once<00:02:30.900> one<00:02:31.110> more<00:02:31.530> time<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.860> entire

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
habit so once one more time the entire

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:47.150 
habit so once one more time the entire
thing<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.519> like<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:45.680> then<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.799> go<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:46.980> this

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
thing is like this then you go to this

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.370 
thing is like this then you go to this
one<00:02:47.280> part<00:02:47.519> which<00:02:47.849> is<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.450> power<00:02:48.750> chords<00:02:49.110> which

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
one part which is the power chords which

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.319 
one part which is the power chords which
are<00:02:49.530> with<00:02:49.680> these<00:02:49.950> three<00:02:50.220> fingers<00:02:50.430> what<00:02:51.209> you

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
are with these three fingers what you

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.789 
are with these three fingers what you
got<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.540> do<00:02:51.630> is<00:02:51.810> any<00:02:52.049> power<00:02:52.319> point<00:02:52.560> they're<00:02:52.680> all

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
got to do is any power point they're all

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.250 
got to do is any power point they're all
the<00:02:52.920> same<00:02:52.950> on<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.519> E<00:02:53.549> and<00:02:53.910> E<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.599> also<00:02:54.900> only<00:02:55.019> a

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
the same on the E and E and also only a

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:03.530 
the same on the E and E and also only a
D<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:55.950> G<00:02:56.069> strip<00:02:56.519> so<00:03:00.920> they<00:03:01.920> go<00:03:02.329> right<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:03.510> way

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
D and G strip so they go right the way

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.819 
D and G strip so they go right the way
up<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:05.489> en<00:03:05.880> extra<00:03:06.350> so<00:03:07.350> you<00:03:07.410> got<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.680> get<00:03:07.739> the

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
up the en extra so you got to get the

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.640 
up the en extra so you got to get the
first<00:03:08.069> note<00:03:08.280> which<00:03:08.519> is<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.940> second<00:03:09.480> one<00:03:10.230> di

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
first note which is the second one di

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.860 
first note which is the second one di
string<00:03:11.040> then<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:11.579> bring<00:03:11.940> these<00:03:12.329> two<00:03:12.389> fingers

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
string then you bring these two fingers

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.280 
string then you bring these two fingers
over<00:03:13.079> here<00:03:13.319> to<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.590> fourth<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.299> G<00:03:15.480> so

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
over here to the fourth and the G so

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.440 
over here to the fourth and the G so
that<00:03:16.319> should<00:03:16.680> sound<00:03:16.889> like<00:03:17.010> this<00:03:18.829> and<00:03:20.450> then

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
that should sound like this and then

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.940 
that should sound like this and then
straight<00:03:22.049> after<00:03:22.079> that<00:03:22.350> you're<00:03:22.620> pretty<00:03:22.799> much

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
straight after that you're pretty much

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.680 
straight after that you're pretty much
doing<00:03:23.220> exactly<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.850> same<00:03:23.880> thing<00:03:24.299> that<00:03:24.450> we<00:03:24.540> did

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
doing exactly the same thing that we did

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.000 
doing exactly the same thing that we did
in<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.840> first<00:03:25.019> part<00:03:25.319> but<00:03:25.440> there's<00:03:25.739> only<00:03:25.889> just

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
in the first part but there's only just

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.400 
in the first part but there's only just
one<00:03:26.489> major<00:03:27.060> change<00:03:27.420> well<00:03:27.750> two<00:03:27.959> major<00:03:28.170> changes

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
one major change well two major changes

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.410 
one major change well two major changes
like<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:29.370> what<00:03:29.519> you<00:03:29.609> got<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.850> do<00:03:29.970> is<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.269> got<00:03:30.389> to

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
like so what you got to do is you got to

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.800 
like so what you got to do is you got to
go<00:03:30.859> and<00:03:31.859> then<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.030> second<00:03:33.450> part<00:03:33.569> this<00:03:33.750> is

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
go and then the second part this is

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.430 
go and then the second part this is
where<00:03:34.019> it<00:03:34.139> changes<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:34.590> goes<00:03:35.329> then<00:03:36.329> fine<00:03:37.079> and

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
where it changes it goes then fine and

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.500 
where it changes it goes then fine and
instead<00:03:37.680> of<00:03:37.739> going<00:03:37.889> down<00:03:38.069> here<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:39.120> go<00:03:39.239> here

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
instead of going down here you go here

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.449 
instead of going down here you go here
to<00:03:39.889> the<00:03:40.889> seventh<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:41.609> you<00:03:41.700> go

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.349 

and<00:03:45.379> then<00:03:46.379> look<00:03:46.650> here<00:03:47.189> to<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.670> third<00:03:47.700> fret<00:03:48.209> on

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
and then look here to the third fret on

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.479 
and then look here to the third fret on
the<00:03:48.450> E<00:03:48.569> string<00:03:48.689> and<00:03:49.170> then<00:03:49.709> put<00:03:49.920> these<00:03:50.250> two<00:03:50.459> in

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
the E string and then put these two in

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:57.050 
the E string and then put these two in
on<00:03:50.730> five<00:03:51.000> in<00:03:51.180> five<00:03:51.359> and<00:03:51.750> go<00:03:54.620> and<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:56.459> pretty

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
on five in five and go and so pretty

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.869 
on five in five and go and so pretty
much<00:03:57.269> how<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.719> should<00:03:57.930> sound<00:03:58.230> after<00:03:58.859> a<00:03:59.159> lot

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
much how that should sound after a lot

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.179 
much how that should sound after a lot
of<00:04:00.030> practicing<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:00.989> going<00:04:01.769> really<00:04:01.920> really

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.189 
of practicing and going really really

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.640 
of practicing and going really really
slowly<00:04:02.519> which<00:04:02.969> he<00:04:03.150> doctorate<00:04:03.900> glasses<00:04:04.500> like

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
slowly which he doctorate glasses like

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:17.270 
slowly which he doctorate glasses like
this<00:04:15.169> I'm<00:04:16.169> liking<00:04:16.380> them<00:04:16.620> before<00:04:16.919> climate

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
this I'm liking them before climate

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.729 
this I'm liking them before climate
changes<00:04:17.669> so<00:04:18.030> there's<00:04:18.389> just<00:04:18.449> an<00:04:18.870> one<00:04:19.470> major

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
changes so there's just an one major

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.999 
changes so there's just an one major
change<00:04:19.979> in<00:04:20.190> here<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.340> think<00:04:20.519> which<00:04:21.090> is<00:04:21.269> three

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:25.009 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.950 

and<00:04:26.009> then<00:04:26.250> you<00:04:26.310> go<00:04:26.490> jump<00:04:27.090> up<00:04:27.300> here<00:04:27.570> to<00:04:27.840> the

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
and then you go jump up here to the

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.770 
and then you go jump up here to the
seven<00:04:28.410> on<00:04:29.039> the<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.490> string<00:04:29.550> so<00:04:30.090> seven<00:04:30.479> and<00:04:30.599> eight

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
seven on the a string so seven and eight

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.680 
seven on the a string so seven and eight
and<00:04:30.810> then<00:04:31.139> nine<00:04:31.410> a<00:04:31.650> nine<00:04:31.680> on<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.430> DNG<00:04:32.849> so

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
and then nine a nine on the DNG so

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.920 
and then nine a nine on the DNG so
that's<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:37.849> that's<00:04:38.849> pretty<00:04:39.210> much<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.780> entire

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
that's and that's pretty much the entire

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.110 
that's and that's pretty much the entire
yourself<00:04:40.500> and<00:04:40.680> there's<00:04:41.490> only<00:04:41.610> one<00:04:41.729> more<00:04:42.060> thing

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
yourself and there's only one more thing

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.610 
yourself and there's only one more thing
that<00:04:42.330> you<00:04:42.570> have<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.870> do<00:04:43.050> when<00:04:43.380> you're<00:04:43.530> doing

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
that you have to do when you're doing

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.379 
that you have to do when you're doing
your<00:04:43.740> PowerPoint<00:04:44.250> you'll<00:04:44.789> notice<00:04:45.150> that<00:04:45.270> it

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
your PowerPoint you'll notice that it

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.129 
your PowerPoint you'll notice that it
kind<00:04:45.599> of<00:04:45.690> stops<00:04:46.050> dead<00:04:46.380> so<00:04:46.710> it<00:04:46.800> goes<00:04:48.050> so<00:04:49.050> what

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
kind of stops dead so it goes so what

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.290 
kind of stops dead so it goes so what
you<00:04:49.260> got<00:04:49.409> to<00:04:49.500> do<00:04:49.590> is<00:04:49.770> you're<00:04:50.159> kind<00:04:50.460> of<00:04:50.550> stopping

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
you got to do is you're kind of stopping

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.750 
you got to do is you're kind of stopping
all<00:04:51.449> of<00:04:51.659> this<00:04:51.720> down<00:04:51.930> with<00:04:52.380> again<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:53.370> family
