00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
not effective just like over dulling and

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.450 
not effective just like over dulling and
over<00:02:02.139> texturing<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:02.740> surface<00:02:03.100> of<00:02:03.219> the<00:02:03.280> ball

over texturing the surface of the ball

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.910 
over texturing the surface of the ball
so<00:02:03.969> it's<00:02:04.149> not<00:02:04.270> effective<00:02:04.840> so<00:02:05.590> what<00:02:05.799> we

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
so it's not effective so what we
