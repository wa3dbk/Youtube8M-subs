is always a good idea it's because you
get<00:03:13.879> in<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.090> graveyard<00:03:14.269> it's<00:03:14.540> done<00:03:14.689> and

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720

dusted humping my career dice and it's
just<00:03:17.299> a<00:03:17.329> really<00:03:17.480> good<00:03:17.659> thing<00:03:17.689> to<00:03:17.930> do<00:03:18.079> the<00:03:18.620> card

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
just a really good thing to do the card

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.199 
just a really good thing to do the card
is<00:03:18.980> also<00:03:19.189> particularly<00:03:19.430> versatile<00:03:19.939> and<00:03:20.090> that

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
is also particularly versatile and that

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.220 
is also particularly versatile and that
you<00:03:20.299> get<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.480> choose<00:03:20.689> the<00:03:20.840> monster<00:03:21.079> that<00:03:21.169> you

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
you get to choose the monster that you

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.080 
you get to choose the monster that you
destroyed<00:03:21.260> laughs<00:03:22.099> we<00:03:22.280> face<00:03:22.459> up<00:03:22.489> fair<00:03:22.909> enough

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
destroyed laughs we face up fair enough

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.550 
destroyed laughs we face up fair enough
you're<00:03:23.359> probably<00:03:23.540> 2,000<00:03:23.989> Life<00:03:24.109> Points<00:03:24.260> pretty

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
you're probably 2,000 Life Points pretty

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.839 
you're probably 2,000 Life Points pretty
pairs<00:03:24.829> if<00:03:25.040> that's<00:03:25.219> a<00:03:25.280> difference<00:03:25.519> between<00:03:25.730> you

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
pairs if that's a difference between you

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.250 
pairs if that's a difference between you
looping<00:03:26.209> them<00:03:26.329> and<00:03:26.480> not<00:03:26.599> looping<00:03:26.930> them<00:03:27.049> it's

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
looping them and not looping them it's

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.559 
looping them and not looping them it's
totally<00:03:27.739> worth<00:03:27.889> it<00:03:28.010> in<00:03:28.129> my<00:03:28.189> constipating<00:03:28.909> the

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
totally worth it in my constipating the

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.089 
totally worth it in my constipating the
traps<00:03:29.780> are<00:03:29.989> completely<00:03:30.379> standard<00:03:30.709> they're

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
traps are completely standard they're

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.740 
traps are completely standard they're
just<00:03:31.129> concentrating<00:03:31.879> on<00:03:31.879> field<00:03:32.209> control<00:03:32.510> just

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
just concentrating on field control just

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.149 
just concentrating on field control just
like<00:03:32.810> Toyota<00:03:33.260> Mansfield<00:03:33.620> except<00:03:33.980> you're<00:03:34.099> my

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 
like Toyota Mansfield except you're my

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:35.770 
like Toyota Mansfield except you're my
mirror<00:03:34.400> force<00:03:34.459> as<00:03:34.790> well<00:03:34.909> so<00:03:35.449> this<00:03:35.540> like<00:03:35.690> just

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
mirror force as well so this like just

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.449 
mirror force as well so this like just
runs<00:03:35.959> double<00:03:36.229> bottomless<00:03:36.590> samrah<00:03:36.949> gauge<00:03:37.250> I'm

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
runs double bottomless samrah gauge I'm

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.640 
runs double bottomless samrah gauge I'm

your<00:03:46.519> phone's<00:03:46.699> going<00:03:46.849> to<00:03:46.909> lose<00:03:47.030> most<00:03:47.180> of<00:03:47.299> cards

themselves if they have an obvious or a

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:07.899 
themselves if they have an obvious or a
terrorist<00:04:07.099> or<00:04:07.250> something<00:04:07.280> stupid<00:04:07.639> like<00:04:07.819> that

which<00:04:08.389> they<00:04:08.540> don't<00:04:08.840> care<00:04:09.079> if<00:04:09.169> it<00:04:09.290> gets

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:09.409 
which they don't care if it gets

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:11.289 
which they don't care if it gets
destroyed<00:04:09.709> and<00:04:10.009> then<00:04:10.639> next<00:04:10.790> turn<00:04:10.970> they<00:04:11.180> can

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
destroyed and then next turn they can

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.780 
destroyed and then next turn they can
just<00:04:11.449> go<00:04:11.540> with<00:04:11.659> loop<00:04:11.810> you<00:04:11.959> so<00:04:12.290> that<00:04:12.979> is<00:04:13.129> for<00:04:13.699> me

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
just go with loop you so that is for me

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.399 
just go with loop you so that is for me
the<00:04:13.819> reason<00:04:14.150> why<00:04:14.419> the<00:04:14.479> step<00:04:14.720> needs<00:04:14.900> to<00:04:15.049> go<00:04:15.169> it's

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:15.409 
the reason why the step needs to go it's

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.140 
the reason why the step needs to go it's
because<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:15.919> can<00:04:16.159> generate<00:04:16.400> disadvantage<00:04:17.030> for

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
because it can generate disadvantage for

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.789 
because it can generate disadvantage for
itself<00:04:17.449> and<00:04:17.690> then<00:04:17.870> just<00:04:17.989> gained<00:04:18.169> instant<00:04:18.560> and

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
itself and then just gained instant and

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.610 
itself and then just gained instant and
bandage<00:04:19.039> the<00:04:19.159> next<00:04:19.370> turn<00:04:19.519> it's<00:04:19.759> just<00:04:19.940> silly

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
bandage the next turn it's just silly

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.749 
bandage the next turn it's just silly
now<00:04:21.620> husband<00:04:21.949> decide<00:04:22.159> next<00:04:22.340> track<00:04:22.550> they<00:04:22.639> are

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:22.759 
now husband decide next track they are

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.100 
now husband decide next track they are
pretty<00:04:22.909> damn<00:04:23.150> standard<00:04:23.630> though<00:04:23.720> I<00:04:23.750> do<00:04:23.870> say<00:04:23.960> so

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
pretty damn standard though I do say so
