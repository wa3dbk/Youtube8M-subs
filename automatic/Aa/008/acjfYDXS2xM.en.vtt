00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
didn't really take that long to figure

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.410 
didn't really take that long to figure
out<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.789> didn't<00:00:30.029> know<00:00:30.090> everything<00:00:30.390> from

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
the beginning but a lot of it was common

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.170

just referenced the manual and that goes

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.590 
just referenced the manual and that goes
for<00:00:35.100> everything<00:00:35.520> with<00:00:35.670> technology<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.390> not

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
for everything with technology it's not

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.479 
for everything with technology it's not
that<00:00:36.870> complicated<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:37.920> anything<00:00:38.190> else

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489

in<00:00:38.790> life<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.180> just<00:00:39.210> takes<00:00:39.600> practice<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.410> I

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
in life it just takes practice and I

don't know how to this is an extremely

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.920 
don't know how to this is an extremely
basic<00:00:47.610> example<00:00:48.270> but<00:00:48.329> it's<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.539> first<00:00:48.750> one<00:00:48.899> I

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
basic example but it's the first one I

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.090 
basic example but it's the first one I
thought<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.379> we're<00:00:49.500> gonna<00:00:49.590> roll<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:50.039> it

actually<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.170> example<00:00:55.530> would<00:00:55.680> be<00:00:55.770> how<00:00:56.010> to

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
actually in this example would be how to

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.069 
actually in this example would be how to
set<00:00:56.460> an<00:00:56.610> email<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.210> will<00:00:57.360> pop<00:00:57.570> up<00:00:57.600> right

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:21.920 
one tip for you computer illiterate
people<00:01:20.880> which<00:01:21.180> doesn't<00:01:21.450> really<00:01:21.509> make<00:01:21.720> any

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
people which doesn't really make any

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.690 
people which doesn't really make any
sense<00:01:22.320> because<00:01:22.590> you're<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.860> YouTube<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.490> you

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
sense because you're on YouTube and you

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.190 
sense because you're on YouTube and you
obviously<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:24.360> some<00:01:24.570> computer<00:01:24.900> literacy

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
obviously have some computer literacy

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.320 
obviously have some computer literacy
but<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.650> general<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.490> message<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.150> them

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
but in general just a message to them

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.940 
but in general just a message to them
think<00:01:27.689> because<00:01:28.110> what<00:01:28.320> you're<00:01:28.439> trying<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.829> do

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
think because what you're trying to do

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.100 
think because what you're trying to do
is<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> lot<00:01:29.549> simpler<00:01:29.970> than<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.299> think<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.869> no

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
is a lot simpler than you think it is no

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.870 
is a lot simpler than you think it is no
one<00:01:31.259> purposefully<00:01:31.979> makes<00:01:32.220> technology

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
one purposefully makes technology

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.580 
one purposefully makes technology
complicated<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.720> confuses<00:01:34.170> people<00:01:34.200> that's

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
complicated so it confuses people that's

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.230 
complicated so it confuses people that's
just<00:01:34.799> not<00:01:34.979> smart<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.640> obviously<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.210> a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
just not smart and obviously this is a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.730 
just not smart and obviously this is a
developing<00:01:36.630> technology<00:01:37.350> they're<00:01:37.500> gonna<00:01:37.590> be

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
developing technology they're gonna be

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.230 
developing technology they're gonna be
smart<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.280> takes<00:01:38.460> some<00:01:38.610> intelligence<00:01:39.150> to

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
smart it takes some intelligence to

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.640 
smart it takes some intelligence to
develop<00:01:39.570> them<00:01:39.720> why<00:01:39.900> it's<00:01:39.930> taking<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.470> while<00:01:40.500> to

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
develop them why it's taking a while to

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.109 
develop them why it's taking a while to
give<00:01:40.920> them<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> level<00:01:41.369> at<00:01:41.460> 7i<00:01:41.790> descend<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
give them a level at 7i descend a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.910 
give them a level at 7i descend a
sentence<00:01:42.390> with<00:01:42.479> at<00:01:42.659> cannot<00:01:43.439> believe<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.890> just

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
sentence with at cannot believe I just

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.740 
sentence with at cannot believe I just
did<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.220> moving<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.090> simplest<00:01:45.509> way<00:01:45.720> of

did that moving on the simplest way of
doing<00:01:46.140> things<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.560> usually<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.399> right<00:01:47.430> way<00:01:47.850> to
