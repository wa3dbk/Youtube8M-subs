00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:09.019
 radioactivity there are acute problems here 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:13.070
 in the middle of Ukraine and uranium 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.070
 manifestations de uranium mine 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.960
 uranium production you this 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:22.220
 Dnepropetrovsk and Kirovograd 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.939
 areas first but exactly the same 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:32.040
 problems of natural radioactivity they 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:36.719
 tied to our land and above all to 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.559
 rural these homes especially if 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.420
 old home from there in such houses 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.620
 often enough elevated content 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.570
 radon 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:52.740
 and the hospital is 70 percent of the dose 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:59.280
 population exposure python is a common 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:01:01.200
 the overall situation across the earth goes down 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.840
 to well that's from the territory of the water intake 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.100
 Naquids bleach understandable need to lower 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.990
 before 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.410
 Now if we talk about water, you need 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.990
 analyze which pollutants of these 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:21.230
 few pollutants may be 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:25.080
 it's uranium for radon lead polonium 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.590
 means the greatest manifestation in Ukraine 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.950
 it's radon and uranium 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.830
 mean if manifestation with touches radon 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.740
 that way is simple 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:43.020
 this is necessary because radon gas is needed 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.020
 you can get rid of this gas by 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.150
 extrusions 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.720
 passing air bubbles or 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:55.890
 oxygen for example these cookies well and furnaces 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.710
 this boiling is definitely helping after 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.020
 radon boiling no but it 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.340
 not necessarily these cookies it can be 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:09.270
 the compressor pumps the usual into the air 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.450
 the compressor effect reduces 35 times 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.420
 about a decrease of 3 to 5 times it is quite 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.970
 enough to remove problems and on 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.370
 practice in practice is done 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.480
 in fact in practice done 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.880
 much more then there are systems 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.090
 getting rid of radon a lot of them it's me 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.720
 called by spend one option 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.880
 this 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.230
 this is tearing aeration systems another 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.910
 moment it may be 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.230
 activated carbon filter but 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.650
 activated carbon is commonly used 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.520
 for example in the water supply system 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.230
 cottage or small 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.030
 water systems on several 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.580
 data well, small houses cottages 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.520
 if big systems in such cases 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.870
 used here are compression 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.830
 installations 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.560
 the radio allows you to reduce effectively and 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.440
 keeping me fish is oval 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.620
 efficiency decreases need the thing is 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:23.840
 that you have in the aquarium there is this 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:26.810
 radon because the water of the city ​​of kiev 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:32.600
 principle if you examine even every 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:36.200
 well it is difficult to find close 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:40.160
 meaning motives meaning they are lower 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.340
 but there are settlements in which the whole 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:48.010
 water from deep wells and water 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.010
 exceeds for example 10 size
