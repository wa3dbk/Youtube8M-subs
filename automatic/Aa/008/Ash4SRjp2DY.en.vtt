00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.080
 Hello everyone, I am Olga again 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.670
 Mamistov aromatherapist today I 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.820
 tell you about such a fragrant 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.360
 accessory as aroma lamp 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.750
 I will tell signs that will make your 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.029
 the perfect purchase what should be 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.950
 functional aroma lamp by example 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.460
 my oil burner 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.360
 that is, it just is 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.399
 perfect aroma lamp 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.800
 he will first tell you what it is 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:45.940
 oil burners oil burner or otherwise 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:50.290
 Aroma smoker is a container with water 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:53.260
 where add the essential oil is put on 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:57.310
 over the candle the candle is heated water 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:02.560
 heats up and the essential oils evaporate and 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:04.659
 flavoring the room as a result we 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.930
 we get a beautiful candlestick and 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.570
 room flavoring 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:15.990
 what should be the perfect aroma lamp 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:18.999
 the first is the distance between the candle and 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.700
 Capacity must be at least centimeters 

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:27.810
 10 that is, it should not be right like that 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:30.960
 further must be a hole so let's say 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.380
 vent otherwise oxygen inside 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.979
 the candlestick itself will end quickly and 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.380
 the candle goes out 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.479
 it often happened to be very 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.609
 beautiful aromalamp 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.130
 but in which there were very few of these 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:47.020
 external holes i.e. it should 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.240
 oxygen should be ventilated 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.679
 freely penetrate to the candle further 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.049
 bowl capacity and it is desirable that she 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.659
 shot so that it can be easily 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.649
 wash inside because essential oils 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:06.270
 sometimes remain on the walls 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:08.800
 good sometimes when the bowl closes and 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.140
 on the lid itself of course there is 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.010
 hole so the essential oil will 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.520
 evaporate more slowly and flavoring will 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.460
 longer 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.740
 that is, we sharply 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:24.090
 aromatization is not necessary that's why 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:27.840
 the distance must be large in order 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.400
 so that the water in the bowl does not boil water 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.650
 should be maintained at about level 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.620
 degrees 60 i.e. it should be 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.540
 hot but so that the finger and if that could 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:42.000
 endure too some time in such 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:44.760
 water and the bowl should be enough 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.610
 deep and then there are such aroma lamps 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.460
 it is flat and water boils away 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.250
 instantly and then what happens next 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.650
 the candle glows the empty bowl and she 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.640
 cracks i.e. such cases 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:04.230
 really a lot here and we have a deep 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.540
 the cup and the water from there might not boil away then 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.780
 there is it there rather never boils away 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.420
 because the candle picks faster then 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.120
 there is a certain technique 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.550
 security 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.670
 here's how to use aroma lamp 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.100
 I offer you a lazy way to 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.940
 there is usually suggest pour cold 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.800
 water in the bowl and set fire to the candle but was 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.130
 flavoring will wait some more 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.500
 time maybe five minutes even 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:39.750
 we want everything and at once therefore we take 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.800
 boil hot water and pour 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:50.840
 water straight 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:55.380
 inside we do not regret pouring more 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:04:00.450
 here we have a bowl of hot water before him on 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:04.770
 drip some essential oil oil 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:07.580
 Demeter is a sweet lime so too 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.580
 summer scent 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.410
 what is the rate of 1 drop per 5 square 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:21.170
 that is, on the average such room 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:24.200
 in Khrushchev it will be about as if 34 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.480
 close the lid there we have it 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:35.930
 further naturally 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:39.000
 set on fire which will be our sleeve 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.790
 notice that the candles are different here I am 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.320
 I choose low sleeves because 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:48.660
 the distance between the cup and the candle is so 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.550
 the most increasing but usually 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.600
 naturally 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.970
 the tablet is suitable there is of course a candle 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.930
 there should be no odor for us 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.720
 no smell needed 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.450
 if there is such a beautiful smell 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.880
 I feel the wonderful aroma of limetta which 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:11.120
 straight spread around me 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:14.060
 room I get an aromatherapy session 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.490
 It is a pity that the fragrance does not pass through 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.350
 monitor screen but hopefully after that 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:24.030

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:26.580
