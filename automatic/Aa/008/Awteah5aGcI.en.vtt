00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.139
 the first thing we're going to look at before 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.099
 of leaving the trip are the levels 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:21.189
 then we open the bonnet the three 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:25.820
 important levels are the oil 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:28.100
 we remove the rod and with a paper or with 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.070
 a rag we have we look that the 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.530
 oil level has to have up to 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.840
 the maximum and minimum indicator 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.000
 when it's in the middle, it's missing 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.920
 to half a liter when when you do not check 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.780
 rods that are missing a liter here 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.700
 we have the antifreeze tank 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.129
 the antifreeze tank also 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.289
 has a measure has an arrow 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.270
 that tells us where to go if 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.100
 low of that indicator and lacks a 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.469
 little bit we can fill with normal water 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.090
 then we have the liquid from 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.649
 windshield wiper is also very 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.870
 important when leaving the trip 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.500
 that this is full in the box we 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.650
 Indicate if we are missing 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.200
 water from the coolant level because 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.480
 this is the reflective one or that too 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.640
 we have below the water level of 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.229
 windshield wiper this is the deposit of the 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.260
 brake fluid that's a circuit 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.080
 closed it is very rare that it loses except 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.560
 have a breakdown we see 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.440
 if we have something some light melted or not 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.110
 especially for the road it makes us 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.670
 missing and the fog lights that each one already 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.680
 he knows where they have them he has to 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.810
 know and then the backs 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.340
 because these are the position always 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.530
 they will be on but for 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.660
 someone will tell you if it works or not 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.610
 then brake must press the brake 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.260
 so always look at it on the wall that 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.760
 garage or else have someone 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.760
 I'll tell you because if you do not, you will not know 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.150
 what interests us is to see that the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.430
 progressive wear both inside 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.890
 as outside because the rolling of the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.540
 tire but as you will see here in 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.270
 it is in this worn 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.780
 it is not the same and this is because it does not 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.110
 tire has not paralleled well 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.450
 all right 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.340
 the rolling has not gone well then 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.490
 we insist that the tire is 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.070
 look both inside and outside and 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.880
 then he has witnesses here and that we 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.470
 indicate the wear of the tire 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.310
 then as we see here this is this 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.590
 witness is already rubbing the rubber and 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.930
 It works tailored to the tire and 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.970
 we take a pressure or another the pressure 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.180
 of wheels you have to look at it with more 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.190
 frequency of what we believe that by 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.720
 at least we go to the gas station once 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.760
 per month because once a month you have to look 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.120
 the pressure of our wheels 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.120
 recommendation
