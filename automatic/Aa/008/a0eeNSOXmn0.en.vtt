00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.570
 hi all of course by itv 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.060
 today I'm going to unveil the 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.470
 tv series the a25 vega consisting of three 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:32.060
 subwoofers and a satellite 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:35.180
 we're starting right away 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:39.470
 with the satellite 400 watts rms 128 db 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.960
 spl mc2 8 inch boomer including one with the 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.970
 twitter integrated in coax for the face 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.410
 back we have to mix the air or the jack 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.560
 in and out 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:53.090
 we have the volume setting here the mode 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.920
 line or microphone setting 1 with or without 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.900
 subwoofer and the youngest 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.190
 which improves the rendering of the grade 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.500
 as soon as you do not have a subwoofer 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.180
 here you have inputs outputs in 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.159
 power supply it allows you 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.939
 of link and several satellites between 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.400
 them with a single electrical outlet for 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.580
 the damage Service 115 series Powerful 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.720

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.800
 back 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:28.100
 just like the satellite entered in x 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.080
 and the rouen jack volume control the 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.810
 filtering for satellite output 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.229
 the 1.1 filter of the subwoofer 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.479
 polarity 0 180 degrees the outputs 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.700

 subwoofer youngest 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.090
 indication at the level of the four letters 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.100
 which is here we have in the orb 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.110
 the power supply and so the 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.700
 seeing this one the second the 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.560
 limiter function that flashes as soon as 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.020
 the limiter engages for you 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.750
 protect and the amplifier and the boomer 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.190
 the third the letter of protection of 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.260
 cons and at the stage after it will be necessary 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.729
 it is essential to turn off the sound for 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.900
 protect either the subwoofer or 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.570
 amplification 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.460
 and the last of course the signal 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.220
 if it arrives correctly in the box 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.650

 difference 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.270
 at the back we have an equalizer 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.430
 parametric with adjustment of the guard of the 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.280

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.800
 decolonization type of boost rather 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.800
 light medium or strong
