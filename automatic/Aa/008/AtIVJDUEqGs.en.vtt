00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.319
 or fly girls and boys as you are 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.210
 I hope you look great that has 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.370
 brought my sneakers today yes 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.719
 same use are mustang are not new 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.309
 balance that you asked me a 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.679
 lot of times because I hard a 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.660
 moussa ali not a good week because today 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.180
 I'll tell you why and 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.920
 I'm going to give two super easy tricks very 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.350
 simple so they can apply us in 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.060
 your light so that equilibration 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.400
 Count style that is not very 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.840
 sports or very arranged 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.480
 whenever I applied this type of 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.930
 shoes you want to know how come 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.930
 we start 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.360
 Well, as I said before finally 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.490
 I decided to buy more music, I 'm going to 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.960
 explain why when the topic started 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.670
 fashion sneakers 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.590
 with the most arranged looks 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.170
 I thought quickly about my nike lars 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.020
 the visualices roses very distant from 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.630
 faux leather that I made look I put them on 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.670
 but what happened to me being short 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.440
 wear flat shoe this shoe is 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.210
 so pink what they got was to make me 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.950
 the effect of the booties you remember with 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.560
 this told us the theme the booties 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.570
 really what they did to me was to be more 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.140
 wide hip and really not 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.360
 lengthened let's say the final part of my 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.460
 body hip feet down 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.380
 what happened that made me very short 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.750
 so I thought if I bought some 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.000
 nova shoes that have as 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.740
 many colors what I'm going to get is 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.110
 the same effect that I have with the nice 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.600
 So, what did I say, well, I'm going to 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.700
 look for snowfalls that are gray 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.190
 totally gray and good and so 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.960
 get the effect of gray or black and 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.850
 so get the effect that I look for that is 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.590
 always the continuity in the part of 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.780
 down my body so that really 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.000
 besides going in shoe trying to be 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.509
 bajita because that does not give me too 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.180
 racing and that gets that effect me 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.340
 I looked for anything and not where the 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.259
 linked are really super policies and 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.470
 the ones I found were like gray but 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.410
 They carry very nice things like yellow or 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.670
 blue and they did not finish convincing me 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.830
 I started to go around a center 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.009
 commercial and these muses appeared to me 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.239
 they seemed ideal they did not have the subject 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.459
 of the brand like it gave me a little 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.160
 like I really fit and add up 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.200
 that's why I bought these and use 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.420
 I did not buy a desire 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.010
 I can buy other bullets from others 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.660
 colors but I could not do the looks 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.450
 that I need because really what I 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.760
 I am looking for is that I will lengthen the figure to 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.819
 In spite of being in a flat position 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.950
 birds and heels then first trick 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.989
 for those who are more or less saturated 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.530
 like me that I measure 160 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.150
 I have a great height and my advice is that 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.920
 for this kind of looks look for some 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.500
 shoes that do not have too much color 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.090
 that is to say that they are of gray shades or 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.489
 black so that when combining it 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.250
 with the pants more or less in tone 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.049
 gray black cowboy you can find that 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.549
 continuity and we do not have the effect that 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.799
 I was telling you that the day of the booty effect 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.750
 ok it was in hip spots and 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.880
 also short, it's worth it, so first 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.090
 advice look for some shoes that are 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.730
 in a dark tone so that it was 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.010
 the figure really goes out 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.890
 the other part of light comes for the part 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.750
 from above how do we get it to be 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.849
 compensated between the bottom and the 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.530
 Top part is very simple if you 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.810
 for example you put on a pair like me 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.760
 I put it to make the idea pants of 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.799
 leatherette with sneakers 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.540
 at the top do not put a 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.030
 jersey do not wear a raincoat 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.890
 put something that really does that 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.230
 contrast contrast forgiveness between 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.790
 bottom part and the one that is more sporty 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.370
 and the top part then I always 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.160
 so I will apply a more casual shirt 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.910
 and a blazer is worth that is going to be the 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.470
 counterpoint is worth the balance between 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.060
 bottom part which is the amount of 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.670
 sports and the isr that is part of 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.890
 up then it's worth second trick not 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.209
 put the bardenas do not put jerseys 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.760
 because the jersey is the only thing that's going to 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.010
 to give is more sporting or you are going to look 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.840
 that you go with a lot more sporty 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.680
 then always look for something much more 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.730
 fixed up 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.950
 so blazer a shirt a jacket type 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.800
 chanel was worth this kind of 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.690
 30 what you are going to do is that you get a 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.580
 balance between the bottom and the 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.870
 part of the top you remember when you do 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.390
 time we talked about the pants 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.310
 tracksuit and the tricks that I gave you then this 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.230
 is exactly the same but applied in 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.590
 sneakers and parts 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.850
 above with which second trick 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.280
 always look for the top 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.440
 something more fixed but type blazer worth 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.300
 and then if it's really cold as they can 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.090
 be these days because you can always put 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.280
 a coat is worth but I, in my case, my 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.500
 advice what it is I would tell you is that these 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.660
 gerais a blazer or a jacket that 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.060
 it was much more arranged 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.680
 nothing else this has been the advice of today 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.110
 I hope you use this type of light 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.880
 because for me they have become like 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.430
 said the other tender of the two in the 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.290
 uniforms today for example that I have to 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.110
 run out 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.670
 of the trip for me is a super part 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.140
 important and I will be able to be comfortable 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.390
 throughout the day because I do not know anything 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.800
 now that I'm going to finish what for 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.560
 me is perfect and all I suppose 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.210
 for the rest of the followers you see 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.250
 this is light too so that you 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.230
 I recommend that you try to find the 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.750
 proper shoe look for go towards 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.250
 Internet is in particular I bought them in 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.130
 a shopping mall in a store 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.860
 these guy maripaz or something like that had the 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.480
 brand mustang and I bought them there but not 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.660
 he has seen them again I also tell you 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:27.180
 ok then look for a sneaker that 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.760
 be according to your style and 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.920
 that also produces that continuity 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.960
 at the bottom and for the part of 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.970
 up and I tell you to use blazers of all 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.530
 the colors and styles that are sure to go 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.200
 to contribute one 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.450
 great nothing else I say goodbye to the 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.670
 Next Wednesday I hope you will give 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.090
 many likes and see you in the next 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.090
