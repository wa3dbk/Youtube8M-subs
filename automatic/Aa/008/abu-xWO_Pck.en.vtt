gunfights<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.620> game<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:55.980> my<00:00:56.070> opinion<00:00:56.100> so

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
gunfights in this game in my opinion so

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.200 
gunfights in this game in my opinion so
it<00:00:57.539> takes<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.809> bit<00:00:57.930> more<00:00:57.960> skill<00:00:58.520> but<00:00:59.520> yeah<00:01:00.059> so

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
it takes a bit more skill but yeah so

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.189
