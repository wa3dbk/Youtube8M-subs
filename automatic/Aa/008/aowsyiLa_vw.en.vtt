 warfare 3 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.250
 it's not a horror game ok maybe a little 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.179
 horror it is because the absurdities that there 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.619
 I'm afraid, no, it's a 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.119
 comment of modern warfare 3 filter 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.600
 immediately the game that is mine 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.230
 very first mob pulled input she who not 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.449
 have in domain mode with mp 7 a 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.580
 rapid fire silencer and then i 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.710
 technicians were sleight of hand pro 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.780
 because it closes however and correlatore prof 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.670
 while in the specialist package 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.180
 sbloccherÃ² murderess pro and pro Jackal 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.379
 thousand stable prox was my second 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.600
 part of the day 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.030
 I remember these I made some 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.739
 long ago it is in practice I remember the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.570
 before this series there was a guy with 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.390
 a mother seat use under 4 5 times of 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.989
 followed the bastard here and he did me 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.699
 angry because I am free of lithium MP and I 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.260
 made the bastard rather angry 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.449
 what a mum is constantly taking now 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.949
 mb 7 I do my ass in fact I have it 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.890
 pulled the mob and then the bastard 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.350
 obviously he came out good at it 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.869
 logic but I like doing it though 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.430
 if while you're in Verona you just do something 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.479
 they get angry to be able to hit you 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.799
 merges tour limbo made course 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.500
 ok, they are not happy anyway 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.760
 intend to give you advice for those who don't 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.460
 here knows what they are doing 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.140
 however, these tips advise you in the end 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.540
 boy I just tell you one thing 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.490
 I watch several videos I watched several 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.650
 video on how to make a new and how 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.970
 28 comes in a row and how to do these 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.640
 how to do this but in the end 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.440
 they all say the same thing however in 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.710
 the truth behind fashion is there 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.920
 absolutely the luck is there 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.290
 you can be as good as you want 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.390
 technique and strategy 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.760
 excellent, however, the bastard camper in the end 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.190
 there is always the one with visibility 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.100
 extinct killer of grave what it is 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.690
 unjust the big across the map 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.800
 fight feels amazing that you 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.710
 takes in the house though 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.560
 specialist and so on and so forth 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.140
 really luck is the basis of 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.390
 but then another thing that helps 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.650
 absolutely learn the moby la 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.480
 connection 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.830
 now I'll do it for a moment and mine 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.570
 connection then my connection 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.060
 Alice are in a country lost in the 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.459
 mountains and already sentence or connection 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.260
 internet but new king guys go 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:36.120
 from 100 to 200 ok this is what we say 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.010
 that my shots come after 80 years 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.440
 eighty centuries that is while I shoot the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.010
 my enemy can easily get 8 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.660
 showers ten children 20 coffee can do 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.300
 what you want to enter and then maybe 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.220
 the shots come now the ping is 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.690
 precisely the time 5 with your shots ad 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.720
 to arrive in the case of cod 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.950
 then to another definition though 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.860
 mainly on cod 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.300
 means this and then you have it low 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.739
 and the better it is because rightly yours 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.980
 shots will be faster they will arrive 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.060
 before 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.549
 however and then in other possible can 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.900
 help the boys and the headphones i 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.610
 Use headphones, however, are not the 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:21.049
 fritto aics I don't know what 8080 becomes 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:26.000
 I don't even know the various editions 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:28.280
 anyway I have some big ben xp gaming 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.140
 something like that and I bought them 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.910
 euro room and I'm not exactly like le 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.000
 tips that make themselves heard from where 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.610
 meals come and make you own 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.340
 feel the direction specifically 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.079
 but enemy footsteps make you feel 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.549
 precisely these quite clearly 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.989
 steps not the direction but make you 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.239
 hear exactly the sound that 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.340
 they produce for example the enemy walks 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.079
 on a wooden floor and makes you 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.430
 hear the sound of wood enough 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:58.239
 well so in the end he guessed I can 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:03.530
 to understand where that exact comes from 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:05.720
 sound of the pastures anyway and then if 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.810
 obviously you have headphones maybe 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.389
 you feel full steps there is a pro relationship 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.849
 pro ratio is obtained after that 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:16.250
 destroy 120 enemy equipment 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:19.130
 if I'm not mistaken they are unlocked with c months 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.840
 and months ago because they no longer Thu 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.250
 It needs a cabbage celebrate 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.110
 stopped at the prestige port there is a lot 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.000
 of golden arms celebrating community 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:32.259
 however, then he sells mod 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.939
 here it is 12 and fuck 3 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:37.159
 anyway, I advise you 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:38.990
 absolutely headphones because they serve 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.789
 really a lot 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.400
 unfortunately the time is over I'm sorry 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:45.229
 the video if used with the little anyway 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.389
 thank you so much for 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.389
 display and beautiful
