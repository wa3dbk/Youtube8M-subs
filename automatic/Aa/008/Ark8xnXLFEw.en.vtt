stock so how this gun works is all I

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.080 
stock so how this gun works is all I
need<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.360> do<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.780> load<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.590> mag<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.310> then

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
need to do is load the mag and then

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.080 
need to do is load the mag and then
stick<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.470> pull<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.090> secondary

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
stick it in you can pull the secondary

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.749 
stick it in you can pull the secondary
trigger<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.009> revving<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.460> pull<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
trigger for the revving and you pull the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.990 
trigger for the revving and you pull the
train<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:49.229> actually<00:01:49.770> full<00:01:50.159> auto<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.909> you

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
train and is actually full auto so you

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.190 
train and is actually full auto so you
don't<00:01:51.180> need<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.390> pull<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.600> trigger<00:01:51.630> for<00:01:52.049> each

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
don't need to pull the trigger for each

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.160 
don't need to pull the trigger for each
shot<00:01:52.850> also<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:54.030> like<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> feather<00:01:54.509> trigger<00:01:54.810> so

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
shot also it's like a feather trigger so

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.889 
shot also it's like a feather trigger so
it's<00:01:55.409> automatics<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.070> don't<00:01:56.250> need<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.899> pull

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
it's automatics you don't need to pull

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
and you very confident in that because

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.150 
and you very confident in that because
it's<00:02:31.270> full<00:02:32.020> auto<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.530> it's<00:02:32.800> not<00:02:32.980> that

it's full auto and it's not that
accurate<00:02:33.310> or<00:02:33.670> anything<00:02:33.880> so<00:02:34.210> mainly<00:02:34.990> for<00:02:35.260> close

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590

quarters<00:02:36.310> combat<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:37.600> even<00:02:38.080> though<00:02:38.170> this<00:02:38.320> gun

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
quarters combat so even though this gun

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.080 
quarters combat so even though this gun
he<00:02:38.710> has<00:02:38.830> all<00:02:39.070> these<00:02:39.190> railings<00:02:39.460> I<00:02:39.760> wouldn't

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
he has all these railings I wouldn't

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.910 
he has all these railings I wouldn't
really<00:02:40.180> recommend<00:02:40.300> any<00:02:40.900> attachment<00:02:41.740> other

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
really recommend any attachment other

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.920 
really recommend any attachment other
than<00:02:42.160> say<00:02:42.460> a<00:02:42.490> front<00:02:42.880> rail<00:02:43.060> like<00:02:43.570> this<00:02:43.600> one

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
than say a front rail like this one

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.930 
than say a front rail like this one
because<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.800> is<00:02:44.830> front<00:02:45.250> heavy<00:02:45.550> that's<00:02:45.880> the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
because it is front heavy that's the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.060 
because it is front heavy that's the
only<00:02:46.180> reason<00:02:46.510> why<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:47.110> community<00:02:47.740> like<00:02:47.860> this

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
only reason why a community like this

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.280 
only reason why a community like this
you<00:02:48.670> have<00:02:48.850> just<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.120> little<00:02:49.300> bit<00:02:49.390> less<00:02:49.570> mobility

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
you have just a little bit less mobility

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.070 
you have just a little bit less mobility
than<00:02:50.470> with<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.680> grip<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.550> could<00:02:52.270> also<00:02:52.630> put<00:02:53.020> a

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
than with a grip you could also put a

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.140 
than with a grip you could also put a
laser<00:02:53.380> on<00:02:53.710> it<00:02:53.830> but<00:02:54.040> that's<00:02:54.100> kind<00:02:54.850> of<00:02:54.910> useless

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
laser on it but that's kind of useless

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.320 
laser on it but that's kind of useless
anyways<00:02:56.010> now<00:02:57.010> for<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.370> pros<00:02:57.640> and<00:02:57.850> cons<00:02:57.910> of

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
anyways now for the pros and cons of

anyways now for the pros and cons of
this<00:02:58.450> gun<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:59.260> pros<00:02:59.560> is<00:02:59.800> is<00:03:00.070> that<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.310> has<00:03:00.490> a

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
flywheel so it has a high rate of fire a

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.670 
flywheel so it has a high rate of fire a

range and lower accuracy but it still

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.550 
range and lower accuracy but it still
has<00:03:47.980> a<00:03:48.010> really<00:03:48.850> nice<00:03:49.330> customizability<00:03:50.080> comes

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
has a really nice customizability comes

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.560 
has a really nice customizability comes
all<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.770> attachment<00:03:51.250> pieces<00:03:51.610> and<00:03:51.820> it<00:03:52.360> can

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
all the attachment pieces and it can

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.110 
all the attachment pieces and it can
shoot<00:03:52.810> very<00:03:53.290> very<00:03:53.650> fast<00:03:54.010> so<00:03:54.640> let's<00:03:54.820> go<00:03:54.970> outside

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
shoot very very fast so let's go outside

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.840 
shoot very very fast so let's go outside
and<00:03:55.570> do<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:55.959> shooting<00:03:56.590> so<00:03:57.130> we<00:03:57.190> have<00:03:57.280> a<00:03:57.340> 75<00:03:57.820> foot

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
and do the shooting so we have a 75 foot

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.160 
and do the shooting so we have a 75 foot
rear<00:03:58.270> lined<00:03:58.480> up<00:03:58.600> when<00:03:58.750> you're<00:03:58.870> shooting<00:03:58.990> a

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
rear lined up when you're shooting a

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:12.149 
rear lined up when you're shooting a
fire<00:03:59.410> strike<00:03:59.650> here<00:03:59.980> we<00:04:00.070> go

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:14.979 

so<00:04:13.159> the<00:04:13.310> ranges<00:04:13.640> of<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:13.939> scan<00:04:14.180> the<00:04:14.420> darts<00:04:14.749> fell

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
so the ranges of the scan the darts fell

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.680 
so the ranges of the scan the darts fell
from<00:04:15.260> 20<00:04:15.650> feet<00:04:15.889> to<00:04:16.039> 45<00:04:16.669> feet<00:04:16.910> so<00:04:17.299> you<00:04:17.389> can<00:04:17.539> see

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
from 20 feet to 45 feet so you can see

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.390 
from 20 feet to 45 feet so you can see
the<00:04:17.810> inconsistency<00:04:18.079> in<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.829> range<00:04:19.039> is<00:04:19.220> there

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
the inconsistency in the range is there

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.300 
the inconsistency in the range is there
also<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:20.389> accuracy<00:04:20.959> is<00:04:21.079> kind<00:04:21.289> of<00:04:21.350> bad<00:04:21.530> so<00:04:21.919> at

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
also the accuracy is kind of bad so at

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.350 
also the accuracy is kind of bad so at
45<00:04:22.970> feet<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:24.130> bull's<00:04:25.130> definitely<00:04:25.880> can't<00:04:26.180> hit

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
45 feet the bull's definitely can't hit

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.189 
45 feet the bull's definitely can't hit
the<00:04:26.479> target<00:04:26.810> because<00:04:26.870> they're<00:04:27.110> just

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
the target because they're just

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.659 
the target because they're just
spreading<00:04:27.440> away<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:27.800> sides<00:04:28.039> so<00:04:28.580> the

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
spreading away the sides so the

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.159 
spreading away the sides so the
effective<00:04:29.000> range<00:04:29.210> could<00:04:29.419> probably<00:04:29.630> be<00:04:29.870> around

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
effective range could probably be around

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.890 
effective range could probably be around
30<00:04:30.650> feet<00:04:30.770> I'd<00:04:31.729> still<00:04:32.150> recommend<00:04:32.270> this<00:04:32.690> gun

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
30 feet I'd still recommend this gun

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.480 
30 feet I'd still recommend this gun
it's<00:04:33.080> still<00:04:33.380> got<00:04:33.560> a<00:04:33.590> really<00:04:33.889> high<00:04:34.190> rate<00:04:34.430> of

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
it's still got a really high rate of

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.120 
it's still got a really high rate of
fire<00:04:34.820> and<00:04:35.120> it<00:04:35.630> looks<00:04:35.840> pretty<00:04:36.050> cool<00:04:36.320> thanks<00:04:37.039> for

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
fire and it looks pretty cool thanks for

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.350 
fire and it looks pretty cool thanks for
watching<00:04:37.400> nervous<00:04:37.610> walking<00:04:37.729> reviews<00:04:38.150> and

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
watching nervous walking reviews and
