00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.819
 My name is Julio and this video 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.850
 I'm liking it because I posted another one. 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.830
 video talking on a folder and 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.960
 how many had many hits 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.090
 people asked me how to do this. 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.939
 I'm from Brazil, I'm going today. 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:21.320
 explaining round fighting more details 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:25.859
 how to do this double then 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:31.859
 next folks this folding machine works 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:58.770
 folding a flat iron is a 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:01:05.729
 two millimeters only 14 love to leave 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:08.969
 Perfect, people, I work here. 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.950
 to make it true is it specific 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:13.229
 for 1 of the work I do here that 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.210
 This barbecue, my aunt. 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.899
 all these works here I do with her 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.020
 then it is 2mm plate length 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:26.340
 this plate here is 50 centimeters 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:32.759
 so I always look here is very good 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:35.159
 the guys make this flag 1 bar 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.810
 train rail because it is stronger as 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.380
 I do not have a train beard 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:45.079
 here I sought what I could at 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:48.990
 Then I built this one from here. 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:51.119
 I bought only one bar each 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:02:02.850
 who is saving the nutmeg I bought 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:02:06.869
 here is 18mm and the doors is 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.920
 so with the word scratched I would do 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.920
 Mocha, ha ha 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.620
 is the following I am gay this first 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:23.380
 nut here on the nutmeg 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:25.960
 so when I turn it it's e or the low 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.500
 the angle of this one here 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.930
 is where sakineh sits to death and 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.100
 below here are two other screws 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.250
 which are well aligned here is well on 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.540
 level here these pints every 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.030
 lateral 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.540
 And she's a soldier down here. 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.740
 nut that is two doors one misses the 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:56.650
 side of the other 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:58.450
 she gives soldier in the structure here then 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.650
 she passed I put a little hat here 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:17.380
 and I'm hers here in the structure even to see 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:20.640
 a piece of the thread that ii and this part 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.980
 here guys it 's the part you 'll turn 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.510
 she'll come in here here on the bridge 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.990
 represents only a small part of the 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.990
 tip 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:41.680
 she was massive as the galera as 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:46.570
 she turns tv but the center of this piece of 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.840
 Goal alone here he has to be fine. 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.540
 in the center of the black singer here the center 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.360
 she has to hit center seat with 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.370
 hundreds of angles here 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.239
 because if you stay a little higher 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.459
 or more down the there the score 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.360
 It will not turn out just the way it is. 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.360
 giving viana 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.890
 can see that here this part from within 

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:24.790
 here o 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:27.250
 she turns right here in the move menu 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.950
 much lower than I saw that because the 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.080
 center was right I dropped the part 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:36.370
 that comes in here in this corner of the 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.110
 front and this one here in the 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:42.300
 background that is the bottom angle here 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.300
 do not move she stays always 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.180
 and the angle then suppose that this one 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.340
 this is the low water is the third to 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:01.180
 another down here also ends with 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:02.140
 Avocado O flap with the flap is then the two 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.640
 downloaded 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.750
 I'd stay with the water quiet here in 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:10.030
 but reinforcement on the front and back 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.730
 Why do not these angles here leave 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.680
 it's left over then as I had no other 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.870
 material I did with myself I only gave one 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:21.720
 iron here it 's more to give a little more 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.720
 of resistance to it 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.560
 so people, this detail is good 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.630
 right in the center here the center of this 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.930
 part has to be in the center of these two 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.960
 angle here as this one will be 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.370
 on top of this one on the bottom 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.980
 She has been in the center of it too. 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.490
 are in the case the three that will pay the 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.490
 center 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:06:00.520
 then this is it this is the O Brazil 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:04.770
 I did with a pass that plate up to 600 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.770
 60cm in case 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.940
 more than that it does not fold for you 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:15.760
 make one want the one meter plate and 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:18.880
 twenty centimeters than the plate coming from 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:23.070
 factory without making a larger corner 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.070
 but it was the better reinforcement too 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.500
 How I'm going to make one to sell? 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.290
 make a new video explaining step by step 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:36.020
 step how to do so this is my crowd
