00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.099
 hello to all the soldier boys 7 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.980
 then today we find ourselves with the ps life 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.900
 2000 and bestiality one thousand per hour 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.910
 useless that I say on the left is 2000 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.949
 on the right and the 1000 then have the color 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.539
 then we are doing the video with a 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.039
 tive because they asked us for it 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.320
 of people 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.330
 so let's say we will do as you like 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.410
 they usually do with cell phones 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.040
 we'll show some stuff 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.140
 then before starting the 2000 console 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.969
 and the 1000 are both both 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.550
 therefore available in European soil 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.210
 you can buy them safely 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.870
 then on the left we have the version 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.980
 2000 on the right the 1000 version 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:58.680
 here we turn the things we show them 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:01:01.620
 19 of the retro glass one thousand two thousand per hour 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.280
 as you see from the console the version 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.590
 1000 and more and a lot there is a lot more 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.720
 great of the 1000 version ie of the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.520
 vision 2000 excuse me say that 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.760
 this could be in favor of the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.210
 2000 which is a little bit lighter and 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.880
 thinner then the only flaw 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.229
 let's say for now the only one and that I believe that 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.720
 from the phone it's not like they can be given 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.119
 much but I swear to you, I notice you are 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.790
 screen colors because the screen 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.850
 of life and a thousand and oled right not 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.250
 is the screen of the 2000 and LED version 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.500
 I don't know why the sony did this 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.210
 cretinata but did it then for 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.070
 anyone who does not have the two consoles 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.530
 there are those who still have to choose the purchase 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.570
 I recommend a thousand but aggression 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.820
 precisely because the screen makes more e 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.340
 It does more to enjoy the game 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.350
 ascent 2000 is much more comfortable then 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.420
 it depends we say now of yours 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.430
 unique florence very good 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.240
 if you want to see a maximum resolution 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.890
 it's a color quality 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.869
 I recommend the 1000 then let's try to 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.939
 see why there are rumors that the 2000 is 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.039
 much faster but i'm not that i have 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.740
 having seen all this speed away 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.490
 both of them 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.760
 and on the sacrifices delta ok they start in 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.480
 same time both of you 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:22.810
 ok then but you could see from you see gods 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.910
 colors also from the can be seen also from 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:33.670
 phone fortunately ok see of a 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:39.310
 second pursued 2000 is of a 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:41.320
 second then no here are the mountaineers 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.210
 mounted paid therefore thousand of a 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.210
 second and six from a thousand 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.260
 I don't think we will try it later 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.880
 with a card game just because 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.710
 this is a probable digital game 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.960
 that the 2000 weighing card and more is 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.900
 heavier 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:05.320
 just then start I show them 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:08.200
 the menus you see look at the colors you see 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.310
 definitely then the sound quality is 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.080
 identical 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.670
 let's see first they feel the same way 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.450
 both 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.520
 then let's try a net game the ok 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.980
 then we saw that version 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.290
 digital was a little faster on ps life 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.410
 a thousand now we don't know since I have 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.080
 the card on the small square 2032 and from 16 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.430
 right on the 1000 so now 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.480
 let's try a game and retail then 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.720
 avenues in the summer at the exact moment 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.120
 perfect 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.590
 now let you see the colors you've 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.820
 we see it 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.570
 here I did not see a Japanese part 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.580
 apart from you in Italian 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:55.540
 let's see if there is a case in japan 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:58.560
 more menu I don't know so yes let's try 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.560
 not even initial 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:08.510
 they seem perfectly identical for now 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:09.880
 it rains then you try to press hicks 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.750
 they are both 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:21.230
 yes yes but that they promote circle 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:23.470
 and excuse the video game ignorance there 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.470
 we are forgotten 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.440
 then you go from the functions of the without 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.710
 disability programs the new parts of it 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.670
 we see the initial video the difference 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.670
 differentiated pc 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.070
 ok 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:50.700
 game look at the colors ok try put 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.800
 we put the game two more prizes 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:05:01.160
 at the same time perfect for now 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:06.050
 identical yes yes yes 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.050
 perfect let's see the speed 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:15.560
 for now i'm really synchronized you have 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.560
 identical none known 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:26.310
 but to note that he is the union 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:33.060
 they called fireflies and they were 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:35.940
 random first then media however I see 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:42.230
 a little a bit a bit ahead the 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:44.370
 2000 but little is known that the most it pours 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.170
 fortunately we are beautiful color 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.660
 we say that a little faster yes but of 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:52.970
 very little so it's not a speed that 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:55.080
 surprising win that makes that makes a difference 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.150
 then let's say the final comment 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.760
 we advise those who do not have life 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.830
 a thousand then we say let's say who does not have 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.940
 just the evening air to buy the 1000 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.970
 unless you take an edition 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.670
 limited as I did that favorite 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.290
 however, you must clearly fear 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.290
 purchased from the family console and does not have 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.570
 found great tragedy however it is so 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.870
 pd say that if you go into the store and 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.580
 ask her a thousand then if you have little 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.710
 flabby hands you don't want to have a thing 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.440
 not heavy because in fact life is not 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.090
 very heavy you take me theme 2000 we say 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.520
 It is to advise the tastes us 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.320
 friendly game to sell the 1000 then 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.770
 from the video and all texture say devil 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.250
 game 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.250
 to the next
