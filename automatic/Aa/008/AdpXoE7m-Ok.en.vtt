00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.390

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.099
 texas brand 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.810
 so we better go with villa and tim hill and emerald to tell us about 

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:23.619
 what is all this about but with attention because you can win tickets 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.629
 for this event and some of you may personally know this 

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:33.100
 day let's see what it is about ap and is that the concept manás coffee is not only 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.730
 music not only party 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.859
 This is one of the parts that I like the most because it is where we inform 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:42.239
 and where, above all, the national scene is supported by me and for this occasion 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.520
 we have a great emerald guest dignify 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.240
 welcome nothing like these 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.579
 thanks to their techniques here 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.940
 it's true in bidding type bids and coming for something main is not 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.280
 that is my best brand is usually something very important 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.250
 of these are presenting p technologies 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.550
 applied to cyclists percent and it's something very interesting because I know that 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.890
 many of you have contacted us that the program to ask us 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.790
 where can I learn how can I learn what equipment to use as that is 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.770
 one of the percent chances I think of the best of the year because 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.130
 rarely do brands offer so much equipment 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.280
 and involve civilians 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.230
 exactly very little mark they care about 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.560
 for supporting the pp and in this case to be 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.310
 she is an efe master 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.360

 efe is known as an exponent of its gender ie and as it says look at this 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.630

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.649
 be some beaches 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:18.310
 that they will be able to write 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.209
 get very easy to see that you have to have triple-double upch license along with 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:24.199
 next to him he demands 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.169

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:28.699

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:54.719
 start answer that is to tell us how we want to get involved 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.189
 we would understand that the frequencies that had to do with 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:01.169
