I'm pretty sure i'm emanuele of the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.340 
I'm pretty sure i'm emanuele of the
original<00:01:04.860> mario<00:01:05.100> 64<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:06.000> though<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.020> sing<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350

original mario 64 so though we sing a

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
bit more about later it's kind of

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.020 
bit more about later it's kind of
interesting<00:01:09.030> how<00:01:09.270> they<00:01:09.390> did<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:10.010> but<00:01:11.010> as<00:01:11.700> usual

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
interesting how they did it but as usual

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.179 
interesting how they did it but as usual
it<00:01:12.119> just<00:01:12.270> describes<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.869> game<00:01:13.049> get<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> couple

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
it just describes the game get a couple

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.030 
it just describes the game get a couple
of<00:01:14.250> screenshots<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:15.150> different<00:01:15.450> things<00:01:16.040> this

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
of screenshots of different things this

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.179 
of screenshots of different things this
I<00:01:17.540> I<00:01:18.540> think<00:01:18.810> you'd<00:01:19.229> call<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> remake<00:01:19.979> of

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
I I think you'd call it a remake of

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.149 
I I think you'd call it a remake of
mario<00:01:20.700> 64<00:01:20.880> rather<00:01:21.420> than<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.630> port<00:01:21.950> of<00:01:22.950> course

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
mario 64 rather than a port of course

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.969 
mario 64 rather than a port of course
they<00:01:23.340> enhanced<00:01:23.729> all<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.909> graphics<00:01:24.299> quite<00:01:24.979> you

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
they enhanced all the graphics quite you

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.499 
they enhanced all the graphics quite you
know<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.189> quite<00:01:26.369> an<00:01:26.490> extent<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.210> can<00:01:27.360> see

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
know to quite an extent as you can see

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.420 
know to quite an extent as you can see
down<00:01:27.689> there<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.680> looks<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.950> bit<00:01:28.979> better<00:01:29.189> than

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
down there it looks a bit better than

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.649 
down there it looks a bit better than
the<00:01:29.549> old<00:01:29.700> classic<00:01:30.530> n64<00:01:31.530> game<00:01:31.710> which<00:01:32.659> I'm

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
the old classic n64 game which I'm

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.819 
the old classic n64 game which I'm
pretty<00:01:33.990> sure<00:01:34.110> it's<00:01:34.259> still<00:01:34.409> one<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.710> most

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
pretty sure it's still one of the most

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.399 
pretty sure it's still one of the most
impressive<00:01:35.340> looking<00:01:35.790> DS<00:01:36.030> games<00:01:36.420> that's

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
impressive looking DS games that's

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.530 
impressive looking DS games that's
around<00:01:37.619> which<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.670> kind<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.090> sad<00:01:39.270> when<00:01:39.299> you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
around which is kind of sad when you

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.420 
around which is kind of sad when you
think<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.780> was<00:01:39.990> pretty<00:01:40.950> much<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.159> launch

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
think this was pretty much a launch

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.399 
think this was pretty much a launch
title<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.329> first<00:01:42.540> title<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.869> ever<00:01:42.990> had<00:01:43.200> for

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.149 
VDS so yeah but yeah in this version
it's<00:01:49.049> kind<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> retelling<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
it's kind of like a retelling of the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.389 
it's kind of like a retelling of the
same<00:01:50.430> classic<00:01:50.909> story<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.329> Mario<00:01:51.659> 64<00:01:52.200> H<00:01:52.860> tells

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
from the ending of the original game so

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.070 
from the ending of the original game so
he<00:02:08.550> comes<00:02:08.789> down<00:02:09.000> goes<00:02:09.390> into<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.690> castle<00:02:10.020> to

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.510 
it's a bit different kind of I cap Errol
universe<00:02:16.000> version<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:16.390> guess<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.890> inside<00:02:18.280> we

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
universe version I guess so inside we

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.700 
universe version I guess so inside we
have<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:19.090> course<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.630> cartridge<00:02:20.140> just<00:02:20.530> for

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
ODS box something I always found

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.060 
ODS box something I always found
interesting<00:02:28.720> about<00:02:29.230> these<00:02:29.440> was<00:02:29.710> the<00:02:29.860> fact

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
interesting about these was the fact

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.980 
interesting about these was the fact
that<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.310> could<00:02:30.520> put<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.120> Game<00:02:31.540> Boy<00:02:31.690> Advance

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
that you could put a Game Boy Advance

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.190 
that you could put a Game Boy Advance
game<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:32.500> being<00:02:32.890> with<00:02:33.130> them<00:02:33.340> as<00:02:33.550> well<00:02:33.700> but

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
game and being with them as well but

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.760 
game and being with them as well but
just<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.470> little<00:02:35.740> bit<00:02:35.830> of<00:02:35.920> an<00:02:35.980> oddity<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:38.470> that's

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
just a little bit of an oddity so that's

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.680 
just a little bit of an oddity so that's
up<00:02:39.000> movie<00:02:40.000> on<00:02:40.120> we<00:02:40.300> have<00:02:41.550> set<00:02:42.550> up<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.910> health<00:02:43.510> and

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
safety precautions booklet and I mean

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.240 
safety precautions booklet and I mean
that<00:02:46.330> there's<00:02:46.540> been<00:02:46.690> like<00:02:46.780> twenty<00:02:47.590> variations

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
that there's been like twenty variations

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.940 
that there's been like twenty variations
on<00:02:48.430> these<00:02:48.550> things<00:02:48.820> so<00:02:49.150> this<00:02:49.270> was<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:50.080> OSDs

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950

which<00:02:58.600> is<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.780> bit<00:02:58.930> interesting<00:02:59.460> so<00:03:00.540> on<00:03:01.540> the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
and then as you can see we actually use

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.710 
and then as you can see we actually use
the<00:03:35.050> original<00:03:35.590> Mario<00:03:35.920> 64<00:03:36.459> renders<00:03:36.820> these<00:03:37.540> are

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
the original Mario 64 renders these are

the original Mario 64 renders these are
the<00:03:37.900> renders<00:03:38.200> from<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:39.100> Mario<00:03:39.370> 64<00:03:39.880> manual<00:03:40.390> and

the renders from the Mario 64 manual and

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.460 
the renders from the Mario 64 manual and
you<00:03:41.860> can<00:03:42.010> see<00:03:42.250> how<00:03:42.610> different<00:03:42.850> they<00:03:43.120> look<00:03:43.470> if

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
you can see how different they look if

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.250 
you can see how different they look if
you<00:03:44.650> look<00:03:44.830> at<00:03:44.980> Mario's<00:03:45.340> face<00:03:45.580> fair<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:47.140> then

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
you look at Mario's face fair and then

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.310 
you look at Mario's face fair and then
you<00:03:47.350> look<00:03:47.500> at<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.709> there<00:03:48.750> so<00:03:49.750> you<00:03:50.230> could

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
you look at it there so you could

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.140 
you look at it there so you could
definitely<00:03:50.470> see<00:03:50.890> that<00:03:50.920> generational<00:03:51.910> gap

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
definitely see that generational gap

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.340 
definitely see that generational gap
between<00:03:52.930> technology<00:03:53.770> and<00:03:53.800> whatnot<00:03:54.280> but<00:03:55.180> um<00:03:55.570> so

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
between technology and whatnot but um so

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.930 
between technology and whatnot but um so
I<00:03:56.380> find<00:03:56.709> it<00:03:56.830> very<00:03:56.860> interesting<00:03:57.070> that<00:03:57.610> they<00:03:57.730> did

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
I find it very interesting that they did

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.580 
I find it very interesting that they did
it<00:03:58.060> they<00:03:58.300> used<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.690> original<00:03:59.050> versions<00:03:59.470> for

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
it they used the original versions for

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.830 
it they used the original versions for
this<00:03:59.910> I've<00:04:00.910> always<00:04:01.060> been<00:04:01.209> a<00:04:01.270> fan<00:04:01.480> of<00:04:01.510> how<00:04:01.780> he

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
this I've always been a fan of how he

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.229 
this I've always been a fan of how he
looked<00:04:02.200> in<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.890> n64<00:04:03.430> years<00:04:03.790> so<00:04:04.000> doesn't

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
looked in the n64 years so doesn't

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.740 
looked in the n64 years so doesn't
really<00:04:04.360> bother<00:04:04.510> me<00:04:04.720> but<00:04:05.670> yeah<00:04:06.670> just<00:04:06.820> found<00:04:07.630> it
