00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
to the table I think the work that the

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.410 
to the table I think the work that the
Blum's<00:03:55.820> do<00:03:56.150> on<00:03:56.270> campus<00:03:56.750> is<00:03:57.220> invaluable<00:03:58.220> and<00:03:58.880> I

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
Blum's do on campus is invaluable and I

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.140 
Blum's do on campus is invaluable and I
think<00:03:59.630> if<00:03:59.720> you<00:03:59.810> talk<00:04:00.020> to<00:04:00.410> any<00:04:00.860> Jewish<00:04:01.790> student

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
think if you talk to any Jewish student

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.699 
think if you talk to any Jewish student
that<00:04:02.540> has<00:04:02.780> been<00:04:02.959> touched<00:04:03.200> by<00:04:03.350> them<00:04:03.590> at

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
that has been touched by them at

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.380 
that has been touched by them at
Columbia<00:04:04.130> they<00:04:04.400> will<00:04:04.550> tell<00:04:04.700> you<00:04:04.850> the<00:04:05.000> exact

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
Columbia they will tell you the exact

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.120 
Columbia they will tell you the exact
same<00:04:05.480> thing<00:04:05.660> I<00:04:06.230> think<00:04:06.440> that<00:04:06.590> you<00:04:06.739> can<00:04:06.890> feel

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130
