interesting<00:00:59.550> choice<00:00:59.940> most<00:01:00.239> handlebars<00:01:00.660> gonna

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
interesting choice most handlebars gonna

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.450 
interesting choice most handlebars gonna

wind up being mild built low goes ahead

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.250 
wind up being mild built low goes ahead
and<00:01:02.670> bumps<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.300> chromoly<00:01:03.690> for<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.110> you

can also see here to these miter cuts
are<00:01:06.180> all<00:01:06.360> TIG<00:01:06.689> welded<00:01:07.140> kind<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.920> nice

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
are all TIG welded kind of a nice

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.580 
are all TIG welded kind of a nice
feature<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.180> bar<00:01:09.420> that's<00:01:09.600> not<00:01:09.960> necessarily

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
feature in a bar that's not necessarily

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.830 
feature in a bar that's not necessarily
at<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> top<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.189> price<00:01:11.430> range<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.060> we've

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
at the top of the price range so we've

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.390 
at the top of the price range so we've
mentioned<00:01:13.049> installation<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:13.979> said<00:01:14.250> these<00:01:14.340> are

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
mentioned installation I said these are

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.710 
mentioned installation I said these are
actually<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> little<00:01:15.060> bit<00:01:15.210> easier<00:01:15.360> than

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
actually a little bit easier than

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.270 
actually a little bit easier than
standard<00:01:16.080> bars<00:01:16.320> reason<00:01:16.920> being<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.250> because

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
standard bars reason being is because

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.760 
standard bars reason being is because
these<00:01:17.549> have<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.970> pullback<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:19.020> rise<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.680> is

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
these have a pullback and a rise that is

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.740 
these have a pullback and a rise that is
actually<00:01:20.159> very<00:01:20.400> similar<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> lot<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.420> stock

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
actually very similar to a lot of stock

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.929 
actually very similar to a lot of stock
bars<00:01:22.229> these<00:01:22.770> things<00:01:23.009> really<00:01:23.549> don't<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:23.880> a

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
bars these things really don't have a

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.520 
bars these things really don't have a
crazy<00:01:24.240> rise<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.810> pullback<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.290> very

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
crazy rise and the pullback is very

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.140 
crazy rise and the pullback is very
normal<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.009> these<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.520> think<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.759> lot<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:26.970> you

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
normal in these so I think a lot of you
