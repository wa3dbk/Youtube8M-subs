they're<00:00:26.970> connected<00:00:27.359> with<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> bar<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.869> back

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
they're connected with a bar in the back

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.689 
they're connected with a bar in the back
which<00:00:28.710> gives<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.070> rack<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> little<00:00:29.580> more

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
which gives the rack a little more

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.310 
which gives the rack a little more
stability<00:00:29.880> if<00:00:30.660> you're<00:00:30.840> doing<00:00:30.990> some<00:00:31.140> heavy

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
stability if you're doing some heavy

stability if you're doing some heavy
heavy<00:00:31.470> weights<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.099> I'd<00:00:32.610> recommend<00:00:33.030> using<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
heavy weights so I'd recommend using the

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.180 
heavy weights so I'd recommend using the
bar<00:00:33.510> for<00:00:33.719> stability<00:00:33.870> but<00:00:34.710> if<00:00:34.800> you're<00:00:34.950> kind<00:00:35.070> of

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
bar for stability but if you're kind of

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.760 
bar for stability but if you're kind of
in<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.460> mobility<00:00:36.300> type<00:00:36.780> atmosphere<00:00:37.050> move

in a mobility type atmosphere move
things<00:00:37.980> around<00:00:38.100> they'll<00:00:38.850> still<00:00:39.120> work<00:00:39.149> fine

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
things around they'll still work fine
