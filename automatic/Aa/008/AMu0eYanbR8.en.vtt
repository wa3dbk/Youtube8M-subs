00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.779
 how is the ski boot next to the car? 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.030
 at the beginning of the adac test 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.160
 load securing the boot was still 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.469
 behind the car together with the 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.000
 complete ski equipment and luggage 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.210
 for a weekend in the mountains 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.640
 then the car was packed and that way 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.670
 how not to do it 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.070
 that is, the bulk of the crash 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.070
 Test speed like city 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.960
 usual 50 km h and it will be quite 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.829
 Quick as clear as the ski boots next to 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.829
 the car could 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.960
 so that something does not happen and before 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.580
 no one should be hurt 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.330
 Car driver before the ride a few 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.800
 to worry about 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.840
 The consumer has to be precise 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.930
 consider how many pieces of luggage have 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.130
 I like the sizes of the individual 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.410
 how can I get this? 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.030
 at all in a car and which one 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.040
 I have these options 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.980
 Also to secure baggage that is 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.390
 He must look I have two points 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.860
 i have some nasty ones in the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.270
 trunk where I then my straps 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.320
 Can attach so I charge 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.780
 can secure at all 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.100
 For example, the ski boots can easily under the 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.990
 Stowed front seat 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.030
 in the trunk belt should not 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.050
 are missing especially when it comes to the 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.240
 secure skis 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.580
 For one thing , you should ski that 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.140
 bind each other and then in addition to 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.540
 fasten straps in the car 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.760
 Also the rest of the equipment the sticks 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.940
 Eyewear and helmets should be tied tightly 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.310
 Large items of luggage such as suitcases become tight 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.530
 to each other and to the backrest of the 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.150
 rear row of seats also packed them 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.770
 Be additional with a strap 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.150
 secured 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.990
 the test shows if the charge is correct 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.990
 is secured 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.200
 This experiment shows that the 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.420
 Charge stayed where it is 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.519
 namely belongs in the trunk to the 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.200
 Secure places as they are installed 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.569
 and that was not 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.680
 has moved uncontrolled in the interior 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.680
 and injured occupants
