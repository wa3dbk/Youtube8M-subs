practicing<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:51.650> ancient<00:02:52.070> art<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.460> Tomoko<00:02:53.210> I

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
practicing the ancient art of Tomoko I

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.370 
practicing the ancient art of Tomoko I
was<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.410> carver<00:02:55.010> for<00:02:55.340> about<00:02:55.670> 23<00:02:56.209> years<00:02:56.330> and<00:02:56.810> then

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
was a carver for about 23 years and then

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.340 
was a carver for about 23 years and then
I<00:02:57.880> changed<00:02:58.880> codes<00:02:59.209> and<00:02:59.570> instead<00:03:00.080> of<00:03:00.170> carving

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
I changed codes and instead of carving

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.500 
I changed codes and instead of carving
timber<00:03:00.830> and<00:03:00.890> stone<00:03:00.980> I<00:03:01.340> started<00:03:01.730> carving<00:03:01.940> skin

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
timber and stone I started carving skin

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.590 
timber and stone I started carving skin
so<00:03:03.470> if<00:03:03.560> you<00:03:03.709> see<00:03:03.980> someone<00:03:04.370> wearing<00:03:04.760> more<00:03:05.390> core

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
so if you see someone wearing more core

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.840 
so if you see someone wearing more core
can<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:05.900> quickly<00:03:06.260> work<00:03:07.100> out<00:03:07.340> where<00:03:07.640> they've

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
can you quickly work out where they've

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.660 
can you quickly work out where they've
come<00:03:07.880> from<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.450> what<00:03:08.840> their<00:03:08.990> background<00:03:09.410> is

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
come from and what their background is

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.920 
come from and what their background is
yeah<00:03:10.670> now<00:03:10.910> I<00:03:10.940> can<00:03:11.150> now<00:03:11.630> I<00:03:11.660> can<00:03:12.020> because<00:03:12.410> there's

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
yeah now I can now I can because there's

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.480 
yeah now I can now I can because there's
there's<00:03:14.930> really<00:03:15.080> I<00:03:15.230> guess<00:03:15.770> on<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.100> larger

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
there's really I guess on the larger

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.699 
there's really I guess on the larger
scale<00:03:16.700> thing<00:03:17.060> there's<00:03:17.300> only<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.570> few<00:03:17.840> few

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
scale thing there's only a few few

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.010 
scale thing there's only a few few
artists<00:03:19.250> that<00:03:19.280> are<00:03:19.400> doing<00:03:19.760> such<00:03:20.270> scale

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
artists that are doing such scale

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.460 
artists that are doing such scale
workers<00:03:21.500> facial<00:03:21.920> model<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.459> so<00:03:23.450> at<00:03:24.230> this

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
workers facial model and so at this

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.040 
workers facial model and so at this
point<00:03:24.800> where<00:03:25.250> I'm<00:03:25.370> able<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:25.760> identify<00:03:26.660> who<00:03:26.720> the

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
point where I'm able to identify who the

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.770 
point where I'm able to identify who the
work<00:03:27.230> has<00:03:27.680> been<00:03:27.950> done<00:03:28.130> by<00:03:28.269> and<00:03:29.269> therefore

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
work has been done by and therefore

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.770 
work has been done by and therefore
identify<00:03:30.850> possibly<00:03:31.850> where<00:03:32.030> that<00:03:32.180> person<00:03:32.630> has

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
identify possibly where that person has

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.590 
identify possibly where that person has
come<00:03:33.170> from<00:03:33.489> most<00:03:34.489> of<00:03:34.700> my<00:03:34.910> stuff<00:03:35.360> is

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
come from most of my stuff is

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.720 
come from most of my stuff is
progressive<00:03:36.410> because<00:03:36.890> a<00:03:36.920> lot<00:03:37.310> of<00:03:37.340> empty

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
progressive because a lot of empty

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.470 
progressive because a lot of empty
spaces<00:03:38.800> that<00:03:39.800> are<00:03:39.950> yet<00:03:40.100> to<00:03:40.130> be<00:03:40.310> filled<00:03:40.790> up<00:03:41.000> as<00:03:41.300> I

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
spaces that are yet to be filled up as I

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.970 
spaces that are yet to be filled up as I
achieve<00:03:41.810> different<00:03:42.050> things<00:03:42.530> throughout<00:03:42.769> my

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
achieve different things throughout my

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.220 
achieve different things throughout my
life<00:03:43.190> so<00:03:43.459> I<00:03:43.730> just<00:03:44.239> started<00:03:44.570> off<00:03:44.630> with<00:03:44.840> a

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
life so I just started off with a

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.550 
life so I just started off with a
section<00:03:45.680> of<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.950> face<00:03:46.130> and<00:03:46.880> that's<00:03:47.690> that

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
section of the face and that's that

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.370 
section of the face and that's that
section<00:03:49.040> really<00:03:49.340> reflected<00:03:50.080> part<00:03:51.080> of<00:03:51.230> my

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
section really reflected part of my

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.500 
section really reflected part of my
local<00:03:52.070> history<00:03:52.400> from<00:03:52.640> where<00:03:52.820> I'm<00:03:52.910> from<00:03:52.940> and
