00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.220

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.430

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.840

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.420
 ratifies and helps control 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.750
 facial glitters but it's not a 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.810
 magnifier so you can see the face 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.179
 cartoon nothing is not a nuance and out 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.960
 discreet that is not going to see your face 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:40.750
 withered is going to look radiant but without 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.330
 so much shine disguise the appearance of 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.909
 the open pores promises to leave a 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.340
 skin effect photoshop says it's multi 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:53.610
 benefits because you can use it as 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:56.920
 prebase as a moisturizer as 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.860
 stevie cream and when I read live in 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.530
 I said like a cream is going to be the same as 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.200
 a live believes but when I started 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.260
 use surprised me a lot because 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.630
 Really 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.510
 when you put it on, it looks like you're 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.090
 putting a bicrim has no color like 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.460
 a showcase but it helps you unify 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.070
 much the tone of your skin and if it is true 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.560
 that leaves the appearance of a showcase to 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.380
 difference of the baby cream this one 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.810
 has a sun protection factor that I 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.170
 I would say that in this cream is the only 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.750
 point that he needs to make a cream 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.240
 perfect promises to create a barrier 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.210
 protective that will protect you from the 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.970
 someone damages the environment or 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.090
 the products of cosmetic uses that a 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.450
 Sometimes we use products that do not 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.130
 we know or do not specify well the 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.160
 ingredients and sometimes those products 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.340
 can be harmful to health and good 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.500
 this cream promises to create a layer that goes 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.130
 to prevent those harmful ingredients 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.800
 damage your skin but it's not your 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.080
 function has proven that its formula 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.330
 helps to improve the appearance of 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.310
 Acne skins among its main 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.080
 ingredients contain and so on the 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.380
 measure that promotes 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.670
 Clean soft and moisturized in its texture 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.670
 It is very light 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.340
 and it helps that it is perfectly based on 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.340
 Our skin 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.170
 it absorbs very fast is not as heavy as 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.989
 other lightening creams is what has 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.510
 liked many times of this one that is very 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.420
 ligerita is absorbed of flown and as they 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.849
 he said he does not leave that heavy feeling that 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.370
 let other creams clear up first what 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:49.250
 best of all this is that it's free to 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.209
 parabens of mineral oils and 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.939
 animals and does not contain dyes or 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.069
 artificial fragrances also not 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.409
 contains no other ingredient of 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.780
 encouragement that can hurt or irritate 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:05.750
 Our skin is suitable for all kinds of 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.090
 skin even the most sensitive its form 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.359
 of use is like any other cream 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.549
 facial either before you put on makeup with 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.729
 the clean face we put in certain 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:19.880
 areas of our face and we blur it 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:22.729
 until absorbed absorbs very fast 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.320
 of the first moment is going to see a little 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.840
 whitish 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.390
 It melts with our skin and adapts 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.410
 perfectly so do not be afraid 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.870
 for looking like a Gasparino or something like that 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:39.530
 I assure you, they are going to ask me 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:42.580
 which is better if this or the bandit of 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:46.090
 tony moli and the truth would be a little 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:49.850
 risky saying which is better or worse 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.400
 because I can look better one and 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.100
 the other not so much and maybe you 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.250
 it works nothing backwards and it seems to you 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:01.160
 better one than the other then both 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.200
 They are very good but what I like about 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.940
 this is that it is light and absorbs more 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.100
 faster than Panda antoni moll 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.530
 but it is already a matter of you 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.930
 try and decide which one is best for you 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.970
 skin type the only thing that when you 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:18.080
 you put sometimes it stays here like that 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:21.230
 trapped in your eyebrows but with a common 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.410
 this one eyebrow skewer you remove the 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:27.770
 excess and ready nothing happens I think it's 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.120
 the perfect cream has everything 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.810
 can you ask 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.790
 of a facial cream and that's why 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.710
 they say that it is not even necessary anymore 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.770
 use bibi cream 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:43.699
 it has everything has to disguise its 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:46.639
 imperfections clarifies protects from damage 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:49.880
 has all the unique things that only 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:52.460
 lack is that it has protection factor 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.889
 solar but if you after this osasuna 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.500
 he lived he usually believes the showcase 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.570
 brings a sun protection factor like this 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.539
 do not worry about that, there's no greater 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.639
 problem and well that was all I hope that
