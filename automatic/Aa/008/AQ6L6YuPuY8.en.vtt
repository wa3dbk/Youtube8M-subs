as you can see from this picture video
there's<00:02:40.349> three<00:02:40.620> capacitors<00:02:41.330> online<00:02:42.330> they're

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
there's three capacitors online they're

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.119 
there's three capacitors online they're
the<00:02:44.069> front<00:02:44.400> one<00:02:44.610> at<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.879> 330<00:02:45.780> micro<00:02:46.260> farad<00:02:46.620> 25

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
the front one at the 330 micro farad 25

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:52.550 
the front one at the 330 micro farad 25
volt<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:48.269> next<00:02:48.690> two<00:02:48.989> or<00:02:49.550> 820<00:02:50.550> micro<00:02:51.450> farad<00:02:51.840> 25

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
volt the next two or 820 micro farad 25

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.089 
volt the next two or 820 micro farad 25
volt<00:02:53.420> so<00:02:54.420> if<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.629> get<00:02:54.840> these<00:02:55.050> two<00:02:55.110> changed<00:02:55.920> out

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
volt so if you get these two changed out

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.610 
volt so if you get these two changed out
again<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.180> your<00:02:57.420> monitor<00:02:58.080> wolf<00:02:58.349> ain't

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
again to you your monitor wolf ain't

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.720
