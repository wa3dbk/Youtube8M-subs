EP<00:03:17.670> 9<00:03:17.849> is<00:03:18.329> basically<00:03:18.900> an<00:03:19.170> urgent<00:03:19.439> drive<00:03:19.709> with<00:03:20.129> a

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
EP 9 is basically an urgent drive with a

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.880 
EP 9 is basically an urgent drive with a
different<00:03:20.610> cut<00:03:20.819> on<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.480> IR<00:03:21.870> frequency<00:03:22.500> about

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
different cut on the IR frequency about

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.089 
different cut on the IR frequency about
1,000<00:03:23.519> Hertz<00:03:23.750> this<00:03:24.750> peculiar<00:03:25.349> circuitry

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
1,000 Hertz this peculiar circuitry

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.949 
1,000 Hertz this peculiar circuitry
gives<00:03:26.430> an<00:03:26.640> extra<00:03:26.879> distortion<00:03:27.569> to<00:03:27.810> these

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
gives an extra distortion to these

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.440 
gives an extra distortion to these
frequencies<00:03:28.230> without<00:03:29.099> affecting<00:03:29.819> bass<00:03:30.120> and

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
frequencies without affecting bass and

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.390 
frequencies without affecting bass and
mid-range<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:31.200> guess<00:03:31.829> it<00:03:32.010> would<00:03:32.159> work

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
mid-range I guess it would work

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.270 
mid-range I guess it would work
perfectly<00:03:32.459> for<00:03:33.420> darkest<00:03:33.900> pickups<00:03:34.290> because<00:03:34.890> of

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
perfectly for darkest pickups because of

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.190 
perfectly for darkest pickups because of
the<00:03:35.370> tendency<00:03:35.670> to<00:03:36.030> emphasize<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.689> high<00:03:36.810> range

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
the tendency to emphasize the high range

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.830 
the tendency to emphasize the high range
of<00:03:37.409> sound<00:03:37.739> without<00:03:38.340> pushing<00:03:38.790> lows<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:39.659> mid

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
of sound without pushing lows and mid

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.649 
of sound without pushing lows and mid
more<00:03:40.170> than<00:03:40.379> necessary<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:41.250> wish<00:03:42.150> I<00:03:42.239> had<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.450> dick

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
more than necessary I wish I had a dick

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.690 
more than necessary I wish I had a dick
now<00:03:42.900> when<00:03:43.140> I<00:03:43.170> was<00:03:43.439> desperately<00:03:44.010> looking<00:03:44.220> for<00:03:44.519> a

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
now when I was desperately looking for a

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.170 
now when I was desperately looking for a
good<00:03:44.879> tone<00:03:45.150> on<00:03:45.359> my<00:03:45.480> 335<00:03:46.519> an<00:03:47.519> extra<00:03:47.939> function

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
good tone on my 335 an extra function

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.330 
good tone on my 335 an extra function
could<00:03:48.599> be<00:03:48.659> to<00:03:48.900> give<00:03:49.049> a<00:03:49.079> bit<00:03:49.349> more<00:03:49.379> presence<00:03:50.159> in

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
could be to give a bit more presence in

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.479 
could be to give a bit more presence in
big<00:03:50.579> stages<00:03:50.940> where<00:03:51.900> it's<00:03:52.230> difficult<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.829> apply

with a three position switch which
allows<00:04:01.109> you<00:04:01.319> to<00:04:01.560> choose<00:04:01.799> between<00:04:02.099> three<00:04:03.000> kinds

a black face and clean which allows you

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.849 
a black face and clean which allows you
to<00:04:10.859> use<00:04:11.040> it<00:04:11.189> as<00:04:11.340> a<00:04:11.370> booster
