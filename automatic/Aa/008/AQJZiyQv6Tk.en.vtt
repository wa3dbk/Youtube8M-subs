four hundred dollars i paid more or less

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.840 
four hundred dollars i paid more or less
half<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.680> which<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.160> still<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.430> lot<00:00:53.730> of

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.900 
half of that which is still a lot of
money<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.539> lasts<00:00:55.309> two<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.340> four<00:00:56.760> months

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
money but this lasts two to four months

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.830 
money but this lasts two to four months
depending<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.510> how<00:00:57.660> much<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.530> wash<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.840> i

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
depending on how much you wash it and i

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.560 
depending on how much you wash it and i
don't<00:01:01.260> get<00:01:01.710> my<00:01:01.829> hair<00:01:02.039> colored<00:01:02.570> professionally

don't get my hair colored professionally
so<00:01:03.930> i<00:01:03.960> figured<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.890> would<00:01:05.040> even<00:01:05.309> out<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.489> be

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.580 
so i figured it would even out to be
about<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.150> same<00:01:06.330> or<00:01:06.600> even<00:01:06.750> less<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.260> just<00:01:07.439> do

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
about the same or even less to just do

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.260 
about the same or even less to just do
