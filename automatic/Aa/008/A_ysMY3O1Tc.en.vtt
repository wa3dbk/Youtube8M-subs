today but where should we start i'll

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.530 
today but where should we start i'll
start<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.340> off<00:00:41.460> with<00:00:41.670> what's<00:00:41.850> called<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.090> VRC

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
start you off with what's called the VRC

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.139 
start you off with what's called the VRC
shadow<00:00:43.020> now<00:00:43.680> VRC<00:00:44.129> stands<00:00:44.670> for<00:00:44.940> virtual

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
shadow now VRC stands for virtual

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.110 
shadow now VRC stands for virtual
reality<00:00:46.079> control<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.739> what<00:00:47.430> we've<00:00:47.610> done<00:00:47.879> is

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
reality control and what we've done is

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.850 
reality control and what we've done is
we've<00:00:48.270> changed<00:00:48.570> traditional<00:00:49.440> thumb<00:00:49.680> play

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
we've changed traditional thumb play

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.910 
we've changed traditional thumb play
with<00:00:50.039> our<00:00:50.129> see<00:00:50.430> into<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.570> virtual<00:00:52.140> reality

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
with our see into a virtual reality

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.950 
with our see into a virtual reality
simulator<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.489> sorts<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.270> rather<00:00:54.480> than<00:00:54.629> flying

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
simulator of sorts so rather than flying

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.049 
simulator of sorts so rather than flying
with<00:00:55.230> your<00:00:55.379> thumbs<00:00:55.620> you'll<00:00:56.489> tilt<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.969> your

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
with your thumbs you'll tilt to your

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.639 
with your thumbs you'll tilt to your
right<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.449> turn<00:00:57.660> you'll<00:00:57.930> tilt<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.320> your<00:00:58.440> left

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
right to turn you'll tilt to your left

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.200 
right to turn you'll tilt to your left
to<00:00:58.770> turn<00:00:59.039> can<00:00:59.730> take<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.910> look<00:01:00.030> at<00:01:00.120> that

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
to turn can take a look at that

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.720 
to turn can take a look at that
absolutely<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.739> kind<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.699> a

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
absolutely so so kind of like you a

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.369 
absolutely so so kind of like you a
Nintendo<00:01:03.300> Wii<00:01:03.480> or<00:01:03.510> some<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.899> these<00:01:03.960> games<00:01:04.170> now

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
Nintendo Wii or some of these games now

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.020 
Nintendo Wii or some of these games now
very<00:01:04.619> similar<00:01:04.949> technology<00:01:07.729> this<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.850> almost

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
very similar technology this is almost

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.550 
very similar technology this is almost
being<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.420> cockpit<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.810> an<00:01:09.990> airplane<00:01:10.080> ER<00:01:10.350> in

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
being in a cockpit of an airplane ER in

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.800 
being in a cockpit of an airplane ER in
a<00:01:10.650> helicopter<00:01:11.000> we<00:01:12.000> think<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.330> as<00:01:12.420> close<00:01:12.600> to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
a helicopter we think it's as close to

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.330 
a helicopter we think it's as close to
in<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.140> toy<00:01:13.350> level<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:13.770> as<00:01:13.860> close<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.250> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
in a toy level it's as close to the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.219 
in a toy level it's as close to the
experiences<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.909> can<00:01:14.939> get<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.540> only<00:01:15.750> like

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
experiences you can get is it only like

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.960 
experiences you can get is it only like
one<00:01:16.380> direction<00:01:16.530> like<00:01:17.159> left<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.610> right<00:01:17.759> or

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
one direction like left and right or

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.460 
one direction like left and right or
what<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.479> can<00:01:18.630> go<00:01:18.720> up<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.080> can<00:01:19.200> dance<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
what you can go up and you can dance a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.560 
what you can go up and you can dance a
three-channel<00:01:19.950> helicopters<00:01:20.939> okay<00:01:21.210> cattle<00:01:21.479> so

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
three-channel helicopters okay cattle so

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.210 
three-channel helicopters okay cattle so
you<00:01:21.630> can<00:01:21.720> go<00:01:21.810> up<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:21.990> go<00:01:22.229> down<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.130> go

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
you can go up and go down you can go

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.590 
you can go up and go down you can go
left<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.580> right<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.150> can<00:01:24.299> move<00:01:24.420> forward

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
left and right and you can move forward

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.330 
left and right and you can move forward
and<00:01:24.900> reverse<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.680> we<00:01:25.770> actually<00:01:25.890> get<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.130> fly

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
and reverse so we actually get to fly

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.070 
and reverse so we actually get to fly
this<00:01:26.400> now<00:01:26.700> absolutely<00:01:27.420> that's<00:01:27.659> what<00:01:27.869> i<00:01:27.900> want

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080

where I believe how was your office we

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.400 
where I believe how was your office we
find<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.480> lot<00:02:36.600> of<00:02:36.630> our<00:02:36.780> customers<00:02:36.900> are<00:02:37.260> sitting

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
find a lot of our customers are sitting

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.690 
find a lot of our customers are sitting
in<00:02:37.470> their<00:02:37.560> office<00:02:37.590> or<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.010> living<00:02:38.250> room<00:02:38.400> what

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
in their office or the living room what

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.920 
in their office or the living room what
are<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:38.880> other<00:02:39.030> controls<00:02:39.390> for<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.690> what

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
are the other controls for that what

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.850 
are the other controls for that what
we've<00:02:40.050> done<00:02:40.230> there's<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.500> bit<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.739> learning

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
we've done there's a bit of a learning

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.160 
we've done there's a bit of a learning
curve<00:02:41.070> with<00:02:41.370> DRC<00:02:41.910> in<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.300> virtual<00:02:42.540> reality

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
curve with DRC in the virtual reality

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.199 
curve with DRC in the virtual reality
control<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:43.739> we've<00:02:43.980> actually<00:02:44.220> implemented<00:02:45.120> in

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
control so we've actually implemented in

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.229 
control so we've actually implemented in
both<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.630> VRC<00:02:45.900> lines<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.500> manual<00:02:47.250> option<00:02:47.430> oh<00:02:47.760> so

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
both the VRC lines a manual option oh so

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.120 
both the VRC lines a manual option oh so
if<00:02:48.300> I'm<00:02:48.420> not<00:02:48.600> comfortable<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:49.320> can<00:02:49.590> just<00:02:49.770> click

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
if I'm not comfortable I can just click

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.010 
if I'm not comfortable I can just click
on<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.430> yeah<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.120> that's<00:02:51.480> gonna<00:02:51.630> put<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.930> in

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
on that yeah and that's gonna put it in

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.140 
on that yeah and that's gonna put it in
the<00:02:52.110> manual<00:02:52.470> mode<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.920> from<00:02:53.400> there<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.640> can<00:02:53.820> fly

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
the manual mode and from there I can fly

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.610 
the manual mode and from there I can fly
it<00:02:54.209> like<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.390> traditional<00:02:54.840> art<00:02:55.050> scene<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:55.440> it's

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
it like a traditional art scene so it's

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.020 
it like a traditional art scene so it's
you<00:02:55.709> know<00:02:55.920> first<00:02:56.190> time<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.550> out<00:02:56.640> of<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.790> box

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
you know first time you out of the box

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.220 
you know first time you out of the box
you<00:02:57.150> might<00:02:57.300> want<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.510> give<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.810> go<00:02:58.020> to<00:02:58.080> get

you might want to give this a go to get

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.140 
you might want to give this a go to get
comfortable<00:02:58.560> with<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.800> helicopter<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.550> then

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
comfortable with the helicopter and then

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.060 
comfortable with the helicopter and then
afterwards<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:00.900> try<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.620> slip<00:03:01.830> it<00:03:01.950> in

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
afterwards you try and you slip it in

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.170 
afterwards you try and you slip it in
it's<00:03:02.340> just<00:03:02.489> that<00:03:02.580> easy<00:03:02.670> with<00:03:02.850> slipping<00:03:03.090> the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
it's just that easy with slipping the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.640 
it's just that easy with slipping the
button<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.780> after<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.140> charge<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.500> and

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
button and after you charge it and

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.960 
button and after you charge it and
you're<00:03:04.799> into<00:03:04.980> virtual<00:03:05.310> reality<00:03:05.640> control

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
you're into virtual reality control

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:18.190 
you're into virtual reality control
right<00:03:06.150> now<00:03:06.180> that's<00:03:06.660> cause<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.930> lot<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.260> fun

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.360 

you've<00:03:19.200> also<00:03:19.380> come<00:03:19.799> out<00:03:19.920> with<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.070> device<00:03:20.340> to

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
you've also come out with a device to

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.370 
you've also come out with a device to
take<00:03:20.670> out<00:03:20.850> door<00:03:21.060> absolutely<00:03:21.690> what's<00:03:22.110> this<00:03:22.200> one

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
take out door absolutely what's this one

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.229 
take out door absolutely what's this one
called<00:03:22.410> this<00:03:22.769> is<00:03:22.920> called<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.220> VRC<00:03:23.519> strike

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
called this is called the VRC strike

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.050 
called this is called the VRC strike
force<00:03:24.480> it's<00:03:25.230> our<00:03:25.350> outdoor<00:03:25.829> gym<00:03:26.160> it's

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
force it's our outdoor gym it's

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.430 
force it's our outdoor gym it's
something<00:03:27.209> really<00:03:27.510> excited<00:03:27.840> about<00:03:27.930> it's<00:03:28.320> the

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
something really excited about it's the

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.620 
something really excited about it's the
same<00:03:28.650> technology<00:03:29.280> but<00:03:29.730> we<00:03:29.820> put<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.269> jet

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
same technology but we put it to a jet

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.690 
same technology but we put it to a jet
so<00:03:31.350> you<00:03:31.440> can<00:03:31.650> shake<00:03:31.829> this<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.250> park<00:03:32.489> and

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
so you can shake this to the park and

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.600 
so you can shake this to the park and
it's<00:03:33.329> it's<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.840> lot<00:03:34.079> of<00:03:34.230> fun<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.620> notice<00:03:35.250> that<00:03:35.400> the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
it's it's a lot of fun I notice that the

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.800 
it's it's a lot of fun I notice that the
control<00:03:35.940> is<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.090> little<00:03:36.120> bit<00:03:36.390> different<00:03:36.720> like

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
control is a little bit different like

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.509 
control is a little bit different like
this<00:03:36.959> one<00:03:37.079> has<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.230> rubber<00:03:37.470> handle<00:03:37.890> this<00:03:38.280> one

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
this one has a rubber handle this one

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.610 
this one has a rubber handle this one
actually<00:03:38.730> because<00:03:39.180> it's<00:03:39.329> it's<00:03:39.660> outdoors<00:03:40.260> need

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
actually because it's it's outdoors need

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.470 
actually because it's it's outdoors need
a<00:03:40.650> lot<00:03:40.799> more<00:03:40.829> range<00:03:41.250> okay<00:03:41.730> operative<00:03:42.150> we<00:03:42.329> use

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
a lot more range okay operative we use

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.569 
a lot more range okay operative we use
the<00:03:42.660> antenna<00:03:43.230> they're<00:03:43.470> like<00:03:43.620> this<00:03:43.829> it<00:03:44.370> just

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
the antenna they're like this it just

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:45.530 
the antenna they're like this it just
allows<00:03:44.670> you<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.090> have<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.239> lot<00:03:45.510> more

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
allows you to have a lot more

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.539 
allows you to have a lot more
comfortable<00:03:46.049> hablar<00:03:46.590> contigo<00:03:46.799> ways<00:03:47.310> you'll

comfortable hablar contigo ways you'll

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.640 
comfortable hablar contigo ways you'll
get<00:03:47.700> about<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.910> hundred<00:03:48.090> feet<00:03:48.420> Wow<00:03:48.810> yeah<00:03:49.170> it<00:03:49.380> can

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
get about a hundred feet Wow yeah it can

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.380 
get about a hundred feet Wow yeah it can
it<00:03:49.829> can<00:03:49.860> fly<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.280> it's<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.549> lot<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:50.760> fun<00:03:50.880> so<00:03:51.150> it's

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
it can fly and it's a lot of fun so it's

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.000 
it can fly and it's a lot of fun so it's
a<00:03:51.480> challenging<00:03:51.959> plane<00:03:52.200> but<00:03:52.470> it's<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.680> lot<00:03:52.950> of

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
a challenging plane but it's a lot of

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.090 
a challenging plane but it's a lot of
fun<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:54.440> see<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:55.500> still<00:03:55.709> has<00:03:55.829> the<00:03:55.950> manual

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
fun I see it still has the manual

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.160 
fun I see it still has the manual
control<00:03:56.610> on<00:03:56.730> absolute<00:03:57.209> but<00:03:57.450> you<00:03:57.540> can<00:03:57.810> fly<00:03:58.110> it

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
control on absolute but you can fly it

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.110 
control on absolute but you can fly it
virtually<00:03:58.530> as<00:03:58.860> well<00:03:59.010> yes<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.640> whole<00:03:59.790> idea<00:03:59.940> is

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
virtually as well yes the whole idea is

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.400 
virtually as well yes the whole idea is
to<00:04:00.329> fly<00:04:00.480> it<00:04:00.540> virtually<00:04:00.720> but<00:04:00.930> we<00:04:01.019> understand

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
to fly it virtually but we understand

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.140 
to fly it virtually but we understand
the<00:04:01.500> learning<00:04:01.769> curves<00:04:01.980> we<00:04:02.220> want<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.579> to<00:04:02.790> have

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
the learning curves we want you to have

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.600 
the learning curves we want you to have
both<00:04:03.390> options<00:04:03.799> and<00:04:04.799> with<00:04:05.010> this<00:04:05.099> is<00:04:05.250> great<00:04:05.459> cuz

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
both options and with this is great cuz

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.030 
both options and with this is great cuz
if<00:04:05.700> you<00:04:05.760> tilt<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.090> left

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
if you tilt to the left

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.130 
if you tilt to the left
it's<00:04:07.189> gonna<00:04:07.370> tilt<00:04:07.670> to<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:07.819> it's<00:04:08.120> it's<00:04:08.420> if<00:04:08.900> the

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
it's gonna tilt to it it's it's if the

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.839 
it's gonna tilt to it it's it's if the
response<00:04:09.500> on<00:04:09.680> is<00:04:09.799> fantastic<00:04:10.400> it's<00:04:10.579> the<00:04:10.640> same

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
response on is fantastic it's the same

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.030 
response on is fantastic it's the same
digital<00:04:11.209> proportion<00:04:11.659> control<00:04:12.079> and<00:04:12.409> as<00:04:12.890> well

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
digital proportion control and as well

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.009 
digital proportion control and as well
as<00:04:13.069> a<00:04:13.159> cyclic<00:04:13.549> technology<00:04:14.120> so<00:04:14.599> it<00:04:14.629> really

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
as a cyclic technology so it really

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:16.779 
as a cyclic technology so it really
allows<00:04:15.319> the<00:04:15.560> ultimate<00:04:16.009> sort<00:04:16.250> of<00:04:16.310> we<00:04:16.519> call<00:04:16.669> it

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
allows the ultimate sort of we call it

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.279 
allows the ultimate sort of we call it
feel<00:04:17.090> what's<00:04:17.329> real<00:04:17.600> I<00:04:17.870> really<00:04:18.259> enjoyed

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
feel what's real I really enjoyed

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.050 
feel what's real I really enjoyed
watching<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.919> shadow<00:04:19.160> fly<00:04:19.430> around<00:04:19.579> inside

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
watching the shadow fly around inside

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.090 
watching the shadow fly around inside
but<00:04:20.359> I'm<00:04:20.479> definitely<00:04:21.019> interested<00:04:21.560> in<00:04:21.859> taking

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
but I'm definitely interested in taking

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.430 
but I'm definitely interested in taking
the<00:04:22.430> strikeforce<00:04:22.910> out<00:04:23.090> into<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:23.479> open<00:04:23.750> air<00:04:24.080> so

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
the strikeforce out into the open air so

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.689 
the strikeforce out into the open air so
what<00:04:24.800> do<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:24.919> say<00:04:25.009> we<00:04:25.100> go<00:04:25.190> test<00:04:25.430> it<00:04:25.490> out<00:04:25.580> you

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
what do you say we go test it out you

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.580 
what do you say we go test it out you
think<00:04:25.880> they'll<00:04:26.360> let<00:04:26.449> me<00:04:26.600> fly<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:27.110> think<00:04:27.500> it

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
think they'll let me fly it I think it

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.320 
think they'll let me fly it I think it
could<00:04:27.680> be<00:04:27.740> arranged<00:04:28.070> okay<00:04:28.669> let's<00:04:29.000> go<00:04:29.120> all
