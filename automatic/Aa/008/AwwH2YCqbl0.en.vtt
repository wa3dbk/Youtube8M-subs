lacrosse ball and a golf ball

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.650 
lacrosse ball and a golf ball
and<00:00:20.050> the<00:00:20.199> tennis<00:00:20.470> balls<00:00:20.680> more<00:00:20.980> entry-level

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
and the tennis balls more entry-level

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.090 
and the tennis balls more entry-level
devices<00:00:22.660> that's<00:00:23.050> a<00:00:23.170> lot<00:00:23.320> softer<00:00:23.529> had<00:00:23.920> some

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
devices that's a lot softer had some

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.960 
devices that's a lot softer had some
gift<00:00:24.400> to<00:00:24.670> it

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
gift to it

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.210 
gift to it
lacrosse<00:00:25.600> ball<00:00:25.960> same<00:00:26.560> dimensions<00:00:27.070> as<00:00:27.189> the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
lacrosse ball same dimensions as the

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.310 
lacrosse ball same dimensions as the
tennis<00:00:27.670> ball<00:00:27.910> but<00:00:28.240> quite<00:00:28.449> a<00:00:28.480> bit<00:00:28.689> harder<00:00:29.109> and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
tennis ball but quite a bit harder and

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.349 
tennis ball but quite a bit harder and
so<00:00:29.890> it<00:00:29.980> so<00:00:30.070> if<00:00:30.160> you<00:00:30.279> step<00:00:30.550> up<00:00:30.730> you<00:00:30.880> graduate

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
so it so if you step up you graduate

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:32.820 
so it so if you step up you graduate
from<00:00:31.390> the<00:00:31.660> tennis<00:00:31.960> ball<00:00:32.169> to<00:00:32.379> the<00:00:32.500> lacrosse

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:32.830 
from the tennis ball to the lacrosse

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.270 
from the tennis ball to the lacrosse
ball<00:00:32.860> and<00:00:33.400> the<00:00:33.850> golf<00:00:34.059> ball<00:00:34.330> is<00:00:34.920> obviously<00:00:35.920> way

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
ball and the golf ball is obviously way

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.250 
ball and the golf ball is obviously way
more<00:00:36.309> focal<00:00:36.879> than<00:00:37.000> these<00:00:37.150> two<00:00:37.510> and<00:00:37.870> a<00:00:38.110> bit

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
more focal than these two and a bit

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.590 
more focal than these two and a bit
harder<00:00:38.680> so<00:00:39.190> they<00:00:39.519> all<00:00:39.909> three<00:00:40.180> serve<00:00:40.390> their

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
harder so they all three serve their

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.090 
harder so they all three serve their
purpose<00:00:40.930> can<00:00:41.110> go<00:00:41.290> over<00:00:41.530> them<00:00:41.620> real<00:00:41.650> quick

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
purpose can go over them real quick

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.549 
purpose can go over them real quick
let's<00:00:43.089> get<00:00:43.239> to<00:00:43.360> the<00:00:43.420> floor<00:00:43.629> so<00:00:44.140> we'll<00:00:44.320> start

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
let's get to the floor so we'll start

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.439 
let's get to the floor so we'll start
off<00:00:44.680> here<00:00:44.920> at<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.040> tennis<00:00:45.430> ball<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:46.030> tennis

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
off here at the tennis ball the tennis

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.049 
off here at the tennis ball the tennis
ball<00:00:47.010> obviously<00:00:48.010> not<00:00:48.159> nearly<00:00:48.430> as<00:00:48.610> hard<00:00:48.820> as<00:00:48.940> the

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
ball obviously not nearly as hard as the

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.119 
ball obviously not nearly as hard as the
cross<00:00:49.330> ball<00:00:49.659> or<00:00:49.869> the<00:00:49.930> golf<00:00:50.170> ball<00:00:50.470> has<00:00:50.799> quite<00:00:51.100> a

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
cross ball or the golf ball has quite a

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:52.649 
cross ball or the golf ball has quite a
bit<00:00:51.309> more<00:00:51.460> give<00:00:51.760> to<00:00:52.030> it<00:00:52.150> so<00:00:52.269> it's<00:00:52.420> a<00:00:52.479> good

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
bit more give to it so it's a good

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.320 
bit more give to it so it's a good
entry-level<00:00:53.379> starting<00:00:54.129> point<00:00:54.460> this<00:00:54.670> is<00:00:54.879> when

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
entry-level starting point this is when

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.969 
entry-level starting point this is when
you<00:00:55.420> start<00:00:55.690> doing<00:00:55.809> myofascial<00:00:56.350> release<00:00:56.530> on

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
you start doing myofascial release on

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:59.130 
you start doing myofascial release on
your<00:00:57.220> foot<00:00:57.519> this<00:00:58.150> would<00:00:58.360> be<00:00:58.449> the<00:00:58.570> guy<00:00:58.690> to<00:00:58.750> start

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
your foot this would be the guy to start

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.660 
your foot this would be the guy to start
with<00:00:59.290> before<00:00:59.650> you<00:00:59.710> graduate<00:01:00.159> to<00:01:00.309> anything

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
with before you graduate to anything

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.689 
with before you graduate to anything
that's<00:01:01.570> a<00:01:01.780> little<00:01:01.960> bit<00:01:02.140> heavier<00:01:02.769> and<00:01:03.100> applies

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
that's a little bit heavier and applies

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:04.500 
that's a little bit heavier and applies
more<00:01:03.909> pressure

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
more pressure

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.840 
more pressure
so<00:01:04.890> take<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.010> tennis<00:01:06.310> ball<00:01:06.520> and<00:01:06.700> you're

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
so take the tennis ball and you're

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.970 
so take the tennis ball and you're
rolling<00:01:07.030> from<00:01:07.450> your<00:01:07.630> heel<00:01:08.050> all<00:01:08.410> the<00:01:08.470> way<00:01:08.920> to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
rolling from your heel all the way to

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.910 
rolling from your heel all the way to
the<00:01:09.220> ball<00:01:09.430> of<00:01:09.640> your<00:01:09.760> foot<00:01:09.970> here<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:11.680> can

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
the ball of your foot here you can

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.030 
the ball of your foot here you can
invert<00:01:12.850> and<00:01:13.120> ebert<00:01:13.540> your<00:01:13.750> ankle<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:14.410> this

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
invert and ebert your ankle and this

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.950 
invert and ebert your ankle and this
will<00:01:15.220> kind<00:01:15.430> of<00:01:15.610> produce<00:01:16.450> it'll<00:01:16.780> give<00:01:16.870> you

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
will kind of produce it'll give you

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.810 
will kind of produce it'll give you
access<00:01:17.140> to<00:01:17.380> different<00:01:17.620> muscles<00:01:18.160> down<00:01:18.520> there

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
access to different muscles down there

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.280 
access to different muscles down there
and<00:01:19.000> your<00:01:19.090> feet<00:01:19.330> you'll<00:01:19.750> feel<00:01:20.050> it<00:01:20.200> in

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
and your feet you'll feel it in

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.410 
and your feet you'll feel it in
different<00:01:20.440> areas<00:01:21.010> you<00:01:21.220> can<00:01:21.670> also<00:01:21.790> point<00:01:22.150> your

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
different areas you can also point your

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.910 
different areas you can also point your
toe<00:01:22.630> down<00:01:22.960> and<00:01:23.580> pull<00:01:24.580> it<00:01:24.730> back<00:01:24.940> and<00:01:25.770> then<00:01:26.770> like

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
toe down and pull it back and then like

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.580 
toe down and pull it back and then like
I<00:01:27.010> said<00:01:27.070> as<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:27.820> tennis<00:01:28.180> ball<00:01:28.390> becomes<00:01:28.780> it'll

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
I said as the tennis ball becomes it'll

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.140 
I said as the tennis ball becomes it'll
start<00:01:29.800> to<00:01:29.830> feel<00:01:30.070> soft<00:01:30.340> but<00:01:30.520> won't<00:01:30.670> produce<00:01:30.850> the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
start to feel soft but won't produce the

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.240 
start to feel soft but won't produce the
same<00:01:31.360> pressure<00:01:32.200> and<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:32.830> won't<00:01:33.010> have<00:01:33.130> the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
same pressure and you won't have the

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.860 
same pressure and you won't have the
same<00:01:33.430> results<00:01:33.909> so<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.030> need<00:01:34.210> to<00:01:34.270> graduate<00:01:34.480> to

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
same results so you need to graduate to

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.020 
same results so you need to graduate to
something<00:01:35.230> like<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.409> lacrosse<00:01:35.740> ball<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.850> so<00:01:36.970> in

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
something like a lacrosse ball and so in

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.420 
something like a lacrosse ball and so in
lacrosse<00:01:37.240> ball<00:01:37.570> same<00:01:37.900> principles<00:01:38.650> here<00:01:38.980> when

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
lacrosse ball same principles here when

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.840 
lacrosse ball same principles here when
you<00:01:39.520> find<00:01:39.820> something<00:01:40.210> that<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:42.430> know<00:01:42.550> trigger

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
you find something that you know trigger

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.560 
you find something that you know trigger
point<00:01:43.030> you<00:01:43.090> think<00:01:43.240> you've<00:01:43.390> identified

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
point you think you've identified

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.630 
point you think you've identified
something<00:01:44.290> what<00:01:44.590> you<00:01:44.710> want<00:01:44.860> to<00:01:44.950> do<00:01:45.130> is<00:01:45.460> just

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
something what you want to do is just

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.469 
something what you want to do is just
stick<00:01:45.970> on<00:01:46.210> that<00:01:46.240> area<00:01:46.870> and<00:01:47.280> if<00:01:48.280> you<00:01:48.460> need<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:49.150> I

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
stick on that area and if you need to I

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:50.760 
stick on that area and if you need to I
kind<00:01:50.020> of<00:01:50.080> whoa

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
kind of whoa

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.760 
kind of whoa
so<00:01:51.280> I'll<00:01:51.430> lift<00:01:51.909> this<00:01:52.300> front<00:01:52.690> leg<00:01:52.930> and<00:01:53.320> lean

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
so I'll lift this front leg and lean

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.710 
so I'll lift this front leg and lean
over<00:01:53.800> and<00:01:54.340> ply<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.550> little<00:01:55.090> bit<00:01:55.240> more<00:01:55.390> pressure

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
over and ply a little bit more pressure

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.469 
over and ply a little bit more pressure
down<00:01:56.500> on<00:01:56.710> this<00:01:56.890> foot<00:01:57.220> at<00:01:57.340> times<00:01:57.610> and<00:01:57.970> that<00:01:58.330> can

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
down on this foot at times and that can

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.899 
down on this foot at times and that can
kind<00:01:58.690> of<00:01:58.750> help<00:01:59.290> out<00:01:59.560> and<00:01:59.920> dig<00:02:00.159> in<00:02:00.340> quite<00:02:00.670> a<00:02:00.700> bit

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
kind of help out and dig in quite a bit

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.590 
kind of help out and dig in quite a bit
quite<00:02:01.570> a<00:02:01.630> bit<00:02:01.750> more<00:02:02.370> the<00:02:03.370> golf<00:02:03.640> ball<00:02:03.940> obviously

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
quite a bit more the golf ball obviously

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.810 
quite a bit more the golf ball obviously
harder<00:02:04.900> than<00:02:05.049> both<00:02:05.290> of<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.590> two<00:02:05.770> balls<00:02:06.070> I<00:02:06.430> just

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
harder than both of the two balls I just

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.690 
harder than both of the two balls I just
previously<00:02:07.060> use<00:02:07.600> it's<00:02:07.780> also<00:02:07.960> extremely<00:02:08.700> focal

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
previously use it's also extremely focal

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.250 
previously use it's also extremely focal
you<00:02:09.789> know<00:02:09.879> it's<00:02:10.030> smaller<00:02:10.390> so<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:10.929> definitely

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
you know it's smaller so it definitely

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.580 
you know it's smaller so it definitely
applies<00:02:11.860> more<00:02:12.130> pressure

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
applies more pressure

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.400 
applies more pressure
and<00:02:13.280> I<00:02:13.849> really<00:02:14.330> like<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.810> in<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.110> area<00:02:15.260> of

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
and I really like this in the area of

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.410 
and I really like this in the area of
the<00:02:15.500> balls<00:02:15.739> of<00:02:15.980> my<00:02:16.130> feet<00:02:16.160> up<00:02:16.610> here<00:02:16.849> close<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.150> my

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
the balls of my feet up here close to my

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.390 
the balls of my feet up here close to my
toes<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:18.080> stuff<00:02:18.410> because<00:02:18.620> it<00:02:18.739> really<00:02:19.069> kind<00:02:19.250> of

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
toes and stuff because it really kind of

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.600 
toes and stuff because it really kind of
gets<00:02:19.640> in<00:02:19.910> between<00:02:20.800> in<00:02:21.800> between<00:02:21.890> areas<00:02:22.520> that

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
gets in between in between areas that

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.130 
gets in between in between areas that
you<00:02:22.760> can't<00:02:23.060> get<00:02:23.209> with<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.450> other<00:02:23.599> two<00:02:23.810> balls

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
you can't get with the other two balls

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.970 
you can't get with the other two balls
so<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:25.370> also<00:02:25.580> is<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:26.420> significantly<00:02:27.200> harder<00:02:27.500> so

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
so it also is it significantly harder so

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.470 
so it also is it significantly harder so
you've<00:02:28.130> got<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.370> be<00:02:28.459> a<00:02:28.489> little<00:02:28.790> bit<00:02:28.910> more

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
you've got to be a little bit more

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.220 
you've got to be a little bit more
gentler<00:02:30.170> until<00:02:31.040> you've<00:02:31.450> become<00:02:32.450> accommodated

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
gentler until you've become accommodated

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.550 
gentler until you've become accommodated
to<00:02:33.349> the<00:02:33.440> pressure<00:02:33.709> from<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.130> other<00:02:34.160> two<00:02:34.519> balls

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
to the pressure from the other two balls

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.720 
to the pressure from the other two balls
that's<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.800> for<00:02:36.980> everything<00:02:37.340> on<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.550> floor

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
that's it for everything on the floor

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.780 
that's it for everything on the floor
