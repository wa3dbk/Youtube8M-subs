00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:03.580
 and here is the presentation of the chili snow plow 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.090
 soft and soft tissue plow 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.990
 snow hunting 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.170
 it has several advantages is not to operate first at the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.089
 reverse gear 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:13.079
 with different speeds necessarily 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.290
 marc chabot 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.669
 5 am different speeds that can change also 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:21.729
 with the speed here of the motor that we can adjust thereafter this is a 

00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:22.390
 small 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.099
 a small button that allows you to 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.050
 to start the snowplow what temperature of minus 10 degrees and without 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.199
 no problem 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.800
 the operation and the same thing as traditional engines so he says if 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.100
 you have the shock 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.740
 alas the purge 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.620
 the the fuel tank earlier 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.580
 at the level of the joysticks here it's pretty simple you've been 2 joysticks 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.200
 the first joystick kessel if it is to engage the strawberry 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.180
 and the second one, which simply means being able to start the march 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.410
 before or the next stepback so 2 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.420
 this controller in everything and for everything 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.870
 you have here a lighthouse for the tic have worked on the body you have to remove 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.560
 the snow 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.640
 the morning or late evening 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.100
 the Germans had not worked just after 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.900
 the birth of cinema but in the classic gas tank the mother of 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.950
 five 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.950
 then one of the more traditional here you have a bus to pick up 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.780
 more rejects than you can easily 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.890
 four sides of August next 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.640
 whether you're left or right for the after-sarkozy the contest will be 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.100
 maybe celebrate the twitter messenger now there is as well as around the 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.340
 leave in the same corner and in fact the psd little trick and you turn yourself 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.910
 buy the album and I propose to create a little further to exchange it 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.330
 by then that houses 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.640
 without any problem the process is here 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.540
 but it stays stuck like that 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.530
 at the level of trÃ©lazÃ© precisely 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.320
 the system is soft so here you have a strawberry this one that turns that goes 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.690
 take the snow and who will send it in your job here 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.850
 and it's the kilotonnes tomb equivalent we saw the snow 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.170
 on the outside or parking vote you're doing 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.890
 you have the opportunity here you have an approach 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.220
 with a small palette 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.770
 not only allows you to free football 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.120
 to remove the wick yesterday on receipts reach 9 to 16 his series damon 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.120
 when we have snow present we must wet it is very interesting 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.480
 you have 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.059
 we continue from the machine 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:11.419
 you have here 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:13.980
 patrick allows you to start the machine 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.809
 in an ethical human way 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:17.679
 you can also 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:21.399
 to start it manually is a fair built for example do not 

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:24.829
 was working the more it is flat you can without any problem start the 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.229
 emmanuel engine what will do charge the battery obviously you have a 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:31.599
 electric starter which is here 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.359
 so I call here the engine 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:36.539
 so few days that the senses and milizac 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:38.219
 but I start the engine 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:41.599
 may Pan Am Volition of Money on the Joystick 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.590
 it's the engine that's annual if I go further and well by passing for 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.590
 electric start 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:54.239
 presentation 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.019
 our task is immense talent
