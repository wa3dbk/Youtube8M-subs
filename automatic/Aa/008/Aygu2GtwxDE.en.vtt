00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
where I compare the two pros and cons

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.390 
where I compare the two pros and cons
and<00:01:08.570> things<00:01:08.960> like<00:01:09.080> that<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:09.440> later<00:01:09.830> on<00:01:09.979> I<00:01:10.220> will

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.950 
and things like that and later on I will
also<00:01:10.670> make<00:01:10.850> a<00:01:10.880> video<00:01:11.090> showing<00:01:11.479> you<00:01:11.630> how<00:01:11.930> to

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
make your wool dreads yourself because

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.210

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
comparing okay so first off um the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.210 
comparing okay so first off um the
merino<00:01:45.080> wool<00:01:45.110> rovings

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
merino wool rovings

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.340 
merino wool rovings
are<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.430> little<00:01:46.820> bit<00:01:47.060> cheaper<00:01:47.390> than<00:01:47.869> the

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
are a little bit cheaper than the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.100 
are a little bit cheaper than the
Kanekalon<00:01:48.710> jumbo<00:01:49.340> braids<00:01:49.750> so<00:01:50.750> this<00:01:50.930> is

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
Kanekalon jumbo braids so this is

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.020 
Kanekalon jumbo braids so this is
definitely<00:01:51.470> a<00:01:51.710> plus<00:01:52.189> I<00:01:52.430> mean<00:01:52.549> the<00:01:52.670> Kanekalon

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
definitely a plus I mean the Kanekalon

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.289 
definitely a plus I mean the Kanekalon
hair<00:01:53.240> is<00:01:53.479> not<00:01:53.689> expensive<00:01:54.259> but<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.850> wool<00:01:56.060> is

pretty quickly another big difference

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.479 
pretty quickly another big difference
between<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.329> two<00:02:17.480> is<00:02:17.719> that<00:02:18.049> the<00:02:18.349> wool<00:02:18.920> dreads

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
between the two is that the wool dreads

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.959 
between the two is that the wool dreads
are<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.819> lot<00:02:20.480> lighter<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.500> weight<00:02:21.549> than<00:02:22.549> the

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:22.969 
are a lot lighter in weight than the

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:26.289 
are a lot lighter in weight than the
synthetic<00:02:23.870> ones<00:02:24.459> for<00:02:25.459> me<00:02:25.579> this<00:02:25.760> is<00:02:25.879> a<00:02:25.939> really

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
synthetic ones for me this is a really

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:27.819 
synthetic ones for me this is a really
good<00:02:26.480> thing<00:02:26.750> because<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:27.079> have<00:02:27.469> some<00:02:27.799> serious

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
good thing because I have some serious

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.819 
good thing because I have some serious
issues<00:02:28.760> with<00:02:28.790> my<00:02:29.150> neck<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.780> my<00:02:29.810> head<00:02:30.620> being

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
issues with my neck and my head being

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.640 
issues with my neck and my head being
super<00:02:31.340> heavy<00:02:31.519> is<00:02:31.819> not<00:02:31.849> a<00:02:32.180> good<00:02:32.569> thing<00:02:32.599> so<00:02:33.079> the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
super heavy is not a good thing so the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.890 
super heavy is not a good thing so the
fact<00:02:33.889> that<00:02:34.010> these<00:02:34.250> pretty<00:02:35.120> much<00:02:35.209> don't<00:02:35.629> weight

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
fact that these pretty much don't weight

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.860 
fact that these pretty much don't weight
anything<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:36.739> a<00:02:36.799> really<00:02:37.579> big<00:02:37.790> plus<00:02:38.090> for<00:02:38.120> me<00:02:38.540> the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
anything is a really big plus for me the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.199 
anything is a really big plus for me the
wool<00:02:39.139> ones<00:02:39.409> still<00:02:39.889> got<00:02:40.099> more<00:02:40.310> water<00:02:40.670> than<00:02:41.060> the

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
wool ones still got more water than the

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.000 
wool ones still got more water than the
Kanekalon<00:02:41.629> ones<00:02:42.079> so<00:02:42.409> when<00:02:42.590> you're<00:02:42.739> in<00:02:42.859> the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
Kanekalon ones so when you're in the

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.449 
Kanekalon ones so when you're in the
shower<00:02:43.250> your<00:02:44.090> hair<00:02:44.420> gets<00:02:44.739> super<00:02:45.739> heavy<00:02:46.040> when

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
shower your hair gets super heavy when

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.899 
shower your hair gets super heavy when
you<00:02:46.489> have<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.909> wool<00:02:47.109> and<00:02:48.109> they<00:02:48.319> just<00:02:48.760> suck<00:02:49.760> up

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
you have the wool and they just suck up

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.659 
you have the wool and they just suck up
all<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.299> water<00:02:50.599> but<00:02:51.409> the<00:02:52.069> good<00:02:52.310> thing<00:02:52.579> about

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:52.669 
all the water but the good thing about

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:54.879 
all the water but the good thing about
the<00:02:52.939> wool<00:02:53.120> is<00:02:53.389> that<00:02:53.629> I<00:02:53.689> can<00:02:53.870> just<00:02:54.079> go<00:02:54.230> like<00:02:54.260> this

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:54.889 
the wool is that I can just go like this

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.770 
the wool is that I can just go like this
and<00:02:54.980> all<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.459> water<00:02:55.579> like<00:02:56.060> most<00:02:56.329> of<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.599> water

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
and all the water like most of the water

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.080 
and all the water like most of the water
will<00:02:57.139> disappear<00:02:57.319> if<00:02:57.889> I<00:02:58.340> do<00:02:58.400> that<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.939> the

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
will disappear if I do that to the

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.699 
will disappear if I do that to the
synthetic<00:02:59.540> ones<00:02:59.750> since<00:03:00.049> they're<00:03:00.230> plastic

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
synthetic ones since they're plastic

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.490 
synthetic ones since they're plastic
they<00:03:00.980> don't<00:03:01.310> really<00:03:01.519> give<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.239> water<00:03:02.450> away<00:03:02.810> so

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
they don't really give the water away so

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.459 
they don't really give the water away so
when<00:03:04.189> I<00:03:04.219> come<00:03:04.519> out<00:03:04.700> of<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:05.299> shower<00:03:05.510> after

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.129 
here that's been like closed in by the
other<00:03:46.459> hair<00:03:46.729> is<00:03:47.060> still<00:03:47.359> a<00:03:47.389> little<00:03:47.599> wet<00:03:47.870> but<00:03:48.079> I

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
other hair is still a little wet but I

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.129 
other hair is still a little wet but I
can't<00:03:48.470> feel<00:03:48.829> it<00:03:48.859> if<00:03:49.310> you<00:03:50.180> touch<00:03:50.569> the<00:03:50.780> surface

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
can't feel it if you touch the surface

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.229 
can't feel it if you touch the surface
like<00:03:51.319> this<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:51.739> feels<00:03:52.069> dry<00:03:52.250> so<00:03:52.639> it's<00:03:52.819> nothing

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
like this it feels dry so it's nothing

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.449 
like this it feels dry so it's nothing
that<00:03:53.419> bothers<00:03:53.720> me<00:03:53.930> at<00:03:54.290> all<00:03:54.620> so<00:03:55.129> they<00:03:55.340> are

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
that bothers me at all so they are

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.189 
that bothers me at all so they are
simpler<00:03:55.939> to<00:03:55.970> wash<00:03:56.329> even<00:03:56.659> though<00:03:56.959> they're<00:03:57.169> a

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:57.199 
simpler to wash even though they're a

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:58.869 
simpler to wash even though they're a
little<00:03:57.409> bit<00:03:57.680> heavy<00:03:57.859> while<00:03:58.250> you're<00:03:58.549> in<00:03:58.699> the

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
little bit heavy while you're in the

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.899 
little bit heavy while you're in the
shower<00:03:59.120> but<00:03:59.479> that's<00:03:59.720> fine<00:04:00.639> making<00:04:01.639> that

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
shower but that's fine making that

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:04.240 
shower but that's fine making that
dreads<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:03.199> wool<00:04:03.530> compared<00:04:04.009> to<00:04:04.129> the

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
dreads the wool compared to the

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.699 
dreads the wool compared to the
Kanekalon<00:04:04.609> the<00:04:05.269> even<00:04:05.629> though<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:06.109> processes

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
Kanekalon the even though the processes

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.920 
Kanekalon the even though the processes
are<00:04:06.859> completely<00:04:07.579> different<00:04:08.060> it<00:04:08.479> takes<00:04:08.750> about

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
are completely different it takes about

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.559 
are completely different it takes about
the<00:04:09.109> same<00:04:09.290> amount<00:04:09.650> of<00:04:09.919> time<00:04:10.189> I<00:04:10.459> guess<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.359> wool

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
the same amount of time I guess the wool

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.180 
the same amount of time I guess the wool
is<00:04:11.870> a<00:04:12.009> little<00:04:13.009> bit<00:04:13.220> quicker<00:04:13.489> but<00:04:14.859> no<00:04:15.859> it<00:04:16.009> takes

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
is a little bit quicker but no it takes

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.539 
is a little bit quicker but no it takes
pretty<00:04:16.459> much<00:04:16.609> the<00:04:16.789> same<00:04:17.000> amount<00:04:17.329> of<00:04:17.419> time<00:04:18.519> yeah

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
pretty much the same amount of time yeah

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:20.979 
pretty much the same amount of time yeah
now<00:04:20.209> here's<00:04:20.539> the<00:04:20.630> funny<00:04:20.810> thing

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
now here's the funny thing

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.560 
now here's the funny thing
braiding<00:04:21.560> them<00:04:21.709> in<00:04:21.979> is<00:04:22.250> actually<00:04:22.909> a<00:04:23.240> little

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
braiding them in is actually a little

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.209 
braiding them in is actually a little
bit<00:04:23.779> quicker<00:04:24.020> with<00:04:24.409> the<00:04:24.440> wool<00:04:24.680> because<00:04:25.099> you

00:04:25.209 --> 00:04:25.219 
bit quicker with the wool because you

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:26.730 
bit quicker with the wool because you
get<00:04:25.400> a<00:04:25.430> better<00:04:25.490> grip<00:04:26.060> doesn't

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
get a better grip doesn't

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.550 
get a better grip doesn't
once<00:04:26.979> they're<00:04:27.220> sort<00:04:27.490> of<00:04:27.580> slippery<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:28.690> well

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
once they're sort of slippery and well

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.499 
once they're sort of slippery and well
they're<00:04:29.710> plastic<00:04:30.250> basically<00:04:30.940> it<00:04:31.090> took<00:04:31.240> me<00:04:31.389> an

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
they're plastic basically it took me an

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.300 
they're plastic basically it took me an
hour<00:04:31.690> and<00:04:31.840> a<00:04:32.020> half<00:04:32.229> to<00:04:32.500> braid<00:04:32.680> these<00:04:32.889> in<00:04:33.099> which

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
hour and a half to braid these in which

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.210 
hour and a half to braid these in which
is<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:33.460> new<00:04:33.729> record<00:04:34.349> I've<00:04:35.349> never<00:04:35.740> been<00:04:35.949> able<00:04:36.039> to

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
is a new record I've never been able to

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.800 
is a new record I've never been able to
do<00:04:36.340> that<00:04:36.520> fast<00:04:36.819> with<00:04:37.090> synthetic<00:04:37.569> dreads

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
do that fast with synthetic dreads

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.779 
do that fast with synthetic dreads
another<00:04:38.380> good<00:04:38.650> thing<00:04:38.680> about<00:04:39.009> the<00:04:39.310> wool<00:04:39.520> ones

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
another good thing about the wool ones

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.740 
another good thing about the wool ones
is<00:04:40.060> that<00:04:40.300> they<00:04:40.479> look<00:04:40.840> even<00:04:41.349> more<00:04:41.949> fake<00:04:42.750> if

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
is that they look even more fake if

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.930 
is that they look even more fake if
that's<00:04:44.139> what<00:04:44.349> you're<00:04:44.500> after<00:04:44.650> they<00:04:45.550> look<00:04:45.729> more

the fact that they're softer and lighter
in<00:05:58.180> weight<00:05:58.469> also<00:05:59.469> gives<00:05:59.740> the<00:06:00.159> wool<00:06:00.430> ones

as<00:06:04.750> much<00:06:05.190> when<00:06:06.190> you<00:06:06.280> have<00:06:06.520> especially<00:06:07.210> when

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 
as much when you have especially when

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:09.779 
as much when you have especially when
your<00:06:07.780> hair<00:06:08.050> has<00:06:08.080> just<00:06:08.740> been<00:06:09.039> had<00:06:09.400> that<00:06:09.610> the

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789 
your hair has just been had that the

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:12.689 
your hair has just been had that the
dreads<00:06:10.090> braided<00:06:10.539> in<00:06:10.889> everything<00:06:11.889> is<00:06:12.009> so<00:06:12.340> tight

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699 
dreads braided in everything is so tight

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.059 
dreads braided in everything is so tight
and<00:06:12.729> your<00:06:13.060> scalp<00:06:13.449> is<00:06:13.659> super<00:06:14.110> sensitive<00:06:14.530> so<00:06:15.009> to

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:15.069 
and your scalp is super sensitive so to

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:17.430 
and your scalp is super sensitive so to
just<00:06:15.460> gather<00:06:15.759> your<00:06:15.880> hair<00:06:16.270> in<00:06:16.479> a<00:06:16.539> ponytail<00:06:16.900> can

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
just gather your hair in a ponytail can

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.360 
just gather your hair in a ponytail can
hurt<00:06:17.740> so<00:06:18.430> bad<00:06:19.110> these<00:06:20.110> don't<00:06:20.440> hurt<00:06:20.620> as<00:06:20.830> much<00:06:20.860> I

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
hurt so bad these don't hurt as much I

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.390 
hurt so bad these don't hurt as much I
guess<00:06:21.940> goes<00:06:22.150> through<00:06:22.360> softer<00:06:22.900> and<00:06:23.319> I<00:06:23.889> don't

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
guess goes through softer and I don't

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.719 
guess goes through softer and I don't
know<00:06:24.639> they<00:06:25.449> don't<00:06:25.750> hurt<00:06:25.960> as<00:06:26.139> much<00:06:26.550> so<00:06:27.550> I<00:06:27.580> think

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 
know they don't hurt as much so I think

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:30.209 
know they don't hurt as much so I think
that's<00:06:28.210> all<00:06:28.539> the<00:06:29.020> points<00:06:29.380> that<00:06:29.680> I<00:06:29.710> wanted<00:06:30.039> to

00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:30.219

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:32.339 
that's all the points that I wanted to
make<00:06:30.430> I<00:06:30.639> still<00:06:30.909> like<00:06:31.180> synthetic<00:06:31.810> dreads<00:06:32.080> it's
