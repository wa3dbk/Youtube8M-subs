00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.330
 water that we are going to cook in a bain marie 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.439

 port this is not going to have to carry 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.670
 vanilla essence but if we are going to 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.500
 place when we have it ready 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.989

 water does not come into contact with erbol 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.059

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.600
