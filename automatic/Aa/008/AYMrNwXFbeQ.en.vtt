I<00:01:51.689> agree<00:01:52.200> with<00:01:52.229> him<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.920> one<00:01:53.100> thing<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.280> does

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
I agree with him the one thing that does

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.340 
I agree with him the one thing that does
worry<00:01:53.850> me<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.390> he<00:01:54.570> has<00:01:54.659> not<00:01:54.840> talked<00:01:55.200> to

worry me is that he has not talked to

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.709 
worry me is that he has not talked to
doug<00:01:55.500> duncan<00:01:55.890> jones<00:01:56.189> since<00:01:56.729> meeting<00:01:57.329> with<00:01:57.570> him

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
doug duncan jones since meeting with him

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.389 
doug duncan jones since meeting with him
about<00:01:57.899> more<00:01:58.290> crafting<00:01:58.740> doesn't<00:01:59.100> really<00:01:59.219> know

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
about more crafting doesn't really know

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.550 
about more crafting doesn't really know
where<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.299> movies<00:02:00.600> at<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:01.020> movie<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.380> this

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
where the movies at a movie of this

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.920 
where the movies at a movie of this
scale<00:02:01.860> i<00:02:02.189> would<00:02:02.640> assume<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:03.119> duncan<00:02:03.750> jones

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
scale i would assume that duncan jones

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.719 
scale i would assume that duncan jones
would<00:02:04.140> keep<00:02:04.409> someone<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:05.009> colin<00:02:05.280> farrell<00:02:05.579> in

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
would keep someone like colin farrell in

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.819 
would keep someone like colin farrell in
the<00:02:06.000> loop<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.780> makes<00:02:07.500> me<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.710> little

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
the loop so that makes me a little

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.310 
the loop so that makes me a little
skeptical<00:02:08.369> about<00:02:08.520> where<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.940> movies<00:02:09.209> going

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
skeptical about where the movies going

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.940 
skeptical about where the movies going
well<00:02:11.320> i<00:02:11.500> would<00:02:12.070> say<00:02:12.390> probably<00:02:13.650> like<00:02:14.650> also

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
well i would say probably like also

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.140 
well i would say probably like also
