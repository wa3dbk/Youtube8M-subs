CC assignable so if you want to put it

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.020 
CC assignable so if you want to put it
on<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.620> secondary<00:00:59.010> pedal<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.430> can<00:00:59.460> but<00:00:59.910> if<00:01:00.000> you

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
on a secondary pedal you can but if you

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.849 
on a secondary pedal you can but if you
want<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.300> put<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.600> another<00:01:01.230> switch<00:01:01.649> or

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
want to put it on another switch or

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.670 
want to put it on another switch or
button<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.399> do<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.699> as<00:01:02.879> well<00:01:03.199> you<00:01:04.199> know

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
button you can do that as well you know

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.920 
button you can do that as well you know
we<00:01:04.799> give<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.100> regular<00:01:05.460> tune<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.390> transpose

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
we give you regular tune and transpose

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.560 
we give you regular tune and transpose
buttons<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.710> then<00:01:07.920> we've<00:01:08.760> created<00:01:08.970> different

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
buttons and then we've created different

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.740 
buttons and then we've created different
velocity<00:01:10.080> shapes<00:01:10.430> you<00:01:11.430> know<00:01:11.580> for<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.479> hard

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
velocity shapes you know for like hard

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.950 
velocity shapes you know for like hard
touch<00:01:13.020> soft<00:01:13.350> touch<00:01:13.970> and<00:01:14.970> then<00:01:15.299> from<00:01:15.540> there<00:01:15.750> you

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
touch soft touch and then from there you

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.600 
touch soft touch and then from there you
know<00:01:16.049> we<00:01:16.170> added<00:01:16.439> some<00:01:16.619> different<00:01:16.740> filters<00:01:17.369> and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
know we added some different filters and

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.859 
know we added some different filters and
pans<00:01:18.200> I<00:01:19.909> really<00:01:20.909> love<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.450> poppy<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> no

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
pans I really love this poppy a no

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.620 
pans I really love this poppy a no
because<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.950> characteristic<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.360> is

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
because the characteristic of it is is

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.719 
because the characteristic of it is is
is<00:01:25.560> quite<00:01:25.740> unique

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
is quite unique

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.480 
is quite unique
it<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> Steinway<00:01:27.960> G<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.799> lot<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.159> people<00:01:29.400> have

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
it is a Steinway G a lot of people have

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.179 
it is a Steinway G a lot of people have
sampled<00:01:30.090> Steinway<00:01:30.570> DS<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.350> think<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:32.009> one

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
sampled Steinway DS but I think this one

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.429 
sampled Steinway DS but I think this one
in<00:01:32.340> particular<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.270> incredibly<00:01:34.079> special

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
in particular is incredibly special

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.679 
in particular is incredibly special
because<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.770> bite<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.280> has<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.479> low<00:01:36.659> end

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
because the bite that has on the low end

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.140 
because the bite that has on the low end
and<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.890> high<00:01:38.220> end<00:01:38.250> we<00:01:38.880> really<00:01:39.450> try<00:01:40.320> to

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
and on the high end we really try to

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.560 
and on the high end we really try to
concentrate<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:43.430> lower<00:01:44.430> soft<00:01:44.850> velocities

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
concentrate on the lower soft velocities

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.069 
concentrate on the lower soft velocities
and<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.799> upper<00:01:47.490> heavy<00:01:47.729> velocities

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
and the upper heavy velocities

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.560 
and the upper heavy velocities
I<00:01:49.110> feel<00:01:49.530> like<00:01:49.710> today<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> lot<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.939> piano<00:01:51.090> sample

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
I feel like today a lot of piano sample

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.520 
I feel like today a lot of piano sample
libraries<00:01:52.049> really<00:01:52.880> missed<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.090> upper

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
libraries really missed the upper

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.969 
libraries really missed the upper
volume<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.700> piano<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.510> at<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.470> same<00:01:58.710> time

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
volume of the piano and at the same time

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.600 
volume of the piano and at the same time
don't<00:01:59.820> pay<00:02:00.030> attention<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.290> soccer<00:02:02.130> points

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
don't pay attention to the soccer points

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.550 
don't pay attention to the soccer points
which<00:02:02.760> is<00:02:02.790> one<00:02:03.690> of<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.900> things<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.259> we<00:02:04.380> did

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
which is one of the things that we did

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.109 
which is one of the things that we did
here<00:02:04.979> also<00:02:05.479> it's<00:02:06.479> very<00:02:06.600> playable<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
here also it's very playable and the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.660 
here also it's very playable and the
best<00:02:09.330> part<00:02:09.569> about<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.990> is<00:02:10.110> its<00:02:10.319> price<00:02:10.590> point

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
best part about it is its price point

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.220 
best part about it is its price point
