it<00:01:04.030> can't<00:01:04.449> manage<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:05.110> loads<00:01:05.350> properly<00:01:05.740> ok

it can't manage the loads properly ok

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:09.179 
it can't manage the loads properly ok
the<00:01:06.790> idea<00:01:06.820> is<00:01:07.329> that<00:01:07.630> when<00:01:08.290> you<00:01:08.350> have<00:01:08.530> an<00:01:08.680> impact

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
the idea is that when you have an impact

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:10.920 
the idea is that when you have an impact
none<00:01:09.579> of<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.759> load<00:01:10.000> is<00:01:10.270> going<00:01:10.750> to<00:01:10.810> be

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
none of the load is going to be

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.190 
none of the load is going to be
transferred<00:01:11.500> to<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:12.490> neck<00:01:13.210> ok<00:01:13.780> you<00:01:13.840> want<00:01:14.080> to

transferred to the neck ok you want to

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.649 
transferred to the neck ok you want to
push<00:01:14.770> to<00:01:15.100> different<00:01:15.430> parts<00:01:15.700> of<00:01:15.760> the<00:01:15.850> body<00:01:16.000> to

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
we're looking for with fit here is if I

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.390 
we're looking for with fit here is if I
go<00:01:56.979> to<00:01:57.040> pull<00:01:57.310> this<00:01:58.229> forward<00:01:59.229> and<00:01:59.500> backwards<00:01:59.950> it

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
go to pull this forward and backwards it

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.950 
go to pull this forward and backwards it
needs<00:02:00.729> to<00:02:00.939> be<00:02:01.060> tight<00:02:01.299> you<00:02:01.390> can't<00:02:01.630> have<00:02:01.840> it

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
needs to be tight you can't have it

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.170 
needs to be tight you can't have it
pulling<00:02:02.229> away<00:02:02.470> from<00:02:02.619> his<00:02:02.950> chest<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.549> having<00:02:04.119> a

point we have to force it down literally

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:18.420 
point we have to force it down literally
when<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:17.980> just

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
levels right you can easily remove that

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.289 
levels right you can easily remove that
first<00:02:29.290> level<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:30.040> get<00:02:30.159> to<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.400> second<00:02:30.790> one<00:02:30.879> at

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
first level to get to the second one at

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.520 
first level to get to the second one at
the<00:02:31.480> end<00:02:31.599> of<00:02:31.689> the<00:02:31.750> day<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:31.930> just<00:02:32.230> want<00:02:32.439> that

the end of the day you just want that

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.979 
the end of the day you just want that
touching<00:02:33.099> his<00:02:33.549> tracks<00:02:33.939> okay<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.689> this<00:02:34.780> one

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
touching his tracks okay and this one

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.710 
touching his tracks okay and this one
literally<00:02:35.319> fits<00:02:35.650> in<00:02:35.859> spot<00:02:36.220> drop<00:02:36.849> it<00:02:37.000> on<00:02:37.120> the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
literally fits in spot drop it on the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.349 
literally fits in spot drop it on the
thing<00:02:37.959> is<00:02:38.079> basically<00:02:38.560> right<00:02:39.459> there<00:02:39.760> okay<00:02:40.299> so

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
you can tune that yourself the idea is

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.360 
you can tune that yourself the idea is
to<00:02:43.120> have<00:02:43.239> it<00:02:43.420> just<00:02:43.689> touching<00:02:44.290> in<00:02:44.439> that<00:02:45.040> area

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
to have it just touching in that area

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
first area we're going to see somewhere

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.189 
first area we're going to see somewhere
is<00:03:36.579> going<00:03:37.000> to<00:03:37.120> be<00:03:37.269> on<00:03:37.419> this<00:03:37.599> lower<00:03:37.870> portion

is going to be on this lower portion

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:40.289 
is going to be on this lower portion
okay<00:03:38.769> it's<00:03:39.190> got<00:03:39.340> some<00:03:39.519> energy<00:03:39.849> absorbing

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
okay it's got some energy absorbing

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.240 
okay it's got some energy absorbing
material<00:03:40.780> built<00:03:40.959> into<00:03:41.319> it<00:03:41.440> right<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:41.829> this

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
of it this is this is work here at the

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.200 
of it this is this is work here at the
back<00:04:30.190> and<00:04:31.030> you<00:04:31.210> can<00:04:32.020> see<00:04:32.370> this<00:04:33.370> material<00:04:33.940> here

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
back and you can see this material here

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.560 
back and you can see this material here
is<00:04:34.419> meant<00:04:35.110> to<00:04:35.320> compress<00:04:36.040> and<00:04:36.220> collapse<00:04:36.610> in<00:04:36.910> the

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
is meant to compress and collapse in the

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.909 
is meant to compress and collapse in the
event<00:04:37.870> of<00:04:38.860> a<00:04:39.010> strong<00:04:39.280> impact<00:04:40.200> if<00:04:41.200> that<00:04:41.500> is<00:04:41.740> not

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
event of a strong impact if that is not

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.800 
event of a strong impact if that is not
enough<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.430> impact<00:04:42.730> is<00:04:42.940> really<00:04:42.970> severe<00:04:43.540> it

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
enough the impact is really severe it

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.240 
enough the impact is really severe it
gets<00:04:43.990> up<00:04:44.169> into<00:04:44.260> this<00:04:44.470> second<00:04:44.860> level<00:04:45.010> of<00:04:45.190> the

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
gets up into this second level of the

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.450 
gets up into this second level of the
brace<00:04:45.490> and<00:04:46.139> like<00:04:47.139> I<00:04:47.230> said<00:04:47.440> even<00:04:47.590> possibly<00:04:48.160> up

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
brace and like I said even possibly up

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.430 
brace and like I said even possibly up
another<00:04:49.000> third<00:04:49.300> level<00:04:49.660> here<00:04:49.840> that's<00:04:50.230> going<00:04:50.350> to

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
another third level here that's going to

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.320 
another third level here that's going to
be<00:04:50.500> as<00:04:50.680> I<00:04:51.070> understand<00:04:51.580> it<00:04:51.669> four<00:04:51.820> more<00:04:51.970> kind<00:04:52.300> of

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
be as I understand it four more kind of

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.850 
be as I understand it four more kind of
a<00:04:52.419> twisting<00:04:52.870> to<00:04:53.050> can<00:04:53.260> kind<00:04:53.440> of<00:04:53.530> get<00:04:53.650> to<00:04:53.770> this

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
a twisting to can kind of get to this

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.580 
a twisting to can kind of get to this
white<00:04:54.130> piece<00:04:57.540> where<00:04:58.540> it<00:04:58.630> contacts<00:04:59.140> your<00:04:59.320> chest

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
white piece where it contacts your chest

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.830 
white piece where it contacts your chest
it<00:05:00.160> uses<00:05:00.460> that<00:05:00.610> same<00:05:00.880> type<00:05:01.210> of<00:05:01.240> material<00:05:01.480> to

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
it uses that same type of material to

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.500 
it uses that same type of material to
help<00:05:01.960> manage<00:05:02.470> that<00:05:02.680> low<00:05:02.890> okay<00:05:03.640> think<00:05:04.390> that

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
help manage that low okay think that

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.330 
help manage that low okay think that
almost<00:05:04.870> the<00:05:04.960> it's<00:05:05.680> similar<00:05:05.950> to<00:05:06.070> the<00:05:06.220> way<00:05:06.310> a

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
almost the it's similar to the way a

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.740 
almost the it's similar to the way a
piece<00:05:06.550> of<00:05:06.730> body<00:05:06.910> armor<00:05:07.210> is<00:05:07.360> going<00:05:07.510> to<00:05:07.570> work

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
piece of body armor is going to work

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.380 
piece of body armor is going to work
right<00:05:08.050> the<00:05:08.710> idea<00:05:09.010> is<00:05:09.190> as<00:05:09.400> it<00:05:10.000> begins<00:05:10.210> to

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
right the idea is as it begins to

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.530 
right the idea is as it begins to
compress<00:05:10.660> it<00:05:10.930> really<00:05:11.110> dissipates<00:05:11.710> the<00:05:11.890> load

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
compress it really dissipates the load

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.630 
compress it really dissipates the load
same<00:05:13.540> thing<00:05:13.810> little<00:05:14.500> firmer<00:05:14.770> here<00:05:15.070> up<00:05:15.310> in<00:05:15.580> the

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
same thing little firmer here up in the

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.760 
same thing little firmer here up in the
shoulder<00:05:16.000> area<00:05:16.030> this<00:05:16.390> is<00:05:16.770> metamorphosizing

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
shoulder area this is metamorphosizing

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.090 
shoulder area this is metamorphosizing
to<00:05:17.860> get<00:05:17.979> the<00:05:18.070> thing<00:05:18.280> to<00:05:18.370> sit<00:05:18.580> on<00:05:18.700> you<00:05:18.850> properly

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
to get the thing to sit on you properly
