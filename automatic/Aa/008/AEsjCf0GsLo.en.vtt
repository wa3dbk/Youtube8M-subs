 quite healthy very rich very very rich not 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.060
 very tasty cheers ingredients 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.349
 for this recipe we will use 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:30.590
 salt and pepper to taste 2 beaten eggs 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:33.850
 2 chicken slices a cup of 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.739
 breaded oil the amount needed 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.559
 2 tablespoons of olive oil per 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.019
 apart a quarter cup of shallots 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.949
 finely chopped 4 cloves of garlic 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.260
 filleted half a cup of white wine 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:50.839
 three quarters back of chicken broth 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.629
 2 lemons only juice 2 tablespoons 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:57.260
 drained capers and 3 tablespoons of 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.149
 chopped parsley let's use 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.730
 let's put the first one here to warm up 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.820
 and a pan 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.250
 because I want to give you two options one 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.800
 that will be low in fat and the other that 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.369
 it's going to be by the traditional then 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.740
 we go first of all to season our 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.870
 our chicken schnitzel will 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.440
 put him here 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.440
 Salt 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.960
 and pepper on one side and now on the other 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.420
 on the other side then let's put a 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:34.230
 little egg that was already in this case 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:37.250
 it's already beaten and we're going to buy it 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:40.800
 from both sides so that it fits 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.630
 covered in egg 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.720
 when they handle eggs I 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.570
 I recommend that you wash your hands well 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.020
 because the egg then sometimes is one is 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.880
 very easy to transmit bacteria to 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.730
 other foods then if it's good 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.220
 have a special hygiene when you 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.970
 manipulates the egg the fish and the chicken 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.990
 raw 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.390
 when they move on to something else and now we're going to 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.479
 add some bread 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.510
 grind let's put some oil 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.420
 olive a little here now the option 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.230
 1 is to put the traditional Milanese as 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.780
 goes here in the pan and option 2 is 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.720
 put that they prefer to put it in the oven that 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.080
 sea light let's do it we're going to 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.230
 make me kill me or not mess with my 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.230
 pots 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.540
 let's put our chicken in the oven like that 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.819
 how's it going 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.080
 a little more bread 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.330
 yes 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.530
 a little bit more of this and we 're going to 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.409
 to put 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:55.129
 baked 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:57.530
 to that solito go away doran good 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.599
 aside let's put a chicken because a 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.130
 little more extra virgin olive oil 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.410
 and we are going to put 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.220
 the made lots 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:12.650
 that can also be purple onion 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:16.150
 to brown a little together with the garlic 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.150
 much under the 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.690
 let's add now that if you're 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.690
 a little bit more golden 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:33.860
 but we're not going to let there reduce a 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.870
 little bit 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.870
 let's see how it goes to our Milanese 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.220
 you with that is already ready 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.670
 and we are going to leave it now yes to 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.520
 start to boil a little 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.970
 and I start reading rich 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.190
 here you still do not have to salt the salt 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.140
 is cast after you put the consommé 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.270
 because if you can not go beyond the 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.870
 food there is wolf to remove the salt to 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.070
 the food has a well proven the the 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.630
 put the potatoes to see if the 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.680
 they absorb the salt 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:13.530
 I already induce myself 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.900
 it happened to me I was in a final exam 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.380
 and I missed a milk thing 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.590
 potatoes better I started doing it again already 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:27.040
 is boiling let's add now yes 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.530
 a little bit of caldito already of your preference 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.210
 of rd of chicken of vegetables does not matter 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:36.410
 let's add a little lemon juice 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.410
 and capers 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:41.779
 a little capers and also parsley 

00:04:39.829 --> 00:04:43.129
 that in this case you can also add 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:45.589
 with the grass of your preference 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:47.569
 this cilantro can be 

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:50.899
 also albacán that would be delicious 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:55.449
 with basil, if it seems to me, let's see 

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:55.449

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.720
 in that 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.240
 let's let this boil there goes 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.600
 little by little losses that have a 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.830
 very rich dish with a sauce 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.090

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.520
