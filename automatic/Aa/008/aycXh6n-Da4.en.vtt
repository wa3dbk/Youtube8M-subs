00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 Hi girls, how are you? I'm here for today. 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:10.679
 give a nice and good nail tip 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:14.009
 practice of doing that is subject here is 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.529
 the third of the rosary is super 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.580
 delicate and how well you 'll see 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.420
 simple 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.340
 So I wanted to explain since here to 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.880
 make the balls of the rosary 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.779
 I used is the tite to caviar in tone 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.770
 golden I used the golden tone o kit that 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:42.930
 I had applied the base to go through 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:46.620
 above is the treatment without a base guga 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:51.000
 common and the enamel I used underneath 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.100
 was risking crystal vigilantes and 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.780
 It feels like it has a 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.780
 holographic so I liked it I found that 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.730
 It was interesting, I thought I stepped 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.920
 step student stayed very well 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.199
 so I hope you can understand 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.890
 repeating itself in the television idea that 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.890
 It was not very cool. 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.290
 so I'll leave the nail ready 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.640
 is 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:45.260
 So how can you see with the toothpick? 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.260
 work is fine but not included 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.180
 is more practical 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.660
 look that 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:25.120
 then we are ready Rosarinho 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.120
 I'm going to end on the basis of 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.980
 to fix the balls 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:50.040
 before 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.840
 super fast and very delicate 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.220
 Good, so I hope you have succeeded. 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.930
 to understand right? 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.349
 I hope you enjoyed it too. 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.890
 Tip it is a small video you can not understand 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.180
 As well as it is, but if you try 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.260
 you will see that it will be well 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.290
 cool 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.030
 It's a very delicate thing, is not it? 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.489
