00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
see it in red but me people it's just

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.660 
see it in red but me people it's just
annoying<00:00:58.670> at<00:00:59.030> getting<00:00:59.359> stared<00:00:59.749> up<00:01:00.129> just<00:01:01.129> makes

disorder<00:01:06.979> wasn't<00:01:07.280> obvious<00:01:07.670> at<00:01:07.760> birth<00:01:08.030> but

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
disorder wasn't obvious at birth but

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.270 
disorder wasn't obvious at birth but
once<00:01:08.690> it<00:01:08.870> was<00:01:09.020> identified<00:01:09.230> doctors<00:01:10.130> have

valuable insights into the whole aging

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.720 
valuable insights into the whole aging
process<00:01:14.780> we're<00:01:15.560> learning<00:01:15.710> about<00:01:16.160> the

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
process we're learning about the

mechanisms that may be involved in aging

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.510 
mechanisms that may be involved in aging
and<00:01:18.590> if<00:01:18.650> we<00:01:18.710> can<00:01:18.830> understand<00:01:19.310> those

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
and if we can understand those

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.330 
and if we can understand those
mechanisms<00:01:20.090> then<00:01:20.960> we<00:01:21.440> able<00:01:21.830> to<00:01:21.920> just<00:01:22.100> try<00:01:22.280> and

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
mechanisms then we able to just try and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.640 
mechanisms then we able to just try and
also<00:01:23.270> those<00:01:23.360> mechanisms<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:24.260> stop<00:01:24.530> the

disease progressing but also it should
have<00:01:26.510> an<00:01:26.600> impact<00:01:26.840> on<00:01:27.020> aging<00:01:27.410> what<00:01:27.800> the<00:01:27.920> future

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
have an impact on aging what the future

holds for Harry himself is harder to
predict<00:01:30.530> currently<00:01:31.340> there<00:01:31.610> is<00:01:31.640> no<00:01:31.790> cure<00:01:32.390> and

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
predict currently there is no cure and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.470 
predict currently there is no cure and
his<00:01:32.990> rapid<00:01:33.350> aging<00:01:33.560> cannot<00:01:34.130> be<00:01:34.370> halted<00:01:34.790> it<00:01:35.240> has

his rapid aging cannot be halted it has
been<00:01:35.660> tough<00:01:35.930> without<00:01:36.230> our<00:01:36.560> tears<00:01:36.950> but<00:01:37.160> and

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
been tough without our tears but and

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.820 
been tough without our tears but and
obviously<00:01:38.570> would<00:01:38.720> just<00:01:38.870> take<00:01:39.080> each<00:01:39.320> day<00:01:39.650> as<00:01:39.680> it

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
obviously would just take each day as it

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.580 
obviously would just take each day as it
comes<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.520> let<00:01:41.210> having<00:01:41.540> live<00:01:41.750> life<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:42.560> the
