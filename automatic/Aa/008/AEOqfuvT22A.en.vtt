00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.680
 let's make a toy dispenser 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:09.730
 for dogs are we going to we need to 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.040
 so a bottle of a soda gives 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.140
 just be a little hard plastic 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.130
 Well, to prevent the animal from breaking it 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:23.320
 very fast a piece of string more or 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.430
 less than 70 centimeters a pair of scissors and 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.570
 a knife 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.800
 the soda bottle can be 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.770
 depending on the size of the dog so what 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.580
 smallest largest medium then 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.290
 It is simple we will take the bottle 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.809
 we will clean the drain, we will leave it 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.320
 drain off water and then we will remove it 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.320
 the plug 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.250
 once this is done 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.830
 let's take it and let's make it three 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.340
 cuts so depends if it's not the 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.500
 first time our dog plays with 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.970
 this type of toys has been played before 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.470
 more or less knows how the story goes and 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.630
 is going to be able to center then with two 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.910
 holes in the bottom part we 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.830
 it will be enough if it is the first time it is better 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.920
 make three so you do not lose the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.920
 interest 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.580
 one 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.100
 two 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.890
 and three 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.070
 let's do it like a dog what 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.070
 we connect now what stands out 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.080
 avoiding leaving leaving tips that 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.980
 can damage we take the rope the 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.980
 we introduce here 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.650
 and we take it out through one of the holes and 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.209
 we have said that in the event that the 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.490
 personal be a novice in this type of 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.140
 game can be done only with 2 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.140
 It would be a knot in this area 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.450
 well once done this as 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.450
 we can check 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.489
 we would introduce the prizes in this case 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.489
 I think 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.260
 who usually eat 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.409
 good therefore in smaller cachitos 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.379
 but you can not enter any 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:09.180
 kind of prize on everything is dry because 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.040
 if it is very wet it can get stuck 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.079
 guy sausages towards the walls and just 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.240
 it drives them crazy because this would be the 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.510
 toy 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.270
 we have here a smaller one than in this 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.950
 case is empty 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.950
 I think what to do is to use it 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.530
 I do not know if I have 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.790
 A) Yes 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.970
 here we have one of my dogs that is going to 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.200
 use the cabbage have a 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.200
 and there it is 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.170
 i
