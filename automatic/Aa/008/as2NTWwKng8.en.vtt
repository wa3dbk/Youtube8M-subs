right i would i would think something

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.509 
right i would i would think something
along<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.810> lines<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.140> how<00:00:25.710> many<00:00:25.949> people<00:00:26.310> buy

is<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.500> what<00:00:34.710> i<00:00:34.739> call<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.309> dichotomy<00:00:36.030> of

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
is this is what i call the dichotomy of

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.330 
is this is what i call the dichotomy of
being<00:00:36.270> huge<00:00:36.899> okay<00:00:37.620> amazon<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.309> a

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
being huge okay amazon is a

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.160 
being huge okay amazon is a
multi-billion<00:00:39.210> dollar<00:00:39.540> company<00:00:39.930> i<00:00:39.989> think

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
multi-billion dollar company i think

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.990 
multi-billion dollar company i think
it's<00:00:40.290> 61<00:00:40.620> billion<00:00:41.010> dollars<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.610> year<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.910> they

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
it's 61 billion dollars a year that they

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.360 
it's 61 billion dollars a year that they
do<00:00:42.059> right<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.989> economy<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.680> being<00:00:43.950> huge<00:00:44.219> is

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
do right so the economy of being huge is

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.549 
do right so the economy of being huge is
the<00:00:44.579> bigger<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.969> are<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.210> more<00:00:45.750> problems<00:00:46.260> you

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the bigger you are the more problems you

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.830 
the bigger you are the more problems you
have<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.770> your<00:00:46.980> business<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:48.000> weird<00:00:48.300> but

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
because it'll be the bigger you are the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.860 
because it'll be the bigger you are the
more<00:00:50.250> opportunity<00:00:51.000> there<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.270> for<00:00:51.390> things<00:00:51.780> to

the main key metric seems to be what's

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.770 
the main key metric seems to be what's
called<00:01:06.390> conversion<00:01:07.200> rate<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.280> Amazon<00:01:09.150> then
