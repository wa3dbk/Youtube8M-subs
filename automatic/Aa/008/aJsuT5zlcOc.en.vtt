started<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.190> channel<00:02:49.310> out<00:02:49.580> was<00:02:49.940> just<00:02:50.300> I

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
started the channel out was just I

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.780 
started the channel out was just I
thought<00:02:52.010> there<00:02:52.160> was<00:02:52.250> some<00:02:52.400> key<00:02:52.760> things

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
thought there was some key things

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.610 
thought there was some key things
missing<00:02:53.420> that<00:02:53.630> most<00:02:53.810> players<00:02:54.020> didn't<00:02:54.320> realize

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
missing that most players didn't realize

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.610 
missing that most players didn't realize
namely<00:02:55.100> our<00:02:55.390> little<00:02:56.390> tagline<00:02:56.660> I<00:02:56.960> created

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
namely our little tagline I created

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.580 
namely our little tagline I created
strategy<00:02:58.310> teamwork<00:02:58.790> yesh<00:02:59.440> most<00:03:00.440> players

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
strategy teamwork yesh most players

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.010 
strategy teamwork yesh most players
don't<00:03:00.770> mess<00:03:01.490> with<00:03:01.700> strategy<00:03:02.150> or<00:03:02.330> teamwork<00:03:02.750> and

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
don't mess with strategy or teamwork and

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.470 
don't mess with strategy or teamwork and
I<00:03:03.050> think<00:03:03.860> it's<00:03:03.980> most<00:03:04.790> important<00:03:05.150> things<00:03:05.300> in

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
I think it's most important things in

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.740 
I think it's most important things in
any<00:03:05.600> first-person<00:03:06.500> shooter<00:03:06.740> game<00:03:07.010> that<00:03:07.750> you

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
any first-person shooter game that you

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.790 
any first-person shooter game that you
could<00:03:08.900> be<00:03:09.020> a<00:03:09.050> lot<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.260> teams<00:03:09.560> that<00:03:09.650> are

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
could be a lot of teams that are

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.010 
could be a lot of teams that are
technically<00:03:10.490> better<00:03:10.790> than<00:03:11.060> you<00:03:11.270> if<00:03:11.720> you<00:03:11.810> just

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
technically better than you if you just

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.300 
technically better than you if you just
stop<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.320> think<00:03:12.350> for<00:03:12.590> a<00:03:12.710> minute<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.070> mingo

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
stop and think for a minute and mingo

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.740 
stop and think for a minute and mingo
maybe<00:03:13.460> call<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:13.790> your<00:03:13.970> buddies<00:03:14.240> and<00:03:14.420> work

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
maybe call it your buddies and work

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.260 
maybe call it your buddies and work
together<00:03:14.930> on<00:03:15.170> it<00:03:15.320> so<00:03:15.650> I<00:03:15.890> thought<00:03:16.550> that<00:03:16.760> was<00:03:16.940> an

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
together on it so I thought that was an

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.970 
together on it so I thought that was an
idea<00:03:17.630> that<00:03:17.690> would<00:03:17.930> help<00:03:18.080> a<00:03:18.230> lot<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.410> people<00:03:18.500> so

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
idea that would help a lot of people so

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.890 
idea that would help a lot of people so
I<00:03:19.010> started<00:03:19.370> making<00:03:19.970> videos<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.510> this<00:03:20.600> channel

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
I started making videos of this channel

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.050 
I started making videos of this channel
and<00:03:21.080> putting<00:03:21.650> tutorials<00:03:22.280> together<00:03:22.610> on<00:03:22.850> things

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
and putting tutorials together on things

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.010 
and putting tutorials together on things
that<00:03:23.270> I<00:03:23.630> was<00:03:24.170> at<00:03:24.290> least<00:03:24.380> sort<00:03:24.770> of<00:03:24.950> good<00:03:25.160> at<00:03:25.190> and

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
that I was at least sort of good at and

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.320 
that I was at least sort of good at and
it's<00:03:27.020> really<00:03:27.350> just<00:03:27.470> grown<00:03:27.910> bigger<00:03:28.910> than<00:03:29.209> I
