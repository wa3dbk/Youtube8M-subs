00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.170 

making<00:01:43.890> sure<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.160> it's<00:01:44.310> evenly<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
making sure that it's evenly in the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.469 
making sure that it's evenly in the
middle<00:01:45.420> as<00:01:45.570> possible

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
middle as possible
