if we chose to fly this aircraft with

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
one pilot we could have done it just

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.510

following<00:04:18.480> the<00:04:18.570> guidance<00:04:18.780> of<00:04:19.080> the<00:04:19.170> FAA<00:04:19.530> but

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
following the guidance of the FAA but

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.100 
following the guidance of the FAA but
instead<00:04:20.910> we<00:04:21.150> looked<00:04:21.390> at<00:04:21.540> it<00:04:21.720> gained<00:04:21.989> the

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
instead we looked at it gained the

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.990 
instead we looked at it gained the
operational<00:04:22.740> experience<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:23.400> realized<00:04:23.790> that

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
operational experience and realized that

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.760 
operational experience and realized that
you<00:04:24.600> really<00:04:24.630> should<00:04:25.110> do<00:04:25.260> this<00:04:25.440> with<00:04:25.650> two

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
you really should do this with two

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.100 
you really should do this with two
pilots<00:04:25.950> it's<00:04:26.790> a<00:04:26.940> safer<00:04:27.330> way<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:27.480> operate<00:04:27.990> the

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
pilots it's a safer way to operate the

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.440 
pilots it's a safer way to operate the
aircraft<00:04:28.590> it<00:04:28.950> is<00:04:29.250> something<00:04:29.610> that<00:04:29.760> everyone

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
aircraft it is something that everyone

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.530

that's<00:04:30.570> flying<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:31.020> new<00:04:31.140> aw139<00:04:31.860> s<00:04:32.310> do<00:04:32.460> so<00:04:33.150> we

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
that's flying the new aw139 s do so we

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.390 
that's flying the new aw139 s do so we
made<00:04:33.840> that<00:04:34.050> conscious<00:04:34.320> decision<00:04:34.530> that<00:04:35.070> it<00:04:35.250> was

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
made that conscious decision that it was

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.390 
made that conscious decision that it was
best<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.270> fly<00:04:36.450> with<00:04:36.750> two<00:04:36.870> pilots<00:04:37.260> there's<00:04:38.160> been

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
best to fly with two pilots there's been

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.070 
best to fly with two pilots there's been
questions<00:04:38.940> of<00:04:39.330> whether<00:04:39.630> we<00:04:39.870> should<00:04:39.900> have

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
questions of whether we should have

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.040 
questions of whether we should have
refurbished<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.920> dolphin<00:04:41.400> fleet<00:04:42.050> to

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
refurbished the dolphin fleet to

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.360 
refurbished the dolphin fleet to
refurbish<00:04:43.830> a<00:04:44.600> dolphin<00:04:45.600> aircraft<00:04:46.230> it<00:04:47.160> would

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
refurbish a dolphin aircraft it would

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.160 
refurbish a dolphin aircraft it would
have<00:04:47.460> cost<00:04:47.730> us<00:04:48.000> close<00:04:48.330> to<00:04:48.540> a<00:04:48.570> hundred<00:04:48.900> and

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
have cost us close to a hundred and

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.500 
have cost us close to a hundred and
fifty<00:04:49.530> million<00:04:49.770> dollars<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.700> refurbish<00:04:51.090> an

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
fifty million dollars to refurbish an

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.720 
fifty million dollars to refurbish an
aircraft<00:04:52.050> to<00:04:52.410> the<00:04:52.530> standards<00:04:52.980> that<00:04:53.070> we<00:04:53.340> wanted

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
aircraft to the standards that we wanted

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.240 
aircraft to the standards that we wanted
and<00:04:53.910> it<00:04:54.540> would<00:04:54.660> only<00:04:54.870> had<00:04:55.230> eighty<00:04:55.500> percent<00:04:55.980> of

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
and it would only had eighty percent of

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.520 
and it would only had eighty percent of
their<00:04:56.880> requirements<00:04:57.570> that<00:04:57.720> were<00:04:57.840> recommended

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
their requirements that were recommended

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.910 
their requirements that were recommended
so<00:04:59.070> if<00:04:59.760> you<00:05:00.300> look<00:05:00.510> at<00:05:00.630> it<00:05:00.750> in<00:05:00.870> that<00:05:01.020> sense<00:05:01.470> we

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
so if you look at it in that sense we

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.190 
so if you look at it in that sense we
actually<00:05:02.250> save<00:05:02.490> money<00:05:02.760> buying<00:05:03.600> new<00:05:03.900> and

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
actually save money buying new and

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.590 
actually save money buying new and
getting<00:05:04.980> the<00:05:05.070> latest<00:05:05.280> safety<00:05:06.050> enhancements

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
getting the latest safety enhancements

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.030 
getting the latest safety enhancements
we're<00:05:09.600> always<00:05:09.690> looking<00:05:09.930> to<00:05:10.320> keep<00:05:10.500> safety<00:05:10.830> in

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
we're always looking to keep safety in

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.520 
we're always looking to keep safety in
the<00:05:11.310> forefront<00:05:11.730> of<00:05:12.000> everything<00:05:12.540> we<00:05:12.840> do<00:05:13.050> it's
