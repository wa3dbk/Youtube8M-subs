00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.799
 we found with front kingfisher 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 of the cougars martÃ­n thank you 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.150
 time and you can ask yourself not about this 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.090
 respite that gives the cup game 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.179
 It serves for trust as tele if 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.130
 it's always important to win is in a way 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.990
 that has been in the cup this a triumph 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.260
 the truth that the mood is very good 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.500
 this after several weeks of not 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.590
 win this league I think it comes very 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.939
 good for trust this mood and 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.269
 good to work obviously much more 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.269
 quiet 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.070
 yes yes yes to everything it serves either 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.890
 we're going to do that it's nothing, it's not 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.809
 can nothing is an important step this 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.719
 has a prize that anyone 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.219
 I would like to have then obviously the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.890
 main objective was the league to 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.559
 qualify today is a bit far 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.480
 this and there is no other good than 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.969
 get them the most points that are good 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.140
 league and try to keep going on in the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.940
 Cup 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.559
 records on a couple of occasions you 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.690
 touched live the glory with this team not 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.010
 I could say you're living part of 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.650
 clean up nation 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.780
 yes yes yes the truth that these moments 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.150
 they are the worst I've ever lived in cougars 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.210
 he had touched me they never saw a moment 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.790
 well this is good and what we know 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.870
 not that we did not win at 11 dates ago and 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.600
 good that the team comes bad this and yes 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.040
 good always happens not in spite of the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.260
 good times or championships that we have 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.670
 gotta also come these are you 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.530
 bitter things I did not say that too 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.270
 know them take to know out of these 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.710
 wells and well I think that in these 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.870
 moments where one has to take the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.000
 forces and prove to us that we are in 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.840
 a great team and good pulls his face out 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.840
 that team that is cougars 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.280
 yes yes yes I believe that it is not the true 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.320
 swollen or true fiction or good 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.580
 encourage does not come to insult or to 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.320
 say nothing I think the people that 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.840
 feel the colors of pumas and that is a 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.750
 true fan this always comes to 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.820
 encourage this those who are not or those who 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.550
 come to fucking this is I prefer not to 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.610
 come not what better stay in their homes 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.340
 this obviously the team no no is not 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.530
 well this and nevertheless although in the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.450
 bitch I think it does not help anyone this 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.100
 So the important thing is now is that 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.840
 let's all be together that the team 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.100
 feel the support of the fans that 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.270
 we also take ourselves 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.680
 demonstrate inside the court that 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.630
 we can change this situation and good 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.280
 we did it on Wednesday the forgiveness the 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.110
 Tuesday in the cup and well now we are going to 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.380
 Search do well on Saturday 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.380
 monterrey 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.060
 after the technical change change of 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.739
 directive followed the players who 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.960
 you see like that it's time that he felt 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.640
 is to evaluate 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.170
 I believe that all the time they have us 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.000
 to evaluate us all the time 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.980
 we have to be demanded all the time 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.320
 have to be seeing how we 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.370
 we develop in the field is not a matter 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.080
 that now because there is a new technician 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.490
 a directive have to evaluate not me 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.050
 I think I 'm from the idea that always 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.380
 always the player has to be in 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.410
 continuous vision this obviously for the 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.430
 development of one personally for 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.920
 obviously always be our best 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.330
 level east and obviously also of 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.580
 requirement if there is not no good has 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.580
 to come another player or play other 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.210
 players then that's one thing 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.210
 normal 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.430
 I have not had a good tournament the truth 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.020
 I am sincere and self-critical this leads 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.980
 barely two goals would have to have 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.319
 many more 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.750
 but good personally I have not 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.360
 felt good for nothing with the team with 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.670
 what are we doing this but I think 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.709
 that also this is part of all 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.500
 I do not think anyone is at their best 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.049
 level this nobody is playing like 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.310
 I would like to and we have already done it well 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.230
 seen in all the matches that we've 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.410
 played I think nobody has shown their 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.930
 better face and good I'm looking for that 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.849
 of retaking my level of retaking the 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.680
 confidence that I had before and good from 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.430
 try to collaborate a little more with 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.750
 goals 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.530
 the people me because I think I wanted the 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.530
 arguments are 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:07.880
 still say something just thank you 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.340
 because I always like I say well encourage 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.870
 I believe that pumas is the best hobby of 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.040
 Mexico are always supporting all 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.810
 this time there is only a small group something 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.079
 that is obviously disappointed novi is 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.630
 normal but the great the great mass of 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.570
 Cougars is always encouraging and giving 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.650
 this good cheer then thank you 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.540
 thank you for the support we are 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.070
 taking from them this and asking them to 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.260
 continue so do not lower the 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.060
 arms that we obviously know what 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.060
 they feel that sadness or pain 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.680
 what do we have that we feel 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.440
 equal or worse than them because we live it 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.300
 well inside then do not believe that 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.979
 neither does it pass us by above is not 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.960
 bad because more to us is not worth not 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.220
 worth nothing not then not not like that 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.810
 we like the worst thing that hurts 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.340
 them and good is to ask them to continue 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.660
 the same way encouraging as always and 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.660
 good to keep coming to the stadium
