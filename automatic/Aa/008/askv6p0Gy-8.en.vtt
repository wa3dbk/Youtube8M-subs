and<00:00:19.619> if<00:00:20.310> that's<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.930> I'm<00:00:21.930> holding<00:00:22.289> what<00:00:22.980> I

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
and if that's you I'm holding what I

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.349 
and if that's you I'm holding what I
consider<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.580> be<00:00:23.699> one<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.119> greatest

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.120 
outfits rod reel and line to get the job
done<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.320> probably<00:00:28.619> think<00:00:28.920> I'm<00:00:29.010> gonna

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
done so you probably think I'm gonna

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.250 
done so you probably think I'm gonna
start<00:00:29.369> talking<00:00:29.699> about<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.000> fly<00:00:30.210> rod<00:00:30.420> first<00:00:30.720> in

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
start talking about the fly rod first in

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.229 
start talking about the fly rod first in
fact<00:00:31.529> I'll<00:00:31.769> start<00:00:32.040> with<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.250> fly<00:00:32.460> line<00:00:32.700> the

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
fact I'll start with the fly line the

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.819 
fact I'll start with the fly line the
reason<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.780> when<00:00:34.050> your<00:00:34.170> nymph<00:00:34.380> fishing

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
reason is when your nymph fishing

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.190 
reason is when your nymph fishing
commonly<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.640> have<00:00:35.790> some<00:00:36.090> indicator<00:00:36.690> some

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
commonly you have some indicator some

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.770 
commonly you have some indicator some
extra<00:00:37.500> weight<00:00:37.649> split<00:00:38.250> shot<00:00:38.489> or<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.570> maybe

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
extra weight split shot or so and maybe

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.900 
extra weight split shot or so and maybe
a<00:00:39.870> couple<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.320> larger<00:00:40.649> flies<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.280> all<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.879> that

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
a couple of larger flies and all of that

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.720 
a couple of larger flies and all of that
equals<00:00:42.360> more<00:00:43.020> mass<00:00:43.379> more<00:00:43.710> weight<00:00:44.129> or<00:00:44.430> wind

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
equals more mass more weight or wind

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.610 
equals more mass more weight or wind
resistance<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.379> got<00:00:46.530> to

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
resistance and so on and you got to

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.200 
resistance and so on and you got to
remember<00:00:46.739> one<00:00:47.010> thing<00:00:47.070> about<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.460> fly<00:00:47.700> line<00:00:47.940> it's

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
remember one thing about a fly line it's

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.910 
remember one thing about a fly line it's
the<00:00:48.390> vehicle<00:00:48.629> for<00:00:49.289> delivery

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
the vehicle for delivery

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.250 
the vehicle for delivery
so<00:00:50.219> as<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.550> mass<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.760> your<00:00:51.090> fly<00:00:51.390> or<00:00:51.750> your<00:00:51.960> rig

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
so as the mass of your fly or your rig

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.529 
so as the mass of your fly or your rig
goes<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.610> too<00:00:53.670> much<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> weight<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.510> your

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
goes up so too much the weight of your

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.380 
goes up so too much the weight of your
fly<00:00:54.870> line<00:00:55.140> our<00:00:56.129> favorite<00:00:56.610> line<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.969> use<00:00:57.180> when

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
fly line our favorite line to use when

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.150

nint<00:00:57.570> fishing<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.050> made<00:00:58.230> by<00:00:58.379> airflow<00:00:58.590> it's

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
nint fishing is made by airflow it's

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.310 
nint fishing is made by airflow it's
called<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> rangefinder<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.180> yes<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.230> a

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
called the rangefinder and yes it's a

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.990 
called the rangefinder and yes it's a
seven-way<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.070> has<00:01:02.190> plenty<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.520> mass<00:01:02.789> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
seven-way so it has plenty of mass to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.700 
seven-way so it has plenty of mass to
kick<00:01:03.180> over<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> indicator<00:01:03.989> split<00:01:04.320> shot<00:01:04.500> and

flies you commonly use when you're nit
fishing<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:07.140> also<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> longer<00:01:08.130> belly<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
fishing it also is a longer belly and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.190 
fishing it also is a longer belly and
the<00:01:08.790> belly<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.150> weight<00:01:09.360> forward<00:01:09.659> portion

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200

as<00:01:14.430> far<00:01:14.640> as<00:01:14.760> casting<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.330> can<00:01:15.450> always<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.750> roll

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
as far as casting you can always do roll

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.810 
as far as casting you can always do roll
casts<00:01:16.439> overhead<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.040> underhand<00:01:17.430> some<00:01:17.610> great

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
good news begins because that longer

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.320 
good news begins because that longer
belly<00:01:22.259> allows<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.310> mend<00:01:23.610> which<00:01:24.210> is

belly allows you to mend which is

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.420 
belly allows you to mend which is
adjusting<00:01:24.810> your<00:01:24.900> fly<00:01:25.170> line<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.189> get

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
adjusting your fly line so that you get

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.210 
adjusting your fly line so that you get
a<00:01:26.490> good<00:01:26.820> natural<00:01:27.150> drift<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.590> natural<00:01:28.950> drifts

so<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.470> fly<00:01:31.740> line<00:01:31.979> super<00:01:32.400> important<00:01:32.939> well

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
so that fly line super important well

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.510 
so that fly line super important well
now<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.500> right<00:01:34.650> fly<00:01:34.860> line<00:01:35.130> we

now that we have the right fly line we

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.670 
now that we have the right fly line we
