top<00:00:40.200> thing<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:41.030> I<00:00:42.030> liked<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.320> was<00:00:43.350> really

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
top thing and I liked it it was really

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.430 
top thing and I liked it it was really
cheap<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.219> easy<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.579> make<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.030> it's<00:00:45.780> it's

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
cheap and easy to make and it's it's

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.350 
cheap and easy to make and it's it's
pretty<00:00:46.500> effective<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.730> know<00:00:47.820> containing

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
pretty effective and you know containing

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.880 
pretty effective and you know containing
her<00:00:48.420> obviously<00:00:48.840> she<00:00:49.020> can't<00:00:49.200> climb<00:00:49.379> out<00:00:49.620> and

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
her obviously she can't climb out and

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.189 
her obviously she can't climb out and
although<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.789> doesn't<00:00:50.940> keep<00:00:51.210> humidity<00:00:52.020> all

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199

that<00:00:52.379> well<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.890> really<00:00:53.190> deep<00:00:53.520> layer<00:00:53.940> of

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
that well I have a really deep layer of

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.750 
that well I have a really deep layer of
substrate<00:00:54.469> that<00:00:55.469> she<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:55.920> barrel<00:00:56.219> him<00:00:56.370> as<00:00:56.579> you

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
substrate that she can barrel him as you

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.439 
substrate that she can barrel him as you
can<00:00:56.910> see<00:00:57.620> she<00:00:58.620> has<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> butter<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.399> have<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.180> foot

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
can see she has a butter I have the foot

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.650 
can see she has a butter I have the foot
of<00:01:00.600> substrate<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.199> she<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.739> burrow<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.190> and

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
of substrate that she can burrow in and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.270 
of substrate that she can burrow in and
since<00:01:03.660> she's<00:01:03.870> brew<00:01:04.199> mating<00:01:04.530> right<00:01:04.710> now<00:01:04.830> anyway

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
since she's brew mating right now anyway

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.859 
since she's brew mating right now anyway
I'm<00:01:05.430> not<00:01:05.460> really<00:01:05.640> too<00:01:06.090> worried<00:01:06.360> about<00:01:06.450> her<00:01:06.840> I

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
I'm not really too worried about her I

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.370 
I'm not really too worried about her I
get<00:01:07.140> her<00:01:07.290> up<00:01:07.439> every<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.369> often<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:09.110> bathe<00:01:10.110> her

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
get her up every so often to bathe her

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.260 
get her up every so often to bathe her
to<00:01:10.619> keep<00:01:10.890> her<00:01:10.920> well<00:01:11.220> hydrated<00:01:11.700> brother<00:01:12.060> and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
to keep her well hydrated brother and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.399 
to keep her well hydrated brother and
that<00:01:12.360> she<00:01:12.570> really<00:01:12.750> doesn't<00:01:12.930> do<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> whole<00:01:13.229> lot

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
that she really doesn't do a whole lot

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.560 
that she really doesn't do a whole lot
and<00:01:13.830> for<00:01:14.729> those<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.030> who<00:01:15.150> don't<00:01:15.330> know<00:01:15.390> what

and for those of you who don't know what
brew<00:01:15.750> mating<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.580> it's<00:01:17.580> where<00:01:18.049> reptilians<00:01:19.049> go

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
brew mating is it's where reptilians go

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.490 
brew mating is it's where reptilians go
into<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> hibernation<00:01:20.250> sort<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.850> state<00:01:21.030> and

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
into a hibernation sort of state and

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.960 
into a hibernation sort of state and
when<00:01:22.500> they<00:01:22.590> do<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.920> their<00:01:23.130> metabolism<00:01:23.729> slows

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
when they do this their metabolism slows

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.440 
when they do this their metabolism slows
way<00:01:24.210> down

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
way down

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.300 
way down
they<00:01:24.930> don't<00:01:25.140> really<00:01:25.350> eat<00:01:25.500> much<00:01:25.530> they<00:01:25.950> don't<00:01:26.070> do

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
they don't really eat much they don't do

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.700 
they don't really eat much they don't do
much<00:01:26.520> other<00:01:26.850> than<00:01:26.939> just<00:01:27.360> sleep<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:28.350> moved

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
much other than just sleep and I moved

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.730 
much other than just sleep and I moved
her<00:01:29.220> hide<00:01:29.490> over<00:01:29.930> just<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.020> show<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.290> what<00:01:31.710> I

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
her hide over just to show you what I

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.010 
her hide over just to show you what I
mean<00:01:32.009> tegus<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.210> lot<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.509> times<00:01:33.750> will<00:01:33.900> make

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
mean tegus a lot of the times will make

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.620 
mean tegus a lot of the times will make
these<00:01:34.799> little<00:01:35.070> nests<00:01:35.490> as<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.329> see<00:01:36.450> she's

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
these little nests as you can see she's

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.240 
these little nests as you can see she's
all<00:01:36.780> nestled<00:01:37.229> up<00:01:37.320> there<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.770> substrate

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
all nestled up there in the substrate

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.460 
all nestled up there in the substrate
and<00:01:38.520> she's<00:01:39.180> been<00:01:39.390> doing<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.810> for<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> better

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
and she's been doing this for the better

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.830 
and she's been doing this for the better
part<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.369> don't<00:01:42.000> know<00:01:42.060> three<00:01:42.299> months<00:01:42.450> or<00:01:42.689> so

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.539 
part of I don't know three months or so
she's<00:01:43.049> really<00:01:43.350> only<00:01:43.500> gotten<00:01:43.890> up<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.100> few<00:01:44.310> times

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
she's really only gotten up a few times

she's not sold up here not really doing

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.000 
she's not sold up here not really doing
a<00:02:30.390> whole<00:02:30.420> lot<00:02:30.600> this<00:02:30.930> winter<00:02:31.200> she<00:02:31.500> has<00:02:31.650> been<00:02:31.860> out

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
a whole lot this winter she has been out

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.370 
a whole lot this winter she has been out
more<00:02:32.310> recently<00:02:32.820> than<00:02:33.570> she's<00:02:33.750> been<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:34.290> know

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
more recently than she's been you know

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.870

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
earlier in the winter so that makes me

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.750 
earlier in the winter so that makes me
think<00:02:36.030> she's<00:02:36.240> probably<00:02:36.480> getting<00:02:36.840> ready<00:02:37.140> to

think she's probably getting ready to
you<00:02:38.760> know<00:02:38.850> wake<00:02:39.030> up<00:02:39.240> completely<00:02:39.690> at<00:02:39.900> this
