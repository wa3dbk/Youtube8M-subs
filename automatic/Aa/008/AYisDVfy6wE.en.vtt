00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
seedlings you will have to make sure

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.820 
seedlings you will have to make sure
that<00:00:30.930> you<00:00:30.990> have<00:00:31.140> something<00:00:31.530> to<00:00:31.619> catch<00:00:31.800> the

that you have something to catch the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.460 
that you have something to catch the
water<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.430> Turkey<00:00:32.750> this<00:00:33.750> tray<00:00:34.050> however

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
water in Turkey this tray however

here<00:00:56.730> are<00:00:56.790> perfect<00:00:57.269> for<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.480> smaller<00:00:57.900> seed<00:00:58.350> an

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
here are perfect for a smaller seed an

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.549 
here are perfect for a smaller seed an
example<00:00:59.070> would<00:00:59.129> be<00:00:59.220> a<00:00:59.339> list<00:00:59.699> them<00:00:59.909> and<00:01:00.559> things

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
example would be a list them and things

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.570 
example would be a list them and things
that<00:01:01.650> are<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.830> little<00:01:01.980> bit<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.220> the<00:01:02.309> smaller

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
that are a little bit on the smaller

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.899 
that are a little bit on the smaller
size<00:01:03.800> however<00:01:04.800> when<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.129> do<00:01:05.280> pick<00:01:05.519> something

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
size however when you do pick something

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.210 
size however when you do pick something
like<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.240> cucumber's<00:01:07.050> the<00:01:07.320> larger<00:01:07.800> melons

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
like the cucumber's the larger melons

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.830 
like the cucumber's the larger melons
and<00:01:08.400> tomatoes<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.060> do<00:01:09.240> want<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.479> go<00:01:09.600> into<00:01:09.750> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and tomatoes you do want to go into a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.860 
and tomatoes you do want to go into a
larger<00:01:10.260> size<00:01:10.470> pack<00:01:11.360> these<00:01:12.360> ones<00:01:12.570> here<00:01:12.720> are

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
larger size pack these ones here are

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.360 
larger size pack these ones here are
great<00:01:13.140> because<00:01:13.350> they<00:01:13.530> do<00:01:13.590> hold<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.070> little<00:01:14.280> bit

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
great because they do hold a little bit

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.490 
great because they do hold a little bit
more<00:01:14.550> of<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.970> soil<00:01:15.150> surface<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.780> are<00:01:15.960> more

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
more of a soil surface and are more

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.440 
more of a soil surface and are more
appropriate

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.840 

next<00:01:23.110> we're<00:01:23.229> gonna<00:01:23.290> use<00:01:23.439> the<00:01:23.770> humidity<00:01:24.640> domes

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
next we're gonna use the humidity domes

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.870 
next we're gonna use the humidity domes
these<00:01:25.299> clear<00:01:25.689> domes<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:27.070> put<00:01:27.340> over<00:01:27.520> top<00:01:27.549> of

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
these clear domes you put over top of

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.460 
these clear domes you put over top of
your<00:01:28.030> seedlings<00:01:28.479> to<00:01:28.720> create<00:01:29.049> a<00:01:29.080> humid

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
your seedlings to create a humid

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.920 
your seedlings to create a humid
environment<00:01:30.100> once<00:01:30.939> the<00:01:31.149> seedlings<00:01:31.360> start<00:01:31.810> to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
environment once the seedlings start to

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.050 
environment once the seedlings start to
germinate<00:01:32.080> you<00:01:32.560> want<00:01:32.799> to<00:01:32.860> remove<00:01:33.159> these

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
germinate you want to remove these

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.310 
germinate you want to remove these
their<00:01:35.990> domes

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
their domes

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.590 
their domes
by<00:01:37.680> keeping<00:01:37.890> these<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.820> eliminates<00:01:39.450> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
by keeping these on this eliminates a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.240 
by keeping these on this eliminates a
lot<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> daily<00:01:40.260> misting<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.800> we<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:41.040> need

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
lot of the daily misting that we do need

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.650 
lot of the daily misting that we do need
to<00:01:41.310> do<00:01:41.580> in<00:01:41.850> order<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.210> keep<00:01:42.330> them<00:01:42.510> moist

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
to do in order to keep them moist

to do in order to keep them moist
environment<00:01:43.350> for<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.590> season

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
environment for the season

do poke a couple of holes along the top
so<00:01:48.549> you<00:01:48.790> do<00:01:48.970> have<00:01:49.000> some<00:01:49.210> air<00:01:49.750> vent<00:01:49.990> taste<00:01:50.970> next

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
so you do have some air vent taste next
