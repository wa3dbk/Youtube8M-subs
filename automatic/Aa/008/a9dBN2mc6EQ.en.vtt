00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello guys how are you today I well 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.970
 I'm excited because my first is here 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.220
 fan mail 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.349
 it's not the first fan mail I get in 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.210
 actually I have already received other 32 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.910
 girls who follow me really adorable 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.100
 which are called emma and noemi rowe I do not have 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.869
 could publish the video dedicated to 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.970
 their fan mail you have to write to me and 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.340
 give me permission if you don't 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.750
 unfortunately I can't publish that 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.160
 that you give me because it could happen 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.720
 some bureaucratic mess in which 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.609
 anyway I don't want to enter we will have to 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.830
 inform you also that if you want to send me 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.410
 something I recommend you do not spend 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.620
 money for me is fine a letter a 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.360
 I design a spit but today but not 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.010
 spend money on me because I feel 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.050
 otherwise you don't blame us first 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.420
 Leonardo wrote 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.969
 which for me is something I don't 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.300
 sa scissors I haven't read yet 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:54.809

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.020
 then above it is written in very large 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.300
 Red handled requests and 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.969
 small actors there is written snail and 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.339
 will be Italy because Leonardo is one 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.590

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.340
 and is subscribed to my harris gesture and it 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.240
 I see very often to comment on who I was 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.090
 san leonardo 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.689
 I pointed out to her this not already 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.070
 said it all 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.360
 yes because I was read first ascent 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.850
 I hope all the things I have you 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.220
 bought can of course some more 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.049
 I apologize for the various imperfections 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.280
 come in the drawing 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.710
 I have no missions on a drawing yet 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.860
 in mind it will be in the other things that 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.729
 there was inside the true true letter but 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.299
 I didn't think of just covers for purposes in 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.280
 I draw a cover but how to what 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.970
 I do not know after we will see scissors do not do 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.040
 nothing ahead I apologize very much but the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.530
 tract pen that used as the tip 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.170
 too big don't worry about those 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.579
 penn roof is always like that and says it in a 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.890
 other article to the stationery for the 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.600
 drawing I was inspired a bit by photos 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.460
 that you did in Japan 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.649
 you must know that the comic elisa is not me 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.869
 brought this to Japan 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.770
 damn scissors go ahead and read not 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.350
 we don't care but I care 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.420
 a is a bit when you had green hair yes 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.610
 why didn't you know I had it for a while 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.010
 of time the green hair was very bad 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.520
 you sniff reason I salute you and thanks 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.170
 to always send me messages, sign up 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.370

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.830
 written replied I don't know I can't 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.340
 to read it however perhaps also because 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.050
 i am to be ignorant probable hope 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.840
 that you admit the cover and send me a 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.320

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.690

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.140
 more than converted and download me 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.270

 but with a haughty and beautiful face 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.680

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.390
