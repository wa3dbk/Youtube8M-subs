I<00:00:28.320> believe<00:00:28.650> built-in<00:00:29.099> if<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.939> same<00:00:30.119> as

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
I believe built-in if it's the same as

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.940 
I believe built-in if it's the same as

nothing<00:00:45.809> else<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> box<00:00:46.590> here's<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.610> case

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
nothing else in the box here's the case

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.260 
nothing else in the box here's the case
itself<00:00:49.940> on<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.090> back<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:52.340> that's<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.670> actual

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
itself on the back and that's it actual

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.970 
itself on the back and that's it actual
instructions<00:00:54.899> are<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> back<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.770> box

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980

instructions are in the back of the box
here<00:00:56.629> I'm<00:00:57.629> familiar<00:00:58.020> with<00:00:58.379> these<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.800> is

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
here I'm familiar with these so this is

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.740 
here I'm familiar with these so this is
in<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.390> case<00:01:00.390> that's<00:01:01.219> huge<00:01:02.219> really<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:03.000> there's

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
in a case that's huge really and there's

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.250 
in a case that's huge really and there's
the<00:01:03.899> case<00:01:04.110> itself<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.339> there's<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.260> whole

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the case itself and there's a whole

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.020 
the case itself and there's a whole
nother<00:01:07.439> layer<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.490> then<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.790> whole<00:01:08.970> thing

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
nother layer and then this whole thing

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.050 
nother layer and then this whole thing
clips<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.810> top<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.380> your<00:01:10.680> phone<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.909> is

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
clips on top of your phone so this is

for<00:01:12.360> impact<00:01:13.290> protection<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.909> then<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.840> is

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
for impact protection and then this is

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.840 
for impact protection and then this is
what<00:01:16.470> houses<00:01:16.680> your<00:01:17.009> phone<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.460> let's<00:01:17.549> go<00:01:17.729> ahead

so<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:24.769> snapped<00:02:25.250> into<00:02:25.519> place<00:02:26.829> yeah<00:02:27.829> that's

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
so that snapped into place yeah that's

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.020 
so that snapped into place yeah that's
in<00:02:28.220> place<00:02:28.459> there's<00:02:29.329> the<00:02:29.540> screen<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:31.790> works

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
in place there's the screen it works

protector on as well it slides in like
that<00:02:36.530> this<00:02:37.430> just<00:02:37.730> stretches<00:02:38.180> over<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.540> top

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
that this just stretches over the top

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.620 
that this just stretches over the top
and<00:02:39.470> holds<00:02:39.980> on<00:02:40.130> nicely<00:02:40.459> now<00:02:40.880> I<00:02:41.209> don't<00:02:41.420> know<00:02:41.569> if

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
and holds on nicely now I don't know if

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.520 
and holds on nicely now I don't know if
you've<00:02:41.750> ever<00:02:41.840> seen<00:02:42.140> any<00:02:42.319> of<00:02:42.380> these

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
demonstrated at how tough these are at

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.690 
demonstrated at how tough these are at
least<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.540> last<00:02:44.750> gen<00:02:45.049> one<00:02:45.260> went<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:46.010> an<00:02:46.099> AP<00:02:46.430> MP

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
least the last gen one went to an AP MP

least the last gen one went to an AP MP
store<00:02:47.030> in<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.450> mall<00:02:47.480> where<00:02:47.959> they<00:02:48.049> actually

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
store in a mall where they actually

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.900 
store in a mall where they actually
threw<00:02:48.530> these<00:02:48.739> over<00:02:49.129> the<00:02:49.220> counter<00:02:49.579> just<00:02:49.790> to

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
threw these over the counter just to

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.720 
threw these over the counter just to
show<00:02:50.090> how<00:02:50.299> tough<00:02:50.599> these<00:02:51.489> OtterBox<00:02:52.489> cases

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
show how tough these OtterBox cases

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.809 
show how tough these OtterBox cases
really<00:02:53.120> were<00:02:53.390> that<00:02:53.599> was<00:02:53.750> on<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.900> 3GS<00:02:54.500> so<00:02:54.889> let's

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
really were that was on a 3GS so let's

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.430 
really were that was on a 3GS so let's
get<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.150> readout<00:02:56.359> here<00:02:56.510> now<00:02:56.810> these<00:02:56.930> do<00:02:57.230> come

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
get the readout here now these do come

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.860 
get the readout here now these do come
in<00:02:57.560> different<00:02:57.709> colors<00:02:58.220> such<00:02:58.910> as<00:02:59.060> black<00:02:59.389> I

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
in different colors such as black I

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.539 
in different colors such as black I
don't<00:03:00.170> know<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.680> others<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:01.069> think<00:03:01.130> I've<00:03:01.400> seen

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
don't know the others I think I've seen

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.420 
don't know the others I think I've seen
yellow<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:02.650> there<00:03:03.650> we<00:03:03.769> have<00:03:03.950> it<00:03:04.100> so<00:03:04.250> this<00:03:04.370> is
