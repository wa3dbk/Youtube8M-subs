knocks<00:02:11.670> but<00:02:12.239> I<00:02:12.450> also<00:02:13.200> want<00:02:13.499> to<00:02:13.529> be<00:02:13.650> stealthy

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
knocks but I also want to be stealthy

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.970 
knocks but I also want to be stealthy
about<00:02:14.249> this<00:02:14.609> I<00:02:15.620> definitely<00:02:16.620> feel<00:02:16.919> that

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
about this I definitely feel that

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.860 
about this I definitely feel that
stealth<00:02:17.700> is<00:02:17.939> probably<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.419> way<00:02:18.540> we

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
stealth is probably the way we

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.930 
stealth is probably the way we
probably<00:02:19.200> get<00:02:19.319> some<00:02:19.530> good<00:02:20.159> photos<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.790> stuff

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
probably get some good photos and stuff

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.229 
probably get some good photos and stuff
a<00:02:21.120> Bigfoot<00:02:21.989> hopefully<00:02:22.379> some<00:02:22.620> real<00:02:22.830> proof<00:02:23.580> that

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
a Bigfoot hopefully some real proof that

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.020 
a Bigfoot hopefully some real proof that
he<00:02:24.390> exists<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:25.709> but<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.640> know<00:02:26.670> I'm<00:02:26.790> willing

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
he exists and I but you know I'm willing

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.460 
he exists and I but you know I'm willing
to<00:02:27.060> try<00:02:27.239> anything<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:27.989> we're<00:02:28.110> going<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.290> try

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
to try anything so we're going to try

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.140 
to try anything so we're going to try
this<00:02:28.500> fire<00:02:28.890> stuff<00:02:29.280> for<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.519> while<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.879> see<00:02:30.060> how

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
this fire stuff for a while and see how

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.720 
this fire stuff for a while and see how
it<00:02:30.299> works<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:33.750> me<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.110> Bill<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.129> master<00:02:35.519> main

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
it works so me and Bill the master main

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.930 
it works so me and Bill the master main
guide<00:02:35.970> here<00:02:37.310> just<00:02:38.310> got<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.579> camp<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.909> few

to get going pretty fast and we'll see

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.100 
to get going pretty fast and we'll see
if<00:02:44.640> this<00:02:44.790> thing<00:02:44.970> kicks<00:02:45.150> off<00:02:45.420> its<00:02:45.629> awful<00:02:45.930> wet

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
of snow but bill put a bunch of birch

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.479 
of snow but bill put a bunch of birch
bark<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:52.410> there<00:02:52.560> usually<00:02:52.799> that<00:02:53.129> kicks<00:02:53.340> off

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
bark in there usually that kicks off

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
trees and whatnot usually gives you your

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:06.770 
trees and whatnot usually gives you your
best<00:03:00.900> chance<00:03:01.109> to<00:03:01.260> get<00:03:01.470> into<00:03:01.560> fire<00:03:01.769> going<00:03:05.780> is

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
best chance to get into fire going is

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.000 
best chance to get into fire going is

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
there any reason why you'd look like a

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.770 
there any reason why you'd look like a
little<00:03:08.159> teepee<00:03:08.579> there<00:03:08.790> yeah<00:03:09.269> because<00:03:09.480> once

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
little teepee there yeah because once

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.210 
little teepee there yeah because once
this<00:03:09.930> is<00:03:10.140> this<00:03:10.319> stuff<00:03:10.530> will<00:03:10.680> get<00:03:10.769> going<00:03:11.099> i'll

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
this is this stuff will get going i'll

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.309 
this is this stuff will get going i'll
start<00:03:11.459> drawing<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.940> out<00:03:12.180> yeah<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.170> then

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
start drawing that out yeah and then

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.380 
start drawing that out yeah and then
once<00:03:13.890> this<00:03:14.040> burn<00:03:14.340> they'll<00:03:14.579> dry<00:03:14.849> out<00:03:14.879> and<00:03:15.209> kind

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
once this burn they'll dry out and kind

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.460 
once this burn they'll dry out and kind
of<00:03:15.420> put<00:03:15.599> that<00:03:15.750> down<00:03:15.900> then<00:03:16.140> we<00:03:16.230> get<00:03:16.349> that

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
of put that down then we get that

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.640 
of put that down then we get that
burning<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:16.950> wetter<00:03:17.700> stuff<00:03:18.090> right<00:03:18.569> here

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
burning the wetter stuff right here

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.949 
what people think we just put it out but
once<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.069> get<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.220> nice<00:03:44.400> follicles<00:03:45.389> there<00:03:45.720> and

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
once you get a nice follicles there and

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.629 
once you get a nice follicles there and
burn<00:03:46.530> anywhere<00:03:46.919> you<00:03:47.160> want<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.489> really<00:03:49.639> and

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
burn anywhere you want to really and

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.569 
burn anywhere you want to really and
it's<00:03:50.940> probably<00:03:51.540> around<00:03:51.660> 28<00:03:52.620> or<00:03:52.799> so<00:03:52.980> maybe<00:03:53.190> even

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
it's probably around 28 or so maybe even

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.550 
it's probably around 28 or so maybe even
warmer<00:03:53.940> than<00:03:54.060> that<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.299> everything<00:03:55.290> is<00:03:55.500> just

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
warmer than that and everything is just

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.129 
warmer than that and everything is just
wet<00:03:56.010> because<00:03:56.310> we<00:03:56.400> had<00:03:56.519> a<00:03:56.549> warm<00:03:56.849> day<00:03:57.060> we<00:03:57.959> can't

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
wet because we had a warm day we can't

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.369 
wet because we had a warm day we can't
hardly<00:03:58.319> get<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.590> fire<00:03:58.739> started<00:03:58.819> so<00:04:00.379> they'll

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
hardly get the fire started so they'll

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:02.509 
hardly get the fire started so they'll
came<00:04:01.560> up<00:04:01.650> with<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.829> trick<00:04:02.010> that<00:04:02.190> seems<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.459> be

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
came up with the trick that seems to be

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.069 
came up with the trick that seems to be
working<00:04:02.730> he<00:04:03.000> happened<00:04:03.329> to<00:04:03.359> have<00:04:03.449> a<00:04:03.569> candle

working he happened to have a candle
with<00:04:04.230> him<00:04:04.379> so<00:04:04.980> he<00:04:05.160> was<00:04:05.310> like<00:04:05.340> we<00:04:05.549> can<00:04:05.579> use<00:04:05.819> some

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
with him so he was like we can use some

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.720 
with him so he was like we can use some
of<00:04:06.030> this<00:04:06.180> wax<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.870> put<00:04:07.859> on<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.069> fire<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.579> kind

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
of this wax to put on the fire to kind

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.250 
of this wax to put on the fire to kind
of<00:04:08.790> help<00:04:08.910> help<00:04:09.329> give<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:09.660> some<00:04:09.780> fuel<00:04:09.989> to<00:04:10.139> get

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
of help help give it some fuel to get

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.400 
of help help give it some fuel to get
