 some have asked max how I pass 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.840
 to create a suit for my 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.880
 character as well as you add 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.140
 clothes that you like not to 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.020
 you today remembering that here you can 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.590
 customize your character from you 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.750
 can leave it is slightly different from the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.670
 male gender or if it was a government 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.460
 this little table that you leave the genre 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.340
 female, now it's there, it's in the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.180
 case with clothes that you will have to 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.790
 do 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.640
 you will click here in this option 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.579
 geometry geometry when you click 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.559
 already has a number of clothes here and 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.690
 these clothes are free to you too 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.539
 It is using its characters not 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.579
 worry because you can in case 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.340
 also use your games so stay 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.469
 quiet just double-click this 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.699
 here he is going to give this year 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.960
 already in our character in the same way if 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.720
 we apply 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.810
 Let's assume in these shirt she too 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.500
 is appearing here in our case. 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.409
 character with logo here very small 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.960
 but it is also that of other types of 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.810
 t-shirts have to stay again to 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.430
 see selecting her here with you 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.759
 you can check 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.470
 It leaves a little interesting and I think 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.799
 This one is more interesting, right? 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.549
 but in many different models 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.630
 Here for yourself you are creating're 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.030
 OK 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.920
 If you click again, let's put the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.640
 men's shoe then you can 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.509
 select others but also 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.720
 I believe it's how you do not 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.530
 importing clothing models for your 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.299
 character is 100% certain since the fall is 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.710
 this one would be more interesting 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.600
 for our game that we are 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.509
 developing the personal game for those who 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.369
 Do not you know we could combine with 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.390
 this one from here 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.989
 Just stay an hour and the clothes are you can 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.670
 to use is also this one from here that pants 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.550
 game already leaves 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.170
 yes, here are some simple things you 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.480
 will not worry in our case of a 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.099
 little rain here because since 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.650
 should make it more interesting then 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.110
 Here people believed in her and 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.720
 take off that shirt here and they'll be 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.510
 changing that shirt there now is 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.580
 cool or failed to get the sound here 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.350
 to see if the interesting is personal to 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.890
 view more of the character will be like this 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.170
 have as well as you are choosing the 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.080
 oil options of the character in the 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.030
 hair options is very severe with odon 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.430
 But how do I create a 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.170
 hair human brother number only you give 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.480
 choose these options here 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.980
 You can be ours too. 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.220
 you can choose other types of 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.040
 hair was just more interesting 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.430
 the tents that it was nice not only that 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.560
 not the choice of hair types 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.080
 here's the look from here, just the hair 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.900
 It is worth remembering that the 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.340
 your win so it stays there the options 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.560
 that you want to use 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.870
 one thing missing in convincing the 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.630
 when your teeth are going to skip this 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.660
 part is because of youtube manager 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.760
 here are these options too I want to find 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.640
 one here will leave here today the 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.440
 eyebrow here will customize the 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.470
 person to leave the character 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.209
 It's just interesting that it's not that 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.410
 eyebrow type is on time 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.900
 if any the same here materials 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.930
 you can choose the skin color of the 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.350
 character is at a level of caution 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.540
 Also this option is that option after 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.430
 animation that is more interesting than ever 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.310
 I had spoken to you before having 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.519
 how is the case creating it matters in 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.250
 already character of the program with 11 axes 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.690
 then you click 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.819
 these options for you will be 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.829
 importing with this hospital model 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.540
 So you do not have to create a 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.090
 bath will already be with this model or 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.819
 enjoy here will verify that is good 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.480
 I also play this rendering option 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.459
 on here 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.169
 here you can choose the resolution of the 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.269
 material you are trying to import 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.039
 It's not just that, we just created a 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.049
 character as I do no matter 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.710
 per bathroom you click on this option 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.220
 'save now 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:30.550
 here you export and you can 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.569
 export to a point format of the then 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.520
 you who do not even export blinder kingdom 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:39.849
 click on imported file 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.090
 choose the option in this first selection 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:44.979
 in the item as you can see it will be 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.319
 here with the partner is not 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:50.590
 I'm worried to play here to play. 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:52.360
 that we want to work the mother of m 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.050
 but as you can see inside the 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.479
 game already appears the clothes of the character รณ 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.289
 Okay, you can use the creation of your 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:06.360
 game is very cool is also 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:10.930
 you can change this option here for 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.740
 gsl that it already automatically appears 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.530
 huh 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.210
 the kibon a little apart from the hair, right? 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.039
 part of the I do not know why this 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.830
 happened but we did not select 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:23.199
 important when they are adjusting 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.630

 people can move the whole human arm 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:34.930
 human maker is a tool 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.639
