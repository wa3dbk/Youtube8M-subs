it<00:04:46.460> is<00:04:47.470> my<00:04:48.470> custom<00:04:48.890> or<00:04:49.460> I<00:04:49.850> didn't<00:04:50.600> buy<00:04:50.750> this

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
it is my custom or I didn't buy this

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.010 
it is my custom or I didn't buy this
anywhere<00:04:51.560> I<00:04:51.740> just<00:04:51.980> made<00:04:52.220> it<00:04:52.540> partly<00:04:53.540> by

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
anywhere I just made it partly by

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.170 
anywhere I just made it partly by
looking<00:04:54.440> at<00:04:54.560> Lego<00:04:54.860> boys<00:04:55.190> partly<00:04:55.640> by<00:04:55.820> looking

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
looking at Lego boys partly by looking

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.740 
looking at Lego boys partly by looking
online<00:04:56.360> at<00:04:56.840> some<00:04:57.230> of<00:04:57.410> these<00:04:57.560> because<00:04:58.510> no<00:04:59.510> one's

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
online at some of these because no one's

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.870 
online at some of these because no one's
telling<00:05:00.050> you<00:05:00.290> how<00:05:00.380> to<00:05:00.410> make<00:05:00.710> them<00:05:00.920> and<00:05:01.730> it's

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
telling you how to make them and it's

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.010 
telling you how to make them and it's
like<00:05:01.970> really<00:05:02.360> hard<00:05:02.510> to<00:05:02.600> get<00:05:02.720> up<00:05:02.810> right<00:05:02.960> now

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
like really hard to get up right now

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.700 
like really hard to get up right now
that's<00:05:03.410> I<00:05:03.740> know<00:05:04.400> they<00:05:04.760> don't<00:05:04.940> have<00:05:05.290> this<00:05:06.290> piece

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
that's I know they don't have this piece

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.220 
that's I know they don't have this piece
right<00:05:06.890> here<00:05:06.950> the<00:05:07.310> gray<00:05:07.730> piece<00:05:08.000> I<00:05:08.270> put<00:05:09.080> that

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
right here the gray piece I put that

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.050 
right here the gray piece I put that
there<00:05:09.290> because<00:05:09.650> one<00:05:10.010> it's<00:05:10.220> easier<00:05:10.520> to<00:05:10.670> stand

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
there because one it's easier to stand

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.610 
there because one it's easier to stand
and<00:05:13.210> hey<00:05:14.210> guys<00:05:14.480> sorry<00:05:14.870> about<00:05:15.020> the<00:05:15.260> cuts<00:05:15.470> in

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
there but I probably will be doing a how

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.790 
there but I probably will be doing a how
to<00:05:19.760> make<00:05:20.090> this<00:05:20.480> Walker<00:05:20.810> video<00:05:21.260> because<00:05:21.620> I've

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
to make this Walker video because I've

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.920 
to make this Walker video because I've
seen<00:05:22.130> comments<00:05:22.760> that<00:05:23.120> people<00:05:23.510> have<00:05:23.720> been

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
seen comments that people have been

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.240 
seen comments that people have been
wanting<00:05:24.350> to<00:05:24.590> see<00:05:25.190> how<00:05:25.460> to<00:05:25.520> make<00:05:25.730> this<00:05:26.950> it<00:05:27.950> is

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
wanting to see how to make this it is

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.840 
wanting to see how to make this it is
similar<00:05:28.670> to<00:05:28.700> like<00:05:29.060> a<00:05:29.090> boys<00:05:29.390> and<00:05:30.310> Lego<00:05:31.310> boy<00:05:31.520> 1<00:05:31.760> 2

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
similar to like a boys and Lego boy 1 2

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.660 
similar to like a boys and Lego boy 1 2
3<00:05:32.000> 4<00:05:32.210> 5<00:05:32.360> 6<00:05:32.630> 7<00:05:32.840> 8<00:05:33.080> or<00:05:33.350> its<00:05:33.710> fan<00:05:33.890> channel<00:05:34.280> or<00:05:34.460> is

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
3 4 5 6 7 8 or its fan channel or is

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.280 
3 4 5 6 7 8 or its fan channel or is
alternative<00:05:35.630> channel<00:05:35.990> but<00:05:37.990> it's<00:05:38.990> a<00:05:39.050> really

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
alternative channel but it's a really

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.800 
alternative channel but it's a really
nice<00:05:39.530> Walker<00:05:39.890> it's<00:05:40.220> small<00:05:40.580> more<00:05:41.120> exact<00:05:41.540> size

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
nice Walker it's small more exact size

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.460 
nice Walker it's small more exact size
like<00:05:42.140> lightning<00:05:42.590> squad<00:05:43.010> had<00:05:43.480> I<00:05:45.790> gave<00:05:46.790> them

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
like lightning squad had I gave them

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.260 
like lightning squad had I gave them
these<00:05:48.470> pieces<00:05:48.830> on<00:05:49.480> the<00:05:50.480> droid<00:05:51.110> bodies<00:05:51.880> are<00:05:52.880> the

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
these pieces on the droid bodies are the

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.380 
these pieces on the droid bodies are the
leg<00:05:53.480> piece<00:05:53.840> part<00:05:54.530> because<00:05:55.340> it's<00:05:55.880> not<00:05:56.090> really

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
leg piece part because it's not really

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.440 
leg piece part because it's not really
easy<00:05:56.930> to<00:05:57.140> balance<00:05:58.010> you<00:05:58.550> can't<00:05:58.820> mount<00:05:59.030> it<00:05:59.330> on

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
easy to balance you can't mount it on

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.350 
easy to balance you can't mount it on
the<00:05:59.570> ground<00:05:59.900> without<00:06:00.230> these<00:06:00.470> pieces<00:06:00.830> but<00:06:01.700> onto

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
the ground without these pieces but onto

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.030 
the ground without these pieces but onto
the<00:06:02.480> Walker<00:06:02.690> we<00:06:03.080> have<00:06:03.200> an<00:06:03.350> arc<00:06:03.530> trooper

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 
the Walker we have an arc trooper

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.260 
the Walker we have an arc trooper
piloting<00:06:04.610> it<00:06:05.020> the<00:06:06.020> gun<00:06:06.500> right<00:06:06.740> there<00:06:06.980> and<00:06:07.460> the

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
piloting it the gun right there and the

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.570 
piloting it the gun right there and the
antenna<00:06:08.630> which<00:06:08.930> I<00:06:09.080> might<00:06:09.440> change<00:06:09.860> to<00:06:10.070> one<00:06:10.460> of

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
antenna which I might change to one of

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.780 
antenna which I might change to one of
these<00:06:10.790> flick<00:06:11.420> fire<00:06:11.690> pieces<00:06:12.370> but<00:06:13.370> other<00:06:13.640> than

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.790 
these flick fire pieces but other than

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.000 
these flick fire pieces but other than
that<00:06:13.880> it's<00:06:14.240> really<00:06:14.300> simple<00:06:14.840> really<00:06:15.350> easy<00:06:15.530> to

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
that it's really simple really easy to

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.000 
that it's really simple really easy to
make<00:06:16.340> not<00:06:16.910> that<00:06:17.240> hard<00:06:17.510> I've<00:06:17.960> gotta<00:06:18.500> fix<00:06:18.890> that

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
make not that hard I've gotta fix that

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.320 
make not that hard I've gotta fix that
