editing side of the game a presentation

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.929 
editing side of the game a presentation
this<00:01:22.080> year<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.909> big<00:01:24.390> letdown<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.320> mean<00:01:25.619> I

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
this year it is a big letdown I mean I

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.929

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
think even a GCSE art student could have

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.490 
think even a GCSE art student could have
done<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> better<00:01:30.180> job<00:01:30.450> than<00:01:30.900> what<00:01:31.079> they've<00:01:31.259> done

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
done a better job than what they've done

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.700 
done a better job than what they've done
