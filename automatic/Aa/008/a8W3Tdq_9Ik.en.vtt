00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
destroyed the earth myself if you throw

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.550 
destroyed the earth myself if you throw
the<00:01:30.299> switch<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.720> side<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.200> machine

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the switch on the side of the machine

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.980 
the switch on the side of the machine
it's<00:01:32.130> game<00:01:32.490> over<00:01:32.700> because<00:01:33.000> doing<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.509> fires

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
it's game over because doing that fires

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.370 
it's game over because doing that fires
the<00:01:34.229> ships<00:01:34.470> photon<00:01:35.130> laser<00:01:35.490> cannon<00:01:36.180> thingy<00:01:36.540> and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
the ships photon laser cannon thingy and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.289 
the ships photon laser cannon thingy and
it<00:01:37.530> blows<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:37.799> earth<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.549> guess<00:01:38.820> by<00:01:39.000> doing

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
it blows up earth but I guess by doing

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.120 
it blows up earth but I guess by doing
that<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.600> destroy<00:01:39.960> any<00:01:40.200> nagging<00:01:40.530> parents<00:01:41.009> so

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
at least he won't get grounded in the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.770 
at least he won't get grounded in the
third<00:01:43.680> game<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.250> invade<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.759> Porticus<00:01:45.210> planet
