00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.940
 when 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.180
 supply and demand 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.400
 because he just came back 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.400
 up sharply yesterday 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.040
 its strength of 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.269
 the list is long 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.479
 problem elsewhere 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:40.829
 and then three years ago 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.829
 as to take 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.529
 obviously it's a return to the 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.629
 Sunday night 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:15.969
 difficult for him 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:19.119
 his failure last year 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:22.149
 there will be cats 

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:25.149
 the royal dutch shell 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.579
 it is absolutely wrong 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.579
 to the general public 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.709
 whatever happens to the minister 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:53.189
 the moment seems to come to that let's add 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.449
 the meeting had 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:58.449
 in 2002 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.239
 I will continue my studies 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.479
 the 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.960
 that's what I do 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.960
 Therefore 

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.979
 you can try
