00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.390
 Ugh 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.199
 but it is not different sweetness concentration 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.029
 design 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.520
 this is more concentrated 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.150
 sweeter techniques 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.150
 the flagship here comes down from the sky 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.540
 you don't deserve everything 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.540

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.800
 andrea giorgetti 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.930
 welcome to our kitchen 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.879
 I am updating this tower of the red saracino restaurant 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.640
 must 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.180
 for almost twenty years 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.369
 let's try to delight version and today we tell you 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.190
 ak a good story is the story of a product 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.910
 very tied to the Italian root 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.070
 what do you have. free of balsamic 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.680
 we have 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.900
 examples of balsamic vinegar here 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.600
 that you are giving me condiments 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.060
 I forget the very particular characteristics 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.500
 we have two different concentrations 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.830
 so we have 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.110
 a product like a sugary note 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.790
 the important thing is therefore a much more concentrated 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.750
 and this is a must 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.080
 true concentrate where we have 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.820
 the 9 and 10 ita a little more pronounced 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.020
 it's a sweetness let's say slightly less 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.350
 pronounced radigue state product 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.350
 karlova save these your contacts 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.770
 now 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.790
 let's imagine contexts where we 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.170
 we can enhance these characteristics by enhancing the characteristics 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.289
 here is good with the first course 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:14.669
 clearly I am I am on the sea then 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.589
 for me it was fun to contextualize this 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:20.019
 seasonings in a fish dish 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.019
 here we have a parabite that is a blue fish 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.129
 very good very delicate 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.449
 as you see here we have 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:31.609
 practically roasted 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.149
 on the side was this fish 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:36.549
 strong brace sura 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.739
 in order to have a toasting effect 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.629
 very particular digusto 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.309
 we immediately cooled the fish 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:48.659
 and therefore we have this red cooking 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.319
 in the center 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.119
 and this part instead 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:55.539
 posted as I said so very tasty 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:58.539
 I go to make the corpse be a contrast of consists 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.109
 but also a contrast of taste 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:06.259
 we must of broccoli sprouts 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.059
 to this is a tom broccoli herb to our traditional 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:15.269
 which has a bitter note 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.340
 then we have a tomato water apple jelly 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:21.759
 pro to refresh your breath a little 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:23.859
 and then these oysters 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.459
 that we marinated in this sarnico bar 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.699
 here the game which is the health my oyster life 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:35.979
 with sweetness in this pleasant acidity 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.129
 denisa product - concentrated because 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.129
 here too much sweetness would have been a little 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:45.779
 pasqui library the dish 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:48.299
 then sand imagined a speech 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.889
 ap1 of different tastes because 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.279
 the fish in this way has a pretty taste 

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:58.719
 however neutral for dedicated fish then 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:01.449
 it was very important from some notes 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:02.709
 via maroc 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.589
 cornalba broccoli leaf 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:08.329
 via fresco of tomato 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.079
 edit 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.169
 Saturday and dessert 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.399
 villa ustica never born in the year of the vassal 

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:17.189
 here we put again 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:18.959
 of the drops 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.379
 marinade precisely because we have salt and sweetness 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:27.389
 surrender much more dynamic dish 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:28.439
 much more 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:30.999
 u much more tasty fast 

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:34.229
 because many battles away dynamically work slowly 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.120
 at this point 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.259
 oviedo and we complete 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:41.400
 with a few drops 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.289
 lowering dv even more 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.289
 intensity 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:55.209
 a very versatile product is included one can imagine so many contexts 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.580
 he is alone 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.919
 just know the bust 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.949
 and to imagine that I can stay 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.379
 well to accompany dishes of different of controls a group of fish 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:08.759
 rather than 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.759
 two of the most diverse pages we try to make 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:15.439
 of emporium decontextualization but 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:18.370
 but imprints lends itself to many uses for snacks 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.229
 so this is the dish 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:22.809
 a dish also 

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:24.729
 simple enough 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.039
 once we have all the right ingredients as usual 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:29.969
 but a dish with tastes 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.050
 very Italian very much 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.080
 modern and at the same time 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.690
 very stylish
