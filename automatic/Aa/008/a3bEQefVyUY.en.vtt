capable of two shot headshot kills in
the<00:01:36.270> crucible<00:01:36.750> now<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.950> plays<00:01:38.479> very

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
the crucible now it plays very

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.929 
the crucible now it plays very
differently<00:01:39.860> from<00:01:40.860> machine<00:01:41.189> guns<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.670> I've

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
differently from machine guns that I've

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.749 
differently from machine guns that I've
gotten<00:01:42.299> used<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:42.990> far<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.470> destiny<00:01:43.950> because

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759

of that focus fire perk is very slow to

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.289 
of that focus fire perk is very slow to
fire<00:01:48.240> very<00:01:48.780> slow<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.229> fire<00:01:49.729> what<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.759> learned

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
fire very slow to fire what I learned

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.030 
fire very slow to fire what I learned
over<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.899> course<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.320> playing<00:01:52.530> with<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.920> gun

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
over the course of playing with the gun

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.740 
over the course of playing with the gun
is<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.490> actually<00:01:53.729> have<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.329> play<00:01:54.479> with

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
is that you actually have to play with

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.170 
is that you actually have to play with
it<00:01:54.780> more<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.680> scout<00:01:56.040> rifle<00:01:56.070> than<00:01:57.060> a

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
it more like a scout rifle than a

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.600 
it more like a scout rifle than a
standard<00:01:57.540> machine<00:01:57.930> gun<00:01:58.110> for<00:01:58.530> me<00:01:58.680> normally

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
standard machine gun for me normally

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.490 
standard machine gun for me normally

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
when I'm using a machine gun I point it

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.990 
when I'm using a machine gun I point it
in<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> correct<00:02:01.979> direction<00:02:02.040> hold<00:02:02.700> down<00:02:02.880> the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
in the correct direction hold down the

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
good it's just it's too dangerous when

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.910 
good it's just it's too dangerous when

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
close range when using this so you

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.730 
close range when using this so you
really<00:03:15.450> want<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.750> use<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:15.960> like<00:03:16.350> a<00:03:16.380> scout<00:03:16.710> rifle

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
you want to use accuracy I do wish that

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.199 
you want to use accuracy I do wish that
it<00:03:22.260> had<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.440> different<00:03:22.709> scope<00:03:23.220> on<00:03:23.490> it<00:03:23.520> this

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
it had a different scope on it this

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.230 
it had a different scope on it this
doesn't<00:03:24.780> seem<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.200> be<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.650> good<00:03:26.280> enough<00:03:26.820> scope

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
doesn't seem to be a good enough scope

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.080 
doesn't seem to be a good enough scope
for<00:03:28.020> me<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.440> get<00:03:28.590> consistent<00:03:29.340> headshots<00:03:29.820> but

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
for me to get consistent headshots but

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.900 
for me to get consistent headshots but
when<00:03:30.300> I<00:03:30.330> do<00:03:30.540> it's<00:03:31.440> amazing<00:03:31.980> like<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.459> people

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
when I do it's amazing like the people

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.080 
when I do it's amazing like the people
just<00:03:33.090> die<00:03:33.300> so<00:03:33.750> fast<00:03:34.230> so<00:03:35.070> it's<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.580> high<00:03:35.790> skill

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
just die so fast so it's a high skill

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.880 
just die so fast so it's a high skill
weapon<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:36.660> would<00:03:36.840> say<00:03:37.050> you<00:03:37.110> definitely<00:03:37.740> need

accuracy<00:03:52.410> and<00:03:52.709> slow<00:03:53.190> rate<00:03:53.459> of<00:03:53.489> fire<00:03:53.640> really<00:03:54.330> do

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
accuracy and slow rate of fire really do

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.260 
accuracy and slow rate of fire really do
make<00:03:54.900> this<00:03:55.080> gun<00:03:55.350> a<00:03:55.590> ton<00:03:56.010> of<00:03:56.040> fun<00:03:56.580> especially<00:03:56.880> at

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
make this gun a ton of fun especially at

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.750 
make this gun a ton of fun especially at
longer<00:03:57.480> ranges<00:03:58.050> if<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.709> site<00:03:59.040> had<00:03:59.280> more<00:03:59.520> of<00:03:59.670> a

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
longer ranges if that site had more of a

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.729 
longer ranges if that site had more of a
zoom<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.239> it<00:04:00.420> I<00:04:00.600> think<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:01.170> thing<00:04:01.440> would<00:04:01.590> be<00:04:01.709> a

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
zoom to it I think this thing would be a

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.310 
zoom to it I think this thing would be a
beast<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:02.580> would<00:04:02.670> be<00:04:02.790> overpowered<00:04:03.720> but<00:04:03.840> as<00:04:04.080> it

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
beast it would be overpowered but as it

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.470 
beast it would be overpowered but as it
sits<00:04:04.500> right<00:04:04.620> now<00:04:04.770> as<00:04:05.190> you<00:04:05.610> can<00:04:05.760> see<00:04:05.910> if<00:04:06.120> you<00:04:06.300> can

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
sits right now as you can see if you can

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.990 
sits right now as you can see if you can
get<00:04:06.630> those<00:04:06.780> headshots<00:04:07.320> it<00:04:08.130> really<00:04:08.760> is<00:04:08.970> a

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
get those headshots it really is a

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.030 
get those headshots it really is a
nightmare<00:04:09.360> for<00:04:09.720> your<00:04:09.900> opponents<00:04:10.560> even<00:04:10.739> when

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
nightmare for your opponents even when

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.890 
nightmare for your opponents even when
they're<00:04:11.160> hiding<00:04:11.459> behind<00:04:11.550> fire<00:04:12.030> and<00:04:12.420> they'd

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
they're hiding behind fire and they'd

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.020 
they're hiding behind fire and they'd
normally<00:04:13.170> be<00:04:13.650> relatively<00:04:14.489> safe<00:04:14.850> from

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
normally be relatively safe from

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.750 
normally be relatively safe from
machine-gun<00:04:15.570> fire<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:16.470> just<00:04:17.010> can<00:04:17.160> fire<00:04:17.400> so

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
machine-gun fire you just can fire so

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.460 
machine-gun fire you just can fire so
accurately<00:04:18.450> because<00:04:18.600> of<00:04:18.840> that<00:04:18.930> slow<00:04:19.230> rate<00:04:19.440> of

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
accurately because of that slow rate of

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.650 
accurately because of that slow rate of
fire<00:04:19.760> that<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:21.120> take<00:04:21.330> them<00:04:21.450> down<00:04:21.630> very

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
fire that you take them down very

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.990 
fire that you take them down very
quickly<00:04:22.200> so<00:04:22.530> definitely<00:04:23.310> keep<00:04:23.550> your<00:04:23.760> eye<00:04:23.789> open

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
quickly so definitely keep your eye open

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.170 
quickly so definitely keep your eye open

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.150 
for the Xerces see in a drop if it
got<00:04:27.330> focused<00:04:27.810> fire<00:04:28.020> definitely<00:04:28.680> level<00:04:28.949> it<00:04:29.070> up

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
got focused fire definitely level it up

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350
