00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
it a little bit closer to the camera so

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.880 
it a little bit closer to the camera so

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
that you can see it closer it's a bit

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.650

millimeter macro lens if we look onto
the<00:00:56.760> top<00:00:57.170> you'll<00:00:58.170> see<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.590> command<00:00:58.920> dial<00:00:59.280> is

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the top you'll see the command dial is

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.369 
the top you'll see the command dial is
on<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.510> right<00:01:00.690> shoulder<00:01:00.899> along<00:01:01.230> with

on the right shoulder along with

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.360 
on the right shoulder along with
basically<00:01:01.649> everything<00:01:02.039> else<00:01:02.190> there's

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
basically everything else there's

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.680 
basically everything else there's
nothing<00:01:02.489> actually<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> left<00:01:03.300> hand<00:01:03.449> side

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
nothing actually on the left hand side

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.539 
nothing actually on the left hand side
and<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.920> not<00:01:05.250> very<00:01:05.430> good<00:01:05.580> for<00:01:05.760> left<00:01:06.119> hand<00:01:06.330> users

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
and so not very good for left hand users

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.160 
and so not very good for left hand users
so<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.909> dial<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> top<00:01:09.390> here<00:01:09.960> is

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
so the the dial on the top here is

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.120 
so the the dial on the top here is
designed<00:01:10.680> for<00:01:11.040> ease<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.369> use<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.090> that's<00:01:12.720> a

designed for ease of use and that's a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.850 
designed for ease of use and that's a
that's<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.720> philosophy<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.290> cameras<00:01:16.710> had

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
that's a philosophy that the cameras had

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.800 
that's a philosophy that the cameras had
going<00:01:17.070> through<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.430> throughout<00:01:17.670> they've<00:01:18.600> put

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
going through it throughout they've put

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.270 
going through it throughout they've put
a<00:01:18.840> lot<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.170> technology<00:01:19.619> into<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.040> makes

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
a lot of technology into it that makes

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.960 
a lot of technology into it that makes
it<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.520> lot<00:01:20.700> easier<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.150> use<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:22.830> auto<00:01:23.310> mode<00:01:23.759> for

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
it a lot easier to use the auto mode for

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.990 
it a lot easier to use the auto mode for
instance<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.570> an<00:01:24.750> upgraded<00:01:25.080> version<00:01:25.229> now<00:01:26.159> it's
