 Tell me guys, I'm going to teach you today. 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.500
 how to install a mold and air mold 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.440
 of modeling is what it serves to open 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.020
 or run the molds any type 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.310
 of course I needed to see 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.350
 there is another one, but I 'm going to teach 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.340
 this world order 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.310
 No, I'll leave it and the link to do the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.320
 download lipo greater craft time inc 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.130
 I'll leave the application and the link 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:37.469
 download so come on it 's simple 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.540
 first you draw the Lada model and 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.600
 then the hill 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.829
 Do you want it here too? 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:52.800
 now you take the modeled folder open 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:57.539
 it takes everything that is inside the copy and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:02.480
 it goes in windows but it's sorry the windows 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:09.600
 er or if you have 28 and search and 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:13.110
 execute and writes percent and the app date 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:18.420
 percent of what was once the coastline 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:21.210
 greater craft of minecraft point already open 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:28.439
 with iha 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:30.990
 ok or select here and glue all glue 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.939
 all or you can just play 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.159
 everything in there and have're close and can 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.700
 you can close here if you have a meta folder 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.110
 Finally in here I think 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.079
 you should probably have a folder called 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.659
 Well, you already pay because she 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.200
 blocks the model area and then 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.060
 of you 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.509
 done this is already installed the user 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.390
 and every time you have love again 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.299
 you will create a folder here within the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.200
 minecraft point paste with the call 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.950
 and I will not create because it is already 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.539
 created in the neighborhood 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.520
 so you wanted a sharing of death 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.990
 and from there you will put all the 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.520
 your manners in here 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:20.060
 ok simple single strand so to 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.709
 install this in this template 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.660
 he's a little different because he's already 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.150
 came into the folder 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.160
 This world has seen it in a folder so I do not 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.040
 I need was I did not need the world 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:35.270

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.230
 copy or in the folder Maria Day Care and 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.260
 here inside 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.320
 the previous the child passes the movie crash 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:47.920
 I'm going to copy everything that's here, I'm going 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:51.380
 paste also simple so replace 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:55.010
 done this is just to see and open 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:03:02.300
 microsoft entering the game will load 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:09.709
 here the way in which it was entering the 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:11.000
 world and start the game 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.360
 I 'm not going to talk about the motto because I 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.910
 I'll make another video talking about him. 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:20.720
 It is and I think that's all it is so lacking 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.000
 nothing then the next video is going to be me 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.160
 I'm going to play, I'm going to want to do a series. 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.450
 the mold of this mountain is quite 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.780
 Funny that from what I saw 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.549

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.549
