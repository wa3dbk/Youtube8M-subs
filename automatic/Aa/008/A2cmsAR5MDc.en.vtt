 Round 25 riders start in glorious summer weather 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.240
 Among the favorites in these races was state champion Harald 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.669
 Starzengruber 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:27.249
 since the Eifeler 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.249
 Characteristic is clear which provides a closed 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.090
 The wm-eleven sent by Evros 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.090
 and not with BELECTRIC or secured with sector 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.820
 Predecessors were the foundation for success 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.820
 but not always can with their body and percent 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.490
 we want a lot 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.149

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:03.709
 he is and he became the Petite Staatsmeister from the head 

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:07.010
 There are many abroad and demand from Philips heavy rank one 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.900
 currently will probably not admit it and there 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.780
 In Norway, it was thus continued to penetrate the good at last 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.000
 Retract the doctor counter 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.790
 Bayern new young team have a lot of fun and am topmotiviert here

 Judendorf we want a place 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.930
 But there were always many demands he behaved 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.000
 Arthur and Israeli missiles a freeze obtains that they really 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.710

 almost a home race who did not necessarily report sda 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.130
 if i got out of the world the instigators finally got both teams there then 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.119
 arises one percent too 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.130
 Rescuers of the Koreans in the squad and of course they are accordingly 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.950
 motivates at the nrw election percent, finally, a possible open option 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.910
 and to present ourselves as well as possible 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.020
 So it's not surprising that the Supreme Court Dean from the organizers easy 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.030
 turned to the good of him 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.400
 we hope that today 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.630
 although their episode bring the stage that was whether they smoked and I hope 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.349

 then an eleven-member group from the field 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:42.589
 the outliers were overtaken again and again by the field 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:46.629
 the field is therefore closed outliers 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.629
 and immediately intercepted 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.110
