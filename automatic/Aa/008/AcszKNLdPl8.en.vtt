I'm<00:00:17.250> going<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.460> go<00:00:17.550> over<00:00:18.380> today<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.619> video

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
I'm going to go over today in this video

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.560 
I'm going to go over today in this video
you<00:00:22.619> might<00:00:22.710> ask<00:00:22.890> yourself<00:00:23.039> wings<00:00:23.460> well<00:00:23.880> how

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
you might ask yourself wings well how

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.420 
you might ask yourself wings well how
can<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.840> change<00:00:24.990> UAB<00:00:25.439> up<00:00:25.590> how's<00:00:25.980> your<00:00:26.250> beak

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
can you change UAB up how's your beak

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.429 
can you change UAB up how's your beak
only<00:00:26.670> changed<00:00:27.060> well<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.660> UAV<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.050> actually

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
only changed well the UAV is actually

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.679 
only changed well the UAV is actually
very<00:00:28.470> complex<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.279> game<00:00:29.490> more<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.660> than

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
very complex in this game more so than

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.690 
very complex in this game more so than
the<00:00:31.019> previous<00:00:31.410> games<00:00:31.619> generally<00:00:32.009> UAVs<00:00:32.669> are

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
the previous games generally UAVs are

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.280 
the previous games generally UAVs are
just<00:00:33.120> standard<00:00:33.450> things<00:00:33.809> for<00:00:33.989> those<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.230> don't

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
just standard things for those you don't

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
much give you a small insight to where

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
faster the radar pings and that's pretty

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.040 
faster the radar pings and that's pretty
much<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.550> call<00:00:54.030> duty<00:00:54.239> modern<00:00:54.570> warfare<00:00:54.690> 3

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050

much it and call duty modern warfare 3
they<00:00:55.710> added<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.160> ability<00:00:56.280> for<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.000> UAV<00:00:57.390> to

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
they added the ability for the UAV to

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.260 
they added the ability for the UAV to
get<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.230> turn<00:00:58.469> into<00:00:58.680> an<00:00:58.770> advanced<00:00:59.160> UAV<00:00:59.399> if<00:01:00.180> you

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
get to turn into an advanced UAV if you

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.599 
get to turn into an advanced UAV if you
had<00:01:00.420> three<00:01:00.719> or<00:01:00.899> more<00:01:01.050> UAVs<00:01:01.500> up<00:01:01.680> at<00:01:01.829> any<00:01:02.160> given

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
had three or more UAVs up at any given

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.750 
had three or more UAVs up at any given
time<00:01:03.409> so<00:01:04.409> what<00:01:04.860> they<00:01:04.979> basically<00:01:05.339> did<00:01:05.580> with<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
time so what they basically did with the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.960 
time so what they basically did with the
UAB<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.380> they<00:01:07.380> took<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.590> out<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> sky<00:01:08.340> it's

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
UAB is they took it out of the sky it's

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.660 
UAB is they took it out of the sky it's
no<00:01:09.090> longer<00:01:09.240> our<00:01:09.360> UAV<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.470> SATCOM<00:01:10.740> which<00:01:11.520> is

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
no longer our UAV it's a SATCOM which is

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.820 
no longer our UAV it's a SATCOM which is
a<00:01:11.700> small<00:01:11.850> deployable<00:01:12.810> device<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.590> put

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
a small deployable device that you put

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.160 
a small deployable device that you put
into<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.250> onto<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.880> map<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.780> pretty<00:01:16.049> much

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
into it onto the map and you pretty much

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.020 
into it onto the map and you pretty much
have<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.439> hide<00:01:16.680> from<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.979> enemy<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.820> gives

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
have to hide from the enemy that gives

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.120 
have to hide from the enemy that gives
you<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> little<00:01:18.390> bit<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.659> insight<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.890> biggest

change<00:01:20.310> about<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> SATCOM<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:22.049> first<00:01:22.259> one

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
change about the SATCOM is the first one

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.580

longer<00:01:25.950> does<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.220> give<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.580> entire<00:01:26.700> field

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
longer does it give you the entire field

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.300 
longer does it give you the entire field

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
teammates will show up on the minimap so

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.880 
teammates will show up on the minimap so
anybody<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.220> your<00:01:38.490> teammates<00:01:38.970> will<00:01:39.180> see<00:01:39.479> or

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
do see will show up on the minimap I

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.179 
do see will show up on the minimap I
feel<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.340> isn't<00:01:45.560> going<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.680> help<00:01:46.890> me

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
feel like this isn't going to help me

feel like this isn't going to help me
that<00:01:48.149> much<00:01:48.180> they'll<00:01:49.110> give<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
that much they'll give you the

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.969 
that much they'll give you the
essentially<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.149> first<00:01:51.420> UAB<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:52.590> gives<00:01:52.799> you

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
essentially the first UAB just gives you

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.170 
essentially the first UAB just gives you
a<00:01:53.659> general<00:01:54.659> idea<00:01:55.460> where<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.549> enemy<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:56.880> at

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
a general idea where the enemy is at
