today<00:00:04.589> I'm<00:00:04.740> going<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:04.890> be<00:00:04.950> doing<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.279> really

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
today I'm going to be doing a really

today I'm going to be doing a really
simple<00:00:06.060> really<00:00:06.120> quick<00:00:06.629> tutorial<00:00:07.109> on<00:00:07.230> how<00:00:07.290> to

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
simple really quick tutorial on how to

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.709 
simple really quick tutorial on how to
do<00:00:07.799> teleporting<00:00:08.639> now<00:00:09.150> this<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.420> something<00:00:09.599> a

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
do teleporting now this is something a

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.419 
do teleporting now this is something a
lot<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.900> people<00:00:09.990> requested<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:10.889> I<00:00:11.190> haven't

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
lot of people requested and I haven't

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.610 
lot of people requested and I haven't
really<00:00:11.610> gotten<00:00:11.790> around<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.150> it<00:00:12.240> till<00:00:12.540> now<00:00:12.719> just

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
really gotten around to it till now just

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.790 
really gotten around to it till now just
because<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.460> incredibly<00:00:15.030> easy<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.450> do

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
because it is incredibly easy to do

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.200 
because it is incredibly easy to do
don't<00:00:16.800> take<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.279> me<00:00:17.460> trying<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.940> say<00:00:18.180> I

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
don't take that is me trying to say I

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.590 
don't take that is me trying to say I
know<00:00:18.630> everything<00:00:19.050> but<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.250> code<00:00:20.490> itself<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:21.210> a

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
know everything but the code itself is a

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.109 
know everything but the code itself is a
little<00:00:22.289> convoluted<00:00:23.189> it's<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.730> kind<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:23.970> thing

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
little convoluted it's the kind of thing

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.580 
little convoluted it's the kind of thing
that's<00:00:24.300> hard<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.539> figure<00:00:24.720> out<00:00:24.930> on<00:00:25.050> your<00:00:25.080> own<00:00:25.230> I

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
that's hard to figure out on your own I

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.650 
that's hard to figure out on your own I
did<00:00:26.189> but<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.490> took<00:00:26.609> several<00:00:26.880> hours<00:00:27.090> of

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
did but it took several hours of

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.990 
did but it took several hours of
knocking<00:00:28.529> my<00:00:28.619> head<00:00:28.800> against<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.189> desk<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.970> I

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
knocking my head against the desk so I

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.089 
knocking my head against the desk so I
understand<00:00:30.570> why<00:00:31.260> it's<00:00:31.529> frustrating<00:00:31.949> to

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
understand why it's frustrating to

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.380 
understand why it's frustrating to
people<00:00:32.369> but<00:00:32.460> once<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.730> figure<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.059> out<00:00:33.149> it's

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
people but once you figure it out it's

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.750 
people but once you figure it out it's
really<00:00:33.780> only<00:00:34.020> one<00:00:34.320> or<00:00:34.440> two<00:00:34.469> lines<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.890> code<00:00:35.070> so

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
really only one or two lines of code so

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.280 
really only one or two lines of code so
first<00:00:36.000> I've<00:00:36.210> got<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.510> little<00:00:36.690> station<00:00:37.140> here

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
first I've got this little station here

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.530 
first I've got this little station here
this<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.070> all<00:00:38.280> irrelevant<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.180> just<00:00:39.390> to

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
this is all irrelevant this is just to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.510 
this is all irrelevant this is just to
make<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.719> look<00:00:39.840> nice<00:00:40.200> when<00:00:40.829> we<00:00:40.980> interact<00:00:41.399> with

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
make it look nice when we interact with

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.529 
make it look nice when we interact with
this<00:00:41.790> box<00:00:43.219> we<00:00:44.219> instantly<00:00:44.670> teleport<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.300> here

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
this box we instantly teleport up here

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.690 
this box we instantly teleport up here
which<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.350> higher<00:00:46.620> up<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.129> canyon

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
which is just higher up in the canyon

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.729 
which is just higher up in the canyon
and<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:47.910> think<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.210> looks<00:00:48.239> really<00:00:49.230> cool<00:00:49.530> from

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
and I think it looks really cool from

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.770 
and I think it looks really cool from
here<00:00:49.950> go<00:00:50.730> swimming<00:00:51.980> jump<00:00:52.980> off<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.340> edge<00:00:53.780> and

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
here go swimming jump off the edge and

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.600 
here go swimming jump off the edge and
we're<00:00:54.960> back<00:00:55.079> down<00:00:55.320> here<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.860> does<00:00:56.160> work<00:00:56.370> both

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
we're back down here it does work both

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.670 
we're back down here it does work both
ways<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:57.840> teleport<00:00:58.170> up<00:00:58.289> there<00:00:58.469> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
ways so I can teleport up there and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.580 
ways so I can teleport up there and
teleport<00:00:59.460> back<00:00:59.579> now<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.840> may<00:01:00.989> notice<00:01:01.020> that's

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
teleport back now you may notice that's

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.070 
teleport back now you may notice that's
a<00:01:01.680> bit<00:01:01.949> herky<00:01:02.489> jerky<00:01:02.780> it's<00:01:03.780> it's

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
a bit herky jerky it's it's

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.070 
a bit herky jerky it's it's
instantaneous<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.430> little<00:01:05.640> bit<00:01:05.760> fast<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.570> first

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
instantaneous a little bit fast so first

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.000 
instantaneous a little bit fast so first
I'm<00:01:07.200> going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.350> show<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.530> how<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.680> do<00:01:07.830> this

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
I'm going to show you how to do this

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.700 
I'm going to show you how to do this
it's<00:01:09.000> instant<00:01:09.540> meaning<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.260> if<00:01:10.439> you're<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.650> a

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
it's instant meaning that if you're in a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.740 
it's instant meaning that if you're in a
combat<00:01:11.130> situation<00:01:11.189> or<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> high-speed

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
combat situation or a high-speed

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.140 
combat situation or a high-speed
situation<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.920> should<00:01:13.950> go<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.430> an<00:01:14.700> instant

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
situation you should go with an instant

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.300 
situation you should go with an instant
teleport<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:16.619> what<00:01:16.740> we're<00:01:16.830> going<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.009> do<00:01:17.130> is

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
teleport so what we're going to do is

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.149 
teleport so what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:18.000> going<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.299> go<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:19.140> box<00:01:19.530> here<00:01:19.860> this

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
we're going to go to this box here this

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.800 
we're going to go to this box here this
is<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.400> box<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.759> you're<00:01:20.939> interacting<00:01:21.240> with

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
is the box that you're interacting with

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.560 
is the box that you're interacting with
to<00:01:22.470> teleport<00:01:23.130> now<00:01:23.759> if<00:01:23.970> you're<00:01:24.150> going<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.420> be

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
to teleport now if you're going to be

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.690 
to teleport now if you're going to be
having<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.200> button<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.860> you're<00:01:26.130> assigning<00:01:26.460> to

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
having a button that you're assigning to

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.060 
having a button that you're assigning to
teleport<00:01:27.150> then<00:01:27.900> you'd<00:01:28.200> put<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.590> code<00:01:28.829> in

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
teleport then you'd put this code in

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.990 
teleport then you'd put this code in
your<00:01:29.100> player<00:01:29.509> after<00:01:31.369> that<00:01:32.369> button<00:01:32.670> press<00:01:32.850> so

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
your player after that button press so

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.700 
your player after that button press so
what<00:01:33.090> we're<00:01:33.180> gonna<00:01:33.270> do<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.740> when<00:01:36.020> interacted

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
what we're gonna do is when interacted

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.500 
what we're gonna do is when interacted
we're<00:01:39.610> going<00:01:39.729> to<00:01:39.790> create<00:01:39.880> a<00:01:40.000> child<00:01:40.240> line<00:01:40.390> of

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
we're going to create a child line of

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.670 
we're going to create a child line of
code<00:01:40.630> appear<00:01:40.869> chime<00:01:41.080> line<00:01:41.229> of<00:01:41.320> code<00:01:41.440> you<00:01:41.560> make

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
code appear chime line of code you make

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.260 
code appear chime line of code you make
a<00:01:41.710> new<00:01:41.830> line<00:01:42.010> of<00:01:42.040> code<00:01:42.250> select<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.119> number

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
a new line of code select the number

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.230 
a new line of code select the number
bump<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.110> right<00:01:44.260> now<00:01:44.440> this<00:01:44.590> line<00:01:44.830> of<00:01:44.950> code

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
bump to the right now this line of code

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.440 
bump to the right now this line of code
won't<00:01:46.240> happen<00:01:46.479> until<00:01:46.900> this<00:01:47.560> line<00:01:47.830> of<00:01:47.979> code<00:01:48.159> is

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
won't happen until this line of code is

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.749 
won't happen until this line of code is
met<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.619> what<00:01:50.710> we're<00:01:50.800> going<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:50.979> do<00:01:51.070> here<00:01:51.100> is

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.969 

we're<00:01:54.759> going<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:54.909> do<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.360> it<00:01:55.840> is<00:01:56.350> referring<00:01:56.800> to

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
we're going to do it it is referring to

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.010 
we're going to do it it is referring to
whatever<00:01:57.580> is<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:58.030> thing<00:01:58.210> that<00:01:58.240> interacted

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
whatever is the thing that interacted

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.850 
whatever is the thing that interacted
with<00:01:59.229> this<00:01:59.590> device<00:02:00.550> it<00:02:03.600> position<00:02:04.619> which<00:02:05.619> is

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
with this device it position which is

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.800 
with this device it position which is
right<00:02:06.610> here<00:02:06.640> its<00:02:07.060> position<00:02:08.050> is<00:02:08.880> equal<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:10.179> now

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
right here its position is equal to now

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.910 
right here its position is equal to now
I<00:02:11.100> it's<00:02:12.100> important<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.640> have<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.820> logic<00:02:13.330> cube<00:02:13.630> at

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
I it's important to have a logic cube at

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.699 
I it's important to have a logic cube at
your<00:02:14.920> teleport<00:02:15.489> locations<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:17.080> have<00:02:17.500> us

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
your teleport locations and I have us

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.490 
your teleport locations and I have us
made<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.280> second<00:02:18.910> teleport<00:02:19.660> location<00:02:20.170> appear

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
made a second teleport location appear

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.580 
made a second teleport location appear
with<00:02:21.070> a<00:02:21.280> logic<00:02:21.970> Q<00:02:22.209> logic<00:02:23.170> cubes<00:02:23.260> you'd<00:02:23.500> be

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
with a logic Q logic cubes you'd be

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.460 
with a logic Q logic cubes you'd be
invincible<00:02:23.860> or<00:02:24.360> invisible<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.600> non<00:02:26.019> kaleido

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
invincible or invisible and non kaleido

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.240 
invincible or invisible and non kaleido
below<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:27.280> select<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.350> then<00:02:29.350> logic

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
below you select that and then logic

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.530 
below you select that and then logic
cube<00:02:31.200> position<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.730> what<00:02:33.820> this<00:02:33.940> does<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.480> it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
cube position so what this does is it

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.720 
cube position so what this does is it
will<00:02:34.930> make<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.320> position<00:02:35.800> of<00:02:35.920> our<00:02:36.070> object<00:02:36.580> the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
will make the position of our object the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.930 
will make the position of our object the
same<00:02:37.000> as<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.480> position<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.260> logic<00:02:38.680> cube

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
same as the position of the logic cube

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.930 
same as the position of the logic cube
pretty<00:02:39.940> simple<00:02:40.330> right<00:02:41.040> yeah<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.310> is<00:02:42.459> is<00:02:42.640> it

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
pretty simple right yeah it is is it

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.130 
pretty simple right yeah it is is it
really<00:02:43.180> is<00:02:43.299> just<00:02:43.329> that<00:02:43.750> simple<00:02:44.019> um<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:46.150> let's

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
really is just that simple um so let's

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.979 
really is just that simple um so let's
try<00:02:47.320> it<00:02:47.380> out

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.420 

that's<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.200> easiest<00:02:54.650> way<00:02:54.890> to<00:02:54.950> teleport

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
that's the easiest way to teleport

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.240 
that's the easiest way to teleport
around<00:02:55.580> is<00:02:55.970> to<00:02:56.030> put<00:02:56.870> logic<00:02:57.620> cubes<00:02:57.829> where<00:02:58.159> you

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
around is to put logic cubes where you

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.210 
around is to put logic cubes where you
want<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.519> teleport<00:02:58.909> and<00:02:59.120> then<00:03:00.220> position

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
want to teleport and then position

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.600 
want to teleport and then position
equals<00:03:01.420> logic<00:03:02.420> you<00:03:02.569> so<00:03:03.140> let's<00:03:03.409> interact<00:03:03.769> poof

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
equals logic you so let's interact poof

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.259 
equals logic you so let's interact poof
and<00:03:04.909> we're<00:03:05.629> there<00:03:05.840> now<00:03:06.579> there's<00:03:07.579> two<00:03:07.790> things<00:03:08.000> I

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
and we're there now there's two things I

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.190 
and we're there now there's two things I
want<00:03:08.299> to<00:03:08.480> point<00:03:08.540> out<00:03:09.819> before<00:03:10.819> before<00:03:11.599> I<00:03:11.810> go<00:03:12.170> any

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
want to point out before before I go any

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.830 
want to point out before before I go any
farther<00:03:12.519> first<00:03:13.519> if<00:03:13.909> you're<00:03:14.599> looking<00:03:14.810> for

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
farther first if you're looking for

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.930 
farther first if you're looking for
something<00:03:15.079> a<00:03:15.200> little<00:03:15.230> flash<00:03:15.650> here<00:03:15.980> or<00:03:16.129> if<00:03:16.790> you

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
something a little flash here or if you

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.610 
something a little flash here or if you
don't<00:03:17.269> like<00:03:17.569> coding<00:03:18.079> you<00:03:18.319> can<00:03:18.440> go<00:03:18.560> to

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
don't like coding you can go to

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.619 
don't like coding you can go to
assemblies<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:22.340> can<00:03:22.519> grab<00:03:22.730> this<00:03:22.970> two-way

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
assemblies and you can grab this two-way

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.030 
assemblies and you can grab this two-way
teleporter<00:03:24.640> assembly<00:03:26.349> so<00:03:27.349> you<00:03:27.409> can<00:03:27.829> take

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
teleporter assembly so you can take

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.149 
teleporter assembly so you can take
these<00:03:28.190> to<00:03:28.540> teleport<00:03:29.540> pads<00:03:29.859> put<00:03:30.859> them<00:03:30.950> wherever

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 
these to teleport pads put them wherever

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:33.699 
these to teleport pads put them wherever
you<00:03:31.340> want<00:03:31.639> and<00:03:31.819> you<00:03:31.909> can<00:03:32.750> teleport<00:03:33.230> between

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
you want and you can teleport between

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.729 
you want and you can teleport between
them<00:03:33.920> when<00:03:34.250> you<00:03:34.430> interact<00:03:34.819> with<00:03:35.120> them<00:03:35.739> really

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
them when you interact with them really

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.589 
them when you interact with them really
simple<00:03:37.099> to<00:03:37.129> do<00:03:37.340> it's<00:03:37.819> pretty<00:03:38.030> much<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.269> same

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
simple to do it's pretty much the same

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.190 
simple to do it's pretty much the same
code<00:03:39.489> there's<00:03:40.489> some<00:03:40.700> other<00:03:41.329> stuff<00:03:41.569> in<00:03:42.019> here

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
code there's some other stuff in here

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.770 
code there's some other stuff in here
about<00:03:42.349> powering<00:03:43.040> up<00:03:43.250> so<00:03:43.489> it<00:03:43.579> looks<00:03:43.790> nicer<00:03:44.209> but

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
about powering up so it looks nicer but

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:52.539 
about powering up so it looks nicer but
it's<00:03:45.079> the<00:03:45.290> same<00:03:45.470> thing<00:03:45.799> so<00:03:47.620> sing<00:03:51.340> there<00:03:52.340> we<00:03:52.489> go

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
it's the same thing so sing there we go

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.550 
it's the same thing so sing there we go
simple<00:03:52.909> as<00:03:53.000> that<00:03:53.049> so<00:03:54.049> if<00:03:54.139> you<00:03:54.230> need<00:03:54.409> to<00:03:54.500> just

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
simple as that so if you need to just

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.869 
simple as that so if you need to just
throw<00:03:54.920> something<00:03:55.159> in<00:03:55.370> your<00:03:55.549> world<00:03:55.700> to

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
throw something in your world to

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.970 
throw something in your world to
teleport<00:03:56.299> no<00:03:56.510> problem<00:03:56.870> also<00:03:57.290> something

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
teleport no problem also something

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.069 
teleport no problem also something
that's<00:03:58.099> simpler<00:03:58.669> this<00:03:59.180> is<00:03:59.329> just<00:03:59.510> something

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
that's simpler this is just something

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:01.990 
that's simpler this is just something
that<00:04:00.260> you<00:04:00.799> know<00:04:00.919> this<00:04:01.280> is<00:04:01.310> not<00:04:01.549> related<00:04:01.760> to

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
that you know this is not related to

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.610 
that you know this is not related to
teleporting<00:04:02.510> but<00:04:02.750> I<00:04:02.959> feel<00:04:03.379> it's<00:04:03.560> worth

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
teleporting but I feel it's worth

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.270 
teleporting but I feel it's worth
mentioning<00:04:04.160> if<00:04:05.120> you<00:04:05.389> don't<00:04:05.629> want<00:04:05.989> this<00:04:06.470> symbol

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
mentioning if you don't want this symbol

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.970 
mentioning if you don't want this symbol
or<00:04:07.549> this<00:04:07.819> shape<00:04:08.209> you<00:04:08.750> can<00:04:08.989> go<00:04:09.199> to<00:04:09.260> swap<00:04:09.650> mesh

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
or this shape you can go to swap mesh

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.349 
or this shape you can go to swap mesh
and<00:04:12.010> change<00:04:13.010> this<00:04:13.250> mess<00:04:13.549> out<00:04:13.790> with<00:04:14.030> just<00:04:14.239> about

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
and change this mess out with just about

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:15.970 
and change this mess out with just about
anything<00:04:14.629> you<00:04:14.810> want<00:04:15.139> and<00:04:15.319> all<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.620> code<00:04:15.829> is

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
anything you want and all the code is

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.469 
anything you want and all the code is
still<00:04:16.160> there<00:04:16.370> so<00:04:16.880> I'm<00:04:17.030> gonna<00:04:17.090> get<00:04:17.329> rid<00:04:17.389> of

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
still there so I'm gonna get rid of

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.279 
still there so I'm gonna get rid of
those<00:04:18.789> all<00:04:19.789> right<00:04:20.269> now<00:04:20.539> what<00:04:20.720> next<00:04:20.989> one<00:04:21.229> I'm

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
those all right now what next one I'm

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:22.180 
those all right now what next one I'm
going<00:04:21.410> to<00:04:21.470> show<00:04:21.590> you<00:04:21.650> is<00:04:21.859> I'm<00:04:21.949> going<00:04:22.039> to<00:04:22.130> show

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
going to show you is I'm going to show

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.529 
going to show you is I'm going to show
you<00:04:22.280> how<00:04:22.340> to<00:04:22.460> make<00:04:22.520> this<00:04:22.639> transition<00:04:23.120> a<00:04:23.360> little

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
you how to make this transition a little

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.740 
you how to make this transition a little
smoother<00:04:24.380> this<00:04:25.220> way<00:04:25.430> it's<00:04:25.669> not<00:04:25.820> a<00:04:25.880> hard<00:04:26.270> bang

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
smoother this way it's not a hard bang

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.839 
smoother this way it's not a hard bang
when<00:04:27.349> you<00:04:27.470> teleport<00:04:28.130> we're<00:04:28.550> gonna<00:04:28.639> have<00:04:28.820> a

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
when you teleport we're gonna have a

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.330 
when you teleport we're gonna have a
fade<00:04:29.180> to<00:04:29.449> black<00:04:29.660> this<00:04:30.590> is<00:04:30.800> nice<00:04:31.010> if<00:04:31.220> you're

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
fade to black this is nice if you're

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.890 
fade to black this is nice if you're
teleporting<00:04:31.820> between<00:04:32.120> two<00:04:32.240> places<00:04:32.419> and<00:04:32.810> it's

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
teleporting between two places and it's

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.750 
teleporting between two places and it's
not<00:04:33.050> a<00:04:33.080> high-speed<00:04:33.530> environment<00:04:34.039> or<00:04:34.340> if

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
not a high-speed environment or if

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.270 
not a high-speed environment or if
you're<00:04:34.940> teleporting<00:04:35.539> into<00:04:35.960> let's<00:04:36.770> say<00:04:36.889> let's

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
you're teleporting into let's say let's

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.760 
you're teleporting into let's say let's
say<00:04:37.400> you're<00:04:37.520> going<00:04:37.789> inside<00:04:38.389> of<00:04:38.570> a<00:04:38.630> house<00:04:38.840> but

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
say you're going inside of a house but

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.529 
say you're going inside of a house but
you're<00:04:40.490> actually<00:04:40.639> teleporting<00:04:41.210> to<00:04:41.330> another

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
you're actually teleporting to another

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.200 
you're actually teleporting to another
location<00:04:41.830> that<00:04:42.830> is<00:04:43.220> like<00:04:43.520> the<00:04:43.550> interior<00:04:44.060> of

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
location that is like the interior of

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.589 
location that is like the interior of
the<00:04:44.690> house<00:04:44.810> so<00:04:45.639> what<00:04:46.639> I'm<00:04:46.699> gonna<00:04:46.789> do<00:04:47.000> get<00:04:47.479> rid

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
the house so what I'm gonna do get rid

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:50.800 
the house so what I'm gonna do get rid
of<00:04:47.659> this<00:04:47.780> line<00:04:47.990> of<00:04:48.110> code<00:04:48.430> when<00:04:49.510> keep<00:04:50.510> doing

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
of this line of code when keep doing

black to know black back to normal so
let's<00:05:36.860> see<00:05:37.040> countdown<00:05:37.640> timer<00:05:38.170> 1<00:05:39.170> which<00:05:40.160> is

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
let's see countdown timer 1 which is

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.430 
let's see countdown timer 1 which is
exactly<00:05:40.460> at<00:05:40.940> one<00:05:41.330> second<00:05:41.840> the<00:05:41.930> screen<00:05:42.200> will<00:05:42.320> be

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
exactly at one second the screen will be

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.570 
exactly at one second the screen will be
completely<00:05:42.860> black<00:05:43.220> then<00:05:44.980> for<00:05:45.980> this<00:05:46.220> we'll

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
completely black then for this we'll

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.670 
completely black then for this we'll
need<00:05:46.610> to<00:05:46.880> actually<00:05:47.030> use<00:05:47.630> the<00:05:47.840> in-game<00:05:48.350> picker

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
need to actually use the in-game picker

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:55.270 
need to actually use the in-game picker
to<00:05:49.040> pick<00:05:49.250> our<00:05:49.490> player<00:05:52.270> so<00:05:53.270> when<00:05:53.530> or<00:05:54.530> we're

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
to pick our player so when or we're

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.500 
to pick our player so when or we're
going<00:05:55.400> to<00:05:55.460> have<00:05:55.610> our<00:05:55.640> player<00:05:56.290> position<00:05:58.510> equal

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
going to have our player position equal

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.070 
going to have our player position equal
to<00:05:59.950> let's<00:06:00.950> go<00:06:01.070> grab<00:06:01.250> our<00:06:01.480> logic<00:06:02.480> cube<00:06:02.720> up<00:06:02.870> here

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
to let's go grab our logic cube up here

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:10.360 
to let's go grab our logic cube up here
again<00:06:05.470> logic<00:06:06.470> cube<00:06:08.260> position<00:06:09.260> there<00:06:10.010> we<00:06:10.190> go

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
again logic cube position there we go

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.510 
again logic cube position there we go
and<00:06:11.410> just<00:06:12.410> to<00:06:12.530> make<00:06:12.560> the<00:06:12.740> cosmetics<00:06:13.310> look<00:06:13.430> a

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
and just to make the cosmetics look a

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.010 
and just to make the cosmetics look a
little<00:06:13.670> better<00:06:13.880> we're<00:06:14.570> going<00:06:14.690> to<00:06:14.750> do<00:06:14.870> another

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
little better we're going to do another

little better we're going to do another

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:29.420 
will make the transition look much nicer

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.770 
will make the transition look much nicer
and<00:06:29.870> much<00:06:30.140> better<00:06:30.470> than<00:06:30.740> just<00:06:31.010> a<00:06:31.160> quick<00:06:31.780> poof

that<00:06:35.510> high-speed<00:06:35.750> turn<00:06:36.290> around<00:06:36.620> but<00:06:37.100> if

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
that high-speed turn around but if

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.580

you're<00:06:37.310> not<00:06:37.430> in<00:06:37.610> combat<00:06:37.820> this<00:06:38.660> looks<00:06:38.900> a<00:06:39.080> lot

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
you're not in combat this looks a lot

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:45.090

nicer<00:06:39.650> so<00:06:40.640> let's<00:06:41.480> interact<00:06:43.180> fade<00:06:44.180> to<00:06:44.330> black

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.100 
nicer so let's interact fade to black

nicer so let's interact fade to black
see<00:06:46.100> how<00:06:46.250> much<00:06:46.400> nicer<00:06:46.460> that<00:06:47.060> was<00:06:47.300> that<00:06:48.170> was

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.320

see how much nicer that was that was
wonderful<00:06:48.710> as<00:06:48.980> opposed<00:06:49.400> to<00:06:49.670> boo
