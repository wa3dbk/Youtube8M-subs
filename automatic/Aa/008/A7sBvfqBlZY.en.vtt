00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
powerful walking around with this thing

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.550 
powerful walking around with this thing
it<00:00:18.029> just<00:00:18.210> sounds<00:00:18.660> cool<00:00:18.960> when<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.260> use<00:00:19.410> it

it just sounds cool when you use it

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.439 
it just sounds cool when you use it
unless<00:00:19.710> uses<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> suppressor<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.820> it's<00:00:21.300> really

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
unless uses a suppressor and it's really

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.269 
unless uses a suppressor and it's really
not<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.689> great<00:00:22.199> with<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.560> suppressor<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.250> I

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
not that great with a suppressor so I

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.620 
not that great with a suppressor so I
wouldn't<00:00:23.609> recommend<00:00:23.820> using<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.240> suppressor

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630

gun<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.770> what<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.430> use<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:24.030> gun<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
gun so what I use for this gun is the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.960 
gun so what I use for this gun is the
muzzle<00:01:25.590> brake<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> angled<00:01:26.580> grip<00:01:26.580> because

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
muzzle brake and the angled grip because

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.630 
muzzle brake and the angled grip because
when<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.780> while<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.500> was<00:01:28.680> using<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:28.979> gun<00:01:29.040> those

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
when I while I was using this gun those

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.999 
when I while I was using this gun those
are<00:01:29.790> probably<00:01:30.540> one<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> more<00:01:31.470> early<00:01:31.829> ones

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
are probably one of the more early ones

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.620 
are probably one of the more early ones
I<00:01:32.130> unlocked<00:01:32.400> was<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.700> muzzle<00:01:33.000> brake<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.329> angled

grip<00:01:33.689> because<00:01:33.990> when<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.619> would<00:01:34.860> switch<00:01:35.100> either

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
grip because when I would switch either

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.100 
grip because when I would switch either
of<00:01:35.610> those<00:01:35.759> out<00:01:36.060> with<00:01:36.450> something<00:01:36.689> else<00:01:36.930> and

able to kill people but I it was it was

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.149 
able to kill people but I it was it was
a<00:01:42.000> much<00:01:42.270> less<00:01:42.570> effective<00:01:43.110> gun<00:01:43.320> when<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.950> have

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
a much less effective gun when you have

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.560 
a much less effective gun when you have
the<00:01:44.280> muzzle<00:01:44.579> brake<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.270> angled

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the muzzle brake and you have the angled

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.210 
the muzzle brake and you have the angled
grip up<00:01:46.020> close<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.799> kill<00:01:46.979> three<00:01:47.189> people

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
grip up close you can kill three people

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.429 
grip up close you can kill three people
no<00:01:47.670> problem<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.329> add<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> medium<00:01:48.960> distance<00:01:49.350> you

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
no problem and add a medium distance you

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.539 
no problem and add a medium distance you
can<00:01:49.560> kill<00:01:49.799> two<00:01:50.399> people<00:01:50.430> with<00:01:50.880> no<00:01:51.000> problem<00:01:51.450> so

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
can kill two people with no problem so

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.950 
can kill two people with no problem so
don't<00:01:53.549> switch<00:01:53.850> those<00:01:54.030> ones<00:01:54.210> out<00:01:54.390> if<00:01:54.600> you

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
don't switch those ones out if you

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.359 
don't switch those ones out if you
listen<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.259> any<00:01:55.380> my<00:01:55.590> reviews<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.070> actually

follow these recommendations it's okay

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.990 
follow these recommendations it's okay
if<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.040> switch<00:01:59.189> out<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.430> hollow<00:01:59.640> or<00:01:59.939> the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
if you switch out the hollow or the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.149 
if you switch out the hollow or the
laser<00:02:00.210> sight<00:02:00.509> those<00:02:01.259> ones<00:02:01.439> didn't<00:02:01.740> matter<00:02:01.890> as

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
laser sight those ones didn't matter as

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.310 
laser sight those ones didn't matter as
much<00:02:02.189> as<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.000> muzzle<00:02:03.360> brake<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.930> angled

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
much as the muzzle brake and the angled

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.690 
much as the muzzle brake and the angled
grip<00:02:04.790> so<00:02:05.790> with<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.780> being<00:02:06.990> said<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:08.310> only

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
grip so with that being said the only

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.219 
grip so with that being said the only
downside<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.450> gun<00:02:09.660> with<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.959> being<00:02:10.110> a
