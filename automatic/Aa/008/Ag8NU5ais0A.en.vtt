I've got my heroes to do the tankage at
the<00:00:20.970> start<00:00:21.270> because<00:00:21.539> my<00:00:21.900> Wizards<00:00:22.410> are<00:00:22.529> quite

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
the start because my Wizards are quite

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.910 
the start because my Wizards are quite
flimsy<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.990> some<00:00:24.990> just<00:00:25.320> work<00:00:25.470> away<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.800> this

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
that phat loot so at this stage I was a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.400 
that phat loot so at this stage I was a
bit<00:00:47.370> worried<00:00:47.760> because<00:00:48.079> everything<00:00:49.079> was<00:00:49.170> going

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
bit worried because everything was going

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.740 
bit worried because everything was going
on<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.590> outside<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.280> all<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.120> defenses<00:00:51.629> are

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
on the outside and all the defenses are

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.319 
on the outside and all the defenses are

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
in the center and I was worried that

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.439 
in the center and I was worried that
there<00:00:54.510> was<00:00:54.629> not<00:00:54.809> going<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.170> many<00:00:56.449> visits

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449

left<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.020> i'm<00:00:58.230> pretty<00:00:59.100> sure<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.210> BK

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
left and i'm pretty sure that the BK

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.429 
left and i'm pretty sure that the BK
dies<00:01:00.899> very<00:01:01.680> soon<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.480> so<00:01:03.480> there's<00:01:03.750> wizards<00:01:04.350> in

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439

giant bombs which I tripped over at the
start<00:01:18.299> there<00:01:18.570> which<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.990> quite<00:01:19.320> unfortunate

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
start there which is quite unfortunate

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.370 
start there which is quite unfortunate
because<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.189> lost<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.640> lot<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> wizards<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.420> this

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
because I lost a lot of wizards and this

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.080 
because I lost a lot of wizards and this
base<00:01:22.650> should<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.009> been<00:01:23.130> knocked<00:01:23.400> out<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.700> lot

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
base should have been knocked out a lot

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.210 
base should have been knocked out a lot
more<00:01:24.270> faster<00:01:24.720> than<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:24.990> should<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.890> here<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.189> go

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
more faster than it should so here we go

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.340 
more faster than it should so here we go
got<00:01:26.970> one<00:01:27.180> more<00:01:27.330> visit<00:01:27.570> out<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.840> worry<00:01:28.200> about

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.390 
but we're going to get all the loot
anyway<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:31.140> bee<00:01:31.290> caves<00:01:31.619> suddenly<00:01:32.250> just

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
anyway and the bee caves suddenly just

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.609 
anyway and the bee caves suddenly just
dies<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.720> we've<00:01:33.720> got<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> few<00:01:34.020> defenses<00:01:34.439> left

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
dies and we've got a few defenses left

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.740 
dies and we've got a few defenses left
but<00:01:34.770> look<00:01:34.920> at<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.100> dps<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.939> those<00:01:36.270> wizards

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
but look at the dps on those wizards

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.260 
but look at the dps on those wizards
they're<00:01:37.320> smashing<00:01:37.920> everything<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:39.150> they

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
they're smashing everything that they

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.660 
they're smashing everything that they
can<00:01:39.329> see<00:01:39.750> especially<00:01:40.710> because<00:01:41.340> there's<00:01:41.579> not

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
can see especially because there's not

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.730 
can see especially because there's not
many<00:01:41.820> left<00:01:42.180> but<00:01:42.869> there's<00:01:43.110> still<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.380> lot<00:01:43.710> of

many left but there's still a lot of

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.690 
many left but there's still a lot of
damage<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:45.259> unleash<00:01:46.259> on<00:01:46.500> those<00:01:46.829> defenses<00:01:47.520> so

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
damage to unleash on those defenses so

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.580 
damage to unleash on those defenses so
we<00:01:47.880> could<00:01:48.030> just<00:01:48.060> wrapping<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.659> up<00:01:48.720> now<00:01:48.780> we<00:01:49.439> got

prematurely I used it because I you know
I<00:03:13.170> was<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:13.590> focused<00:03:13.860> on<00:03:14.280> healing<00:03:14.610> everything<00:03:15.060> I

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.520 
I was so focused on healing everything I
thought<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.450> Queen<00:03:15.660> was<00:03:15.780> actually<00:03:16.110> gonna<00:03:16.260> die

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
thought the Queen was actually gonna die

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.550 
thought the Queen was actually gonna die
it<00:03:16.590> I<00:03:16.920> was<00:03:17.340> dying<00:03:17.580> earlier<00:03:17.820> so<00:03:18.540> we<00:03:18.570> got<00:03:18.990> one

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
it I was dying earlier so we got one

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.380 
it I was dying earlier so we got one
more<00:03:19.590> whisked<00:03:19.980> out<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.190> worry<00:03:20.370> about<00:03:20.520> a<00:03:20.850> few

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
more zaps on that wins tower I think

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.410

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
would totally not have three start this

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.790 
would totally not have three start this
space<00:03:51.270> so<00:03:51.510> there<00:03:51.690> we<00:03:51.780> go<00:03:51.810> Ben<00:03:52.170> imagine<00:03:52.740> this

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800

a decent amount of lune there um so the

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.479 
a decent amount of lune there um so the
walls<00:04:15.420> are<00:04:15.600> better<00:04:15.830> the<00:04:16.830> defense<00:04:17.070> isabella

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
walls are better the defense isabella

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.130 
walls are better the defense isabella
but<00:04:17.730> there's<00:04:17.880> some<00:04:18.000> decent<00:04:18.180> loot<00:04:18.570> still<00:04:18.900> and

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140
