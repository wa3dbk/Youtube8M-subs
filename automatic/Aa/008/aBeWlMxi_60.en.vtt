00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.799
 Hello, now on the market 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.019
 a lot of professional 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.700
 devices for creating design 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.980
 one last flop came 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.350
 material that allows you to create 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.439
 nail effect natural velvet 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.109
 these nails look very solemn 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.650
 working with material is quite simple 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.330
 and the effect is to strike even the most sophisticated 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.580
 to work with the flock, we need 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.700
 a special device is an apparatus 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.000
 which is called flag ider such a hole 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.870
 there are two wires 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.070
 thin and thicker at the end of a thin robot 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.100
 you will see 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.180
 tucked crocodile and also included 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.450
 protective screen 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.260
 need crocodile protection attach to 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.000
 protective 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.270
 the screen and then you can already connect 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.030
 apparatus in the network in order to 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.879
 further it was possible to work with him 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:07.619
 also on the ideer flag itself and there is a red one 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:11.369
 button switch that starts 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.580
 the work of the device itself when turned on 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.490
 button lights up red indicator on 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.119
 bottom flag aydar flag ah yes you can 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.369
 Only disassemble inoperative 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:28.680
 thus unscrew the top 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:31.500
 cover we take the flag the flag is here with 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.450
 these jars of 4 grams it is packaged 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.810
 one jar of flock is enough for about 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:43.290
 4 treatments that is approximately 40 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:48.409
 fingers flag falls asleep itself during flac 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:51.409
 ider closes like this 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.409
 cap 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.880
 and when the machine is turned on you can already rap 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.600
 I continue to work with this device 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.980
 I 'll tell you later so I prepared 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.950
 the ideer flag to work connected it to the network 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:13.200
 I connected the protective screen further I 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:16.380
 I pick up the flag 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.430
 we have 9 times color glasses 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.240
 it is red and pink like that 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.150
 bright blue color is very beautiful 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:30.390
 saturated green beige 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:33.570
 yellow further note under 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.730
 mesh protective I put sheets 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.950
 clean paper so that when u 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.980
 I will be showered flag flag on 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.360
 a little piece of paper I could save it later 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.910
 back in a jar all add up 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.840
 Further on 2 fingers I wanted to you today 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:55.230
 show I have already applied a base coat 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:58.380
 I select the most suitable for the tone 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.630
 the color of ordinary varnish today I will show you 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:08.790
 drawing a bottle on a usual varnish and on 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:12.950
 gel varnish on our usual varnish 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.300
 the coating can be in two layers in 1 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.930
 see how you have it in density 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.930
 will fall 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:30.269
 give it a little dry in my 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.269
 case i will put 2 layers of color 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:43.880
 a little under the land and then put bare 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:47.840
 top coat dried a little 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.970
 apply topcoat color and not 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.290
 waiting for it to dry 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:58.250
 I turn the flag on the flag literally wait 2 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:02.870
 3 seconds model hand I put on 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.690
 protective screen and bring it neatly to 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:09.010
 selected finger 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:12.140
 caider and start or side to side 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:17.420
 no noise at the same time 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:19.070
 created turn it into different 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.210
 parties in order to 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:33.320
 the whole nail was completely filled 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:34.970
 flock after the flag we lay down 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:41.210
 quite dense layer 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:44.500
 I turn off the flag , we remove aside 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:49.700
 and neatly with a brush 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.640
 I look like a flag from the skin and an extra sign flag 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.790
 . coated 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:58.280
 the whole fleet that got on paper i 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.760
 I can gently pour back into 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.760
 jar 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.220
 so in order to clear the flag Eider 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:18.430
 here is a certain color flock me 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:22.030
 you must first disable it then 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.880
 open the cover idar flag and gently 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:30.940
 I pour the rest 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:32.770
 a bottle of varnish doing it all again on 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:38.020
 blank dots address 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:43.200
 the remains of the flock with a brush remove from 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:48.600
 flokator also cleaned carefully mesh 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:52.690
 from color and slime again. can 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:55.150
 transfer the flag to the jar to save 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:59.530
 on the next fingers i will show you 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:02.920
 flock applied to gel polish first i 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:07.090
 put a base covering fuse world 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:12.460
 blockage then apply a layer again 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:14.440
 See 1 2 layers for the need flag 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.260
 principle lies down as you can see 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:21.660
 on the first the fingers are tight enough and 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:26.520
 very well covers exactly the color 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:31.750
 so you can do with one layer 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:35.280
 Next, we will polymerize the color in the lamp after 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:41.230
 polymerization coating topcoat 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:45.820
 gel varnish as usual seal the butt 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:50.500
 polymerization food plugging flag ayder i 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:58.480
 already flooding burgundy in it 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:07:02.070
 shade and neatly distribute the flag on 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.070
 nail on the cover 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.610
 after flock distribution over the surface 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.460
 cover 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.430
 I put the pen back in the lamp for 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.110
 polymerization 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:21.370
 after polymerization gel varnish 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:26.620
 I neatly tidy foundation brush 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:29.690
 excess from the skin and from the surface of the coating 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:32.530
 this coating holds the same as 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:36.890
 lacquer that is about 5-7 days and 

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:40.010
 gel polish on average around 10 14 days 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:42.770
 you can safely do all the household chores 

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:46.460
 wet the handles are covered with nothing 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:49.010
 happen hope you enjoyed our 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:51.610
 video thank you all for your attention and 

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.610
 to new meetings
