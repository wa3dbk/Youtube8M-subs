00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
to maximize the CPU use it as much as it

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.300 
to maximize the CPU use it as much as it
can<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.360> really<00:01:33.810> make<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.170> device<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.740> speedy

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
can and really make this device a speedy

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.890 
can and really make this device a speedy
device<00:01:35.579> I'll<00:01:35.759> tell<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.060> after<00:01:36.360> hours<00:01:36.720> of

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
device I'll tell you after hours of

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.050 
device I'll tell you after hours of
playing<00:01:37.110> with<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.790> working<00:01:38.790> with<00:01:38.909> it

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
playing with this and working with it

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.210 
playing with this and working with it
I'm<00:01:39.210> really<00:01:39.630> impressed<00:01:40.020> at<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.770> speed<00:01:41.040> but

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
I'm really impressed at the speed but

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.649 
I'm really impressed at the speed but
you'll<00:01:41.340> see<00:01:41.490> some<00:01:41.520> differences<00:01:42.150> across<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
you'll see some differences across the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.300 
you'll see some differences across the
board<00:01:42.869> we<00:01:43.020> want<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.259> highlight<00:01:43.530> those<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
board we want to highlight those in the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.100 
board we want to highlight those in the
video<00:01:44.549> first<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.970> all<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> notifications<00:01:45.899> bar

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
video first of all the notifications bar

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.719 
video first of all the notifications bar
you'll<00:01:46.619> notice<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> little<00:01:47.310> bit<00:01:47.430> different

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
you'll notice is a little bit different

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.830 
you'll notice is a little bit different
the<00:01:47.790> clock<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.270> different<00:01:48.509> I'm<00:01:48.570> gonna<00:01:48.720> bring

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
the clock is different I'm gonna bring

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.330 
the clock is different I'm gonna bring
this<00:01:48.960> one<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.170> periodically<00:01:49.829> just<00:01:49.950> for

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
this one in periodically just for

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.069 
this one in periodically just for
comparison<00:01:50.640> reasons<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.720> can<00:01:51.840> see<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
comparison reasons and you can see the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.560 
comparison reasons and you can see the
differences<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.649> Android<00:01:53.310> 4.0<00:01:53.850> versus

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
differences in Android 4.0 versus

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.929 
differences in Android 4.0 versus
Android<00:01:55.100> 4.1<00:01:56.100> that's<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> way<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.670> looks<00:01:56.850> a

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
Android 4.1 that's the way it looks a

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:57.889 
Android 4.1 that's the way it looks a
little<00:01:57.030> bit<00:01:57.210> different<00:01:57.299> you're<00:01:57.570> wondering

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
little bit different you're wondering

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.480 
little bit different you're wondering
what<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.079> scattered<00:01:58.500> clouds<00:01:58.799> as<00:01:59.070> we'll<00:01:59.310> get

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
what the scattered clouds as we'll get

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.280 
what the scattered clouds as we'll get
to<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.719> second<00:02:01.020> but<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> little

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
to that in just a second but a little

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.359 
to that in just a second but a little
bit<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.530> difference<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.070> course<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
bit of a difference and of course the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.399 
bit of a difference and of course the
lockscreen<00:02:02.790> has<00:02:03.450> changed<00:02:03.990> as<00:02:04.110> well<00:02:04.290> and

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
lockscreen has changed as well and

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.480 
lockscreen has changed as well and
you'll<00:02:04.530> see<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.250> makes<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.430> little

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
you'll see that it makes a little

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.069 
you'll see that it makes a little
animation<00:02:05.939> there<00:02:06.240> spinning<00:02:06.659> out<00:02:06.840> for<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
animation there spinning out for the

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.600 
animation there spinning out for the
lockscreen<00:02:07.380> from<00:02:07.649> here<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.829> can<00:02:08.069> Google<00:02:08.369> search

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
lockscreen from here I can Google search

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.580 
lockscreen from here I can Google search
I<00:02:08.789> can<00:02:08.819> go<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.090> camera<00:02:09.479> or<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.899> can<00:02:10.110> unlock<00:02:10.379> but<00:02:10.560> I

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
I can go to camera or I can unlock but I

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.290 
I can go to camera or I can unlock but I
really<00:02:10.830> want<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.129> focus<00:02:11.340> especially<00:02:12.239> if
