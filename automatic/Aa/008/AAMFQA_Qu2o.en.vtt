 Yes, this How to Grow It is Gerbera I think I want to talk to you 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:11.050
 These large flowers are empty with flowers of different shades 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:19.770
 Gardia 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:19.770
 As there are many pastel colors from pass temple, it is from young one, but broad one to elderly person 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:28.539
 Yes it is one of the I put the plant lovers 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.950
 Flower It is will bloom in the spring and fall I will bloom I think 2 c manner 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:38.100
 Hey 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:44.309
 The flower is in the bar and the big flower blooms, but it is quite good that the next flower goes up 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.630
 It takes time, but I think that each small flower has disappeared in the spring and autumn sushi season 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:52.090
 You do not give up Te 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:55.180
 It will only come to manage fertilizer and water 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.460
 Because you have ne Well pretty much it is the fertilizer 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.149
 Please give me plenty of spring turkey 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:06.640
 It is watering, but here is point 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:09.560
 When we do water, we hang on from now, but the central part of this flower 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.979
 Yes if it gets water here 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.770
 I'm stuck in the lacquer 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.420
 It will rot 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:22.600
 So if you 're pouring water on the deck, you can hit the leaves, but in the center of the flower 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:29.590
 Please pour water so that it does not hit 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:30.310
 If you grow in the pot of rare It's yeah I moved to the place where Ainu took something like 2 houses of a long house 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.060
 Then 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.290
 You can see without Kanagawa 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.950
 And 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.100
 Pests and pests Pests are aphids and leafminers 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:46.229
 It is easy to say 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.580
 If there is no aphids are Well that was what scatter anything So you hired me so so get drug 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.750
 I think so 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.740
 air 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.830
 It's a leafminer fly This leaf I'm going this summer 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.270
 It is nor open hole without necessarily was Ueo A look- 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.900
 Row like a maze 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.560
 It's there larvae I slips into the 8 horses 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.880
 When in would write it eco-art full 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.210
 that 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:15.750
 Because there is an influence on the construction mouth 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:22.010
 Because it is a caterpillar of the appropriate medicine Haemogly fly, it changed to the wind called Hamoglyfly 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.010
 It is a granule of a drug , I think that it is said that if you can spray it 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:31.400
 And it is winter management a 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.520
 Recently, a very strong breed This breed is very strong 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.470
 Iwate Prefecture I'm talking about now 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:41.750
 Is less than minus 10 degrees 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.810
 If I'm there, but I'm a strong varieties around can winter over in the outside still are coming out 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.810
 a 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:53.879
 Well it is to Shinan and also from southern Tohoku 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:59.490
 A member? I think the country is okay to a as it is winter in meeting 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:03:03.150
 I think that it is better to recruit called from the north northeast in it is the people of Hokkaido house 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:08.280
 Appearance say they're going only course Hey promulgated flower 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.970
 The leaves are curry, so when it gets cold, the leaves will wither and be in a state of only 8 convex ridges 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.170
 but 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:19.569
 Because sound is a perennial plant of the type of plants that come out and it is the Court also deterrent 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:24.500
 Please be careful not to throw it away as you thought the Ueno collapsed 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:28.300
 Yes is not difficult to grow Hey Well so much a like this 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.720
 Because a lot of beautiful flowers bloom a 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:36.370
 Sound points like I spoke about vomiting by all means 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:40.440
 I think that if you can practice it and enjoy the flowers of a long house, I think it is this time 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.440
 Talked about how to grow gerbera
