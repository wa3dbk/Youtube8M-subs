of them have wood and things like that

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.009 
of them have wood and things like that

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
so it looks very shiny very glossy like

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.360 
so it looks very shiny very glossy like
it<00:04:06.140> looks<00:04:06.350> like<00:04:06.500> it's<00:04:06.650> made<00:04:06.739> of<00:04:06.799> plastic<00:04:07.190> this

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
it looks like it's made of plastic this

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.129 
it looks like it's made of plastic this
is<00:04:07.489> like<00:04:07.609> a<00:04:07.640> very<00:04:08.120> matte<00:04:08.450> finish<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:08.959> it

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
is like a very matte finish to it

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.289 
is like a very matte finish to it
because<00:04:09.769> it's<00:04:09.919> it's<00:04:10.220> all<00:04:10.400> made<00:04:10.609> of<00:04:10.760> fiberglass

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
because it's it's all made of fiberglass

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.290 
because it's it's all made of fiberglass
