00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.309
 what I said in this discussion is 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.019
 equal to what the superintendent 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.599
 express 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.730
 within 4 months from the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.349
 province that is firm that I believe 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.509
 that the provision for the qualification of 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:22.140
 credits would be firm November 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:24.570
 December 2012 begin to be counted 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.029
 the 4 months to reach agreements of 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.059
 payment with creditors I think 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.719
 firmly believe that we will achieve or be 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:36.120
 America is not going to die so you 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.350
 I remember the phrase 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.680
 a sector of the fans 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.230
 has created and another that created our 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.600
 President death will not dress 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.600
 red because america saved it me 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.909
 america salt ahead of what I guarantee 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.359
 only with the fans the fans 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.949
 they accompany us and with the fans and the 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.199
 people who are running the institution 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.350
 in a transparent way we have the money 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.450
 enough to pay the debts and to 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.180
 have a competitive team to go by 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.180
 the 14th the 15th and the 16th star 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.119
 the first step is the super promoter 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.250
 is developing the projects of 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.110
 credit rating and determination 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.810
 voting rights 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.540
 We believe that he will present it before 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.340
 October 30 the next step is 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.940
 bring it to the attention of 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.950
 creditors and the debtor that is america and 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.200
 at that time you can trace some 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.810
 controversy or because some creditor 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.290
 thinks that more or because the debtor 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.740
 he thinks he owes less and that can 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.140
 take one or two months that discussion and 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.240
 then the famous four months of that 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.810
 he talks superintendent that says the law 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.670
 to negotiate but we have the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.700
 absolute certainty that we're going to get to a 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.920
 agreement with the creditors 12 that you 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.810
 We are going to pay all the debts to the 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.280
 creditors absolute absolute certainty and 3 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.170
 that we are doing the task as 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.560
 it must be like the law does not order the 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.560
 America 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.480
 if we are aware 5 million 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.420
 fans we are going to find a stadium with 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.489
 fans supporting the institution some 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.140
 players as the president said in the 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.989
 court meeting a technical director 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.670
 fulfilling in the line and the directors 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.130
 ends up fulfilling the task that is 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.330
 transparent public monies are the 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.330
 of the america and sacred
