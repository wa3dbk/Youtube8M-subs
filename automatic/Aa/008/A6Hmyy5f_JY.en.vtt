00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
you said I just used it by itself like

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.540 
you said I just used it by itself like
plastic<00:02:00.740> come<00:02:00.860> from<00:02:01.010> my<00:02:01.100> head

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
plastic come from my head

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.900 
plastic come from my head
ten<00:02:01.730> minutes<00:02:02.090> in<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:03.020> out<00:02:03.110> done<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:04.550> I<00:02:04.670> will

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
ten minutes in and out done and I will

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.840 
ten minutes in and out done and I will
say<00:02:05.210> I<00:02:05.240> wasn't<00:02:05.750> I<00:02:06.220> didn't<00:02:07.220> really<00:02:07.400> like<00:02:07.610> it<00:02:07.640> how

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
say I wasn't I didn't really like it how

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.000 
say I wasn't I didn't really like it how
much<00:02:08.030> it<00:02:08.240> wasn't<00:02:08.630> that<00:02:08.720> it<00:02:08.930> was<00:02:08.960> bad<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:09.860> was

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
much it wasn't that it was bad it was

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.870 
much it wasn't that it was bad it was
just<00:02:10.130> that<00:02:10.430> my<00:02:10.670> hair<00:02:10.970> felt<00:02:11.930> more<00:02:12.880> strengthened

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
just that my hair felt more strengthened

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.860 
just that my hair felt more strengthened
than<00:02:14.690> it<00:02:14.840> did<00:02:15.110> soft<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.490> I<00:02:16.790> usually<00:02:17.630> like<00:02:17.840> my

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
than it did soft and I usually like my

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.380 
than it did soft and I usually like my
DC's<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:19.250> make<00:02:19.400> my<00:02:19.550> hair<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:19.910> know<00:02:20.030> like<00:02:20.210> very

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
DC's to make my hair you know like very

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.760 
DC's to make my hair you know like very
like<00:02:20.570> blush<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.470> plush<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.520> soft<00:02:23.510> so<00:02:23.930> that

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
like blush and plush and soft so that

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.650 
like blush and plush and soft so that
was<00:02:24.890> kind<00:02:25.430> of<00:02:25.460> like<00:02:25.520> uh<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:25.880> think<00:02:26.240> I<00:02:26.480> would<00:02:26.630> use

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
was kind of like uh I think I would use

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.230 
was kind of like uh I think I would use
this<00:02:26.900> more<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:28.520> protein<00:02:29.000> treatment

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
this more of a protein treatment

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.700 
this more of a protein treatment
especially<00:02:29.840> because<00:02:29.960> my<00:02:30.200> abilities<00:02:30.530> we

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
especially because my abilities we

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.100 
especially because my abilities we
protein<00:02:31.100> is<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.790> second<00:02:32.120> ingredient<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:32.930> that

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
protein is the second ingredient so that

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.350 
protein is the second ingredient so that
and<00:02:33.380> that<00:02:33.500> for<00:02:33.740> me<00:02:33.890> that's<00:02:34.070> a<00:02:34.250> pretty<00:02:34.520> strong

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
and that for me that's a pretty strong

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.910 
and that for me that's a pretty strong
protein<00:02:35.930> my<00:02:36.350> hair<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.620> little<00:02:36.770> bit

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
protein my hair is a little bit

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.350 
protein my hair is a little bit
sensitive<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.640> wheat<00:02:37.760> protein<00:02:38.180> nice

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
sensitive to wheat protein nice

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.090 
sensitive to wheat protein nice
personally<00:02:39.020> I<00:02:39.080> always<00:02:39.110> have<00:02:39.560> had<00:02:39.740> the<00:02:39.920> most

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
personally I always have had the most

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.640 
personally I always have had the most
issues<00:02:40.370> with<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.540> when<00:02:41.720> I<00:02:41.750> say<00:02:41.990> issues<00:02:42.380> I<00:02:42.530> mean

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
issues with and when I say issues I mean

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.230 
issues with and when I say issues I mean
like<00:02:42.800> getting<00:02:42.980> protein<00:02:43.250> overload<00:02:43.850> I<00:02:44.000> don't

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
like getting protein overload I don't

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.320 
like getting protein overload I don't
mean<00:02:44.390> like<00:02:44.570> my<00:02:44.720> hair<00:02:44.900> falling<00:02:45.230> out<00:02:45.320> so<00:02:46.330> that

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
mean like my hair falling out so that

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.370 
mean like my hair falling out so that
was<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.540> first<00:02:47.750> time<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:47.930> mean<00:02:48.020> is<00:02:48.110> that<00:02:48.140> the

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
was the first time I mean is that the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.990 
was the first time I mean is that the
second<00:02:48.740> time<00:02:48.770> I<00:02:48.890> use<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.160> I<00:02:49.220> actually<00:02:49.430> mixed

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
second time I use that I actually mixed

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.850 
second time I use that I actually mixed
it<00:02:50.150> with<00:02:50.600> my<00:02:50.780> organic<00:02:51.350> oils<00:02:51.620> deep

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
it with my organic oils deep

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.550 
it with my organic oils deep
conditioning<00:02:52.400> cream<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:53.960> was<00:02:54.080> awesome

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
conditioning cream and that was awesome

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.880 
conditioning cream and that was awesome
so<00:02:55.040> I<00:02:55.460> think<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:56.150> was<00:02:56.360> better<00:02:56.990> for<00:02:57.140> me<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:57.860> just

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
so I think it was better for me to just

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.310 
so I think it was better for me to just
mix<00:02:58.250> it<00:02:58.489> with<00:02:58.700> something<00:02:58.940> that<00:02:59.660> is<00:03:00.020> more

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
mix it with something that is more

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.220 
mix it with something that is more
moisturizing<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.940> thing<00:03:02.300> together<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:02.810> got<00:03:03.170> a

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
moisturizing and thing together I got a

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.540 
moisturizing and thing together I got a
really<00:03:03.590> good<00:03:04.209> balance<00:03:05.209> between<00:03:06.130> softness<00:03:07.130> and

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
really good balance between softness and

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.760 
really good balance between softness and
strength<00:03:08.410> then<00:03:09.410> I<00:03:09.440> also<00:03:09.920> used<00:03:10.310> it<00:03:10.489> with<00:03:10.910> my

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
strength then I also used it with my

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.660 
strength then I also used it with my
bath<00:03:12.970> cacao<00:03:14.080> deep<00:03:15.080> conditioner<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:16.040> what<00:03:16.640> I

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
bath cacao deep conditioner and what I

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.650 
bath cacao deep conditioner and what I
did<00:03:17.060> that<00:03:17.360> one<00:03:17.750> I<00:03:18.050> used<00:03:18.290> like<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.709> best<00:03:18.950> on

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
did that one I used like the best on

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.150 
did that one I used like the best on
like<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.840> length<00:03:21.050> of<00:03:21.230> my<00:03:21.440> hair<00:03:21.470> like<00:03:21.890> kind<00:03:22.100> of

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
like the length of my hair like kind of

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.770 
like the length of my hair like kind of
at<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.370> top<00:03:22.550> and<00:03:22.790> then<00:03:22.880> I<00:03:22.970> just<00:03:23.150> used<00:03:23.390> this<00:03:23.570> on

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
at the top and then I just used this on

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.530 
at the top and then I just used this on
the<00:03:24.290> ends<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:24.860> I<00:03:24.980> did<00:03:25.160> a<00:03:25.190> over<00:03:25.520> an<00:03:25.610> ITC<00:03:26.000> with<00:03:26.330> it

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
the ends and I did a over an ITC with it

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.490 
the ends and I did a over an ITC with it
so<00:03:27.170> it<00:03:27.590> on<00:03:27.830> dry<00:03:28.070> hair<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:29.080> when<00:03:30.080> I<00:03:30.110> rinse<00:03:30.440> my

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
so it on dry hair and when I rinse my

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.750 
so it on dry hair and when I rinse my
hair<00:03:30.739> out<00:03:30.800> that<00:03:31.160> was<00:03:31.250> when<00:03:31.430> I<00:03:31.520> was<00:03:31.550> talking

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
hair out that was when I was talking

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.460

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.590 
put it on and then put when I stopped it
before<00:03:46.070> I<00:03:46.310> would<00:03:46.610> get<00:03:46.760> to<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.120> part<00:03:47.390> with<00:03:47.570> the

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
before I would get to the part with the

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.440 
before I would get to the part with the
milrose<00:03:48.170> on<00:03:48.440> it<00:03:48.670> but<00:03:49.670> my<00:03:49.850> hair<00:03:50.060> was<00:03:50.209> really

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
milrose on it but my hair was really

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.840 
milrose on it but my hair was really
really<00:03:50.720> soft<00:03:51.019> I<00:03:51.200> really<00:03:51.590> really<00:03:51.890> like<00:03:52.130> this

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
really soft I really really like this

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.450 
really soft I really really like this
and<00:03:53.090> overnight<00:03:53.600> dry<00:03:54.200> DC<00:03:54.710> it<00:03:54.860> felt<00:03:55.040> great<00:03:55.190> it

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
and overnight dry DC it felt great it

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.180 
and overnight dry DC it felt great it
didn't<00:03:55.730> mix<00:03:55.970> funny<00:03:56.510> with<00:03:57.200> any<00:03:57.560> of<00:03:57.950> the

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
didn't mix funny with any of the

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.100 
didn't mix funny with any of the
products<00:03:58.730> that<00:03:58.760> were<00:03:58.940> previously<00:03:59.360> in<00:03:59.720> my<00:03:59.840> hair

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
products that were previously in my hair

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.960 
products that were previously in my hair
it<00:04:00.350> was<00:04:00.440> really<00:04:00.770> easy<00:04:00.980> to<00:04:01.100> rinse<00:04:01.310> out<00:04:01.490> I<00:04:01.730> didn't

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
it was really easy to rinse out I didn't

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.030 
it was really easy to rinse out I didn't
even<00:04:02.090> have<00:04:02.300> to<00:04:02.510> condition<00:04:03.350> my<00:04:03.680> hair<00:04:03.890> again

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
even have to condition my hair again

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.890 
even have to condition my hair again
after<00:04:04.670> I<00:04:04.730> rinse<00:04:04.940> it<00:04:05.090> out<00:04:05.240> I<00:04:05.270> didn't<00:04:05.630> have<00:04:05.750> to

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
after I rinse it out I didn't have to

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.290 
after I rinse it out I didn't have to
use<00:04:06.440> like<00:04:06.680> a<00:04:06.860> collage<00:04:07.310> and<00:04:07.550> enough<00:04:07.790> to<00:04:07.910> shampoo

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
use like a collage and enough to shampoo

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.390 
use like a collage and enough to shampoo
because<00:04:08.780> my<00:04:08.990> hair<00:04:09.170> was<00:04:09.320> not<00:04:09.350> gunky<00:04:10.010> so<00:04:10.250> that

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
because my hair was not gunky so that

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.660 
because my hair was not gunky so that
was<00:04:10.520> absolutely<00:04:11.060> awesome<00:04:11.330> so<00:04:12.170> kudos<00:04:12.620> to

Camille<00:04:13.670> Rose<00:04:13.910> for<00:04:14.360> that<00:04:14.480> even<00:04:14.750> sometimes<00:04:15.110> we

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
Camille Rose for that even sometimes we

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.920 
Camille Rose for that even sometimes we
use<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.560> deep<00:04:15.830> conditioner<00:04:16.340> on<00:04:16.580> dry<00:04:16.970> dirty

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
use the deep conditioner on dry dirty

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.380 
use the deep conditioner on dry dirty
hair<00:04:18.230> it<00:04:18.770> kind<00:04:19.070> of<00:04:19.190> ends<00:04:19.580> up<00:04:19.700> giving<00:04:20.030> a<00:04:20.239> little

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
hair it kind of ends up giving a little

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.940 
hair it kind of ends up giving a little
gunky<00:04:20.780> then<00:04:20.989> you<00:04:21.080> have<00:04:21.230> to<00:04:21.350> just<00:04:21.590> start<00:04:21.800> all

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
gunky then you have to just start all

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.760 
gunky then you have to just start all
over<00:04:21.980> and<00:04:22.280> wash<00:04:22.460> your<00:04:22.610> hair<00:04:22.850> um<00:04:23.440> but<00:04:24.440> that<00:04:24.590> did

over and wash your hair um but that did

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.740 
over and wash your hair um but that did
not<00:04:24.830> happen<00:04:25.070> so<00:04:25.430> that<00:04:25.670> was<00:04:25.760> great<00:04:26.060> let<00:04:26.540> me<00:04:26.600> see

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
not happen so that was great let me see

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.250 
not happen so that was great let me see
what<00:04:26.870> else<00:04:26.990> I<00:04:27.080> will<00:04:27.710> say<00:04:27.950> I<00:04:28.690> personally<00:04:29.690> would

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
what else I will say I personally would

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.590 
what else I will say I personally would
not<00:04:30.380> use<00:04:30.650> it<00:04:30.950> as<00:04:31.190> a<00:04:31.670> leave-in<00:04:31.970> conditioner

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
not use it as a leave-in conditioner

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.820 
not use it as a leave-in conditioner
just<00:04:32.810> because<00:04:33.020> it's<00:04:33.140> a<00:04:33.200> hydraulic<00:04:33.380> sweep

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
just because it's a hydraulic sweep

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.070 
just because it's a hydraulic sweep
protein<00:04:34.220> it<00:04:34.520> is<00:04:34.940> the<00:04:35.060> second<00:04:35.420> ingredient<00:04:35.570> and

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
protein it is the second ingredient and

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.500 
protein it is the second ingredient and
we<00:04:36.200> all<00:04:36.350> know<00:04:36.470> also<00:04:36.770> just<00:04:37.220> a<00:04:37.640> little<00:04:37.910> tip<00:04:38.090> it<00:04:38.270> if

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
we all know also just a little tip it if

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.770 
we all know also just a little tip it if
you<00:04:38.690> have<00:04:38.870> not<00:04:38.990> watched<00:04:39.230> my<00:04:39.380> video<00:04:39.620> on<00:04:39.920> protein

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
you have not watched my video on protein

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.240 
you have not watched my video on protein
hydrolyzed<00:04:41.780> protein<00:04:42.320> that's<00:04:42.830> when<00:04:43.010> they<00:04:43.100> like

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
hydrolyzed protein that's when they like

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.160 
hydrolyzed protein that's when they like
make<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.580> molecules<00:04:44.210> like<00:04:44.390> smaller<00:04:44.720> to<00:04:45.020> like

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
make the molecules like smaller to like

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.200 
make the molecules like smaller to like
penetrate<00:04:45.530> your<00:04:45.770> hair<00:04:45.980> shaft<00:04:46.220> so<00:04:46.700> this<00:04:46.910> when

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
penetrate your hair shaft so this when

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.450 
penetrate your hair shaft so this when
it<00:04:47.330> says<00:04:47.570> it<00:04:47.840> can<00:04:48.020> reconstruct<00:04:48.590> damaged<00:04:49.190> hair

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
it says it can reconstruct damaged hair

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.910 
it says it can reconstruct damaged hair
it<00:04:49.820> doesn't<00:04:50.210> necessarily<00:04:50.440> repair<00:04:51.440> your<00:04:51.680> hair

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
it doesn't necessarily repair your hair

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.880 
it doesn't necessarily repair your hair
but<00:04:52.070> it<00:04:52.130> can<00:04:52.400> fill<00:04:52.760> in<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.210> holes<00:04:53.570> in<00:04:54.020> your

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
but it can fill in the holes in your

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.670 
but it can fill in the holes in your
hair<00:04:55.130> shaft<00:04:55.430> so<00:04:56.240> I<00:04:56.270> think<00:04:56.600> guys<00:04:57.020> really<00:04:57.470> great

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
hair shaft so I think guys really great

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.530 
hair shaft so I think guys really great
so<00:04:57.830> if<00:04:57.950> you<00:04:58.070> damaged<00:04:58.580> hair<00:04:58.820> I<00:04:59.090> really

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
so if you damaged hair I really

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.180 
so if you damaged hair I really
recommend<00:05:00.110> this<00:05:00.140> conditioner<00:05:00.860> and<00:05:01.040> if<00:05:01.130> you

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
recommend this conditioner and if you

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.280 
recommend this conditioner and if you
have<00:05:01.370> fine<00:05:01.730> hair<00:05:01.760> this<00:05:02.630> may<00:05:02.900> be<00:05:02.960> a<00:05:03.080> good

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
have fine hair this may be a good

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.640 
have fine hair this may be a good
conditioner<00:05:03.770> for<00:05:04.010> you<00:05:04.190> to<00:05:04.790> reduce<00:05:05.150> breakage

conditioner for you to reduce breakage

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.590 
conditioner for you to reduce breakage

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
but if you of course hair like me you

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.360 
but if you of course hair like me you
probably<00:05:08.930> would<00:05:09.470> need<00:05:09.620> to<00:05:09.770> use<00:05:09.950> this<00:05:10.100> laughs

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
probably would need to use this laughs

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.890 
probably would need to use this laughs
you<00:05:10.580> don't<00:05:10.730> need<00:05:10.880> to<00:05:11.000> use<00:05:11.150> all<00:05:11.420> the<00:05:11.540> time<00:05:11.750> and

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
you don't need to use all the time and

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.930 
you don't need to use all the time and
even<00:05:11.960> though<00:05:12.140> I<00:05:12.170> have<00:05:12.470> to<00:05:12.650> buy<00:05:12.740> my<00:05:12.920> hair<00:05:13.160> my

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
even though I have to buy my hair my

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.670 
even though I have to buy my hair my
hair<00:05:13.970> is<00:05:14.240> still<00:05:14.420> very<00:05:14.720> coarse<00:05:15.080> my<00:05:15.290> strands

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
hair is still very coarse my strands

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.420 
hair is still very coarse my strands
have<00:05:15.860> always<00:05:16.130> been<00:05:16.370> very<00:05:16.700> very<00:05:16.880> thick<00:05:17.180> so<00:05:18.430> just

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
have always been very very thick so just

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.850 
have always been very very thick so just
use<00:05:19.940> it<00:05:20.120> less<00:05:20.300> I<00:05:20.480> would<00:05:20.540> not<00:05:20.810> use<00:05:21.230> it<00:05:21.500> like

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860

use it less I would not use it like
every<00:05:22.400> time<00:05:22.760> you<00:05:23.210> decide<00:05:23.660> to<00:05:23.690> decondition

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
every time you decide to decondition

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.680 
every time you decide to decondition
this<00:05:25.010> is<00:05:25.160> more<00:05:25.340> like<00:05:25.550> a<00:05:25.580> special<00:05:26.120> treat<00:05:26.420> for

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
this is more like a special treat for

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.740 
this is more like a special treat for
your<00:05:27.260> hair<00:05:27.560> ah<00:05:28.090> let's<00:05:29.090> see<00:05:29.270> what<00:05:29.360> else

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
your hair ah let's see what else

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.130 
your hair ah let's see what else
MSM<00:05:30.740> and<00:05:31.100> biotin<00:05:31.760> I<00:05:31.970> feel<00:05:32.360> about<00:05:32.690> doing<00:05:32.990> those

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
MSM and biotin I feel about doing those

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.660 
MSM and biotin I feel about doing those
topically<00:05:33.800> on<00:05:34.010> your<00:05:34.460> hair<00:05:34.790> I'm<00:05:35.060> not<00:05:35.240> I<00:05:35.540> see

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
topically on your hair I'm not I see

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.280 
topically on your hair I'm not I see
there's<00:05:37.670> like<00:05:37.820> a<00:05:37.880> debate<00:05:38.390> whether<00:05:38.930> they

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
there's like a debate whether they

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.560 
there's like a debate whether they
really<00:05:39.470> do<00:05:39.800> anything<00:05:40.100> but<00:05:40.340> both<00:05:40.940> of<00:05:40.970> those<00:05:41.210> do

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
really do anything but both of those do

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.350 
really do anything but both of those do
help<00:05:41.990> strengthen<00:05:42.260> hair<00:05:42.590> so<00:05:42.860> like<00:05:43.430> taking<00:05:43.970> MSM

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
help strengthen hair so like taking MSM

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.440 
help strengthen hair so like taking MSM
bites<00:05:44.600> and<00:05:44.870> supplements<00:05:45.590> are<00:05:46.190> good<00:05:46.490> internal

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
bites and supplements are good internal

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.570 
bites and supplements are good internal
health<00:05:47.750> but<00:05:48.350> putting<00:05:48.890> it<00:05:49.040> on<00:05:49.190> your<00:05:49.310> hair

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
health but putting it on your hair

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.020 
health but putting it on your hair
topically<00:05:50.890> debatable<00:05:51.890> but<00:05:52.370> I<00:05:52.430> can<00:05:52.670> see<00:05:52.820> why

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
topically debatable but I can see why

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.010 
topically debatable but I can see why
she<00:05:53.210> has<00:05:53.300> those<00:05:53.480> ingredients<00:05:54.080> in<00:05:54.230> there<00:05:56.020> let's

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
she has those ingredients in there let's

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.689 
she has those ingredients in there let's
do<00:05:57.170> it<00:05:57.290> off

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.400 

that's<00:06:00.699> really<00:06:00.970> although<00:06:01.150> yeah<00:06:01.930> I<00:06:01.960> don't<00:06:02.260> know

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
that's really although yeah I don't know

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.720 
that's really although yeah I don't know
I<00:06:02.440> like<00:06:02.770> it<00:06:02.830> I<00:06:03.010> think<00:06:03.220> it's<00:06:03.340> good

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.730 
I like it I think it's good

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.580 
I like it I think it's good
I<00:06:03.760> personally<00:06:04.360> probably<00:06:04.900> would<00:06:05.230> not<00:06:05.380> purchase

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
I personally probably would not purchase

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.980 
I personally probably would not purchase
it<00:06:05.860> again<00:06:06.550> just<00:06:06.970> because<00:06:07.360> there<00:06:07.780> are<00:06:07.870> other

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
it again just because there are other

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.689 
it again just because there are other
villalobos<00:06:08.530> products<00:06:08.919> that<00:06:09.010> I<00:06:09.070> like<00:06:09.250> more<00:06:09.460> so

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:09.699 
villalobos products that I like more so

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:10.890 
villalobos products that I like more so
if<00:06:09.790> I<00:06:09.880> was<00:06:10.000> ordering<00:06:10.300> something<00:06:10.600> off<00:06:10.780> the<00:06:10.870> a

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
if I was ordering something off the a

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.510 
if I was ordering something off the a
view<00:06:11.229> of<00:06:11.410> probably<00:06:11.860> picked<00:06:12.010> something<00:06:12.220> else

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
view of probably picked something else

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.590 
view of probably picked something else
and<00:06:12.910> the<00:06:13.870> protein<00:06:14.320> if<00:06:15.280> I<00:06:15.550> these<00:06:15.760> proteins<00:06:16.360> I

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
and the protein if I these proteins I

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.540 
and the protein if I these proteins I
usually<00:06:17.139> like<00:06:17.320> to<00:06:17.350> deal<00:06:17.889> with<00:06:17.919> softer

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
usually like to deal with softer

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.280 
usually like to deal with softer
proteins<00:06:19.000> and<00:06:19.270> get<00:06:19.360> a<00:06:19.389> little<00:06:19.570> tidbits<00:06:20.080> of

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.290 
proteins and get a little tidbits of

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.100 
proteins and get a little tidbits of
protein<00:06:21.070> in<00:06:21.430> my<00:06:21.639> routine<00:06:22.150> every<00:06:22.570> now<00:06:22.720> and<00:06:22.960> then

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
protein in my routine every now and then

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.110 
protein in my routine every now and then
like<00:06:23.380> low<00:06:23.560> running<00:06:23.830> ingredients<00:06:24.520> list<00:06:24.729> and<00:06:25.000> my

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
like low running ingredients list and my

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.340 
like low running ingredients list and my
conditioner<00:06:25.840> just<00:06:26.110> not<00:06:27.070> like<00:06:27.600> gung-ho<00:06:28.600> with

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 
conditioner just not like gung-ho with

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.770 
conditioner just not like gung-ho with
the<00:06:30.280> protein<00:06:30.699> because<00:06:30.910> my<00:06:31.060> American<00:06:31.419> a<00:06:31.510> can

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
the protein because my American a can

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.300 
the protein because my American a can
really<00:06:32.080> really<00:06:32.200> bratty<00:06:32.590> when<00:06:32.860> it<00:06:32.950> gets<00:06:33.130> too

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
really really bratty when it gets too

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.640 
really really bratty when it gets too
much<00:06:33.400> protein<00:06:33.700> but<00:06:34.389> anyway<00:06:34.810> that<00:06:35.139> is<00:06:35.350> all<00:06:35.530> I

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
much protein but anyway that is all I

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.140 
much protein but anyway that is all I
have<00:06:35.800> to<00:06:35.919> say<00:06:35.950> I<00:06:36.130> will<00:06:36.729> talk<00:06:36.940> to<00:06:37.030> you<00:06:37.120> later

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
have to say I will talk to you later

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.630 
have to say I will talk to you later
okay
