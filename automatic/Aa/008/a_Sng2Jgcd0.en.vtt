Galaxian<00:00:04.650> is<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.799> corpus<00:00:05.190> freeze<00:00:05.580> gun<00:00:05.879> obtained

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
Galaxian is a corpus freeze gun obtained

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.000 
Galaxian is a corpus freeze gun obtained
from<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.629> energy<00:00:06.960> lab<00:00:07.109> in<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.410> dojo<00:00:07.589> and<00:00:07.890> is

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
from the energy lab in the dojo and is

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.500 
from the energy lab in the dojo and is
actually<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.429> first<00:00:08.700> weapon<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.300> feature

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
actually the first weapon to feature

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.810 
actually the first weapon to feature
cold<00:00:09.929> as<00:00:10.139> his<00:00:10.320> main<00:00:10.559> damage<00:00:11.099> type<00:00:11.340> now<00:00:11.759> the

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
cold as his main damage type now the

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.549 
cold as his main damage type now the
cold<00:00:12.090> element<00:00:12.480> by<00:00:12.570> itself<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:13.019> typically<00:00:13.410> good

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
cold element by itself is typically good

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.990 
cold element by itself is typically good
at<00:00:13.650> taking<00:00:13.799> down<00:00:14.040> shields<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:14.580> great<00:00:14.790> against

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
at taking down shields so great against

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.400 
at taking down shields so great against
the<00:00:15.120> corpus<00:00:15.540> but<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.780> also<00:00:15.900> has<00:00:16.139> increased

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
the corpus but it also has increased

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.200 
the corpus but it also has increased
damage<00:00:16.619> against<00:00:16.949> an<00:00:17.039> alloy<00:00:17.340> target<00:00:17.760> units<00:00:18.060> so

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
damage against an alloy target units so

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.700 
damage against an alloy target units so
it<00:00:18.270> has<00:00:18.420> some<00:00:18.630> applications<00:00:19.260> for<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.439> gurney

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
it has some applications for the gurney

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.320 
it has some applications for the gurney
or<00:00:19.740> when<00:00:19.980> taking<00:00:20.279> down<00:00:20.310> bomber's<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.210> Nate

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
or when taking down bomber's and Nate

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.029 
or when taking down bomber's and Nate
Palmer's<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.900> stuff<00:00:22.050> like<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.439> but<00:00:22.890> his

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
Palmer's and stuff like that but his

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.950 
Palmer's and stuff like that but his
drawback<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.000> not<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.449> great<00:00:24.660> taking

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
drawback is it's not so great taking

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.779 
drawback is it's not so great taking
down<00:00:25.050> infested<00:00:25.680> units<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.250> mechanically<00:00:26.640> all

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
down infested units and mechanically all

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.040 
down infested units and mechanically all
this<00:00:26.910> weapon<00:00:27.180> works<00:00:27.330> as<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.599> fires<00:00:27.810> at<00:00:27.960> a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
this weapon works as it fires at a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.330 
this weapon works as it fires at a
frozen<00:00:28.260> continuous<00:00:28.920> beam<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.250> will

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
frozen continuous beam that will

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.859 
frozen continuous beam that will
gradually<00:00:29.789> freeze<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.390> target<00:00:30.750> until

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
gradually freeze the target until

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.659 
gradually freeze the target until
they're<00:00:31.109> completely<00:00:31.500> frozen<00:00:31.859> solid<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
they're completely frozen solid and the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.310 
they're completely frozen solid and the
animation<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.270> solely<00:00:33.540> based<00:00:33.809> off<00:00:34.050> how<00:00:34.200> much

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
animation is solely based off how much

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.930 
animation is solely based off how much
damage<00:00:34.739> you're<00:00:34.829> actually<00:00:35.100> doing<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.700> mata

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
damage you're actually doing so on mata

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.940 
damage you're actually doing so on mata
you'll<00:00:36.149> see<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.510> process<00:00:37.050> happen<00:00:37.350> slowly<00:00:37.590> but

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
you'll see the process happen slowly but

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.590 
you'll see the process happen slowly but
once<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.250> get<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.430> lot<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.700> mods<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.210> there<00:00:39.420> like

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
once you get a lot of mods on there like

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.150 
once you get a lot of mods on there like
three<00:00:39.930> former<00:00:40.320> like<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.469> have<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.829> build

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
three former like I have on this build

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.889 
three former like I have on this build
they'll<00:00:41.579> be<00:00:41.700> frozen<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.329> blink<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.660> an<00:00:42.780> eye

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
they'll be frozen in a blink of an eye

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.479 
they'll be frozen in a blink of an eye
so<00:00:43.200> let's<00:00:43.530> pull<00:00:43.680> up<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.770> stats<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.160> discuss

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
so let's pull up the stats and discuss

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.220 
so let's pull up the stats and discuss
the<00:00:44.700> pros<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.300> cons<00:00:45.600> with<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:45.960> weapon

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the pros and cons with this weapon

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.330 
the pros and cons with this weapon
because<00:00:46.379> there's<00:00:46.500> definitely<00:00:46.590> some<00:00:46.950> unique

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
because there's definitely some unique

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.160 
because there's definitely some unique
and<00:00:47.520> interesting<00:00:47.969> things<00:00:48.300> about<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.780> for<00:00:48.960> one

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and interesting things about it for one

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.439 
and interesting things about it for one
as<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.530> largest<00:00:50.039> magazine<00:00:50.370> size<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.239> any

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
as the largest magazine size of any

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.330 
as the largest magazine size of any
weapon<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> game<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.289> 300<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.949> also<00:00:53.129> has

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
weapon in the game at 300 it also has

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.850 
weapon in the game at 300 it also has
the<00:00:53.430> largest<00:00:53.610> max<00:00:54.030> ammo<00:00:54.329> capacity<00:00:54.660> at<00:00:55.079> 1,500

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the largest max ammo capacity at 1,500

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.310 
the largest max ammo capacity at 1,500
and<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.550> highest<00:00:56.940> fire<00:00:57.210> rate<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.539> any<00:00:57.840> weapon

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
and the highest fire rate of any weapon

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.779 
and the highest fire rate of any weapon
in<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.680> game<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.280> other<00:00:59.370> thing<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.579> really

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
in the game the other thing that really

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.189 
in the game the other thing that really
stands<00:01:00.090> out<00:01:00.239> about<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> weapon<00:01:00.809> too<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.020> that

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
stands out about the weapon too is that

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.410 
stands out about the weapon too is that
it<00:01:01.320> only<00:01:01.469> has<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> 15%<00:01:02.309> status<00:01:03.059> base<00:01:03.210> but

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
it only has a 15% status base but

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.149 
it only has a 15% status base but
because<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> insane<00:01:04.290> fire<00:01:04.619> rate<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.979> acts

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
because of the insane fire rate it acts

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.859 
because of the insane fire rate it acts
as<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.580> has<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> much<00:01:06.060> higher<00:01:06.090> one<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.780> you

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
as if it has a much higher one so you

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.330 
as if it has a much higher one so you
can<00:01:06.990> definitely<00:01:07.170> put<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.560> all<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.100> duals

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
can definitely put on all the duals

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.640 
can definitely put on all the duals
tatted<00:01:08.760> elements<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.390> proc<00:01:09.869> your<00:01:10.110> statuses

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
tatted elements and proc your statuses

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.950 
tatted elements and proc your statuses
at<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.950> very<00:01:11.310> consistent<00:01:11.700> rate<00:01:12.090> now<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
at a very consistent rate now on to the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.420 
at a very consistent rate now on to the
downsides<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> weapon<00:01:13.950> though<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> first

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
downsides of the weapon though the first

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.190 
downsides of the weapon though the first
thing<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.000> very<00:01:15.060> low<00:01:15.479> base<00:01:15.780> damage

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
thing is that is a very low base damage

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.190 
thing is that is a very low base damage
at<00:01:16.320> 6.3<00:01:17.130> with<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> low<00:01:17.490> crit<00:01:17.790> chance<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.150> 1%<00:01:18.869> but

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
at 6.3 with a low crit chance of 1% but

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.440 
at 6.3 with a low crit chance of 1% but
ironically<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.890> has<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.070> 2.0<00:01:20.640> multiplier<00:01:21.210> and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
ironically it has a 2.0 multiplier and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.090 
ironically it has a 2.0 multiplier and
even<00:01:21.960> though<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.259> fire<00:01:22.470> rate<00:01:22.619> kind<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.920> makes

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
even though the fire rate kind of makes

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.100 
even though the fire rate kind of makes
up<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:24.030> base<00:01:24.210> damage<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.600> little<00:01:24.689> bit<00:01:24.930> is

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
up for the base damage a little bit is

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.899 
up for the base damage a little bit is
not<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.710> compare<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.400> some<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.759> high

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
not going to compare to some of the high

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.149 
not going to compare to some of the high
tier<00:01:27.180> weapons<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.689> terms<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.140> DPS<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.920> other

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
tier weapons in terms of DPS the other

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.980 
tier weapons in terms of DPS the other
major<00:01:29.430> downside<00:01:29.970> with<00:01:30.090> weapon<00:01:30.420> 2<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.780> as<00:01:30.960> a

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
major downside with weapon 2 is as a

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.100 
major downside with weapon 2 is as a
very<00:01:31.380> bad<00:01:31.860> amyl<00:01:32.310> economy<00:01:32.880> ammo<00:01:33.299> mutation<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:34.079> a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
very bad amyl economy ammo mutation is a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.510 
very bad amyl economy ammo mutation is a
must<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:34.920> kind<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.100> funny<00:01:35.280> because<00:01:35.340> when

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
must and it's kind of funny because when

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.980 
must and it's kind of funny because when
you<00:01:35.579> first<00:01:35.759> pick<00:01:35.939> up<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.150> weapon<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.570> see<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
you first pick up the weapon you see the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.530 
you first pick up the weapon you see the
1,500<00:01:37.829> ammo<00:01:38.070> capacity<00:01:38.310> like<00:01:38.729> wow<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.150> got<00:01:39.329> tons

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
1,500 ammo capacity like wow I got tons

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.179 
1,500 ammo capacity like wow I got tons
of<00:01:39.659> ammo<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:40.079> no<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.320> burn<00:01:40.740> through<00:01:40.979> this

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
of ammo but no you burn through this

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.920 
of ammo but no you burn through this
very<00:01:41.670> very<00:01:41.850> quickly<00:01:42.299> if<00:01:42.540> you're<00:01:42.630> not<00:01:42.750> careful

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
very very quickly if you're not careful

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.719 
very very quickly if you're not careful
so<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.290> definitely<00:01:43.409> want<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.860> burst<00:01:44.100> fire<00:01:44.430> and

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
so you definitely want to burst fire and

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.160 
so you definitely want to burst fire and
not<00:01:44.909> just<00:01:45.119> hold<00:01:45.360> down<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.659> trigger<00:01:45.810> all<00:01:46.079> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
not just hold down the trigger all the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.420 
not just hold down the trigger all the
time<00:01:46.350> I'm<00:01:46.710> gonna<00:01:46.829> be<00:01:46.950> honest<00:01:47.189> though<00:01:47.250> this

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
time I'm gonna be honest though this

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.950 
time I'm gonna be honest though this
weapon<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> lot<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.360> fun<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.810> pretty

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
weapon is a lot of fun and it pretty

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.330 
weapon is a lot of fun and it pretty
much<00:01:49.049> takes<00:01:49.259> care<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.619> anything<00:01:49.890> on<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
much takes care of anything on the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.980 
much takes care of anything on the
regular<00:01:50.640> star<00:01:50.880> map<00:01:51.090> especially<00:01:51.630> comes<00:01:51.869> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
regular star map especially comes the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.990 
regular star map especially comes the
corpus<00:01:52.350> but<00:01:52.470> his<00:01:52.590> biggest<00:01:53.040> weakness<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
corpus but his biggest weakness is the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.420 
corpus but his biggest weakness is the
boys<00:01:54.240> like<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.630> was<00:01:54.750> barely<00:01:55.020> able<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.560> solo<00:01:56.219> at

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
boys like I was barely able to solo at

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.520 
boys like I was barely able to solo at
e3<00:01:56.670> exterminate<00:01:57.479> halfway<00:01:58.170> through<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
e3 exterminate halfway through the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.469 
e3 exterminate halfway through the
mission<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:58.979> was<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.280> running<00:01:59.880> out<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.060> ammo

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
mission I was just running out of ammo

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.510 
mission I was just running out of ammo
so<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.689> was<00:02:00.899> definitely<00:02:01.140> not<00:02:01.560> matching<00:02:02.009> my<00:02:02.100> DPS

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
so I was definitely not matching my DPS

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.310 
so I was definitely not matching my DPS
or<00:02:02.670> how<00:02:02.729> much<00:02:02.880> ammo<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.719> consuming<00:02:04.200> so

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
or how much ammo is consuming so

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.420 
or how much ammo is consuming so
definitely<00:02:04.619> don't<00:02:04.710> expect<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.159> bring<00:02:05.310> this

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
definitely don't expect to bring this

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.370 
definitely don't expect to bring this
into<00:02:05.610> T<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:06.090> survival<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.840> last<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.290> entire

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
into T for survival and last the entire

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.380 
into T for survival and last the entire
mission<00:02:07.890> with<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.340> but<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.119> know<00:02:09.209> still

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
mission with it but you know still

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.940 
mission with it but you know still
having<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.780> said<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.110> still<00:02:10.410> recommend<00:02:10.709> if

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
having that said I still recommend if

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.900

guys when it comes to Monning out the
Glac<00:02:17.460> scene<00:02:17.700> I'm<00:02:17.850> first<00:02:18.090> just<00:02:18.270> gonna<00:02:18.420> show<00:02:18.630> you

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
Glac scene I'm first just gonna show you

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.480 
Glac scene I'm first just gonna show you
which<00:02:19.020> polarities<00:02:19.470> I'm<00:02:19.620> actually<00:02:19.770> running<00:02:20.160> on

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
which polarities I'm actually running on

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.040 
which polarities I'm actually running on
the<00:02:20.670> weapons<00:02:21.120> so<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.660> weapon<00:02:21.960> actually

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
the weapons so the weapon actually

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.450 
the weapons so the weapon actually
didn't<00:02:22.320> come<00:02:22.440> with<00:02:22.560> any<00:02:22.590> polarities<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.160> its

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
didn't come with any polarities of its

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.220 
didn't come with any polarities of its
own<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:23.820> I<00:02:23.880> did<00:02:24.060> have<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.270> form<00:02:24.600> it<00:02:24.720> three<00:02:24.990> times

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
own so I did have to form it three times

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.140 
own so I did have to form it three times
to<00:02:25.440> put<00:02:25.620> on<00:02:25.740> three<00:02:26.070> V's<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.760> was<00:02:26.910> enough

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
to put on three V's and this was enough

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.300 
to put on three V's and this was enough
to<00:02:27.330> complete<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.900> build<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.410> this<00:02:28.830> is<00:02:28.980> mostly

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
to complete the build and this is mostly

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.800 
to complete the build and this is mostly
gonna<00:02:29.520> be<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> case<00:02:29.910> for<00:02:29.940> weapons<00:02:30.660> where

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
gonna be the case for weapons where

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.180 
gonna be the case for weapons where
you're<00:02:30.900> running<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.200> dual<00:02:31.410> sided<00:02:31.740> elements

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
you're running the dual sided elements

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.920 
you're running the dual sided elements
opposed<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.820> regular<00:02:33.000> ones<00:02:33.330> but<00:02:33.690> before

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
opposed to the regular ones but before

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.030 
opposed to the regular ones but before
we<00:02:33.990> get<00:02:34.080> into<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.380> let's<00:02:34.620> talk<00:02:34.740> about<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
we get into that let's talk about the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.220 
we get into that let's talk about the
raw<00:02:35.310> damage<00:02:35.730> mod<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.360> first<00:02:36.600> up<00:02:36.810> we<00:02:37.200> have

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
raw damage mod so first up we have

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.310 
raw damage mod so first up we have
serration<00:02:37.920> maxed<00:02:38.340> out<00:02:38.510> 165<00:02:39.510> percent<00:02:39.690> extra

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
kind of unstable to begin with so it's

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.350 
kind of unstable to begin with so it's
pretty<00:02:55.920> much<00:02:56.010> all<00:02:56.220> upside<00:02:56.550> on<00:02:57.000> this<00:02:57.180> weapon

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
that this mod in particular has way more

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
value than ammo drums so for those who

value than ammo drums so for those who
don't<00:03:33.780> know<00:03:33.870> what<00:03:34.260> this<00:03:34.380> mod<00:03:34.590> will<00:03:34.739> give<00:03:34.860> you

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
don't know what this mod will give you

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.830 
don't know what this mod will give you
on<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.160> weapon<00:03:35.519> is<00:03:35.700> it'll<00:03:36.269> increase<00:03:36.720> your

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
on the weapon is it'll increase your

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.320 
on the weapon is it'll increase your
ammo<00:03:37.350> cap<00:03:37.620> from<00:03:37.830> 1500<00:03:38.549> up<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.850> nineteen

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
ammo cap from 1500 up to nineteen

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.970 
ammo cap from 1500 up to nineteen
hundred<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:39.840> fifty<00:03:40.260> which<00:03:40.440> is<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.680> increase

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
hundred and fifty which is the increase

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.030 
hundred and fifty which is the increase
of<00:03:41.220> 450<00:03:41.940> rounds<00:03:42.120> which<00:03:43.110> basically<00:03:43.590> works<00:03:43.860> out

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
of 450 rounds which basically works out

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.509 
of 450 rounds which basically works out
to<00:03:44.220> 1/2<00:03:44.730> clips<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.330> it's<00:03:46.170> about<00:03:46.530> 5<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.160> 7

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
to 1/2 clips and it's about 5 to 7

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.220 
to 1/2 clips and it's about 5 to 7
seconds<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.180> actually<00:03:48.600> holding<00:03:48.930> down<00:03:49.049> the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
seconds of actually holding down the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.100 
seconds of actually holding down the
trigger<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.739> that<00:03:49.799> is<00:03:50.459> it<00:03:50.640> basically<00:03:50.820> so<00:03:51.810> and

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
trigger and that is it basically so and

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.770 
trigger and that is it basically so and
the<00:03:52.590> other<00:03:52.620> point<00:03:53.130> is<00:03:53.400> that<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.970> you<00:03:54.570> can<00:03:54.660> only

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
the other point is that you you can only

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.320 
the other point is that you you can only
really<00:03:54.959> run<00:03:55.410> one<00:03:55.739> amyl<00:03:56.160> mod<00:03:56.880> basically

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
really run one amyl mod basically

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.090 
really run one amyl mod basically
because<00:03:57.870> if<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:58.200> run<00:03:58.410> -<00:03:58.680> you'd<00:03:58.980> be

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
because if you run - you'd be

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.060 
because if you run - you'd be
sacrificing<00:03:59.670> an<00:03:59.760> element<00:04:00.120> or<00:04:00.239> too<00:04:00.810> much<00:04:00.959> DPS

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
sacrificing an element or too much DPS

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.650 
sacrificing an element or too much DPS
so<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:02.400> end<00:04:02.549> up<00:04:02.640> consuming<00:04:02.880> more<00:04:03.420> ammo

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
so you end up consuming more ammo

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.110 
so you end up consuming more ammo
anyways<00:04:04.590> as<00:04:04.799> a<00:04:04.830> result<00:04:05.280> so<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.790> point<00:04:06.000> is<00:04:06.060> you

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
anyways as a result so the point is you

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.789 
anyways as a result so the point is you
want<00:04:06.360> to<00:04:06.390> balance<00:04:06.750> out<00:04:06.900> your<00:04:07.049> DPS<00:04:07.500> how<00:04:07.650> much

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
want to balance out your DPS how much

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.160 
want to balance out your DPS how much
ammo<00:04:08.040> you're<00:04:08.310> consuming<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:09.049> rifle<00:04:10.049> a

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
ammo you're consuming and rifle a

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.650 
ammo you're consuming and rifle a
mutation<00:04:10.560> is<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:10.890> best<00:04:11.340> value<00:04:11.640> mod<00:04:12.000> for<00:04:12.420> that

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
mutation is the best value mod for that

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.500 
mutation is the best value mod for that
because<00:04:13.070> every<00:04:14.070> enemy<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.640> kill<00:04:14.970> will<00:04:15.239> drop

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
because every enemy you kill will drop

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.420 
because every enemy you kill will drop
some<00:04:15.810> source<00:04:16.200> of<00:04:16.410> ammo<00:04:16.620> for<00:04:16.890> the<00:04:16.950> most<00:04:17.160> part

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
some source of ammo for the most part

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.800 
some source of ammo for the most part
and<00:04:17.609> you<00:04:17.669> can<00:04:17.700> vert<00:04:18.030> that<00:04:18.180> into<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.540> ammo<00:04:18.690> you

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
and you can vert that into the ammo you

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.240 
and you can vert that into the ammo you
need<00:04:19.049> so<00:04:19.200> that's<00:04:19.350> all<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:19.590> really<00:04:19.680> need<00:04:20.160> to

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
need so that's all you really need to

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.130 
need so that's all you really need to
know<00:04:20.280> about<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.729> the<00:04:21.239> next<00:04:21.540> thing<00:04:21.660> is<00:04:21.840> I<00:04:21.959> am

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
know about that the next thing is I am

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.680 
know about that the next thing is I am
running<00:04:22.410> a<00:04:22.620> faction<00:04:23.099> mod<00:04:23.280> in<00:04:23.550> in<00:04:24.150> this<00:04:24.360> load<00:04:24.660> oh

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
running a faction mod in in this load oh

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.120 
running a faction mod in in this load oh
and<00:04:25.050> this<00:04:25.140> one's<00:04:25.349> for<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.560> Grenier<00:04:25.890> by<00:04:26.070> the

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
and this one's for the Grenier by the

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.560 
and this one's for the Grenier by the
way<00:04:26.280> so<00:04:26.340> instead<00:04:26.700> of<00:04:26.760> running<00:04:26.970> like<00:04:27.330> the

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
way so instead of running like the

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.460 
way so instead of running like the
thermite<00:04:28.320> rounds<00:04:28.650> bling<00:04:29.010> a<00:04:29.100> person<00:04:29.490> force<00:04:30.060> and

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
thermite rounds bling a person force and

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.230 
thermite rounds bling a person force and
rhyme<00:04:31.470> rounds<00:04:31.920> I'm<00:04:32.070> running<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.850> bane<00:04:33.060> of<00:04:33.090> the

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
rhyme rounds I'm running the bane of the

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.670 
rhyme rounds I'm running the bane of the
grenier<00:04:33.630> and<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.870> reason<00:04:34.170> why<00:04:34.290> I'm<00:04:34.410> doing

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
grenier and the reason why I'm doing

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.680 
grenier and the reason why I'm doing
this<00:04:34.830> is<00:04:35.010> because<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.970> bane<00:04:36.120> of<00:04:36.150> Grenier<00:04:36.510> will

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
this is because the bane of Grenier will

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.870 
this is because the bane of Grenier will
give<00:04:36.840> me<00:04:37.020> more<00:04:37.230> top<00:04:37.590> end<00:04:37.620> damage<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:38.490> I<00:04:38.610> felt

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
give me more top end damage and I felt

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.850 
give me more top end damage and I felt
that<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.240> status<00:04:39.690> like<00:04:40.230> you<00:04:40.440> know<00:04:40.560> combined

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
that the status like you know combined

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.430 
that the status like you know combined
with<00:04:40.980> the<00:04:41.070> fiery<00:04:41.310> I<00:04:41.610> had<00:04:41.940> enough<00:04:42.440> consistent

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
with the fiery I had enough consistent

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.800 
with the fiery I had enough consistent
procs<00:04:43.800> to<00:04:44.070> run<00:04:44.280> it<00:04:44.400> this<00:04:44.520> way<00:04:44.760> but<00:04:45.360> this<00:04:45.660> is

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
procs to run it this way but this is

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.020 
procs to run it this way but this is
more<00:04:46.020> of<00:04:46.110> a<00:04:46.170> personal<00:04:46.410> preference<00:04:46.920> so<00:04:47.190> if<00:04:47.760> you

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
more of a personal preference so if you

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.570 
more of a personal preference so if you
wanted<00:04:48.330> to<00:04:48.480> go<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.720> full<00:04:49.320> on<00:04:49.530> status<00:04:50.100> and<00:04:50.340> put<00:04:50.490> in

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
wanted to go a full on status and put in

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.220 
wanted to go a full on status and put in
the<00:04:50.700> rime<00:04:50.910> rounds<00:04:51.270> instead<00:04:51.480> just<00:04:51.690> increase

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
the rime rounds instead just increase

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.380 
the rime rounds instead just increase
this<00:04:52.410> a<00:04:52.470> little<00:04:52.890> bit<00:04:53.040> which<00:04:53.820> would<00:04:54.030> bring<00:04:54.240> it

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
this a little bit which would bring it

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.870 
this a little bit which would bring it
up<00:04:54.510> to<00:04:54.710> 74<00:04:55.710> point<00:04:55.950> to<00:04:56.070> you<00:04:56.130> you<00:04:56.310> can<00:04:56.640> i

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
up to 74 point to you you can i

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.700 
up to 74 point to you you can i
definitely<00:04:57.600> recommend<00:04:57.660> experimenting<00:04:58.590> with

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
definitely recommend experimenting with

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.050 
definitely recommend experimenting with
this<00:04:58.860> and<00:04:59.100> finding<00:04:59.400> which<00:04:59.580> one<00:04:59.790> you<00:04:59.910> like

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
this and finding which one you like

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.790 
this and finding which one you like
better<00:05:00.270> but<00:05:00.630> as<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:01.230> sits<00:05:01.380> right<00:05:01.590> now

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
better but as it sits right now

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.860 
better but as it sits right now
basically<00:05:02.310> what<00:05:02.610> we<00:05:02.700> have<00:05:02.910> is<00:05:02.940> radiation

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
basically what we have is radiation

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.870 
basically what we have is radiation
electric<00:05:04.350> and<00:05:04.500> fire<00:05:04.740> go<00:05:05.310> against<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:05.640> alloy

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
electric and fire go against the alloy

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.310 
electric and fire go against the alloy
target<00:05:06.300> units<00:05:06.510> when<00:05:06.630> aprox<00:05:06.990> you<00:05:07.140> get<00:05:07.260> the

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
target units when aprox you get the

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.500 
target units when aprox you get the
confusion<00:05:07.770> effect<00:05:08.100> malignant<00:05:09.060> force<00:05:09.210> on<00:05:09.390> its

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
confusion effect malignant force on its

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.300 
confusion effect malignant force on its
own<00:05:09.630> will<00:05:09.840> combo<00:05:10.260> with<00:05:10.470> the<00:05:10.500> weapons<00:05:11.010> cooled

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
own will combo with the weapons cooled

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.340 
own will combo with the weapons cooled
already<00:05:11.640> so<00:05:11.820> I<00:05:11.850> have<00:05:12.000> my<00:05:12.210> viral<00:05:12.660> and<00:05:12.840> in<00:05:13.170> vain

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
already so I have my viral and in vain

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.960 
already so I have my viral and in vain
the<00:05:13.500> Grenier<00:05:13.770> is<00:05:13.950> for<00:05:14.160> more<00:05:14.310> top<00:05:14.490> end<00:05:14.550> damage

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
the Grenier is for more top end damage

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.760 
the Grenier is for more top end damage
and<00:05:15.300> that's<00:05:15.960> it<00:05:16.080> for<00:05:16.200> the<00:05:16.290> Grenier<00:05:16.530> but<00:05:16.650> let's

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
and that's it for the Grenier but let's

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.250 
and that's it for the Grenier but let's
move<00:05:16.890> on<00:05:17.010> to<00:05:17.070> corpus<00:05:17.640> so<00:05:18.180> corpus<00:05:18.660> basically

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
move on to corpus so corpus basically

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.020 
move on to corpus so corpus basically
what<00:05:19.350> we're<00:05:19.440> doing<00:05:19.470> now<00:05:19.770> is<00:05:19.980> magnetic<00:05:20.790> first

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
what we're doing now is magnetic first

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.940 
what we're doing now is magnetic first
so<00:05:21.300> high<00:05:21.690> voltage<00:05:22.080> and<00:05:22.110> now<00:05:22.350> I<00:05:22.380> am<00:05:22.620> using<00:05:22.830> the

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
so high voltage and now I am using the

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.980 
so high voltage and now I am using the
rime<00:05:23.220> rounds<00:05:23.640> because<00:05:23.760> electric<00:05:24.330> and<00:05:24.480> frost

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
rime rounds because electric and frost

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.540 
rime rounds because electric and frost
will<00:05:25.230> give<00:05:25.350> you<00:05:25.440> the<00:05:25.530> magnetic<00:05:25.830> combo<00:05:26.310> which

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
will give you the magnetic combo which

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.190 
will give you the magnetic combo which
when<00:05:27.030> it<00:05:27.120> procs<00:05:27.390> will<00:05:27.630> remove<00:05:27.840> shields

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
when it procs will remove shields

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.870 
when it procs will remove shields
completely<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:28.920> then<00:05:29.040> when<00:05:29.250> it<00:05:29.370> doesn't<00:05:29.760> it's

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
completely and then when it doesn't it's

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.730 
completely and then when it doesn't it's
just<00:05:29.940> good<00:05:30.210> damaging<00:05:30.690> shields<00:05:31.080> and<00:05:31.230> then

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
just good damaging shields and then

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.230 
just good damaging shields and then
malignant<00:05:32.160> force<00:05:32.310> on<00:05:32.520> its<00:05:32.700> own<00:05:32.820> will<00:05:33.000> give<00:05:33.120> you

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
malignant force on its own will give you

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.240 
malignant force on its own will give you
the<00:05:33.390> toxic<00:05:33.990> which<00:05:34.530> is<00:05:34.710> what<00:05:34.890> you<00:05:34.980> want<00:05:35.160> because

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
the toxic which is what you want because

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.340 
the toxic which is what you want because
toxic<00:05:35.670> actually<00:05:35.970> goes<00:05:36.090> through<00:05:36.120> shields<00:05:36.960> so

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
toxic actually goes through shields so

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.350 
toxic actually goes through shields so
in<00:05:37.500> this<00:05:37.680> case<00:05:37.950> I<00:05:38.130> actually<00:05:38.340> would<00:05:38.880> not<00:05:39.090> run

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
in this case I actually would not run

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.580 
in this case I actually would not run
the<00:05:39.510> thermite<00:05:39.840> rounds<00:05:40.140> because<00:05:40.290> if<00:05:40.470> I<00:05:40.560> use

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
the thermite rounds because if I use

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.400 
the thermite rounds because if I use
this<00:05:40.950> in<00:05:41.160> place<00:05:41.490> of<00:05:41.730> the<00:05:42.090> bane<00:05:42.630> of<00:05:42.660> corpus<00:05:43.200> I

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
this in place of the bane of corpus I

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.740 
this in place of the bane of corpus I
would<00:05:43.830> get<00:05:44.040> gas<00:05:44.370> instead<00:05:44.970> which<00:05:45.210> is<00:05:45.360> actually

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
would get gas instead which is actually

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.210 
would get gas instead which is actually
bad<00:05:46.080> against<00:05:46.380> the<00:05:46.530> faction<00:05:46.860> you'll<00:05:47.010> get

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
bad against the faction you'll get

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.100 
bad against the faction you'll get
negative<00:05:47.700> multipliers<00:05:48.330> to<00:05:48.420> the<00:05:48.540> flesh<00:05:48.780> units

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
negative multipliers to the flesh units

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.630 
negative multipliers to the flesh units
so<00:05:49.620> in<00:05:49.740> this<00:05:49.860> case<00:05:50.070> you<00:05:50.220> don't<00:05:50.280> really<00:05:50.490> have<00:05:50.580> a

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
so in this case you don't really have a

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.550 
so in this case you don't really have a
choices<00:05:50.880> run<00:05:51.210> the<00:05:51.360> bane<00:05:51.540> of<00:05:51.570> the<00:05:52.170> corpus

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
choices run the bane of the corpus

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.530 
choices run the bane of the corpus
basically<00:05:52.980> moving<00:05:53.760> on<00:05:53.940> to<00:05:54.060> the<00:05:54.150> last<00:05:54.360> load

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
basically moving on to the last load

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.870 
basically moving on to the last load
although<00:05:54.840> the<00:05:55.050> first<00:05:55.290> thing<00:05:55.680> is<00:05:56.040> basically

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
although the first thing is basically

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.510 
although the first thing is basically
for<00:05:57.120> the<00:05:57.270> infested<00:05:58.050> so<00:05:58.680> with<00:05:59.010> infested

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
for the infested so with infested

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.650 
for the infested so with infested
basically<00:05:59.820> what<00:05:59.910> you<00:05:59.970> want<00:06:00.120> to<00:06:00.180> do<00:06:00.300> is<00:06:00.510> run

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
basically what you want to do is run

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.180 
basically what you want to do is run
high-voltage<00:06:01.080> and<00:06:01.410> malignant<00:06:01.680> force<00:06:01.860> first

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
high-voltage and malignant force first

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.310 
high-voltage and malignant force first
to<00:06:02.430> give<00:06:02.550> you<00:06:02.700> your<00:06:02.850> corrosive<00:06:03.360> damage<00:06:03.390> really

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
to give you your corrosive damage really

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.690 
to give you your corrosive damage really
good<00:06:04.440> damage<00:06:04.620> against<00:06:04.920> the<00:06:05.070> ancients<00:06:05.580> and

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
good damage against the ancients and

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.850 
good damage against the ancients and
then<00:06:06.210> thermite<00:06:06.690> rounds<00:06:07.050> on<00:06:07.230> its<00:06:07.410> own<00:06:07.590> will

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
then thermite rounds on its own will

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.190 
then thermite rounds on its own will
combine<00:06:08.250> with<00:06:08.520> the<00:06:08.880> cold<00:06:09.570> which<00:06:09.840> will<00:06:10.020> give

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
combine with the cold which will give

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.530 
combine with the cold which will give
you<00:06:10.350> blasts<00:06:10.800> basically<00:06:11.580> and<00:06:11.760> again<00:06:12.420> I'm

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
you blasts basically and again I'm

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.360 
you blasts basically and again I'm
running<00:06:12.630> the<00:06:12.810> bane<00:06:13.020> mod<00:06:13.260> just<00:06:13.950> for<00:06:14.160> a<00:06:14.190> more

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
running the bane mod just for a more

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.220 
running the bane mod just for a more
top-end<00:06:14.670> damage<00:06:15.240> and<00:06:15.420> this<00:06:15.750> has<00:06:15.870> been<00:06:16.020> working

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.230 
top-end damage and this has been working

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.470 
top-end damage and this has been working
for<00:06:16.410> me<00:06:16.650> rather<00:06:16.890> well<00:06:17.010> now<00:06:17.430> for<00:06:17.700> the<00:06:17.880> voids

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.480 
for me rather well now for the voids

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.690 
for me rather well now for the voids
though<00:06:18.870> and<00:06:19.800> I<00:06:19.890> did<00:06:20.040> mention<00:06:20.220> in<00:06:20.400> the<00:06:20.460> voids

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
though and I did mention in the voids

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.360 
though and I did mention in the voids
that<00:06:21.030> it<00:06:21.900> isn't<00:06:22.380> the<00:06:22.440> best<00:06:22.620> weapon<00:06:22.980> for<00:06:23.010> it<00:06:23.250> but

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
that it isn't the best weapon for it but

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.950 
that it isn't the best weapon for it but
if<00:06:23.460> you<00:06:23.550> have<00:06:23.730> to<00:06:23.940> absolutely<00:06:24.390> bring<00:06:24.690> it<00:06:24.810> in

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
if you have to absolutely bring it in

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.330 
if you have to absolutely bring it in
there<00:06:25.170> basically<00:06:25.410> what<00:06:25.740> you'd<00:06:25.860> want<00:06:25.890> to<00:06:26.130> do<00:06:26.220> is

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
there basically what you'd want to do is

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.770 
there basically what you'd want to do is
first<00:06:26.520> put<00:06:26.730> the<00:06:26.820> rime<00:06:27.000> rounds<00:06:27.330> on<00:06:27.480> so<00:06:27.660> you<00:06:27.750> have

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
first put the rime rounds on so you have

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.380 
first put the rime rounds on so you have
corrosive<00:06:28.290> cold<00:06:28.590> and<00:06:28.860> then<00:06:29.520> in<00:06:29.700> this<00:06:29.880> case<00:06:29.940> I

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
corrosive cold and then in this case I

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.870 
corrosive cold and then in this case I
felt<00:06:30.930> it<00:06:31.230> was<00:06:31.380> best<00:06:31.740> to<00:06:31.890> use<00:06:32.160> do<00:06:32.310> a<00:06:32.370> two<00:06:32.700> from

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
felt it was best to use do a two from

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.030 
felt it was best to use do a two from
the<00:06:33.000> top<00:06:33.180> storm<00:06:33.540> bringer<00:06:33.840> which<00:06:33.990> gives<00:06:34.230> me<00:06:34.350> 60%

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.040 
the top storm bringer which gives me 60%

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.620 
the top storm bringer which gives me 60%
electro<00:06:35.640> damage<00:06:36.000> which<00:06:36.150> would<00:06:36.270> give<00:06:36.390> me<00:06:36.419> more

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
electro damage which would give me more

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.130 
electro damage which would give me more
corrosive

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
corrosive

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.250 
corrosive
now<00:06:37.650> in<00:06:38.370> this<00:06:38.970> case<00:06:39.210> what<00:06:39.570> you<00:06:39.660> can<00:06:39.930> do<00:06:40.140> you

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
now in this case what you can do you

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.450 
now in this case what you can do you
have<00:06:40.350> actually<00:06:40.830> a<00:06:40.860> couple<00:06:41.070> more

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
have actually a couple more

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.980 
have actually a couple more
options<00:06:41.819> the<00:06:41.940> first<00:06:41.970> thing<00:06:42.330> you<00:06:42.449> can<00:06:42.600> do<00:06:42.780> is

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
options the first thing you can do is

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.260 
options the first thing you can do is
you<00:06:43.380> can<00:06:43.500> actually<00:06:43.830> use<00:06:43.979> the<00:06:44.250> crowns<00:06:45.030> to<00:06:45.150> give

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
you can actually use the crowns to give

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.240 
you can actually use the crowns to give
you<00:06:45.330> more<00:06:45.479> ice<00:06:45.780> damage<00:06:46.259> which<00:06:46.740> isn't<00:06:47.009> really

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
you more ice damage which isn't really

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.760 
you more ice damage which isn't really
necessary<00:06:47.910> I<00:06:47.970> mean<00:06:48.120> it's<00:06:48.240> a<00:06:48.270> full<00:06:48.449> 90%<00:06:48.780> but<00:06:49.319> the

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.770 
necessary I mean it's a full 90% but the

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:50.870 
necessary I mean it's a full 90% but the
reason<00:06:50.039> why<00:06:50.099> I<00:06:50.130> use<00:06:50.310> the<00:06:50.430> two<00:06:50.580> from<00:06:50.759> the<00:06:50.789> top

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 
reason why I use the two from the top

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.570 
reason why I use the two from the top
stormbringer<00:06:51.509> is<00:06:51.810> because<00:06:52.169> I<00:06:52.500> more<00:06:53.310> corrosive

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 
stormbringer is because I more corrosive

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.550 
stormbringer is because I more corrosive
damage<00:06:53.759> is<00:06:54.030> better<00:06:54.240> for<00:06:54.449> the<00:06:54.509> Gunners<00:06:54.870> but<00:06:55.440> the

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 
damage is better for the Gunners but the

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.330 
damage is better for the Gunners but the
other<00:06:55.740> option<00:06:56.250> you<00:06:56.280> have<00:06:56.400> is<00:06:56.580> well<00:06:57.060> is<00:06:58.190> you<00:06:59.190> can

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
other option you have is well is you can

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.180 
other option you have is well is you can
basically<00:06:59.490> do<00:06:59.849> the<00:07:00.030> radiation<00:07:00.770> viral<00:07:01.770> combo

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.190 
basically do the radiation viral combo

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.890 
basically do the radiation viral combo
which<00:07:02.639> you'll<00:07:03.000> get<00:07:03.090> the<00:07:03.180> confusion<00:07:03.630> effects

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
which you'll get the confusion effects

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.659 
which you'll get the confusion effects
you<00:07:04.020> can<00:07:04.110> actually<00:07:04.349> do<00:07:05.220> that<00:07:05.370> kind<00:07:05.550> of<00:07:05.580> a

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:05.669 
you can actually do that kind of a

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:08.089 
you can actually do that kind of a
thermite<00:07:06.060> round<00:07:06.330> with<00:07:07.110> wait<00:07:07.710> how<00:07:07.860> do<00:07:07.919> I<00:07:08.009> have

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:08.099 
thermite round with wait how do I have

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:11.089 
thermite round with wait how do I have
this<00:07:08.280> here<00:07:08.930> mixes<00:07:09.930> mixes<00:07:10.590> around<00:07:10.770> there<00:07:10.889> we<00:07:10.979> go

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:11.099 
this here mixes mixes around there we go

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:13.520 
this here mixes mixes around there we go
there<00:07:11.310> we<00:07:11.340> go<00:07:11.400> so<00:07:11.870> basically<00:07:12.870> you'll<00:07:13.259> get<00:07:13.410> the

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.530 
there we go so basically you'll get the

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.589 
there we go so basically you'll get the
viral<00:07:13.919> and<00:07:14.220> radiation<00:07:14.729> which<00:07:15.090> still<00:07:15.330> works

00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:15.599 
viral and radiation which still works

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:17.960 
viral and radiation which still works
really<00:07:15.990> well<00:07:16.289> because<00:07:16.949> you<00:07:17.669> can<00:07:17.789> get<00:07:17.880> the
