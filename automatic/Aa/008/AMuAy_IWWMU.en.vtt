00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 I am a representative of the forest communities in Oddar Meanchey province, 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 especially the Sang Rukhavon forest community. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 I have participated in the meetings with the communities here 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 to discuss the REDD project with them. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 The people in these communities have been very optimistic 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 to hear about this REDD program because 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 They hope that the project will help them reduce poverty. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Our annual activities for the forest are the following: 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 We routinely patrol the forest to look for offenders 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 and I take care of the efforts to disseminate information 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 to raise awareness about the environment 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 and the essential thing that the forest is for the life of these people. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 We have monthly meetings of the Community Forest committee. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 We are also involved in a program to order 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 the trees and reforest. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 We have ordered this tree and another one as a model 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 for the whole forest area. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 After ordering, the tree becomes like a monk 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 and we tell people in the community, 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 especially those who follow Buddhism, 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 that this forest has life forever, 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 and if they cut it will bring bad luck. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 I hope that with the support 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 of the Clinton Foundation, the Oddar Meanchey forestry project 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 be successful
