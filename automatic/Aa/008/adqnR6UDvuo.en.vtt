come on go we have a community tree farm
it's<00:01:00.409> very<00:01:00.559> efficient<00:01:01.129> actually<00:01:02.499> and<00:01:03.760> we

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
it's very efficient actually and we

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
finally have our wheat farm which still

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.830 
finally have our wheat farm which still
needs<00:01:08.030> to<00:01:08.270> be<00:01:08.650> fully<00:01:10.030> what's<00:01:11.030> it<00:01:11.150> called<00:01:11.330> code

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
needs to be fully what's it called code

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.860 
needs to be fully what's it called code
i<00:01:12.140> guess<00:01:12.410> or<00:01:12.710> killed<00:01:13.750> but<00:01:14.750> anyways<00:01:15.550> let's<00:01:16.550> go

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
i guess or killed but anyways let's go

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.740 
i guess or killed but anyways let's go
back<00:01:17.870> to<00:01:18.080> my<00:01:18.230> home<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:18.970> we've<00:01:19.970> done<00:01:20.120> quite<00:01:20.600> a

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
back to my home and we've done quite a

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.030 
back to my home and we've done quite a
bit<00:01:20.870> actually<00:01:21.200> as<00:01:21.440> you<00:01:21.530> can<00:01:21.680> see<00:01:21.860> in<00:01:21.950> the

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
bit actually as you can see in the

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.720 
bit actually as you can see in the
distance<00:01:22.160> we've<00:01:23.000> claimed<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.720> lot<00:01:23.960> of<00:01:24.110> land

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
distance we've claimed a lot of land

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.830 
distance we've claimed a lot of land
because<00:01:25.730> we<00:01:25.880> have<00:01:26.000> some<00:01:26.180> good<00:01:26.330> ideas<00:01:26.390> for

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
because we have some good ideas for

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.360 
because we have some good ideas for
future<00:01:27.200> expansions<00:01:27.740> as<00:01:27.920> you<00:01:28.010> can<00:01:28.130> see<00:01:28.220> we've

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
future expansions as you can see we've

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.520 
future expansions as you can see we've
made<00:01:28.580> a<00:01:28.610> road<00:01:28.880> this<00:01:29.540> is<00:01:29.690> Stan<00:01:29.900> stone<00:01:30.200> not<00:01:30.410> just

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
made a road this is Stan stone not just

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.470 
made a road this is Stan stone not just
normal<00:01:30.800> stuff<00:01:31.340> sand<00:01:32.090> so<00:01:32.480> yeah<00:01:34.390> there's<00:01:35.390> that

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
normal stuff sand so yeah there's that

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.300 
normal stuff sand so yeah there's that
right<00:01:35.840> now<00:01:35.960> I<00:01:36.170> think<00:01:36.560> I<00:01:36.650> think<00:01:36.950> that<00:01:37.070> was<00:01:37.160> their

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
right now I think I think that was their

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.250 
right now I think I think that was their
last<00:01:37.490> time<00:01:37.730> but<00:01:38.180> now<00:01:38.300> it<00:01:38.450> breaks<00:01:38.660> off<00:01:38.870> into<00:01:39.140> a

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
last time but now it breaks off into a

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.250 
last time but now it breaks off into a
river<00:01:40.420> and<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.540> river<00:01:41.570> goes<00:01:41.960> all<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:42.140> way

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
river and the river goes all the way

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.460 
river and the river goes all the way
down<00:01:42.290> to<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:42.530> ocean<00:01:43.300> and<00:01:44.300> then<00:01:44.840> up<00:01:44.990> there<00:01:45.230> you

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
down to the ocean and then up there you

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.080 
down to the ocean and then up there you
can<00:01:45.590> see<00:01:45.620> there's<00:01:45.860> a<00:01:45.920> dirt<00:01:46.130> outline<00:01:46.520> of<00:01:46.550> that's

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
can see there's a dirt outline of that's

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.950 
can see there's a dirt outline of that's
going<00:01:47.210> to<00:01:47.300> be<00:01:47.360> our<00:01:47.390> main<00:01:47.600> building<00:01:48.050> eventually

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
going to be our main building eventually

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.920 
going to be our main building eventually
and<00:01:51.190> what<00:01:52.190> else<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:52.700> think<00:01:53.690> that's<00:01:53.810> everything

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
and what else I think that's everything

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.020 
and what else I think that's everything
although<00:01:54.260> there<00:01:54.530> for<00:01:54.770> now<00:01:54.940> I'm<00:01:55.940> actually

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
although there for now I'm actually

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.960 
although there for now I'm actually
going<00:01:56.300> to<00:01:56.500> show<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:57.560> our<00:01:57.890> planned<00:01:58.670> future

going to show you our planned future

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.820 
going to show you our planned future
expansion<00:01:59.600> and<00:01:59.780> then<00:02:00.290> I'll<00:02:00.380> get<00:02:00.530> on<00:02:00.620> to<00:02:00.740> the

building in the city to just be just
full<00:03:02.239> of<00:03:02.269> epicness<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:03.379> that's<00:03:04.069> our<00:03:04.250> sea<00:03:04.430> port

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
full of epicness so that's our sea port

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.819 
full of epicness so that's our sea port
right<00:03:04.819> there<00:03:04.879> and<00:03:05.269> that's<00:03:05.450> our<00:03:05.810> what's<00:03:06.739> it

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
right there and that's our what's it

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.089 
right there and that's our what's it
called<00:03:06.980> lighthouse<00:03:07.310> um<00:03:08.109> if<00:03:09.109> right<00:03:09.560> sniffing

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
called lighthouse um if right sniffing

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.670 
called lighthouse um if right sniffing
dead<00:03:10.670> live<00:03:10.879> data<00:03:11.060> if<00:03:11.420> redstone<00:03:12.109> was<00:03:12.290> brighter

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
dead live data if redstone was brighter

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.470 
dead live data if redstone was brighter
we<00:03:13.190> would<00:03:13.340> have<00:03:13.370> definitely<00:03:13.639> made<00:03:13.879> like<00:03:14.449> a

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
we would have definitely made like a

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.629 
we would have definitely made like a
flashing<00:03:15.049> tower<00:03:15.319> the<00:03:15.919> redstone<00:03:16.310> is<00:03:16.340> just

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
flashing tower the redstone is just

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.059 
flashing tower the redstone is just
pathetic<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:17.480> we're<00:03:18.230> going<00:03:18.319> to<00:03:18.410> leave<00:03:18.560> that<00:03:18.590> as

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
pathetic so we're going to leave that as

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.409 
pathetic so we're going to leave that as
is<00:03:19.099> for<00:03:19.489> now<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.900> this<00:03:21.889> is<00:03:21.980> our<00:03:22.069> seaport<00:03:22.519> we

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
is for now and this is our seaport we

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:24.849 
is for now and this is our seaport we
have<00:03:23.540> a<00:03:23.569> nice<00:03:23.720> little<00:03:23.750> bridge<00:03:24.169> leading<00:03:24.500> over

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
have a nice little bridge leading over

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.119

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
stumped on the seaport but lighthouse

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.379 
stumped on the seaport but lighthouse
were<00:04:16.820> pretty<00:04:17.000> much<00:04:17.090> done<00:04:17.329> I<00:04:17.620> have<00:04:18.620> an<00:04:18.709> idea<00:04:18.799> for

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
were pretty much done I have an idea for

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.250 
were pretty much done I have an idea for
building<00:04:20.389> kind<00:04:20.930> of<00:04:21.019> in

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
building kind of in

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.710 
building kind of in
to<00:04:21.320> that<00:04:21.440> mountain<00:04:22.330> and<00:04:23.330> then<00:04:23.450> we<00:04:23.570> also

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
to that mountain and then we also

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.450 
to that mountain and then we also
obviously<00:04:24.110> have<00:04:24.470> that<00:04:24.620> main<00:04:24.800> building<00:04:25.190> and

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
obviously have that main building and

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.070 
obviously have that main building and
then<00:04:25.790> like<00:04:26.000> I<00:04:26.120> said<00:04:26.300> before<00:04:26.390> the<00:04:26.690> other<00:04:26.780> stuff

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
then like I said before the other stuff

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.950 
then like I said before the other stuff

maybe<00:06:28.480> it<00:06:29.480> looks<00:06:29.600> really<00:06:29.960> cool<00:06:30.170> it's<00:06:30.470> kind<00:06:30.620> of

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
maybe it looks really cool it's kind of

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.820 
maybe it looks really cool it's kind of
like<00:06:30.770> a<00:06:31.390> 2d<00:06:32.390> minecraft<00:06:32.570> but<00:06:33.320> I<00:06:33.500> guess<00:06:33.800> I

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
like a 2d minecraft but I guess I

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.100 
like a 2d minecraft but I guess I
shouldn't<00:06:34.130> really<00:06:34.220> be<00:06:34.340> compared<00:06:35.180> to<00:06:35.330> it<00:06:35.450> it's

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
shouldn't really be compared to it it's

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.080 
shouldn't really be compared to it it's
like<00:06:36.590> a<00:06:36.650> 2d<00:06:36.980> minecraft<00:06:37.160> in<00:06:37.640> the<00:06:37.670> way<00:06:37.880> that<00:06:38.110> I

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
like a 2d minecraft in the way that I

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.860 
like a 2d minecraft in the way that I
don't<00:06:41.090> know<00:06:41.150> that's<00:06:41.300> gonna<00:06:41.450> be<00:06:41.540> a<00:06:41.570> horrible

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
don't know that's gonna be a horrible

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.320 
don't know that's gonna be a horrible
comparison<00:06:42.410> in<00:06:42.710> the<00:06:42.830> way<00:06:42.950> that<00:06:43.160> Call<00:06:44.000> of<00:06:44.030> Duty

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330 
comparison in the way that Call of Duty

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.110 
comparison in the way that Call of Duty
is<00:06:44.480> a<00:06:44.900> battlefield<00:06:45.740> like<00:06:46.490> you<00:06:46.640> know<00:06:46.730> they<00:06:46.910> they

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 
is a battlefield like you know they they

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.360 
is a battlefield like you know they they
have<00:06:47.270> some<00:06:47.570> things<00:06:47.780> that<00:06:47.840> are<00:06:47.930> saying<00:06:48.370> but

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
have some things that are saying but

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.840 
have some things that are saying but
overall<00:06:50.090> it's<00:06:50.330> a<00:06:50.360> different<00:06:50.630> game<00:06:51.670> this<00:06:52.670> is

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:52.850 
overall it's a different game this is

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.570 
overall it's a different game this is
like<00:06:52.970> a<00:06:53.000> 2d<00:06:53.360> side<00:06:53.390> scroller<00:06:54.050> that<00:06:54.740> you<00:06:55.340> build

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
like a 2d side scroller that you build

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.720 
like a 2d side scroller that you build
stuff<00:06:55.850> and<00:06:56.150> it's<00:06:56.270> randomly<00:06:56.630> generated<00:06:57.200> and

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:57.730 
stuff and it's randomly generated and

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.310 
stuff and it's randomly generated and
you<00:06:58.730> can<00:06:58.880> craft<00:06:59.150> tools<00:06:59.510> with<00:06:59.840> a<00:06:59.870> crafting

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.320 
you can craft tools with a crafting

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.330 
you can craft tools with a crafting
table<00:07:00.350> so<00:07:00.710> there's<00:07:00.860> obviously<00:07:00.950> some

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
table so there's obviously some

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.920 
table so there's obviously some
similarities<00:07:01.880> but<00:07:02.060> it<00:07:02.240> has<00:07:02.420> lots<00:07:02.660> of<00:07:02.750> stuff

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:02.930 
similarities but it has lots of stuff

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.240 
similarities but it has lots of stuff
