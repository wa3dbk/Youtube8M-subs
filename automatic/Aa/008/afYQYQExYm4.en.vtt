00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.069
 attention google has with the last play 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.720
 store update a change 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.340
 publishes the developers 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.830
 dangerous rear door leaves open 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.450
 with the version 4 819 was now 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.610
 finally paypal as a payment 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.590
 This change was also integrated 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.630
 meaning that hardly anyone will do the rest 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.220
 has noticed developers can now 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.630
 within an update even more 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.670
 Request corrections 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.500
 without you as a user something 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.970
 but must confirm how is that 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.800
 possible, after all, I'll be at one 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.900
 update informed with a little window 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.520
 and then there is now sms 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.800
 write or would like to know in the future 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.420
 where you are android 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.300
 divided all possible rights in 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.430
 groups of which there are a total of 13 under 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.170
 other contacts phone location or 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.550
 also identity these groups have 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.559
 generally always a reason to exist 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.719
 and also simplify the whole 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.309
 Right system for developers many apps 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.530
 For example, you need the phone status 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.059
 read and identify the app 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.539
 be paused in the event of a call 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.920
 can 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.750
 but with the new changes have to 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.160
 one in the corrections within 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.579
 a group not further confirmed 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.199
 become 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.420
 instead, you only give it to yours once 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.100
 okay for the group phone and all 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.689
 other rights within this group 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.760
 can later just to come 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.260
 the problem the group phone could be 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.939
 also directly get the authorization 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.750
 on your imei and imsi numbers 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.369
 access 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.320
 google has with android 4.3 the 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.970
 New apps introduced with the ever 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.590
 a sender's permissions within 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.540
 can disable an app again 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.610
 but that is awkward and holland 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.680
 therefore always an action of you pay attention 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.540
 please be sure which apps 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.549
 installed what the authority 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.540
 include and disable especially the 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.619
 automatic update their apps 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.390
 a detailed article on this 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.799
 theme a resolution of all app 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.140
 permissions that exist at all and 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.700
 what do these and the app with the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.200
 these permissions again 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.390
 you can deactivate all that you find 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.520
 on this page us in the giga article 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.140
 or below in the description and on 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.180
 this page you still have the test 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.520
 the last two devices we had 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.740
 makes student comments for htc and 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.180
 samsung galaxy s 5 write us if 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.590
 your developer down in the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.270
 comments on this update 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.310
 Hold that if it is really good for you 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.869
 whether that becomes easier or not 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.040
 google with it a really thick 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.040
 fat carver has allowed
