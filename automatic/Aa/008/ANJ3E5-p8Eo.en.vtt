for this review but I really don't see

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.580 
for this review but I really don't see
why<00:01:05.400> my<00:01:05.700> negative<00:01:06.299> reaction<00:01:06.869> was<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.229> strong

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
why my negative reaction was so strong

why my negative reaction was so strong
at<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> time<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.369> mean<00:01:08.909> they<00:01:09.210> definitely<00:01:09.630> did

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
at the time I mean they definitely did

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.080 
at the time I mean they definitely did
change<00:01:10.320> their<00:01:10.560> sound<00:01:10.799> after

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
change their sound after

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.700 
change their sound after
Transatlanticism<00:01:12.090> but<00:01:12.900> not<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.500> worst

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
Transatlanticism but not in the worst

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.609 
Transatlanticism but not in the worst
way<00:01:13.950> possible<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.790> was<00:01:14.970> slower<00:01:15.689> more<00:01:16.259> mellow

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
way possible it was slower more mellow

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.120 
way possible it was slower more mellow
more<00:01:17.400> baladi<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.360> guess<00:01:18.600> maybe<00:01:18.900> at<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.259> time<00:01:19.560> it

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
more baladi I guess maybe at the time it

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.640 
more baladi I guess maybe at the time it

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
everything that I was going to hear but

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.960 
everything that I was going to hear but
after<00:02:10.229> many<00:02:10.440> listens<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.340> album<00:02:11.610> I

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
after many listens to this album I

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.910 
after many listens to this album I
couldn't<00:02:12.629> find<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.959> single<00:02:13.319> thing

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
and I think that's mostly because this

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.180 
and I think that's mostly because this

I'm<00:04:06.329> gonna<00:04:07.079> let<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:07.500> shine<00:04:07.970> this<00:04:08.970> little<00:04:09.840> light

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
I'm gonna let it shine this little light

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.189 
I'm gonna let it shine this little light
of<00:04:10.650> mine<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:12.060> band<00:04:12.299> does<00:04:12.449> experiment<00:04:13.139> a

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
of mine the band does experiment a

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:14.809 
of mine the band does experiment a
little<00:04:13.349> bit<00:04:13.470> on<00:04:13.739> some<00:04:13.949> of<00:04:13.980> these<00:04:14.129> tracks<00:04:14.519> but

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
little bit on some of these tracks but

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.539 
little bit on some of these tracks but
the<00:04:15.359> whole<00:04:15.540> album<00:04:15.810> is<00:04:16.169> so<00:04:16.440> low-key<00:04:17.160> that<00:04:17.519> I

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
the whole album is so low-key that I

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.279 
the whole album is so low-key that I
remember<00:04:18.090> when<00:04:18.209> I<00:04:18.239> was<00:04:18.419> first<00:04:18.599> listening<00:04:19.169> to

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
remember when I was first listening to

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:20.569 
remember when I was first listening to
it<00:04:19.410> these<00:04:19.530> moments<00:04:19.979> just<00:04:20.070> really<00:04:20.340> kind<00:04:20.519> of

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
it these moments just really kind of

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.209 
it these moments just really kind of
blew<00:04:21.419> by<00:04:21.750> me<00:04:21.989> I'm<00:04:22.169> thinking<00:04:22.530> of<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.710> track<00:04:22.950> like

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:23.219 
blew by me I'm thinking of a track like

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:25.640 
blew by me I'm thinking of a track like
doors<00:04:24.090> unlocked<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:24.960> open

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
doors unlocked and open

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.219 
doors unlocked and open
which<00:04:25.800> is<00:04:26.100> really<00:04:26.910> rigid<00:04:27.270> really<00:04:27.990> kind<00:04:28.199> of

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
which is really rigid really kind of

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.010 
which is really rigid really kind of
mid-tempo<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.250> reminds<00:04:29.639> me<00:04:29.699> of<00:04:29.820> like

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
mid-tempo and reminds me of like

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.659 
mid-tempo and reminds me of like
krautrock<00:04:31.020> maybe<00:04:31.740> even<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.190> same<00:04:32.370> direction

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
krautrock maybe even the same direction

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.999 
krautrock maybe even the same direction
that<00:04:32.910> Magua<00:04:33.600> was<00:04:33.900> taking<00:04:34.259> their<00:04:34.440> latest<00:04:34.800> album

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
that Magua was taking their latest album

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.580 
that Magua was taking their latest album

Gibbard<00:04:50.460> x'v<00:04:50.759> ice<00:04:50.970> on<00:04:51.389> this<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.199> way<00:04:52.289> he<00:04:52.500> sings

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.260 
Gibbard x'v ice on this the way he sings
I<00:04:53.190> guess<00:04:53.580> he<00:04:54.270> just<00:04:54.530> doesn't<00:04:55.530> have<00:04:55.889> as<00:04:56.039> much

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
I guess he just doesn't have as much

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.240 
I guess he just doesn't have as much
inflection<00:04:57.270> or<00:04:57.419> emotion<00:04:58.320> in<00:04:58.440> his<00:04:58.620> voice<00:04:58.650> as<00:04:59.100> he

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
inflection or emotion in his voice as he

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.060 
inflection or emotion in his voice as he
used<00:04:59.490> to<00:04:59.729> he<00:05:00.180> just<00:05:00.389> flatly<00:05:01.110> delivers<00:05:01.770> these

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
used to he just flatly delivers these

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.969 
used to he just flatly delivers these
same<00:05:02.729> vocal<00:05:03.120> melodies<00:05:03.660> over<00:05:04.169> and<00:05:04.410> over<00:05:04.800> and

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
same vocal melodies over and over and

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.060 
same vocal melodies over and over and
without<00:05:05.760> making<00:05:06.330> any<00:05:06.630> alterations<00:05:07.590> to<00:05:07.860> them

without making any alterations to them
melodically<00:05:08.910> or<00:05:09.229> emotionally<00:05:10.229> but<00:05:10.500> still

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
melodically or emotionally but still

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.320 
melodically or emotionally but still
that<00:05:11.070> didn't<00:05:11.340> really<00:05:11.490> ruin<00:05:11.910> any<00:05:12.060> of<00:05:12.180> these

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
that didn't really ruin any of these

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.620 
that didn't really ruin any of these

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.520 
songs for me at worst at worst this
album<00:05:16.169> was<00:05:17.150> underwhelming<00:05:18.530> underwhelming

album was underwhelming underwhelming

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.500 
album was underwhelming underwhelming
and<00:05:19.650> even<00:05:20.310> though<00:05:20.430> I<00:05:20.460> wish<00:05:20.729> these<00:05:21.000> guys<00:05:21.240> would

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
and even though I wish these guys would

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.170 
and even though I wish these guys would
stop<00:05:22.110> using<00:05:22.500> electronics<00:05:23.430> in<00:05:23.639> their<00:05:23.849> songs

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
stop using electronics in their songs

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.779 
stop using electronics in their songs
when<00:05:24.900> I<00:05:25.110> hear<00:05:25.380> a<00:05:25.410> little<00:05:25.680> sequence<00:05:26.220> a<00:05:26.520> little

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
when I hear a little sequence a little

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.249 
when I hear a little sequence a little
rhythm<00:05:27.030> here<00:05:27.479> or<00:05:27.599> there<00:05:27.780> or<00:05:27.810> something<00:05:28.139> like

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
rhythm here or there or something like

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.500 
rhythm here or there or something like
that<00:05:28.470> that's<00:05:28.710> generated<00:05:29.490> electronically<00:05:30.300> or

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
that that's generated electronically or

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.260 
that that's generated electronically or
in<00:05:30.720> effect<00:05:31.169> or<00:05:31.410> a<00:05:31.470> string<00:05:32.340> arrangement<00:05:32.910> it's

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
in effect or a string arrangement it's

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.480 
in effect or a string arrangement it's
not<00:05:33.510> like<00:05:33.750> it<00:05:34.020> takes<00:05:34.620> over<00:05:34.889> the<00:05:35.010> whole<00:05:35.130> song

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
not like it takes over the whole song

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.909 
not like it takes over the whole song
it's<00:05:35.729> not<00:05:35.789> like<00:05:36.000> it<00:05:36.090> swallows<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:37.199> song<00:05:37.470> all

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
it's not like it swallows the song all

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.430 
it's not like it swallows the song all
of<00:05:38.340> the<00:05:38.490> additions<00:05:39.300> around<00:05:39.660> these<00:05:39.840> songs<00:05:40.110> are

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
of the additions around these songs are

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.670 
of the additions around these songs are
very<00:05:40.699> quiet<00:05:41.699> very<00:05:42.120> subtle<00:05:42.630> and<00:05:42.750> I<00:05:43.110> like<00:05:43.409> that

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
very quiet very subtle and I like that

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.550 
very quiet very subtle and I like that
it<00:05:43.889> doesn't<00:05:44.070> distract<00:05:44.610> it<00:05:45.110> complements<00:05:46.110> maybe

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560
