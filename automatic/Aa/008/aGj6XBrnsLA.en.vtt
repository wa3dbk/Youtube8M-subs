 I do not go to the kitchen to start hearing what we anticipated tenderness that makes a 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.010
 I am a little player for a woman of benjamin to Madariaga hospital and we go 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.250
 to take for 31 with 60 area vaccinate to play again and here comes the hake

 the Iraqi wine was sent before this motivated to deny that buendía as 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.620
 these can be heard very well for your melted and encouraging baby I thought that 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:22.970
 staff peñarol derivatives 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.630
 last week banned Friday the addictive downpour a hake 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.210
 with a green sauce that the protagonist of the green sauce or make the parsley 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.840
 client 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.890
 so good 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.350
 we are going to like this in a very interesting amount that can be used 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.550
 even for other types of meat as well as for use as well, it can be used 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.309
 also for carmen 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.179
 and why not for some kind of pact feel you are going to see that it is very good 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:52.440
 prepare is very interesting very tasty 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.860
 and with an ingredient that super economico that the dyn parsley so good we go 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.300
 to use hake but it can be any other type of fish that 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.199
 let's use 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.909
 We could also use a tenderloin tuna was going to be very good afternoon eta 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.219
 percent if they have can they almost want to do it with poso is also a 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:14.950
 excellent opportunity to cheer up doing it is like stepping on a little broth 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.630
 of vegetables a touch flour just something we are going to use some potatoes because 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.399
 as well commented the garnish of our dish anap make a 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.600
 preparation that is given to rotating dads and is that out there at home is not so 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.369
 known but is a classic of gastronomy as it would be made of 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.070
 explain the truth is very easy closed the amalia potato was cooking south a 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.890
 pan has been the same and they call me papa rice papa rospigliosi 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.290
 There is a technique in the middle that to get rid of the infliction that is inflicted more 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.480
 of grip for obeying the potato in water and with that the problem is solved 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.540
 but that we are going to see it is going to mobilize a little bit of butter that also 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.030
 could have replaced anyway by some olive oil we were going to 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.530
 use of course pepper salt and some sweet paprika that I eat 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.990
 potato company the first day there is an extraordinary being ep but also 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.250
 It will be a good opportunity to use rosemary if we have a little plant 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.200
 erroneous and house a romerito for example that is a great companion of de of this 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.900
 tuber can be also made the garnish with another type of tuber 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.840
 like carrots for a hundred goes to tata even very very good ezequiel 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.460
 rosemary came to the potato jujuy rosemary and potato are but a just rosemary 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.090
 because there are some who want to become strong in the country and the rosemary very 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.829
 invasive you really have to pay the appropriate amount of rosemary 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.090
 and you also have to keep in mind that fresh is different from dry 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.040
 if we have rosemary pse with a bottle yes when we put it is going to be 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.450
 much more invasive than the fresh one still in for the cool like that 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.540
 It encloses lightening is a bit with cooking but the cecor like that keeps 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.239
 more aromas and perfumes a lot more paints this Thursday during cooking 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.970
 rosemary joseph puts at the end of the test can be put during cooking the subject 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.930
 no, I do not think that beyond that there is a question, and win would have to 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.150
 burn a lot to generate bad smell in Lima make a product is 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.810
 nice 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.140
 but a slight touch to iker romero does not happen anything because these are the 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.059
 ingredients that we need validity and recite today 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:22.909
 there is a gift because we are going for richer murray four people today we prepare 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.139
 hake as was the name I like the sauce to fix it 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:32.329
 green constanza as the parish exactly the cost of 31 with 60 for 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:33.539
