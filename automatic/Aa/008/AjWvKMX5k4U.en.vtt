00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.020 
really natural
um<00:01:53.990> and<00:01:54.990> then<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.590> have<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.829> sad<00:01:56.159> part<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.729> didn't

cuz I don't really wear my hair on that

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.569 
cuz I don't really wear my hair on that
side<00:02:48.519> so<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:53.620> header<00:02:53.890> is<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.160> really<00:02:54.459> really

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
side so this header is a really really

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.960 
side so this header is a really really
really<00:02:54.760> really<00:02:55.060> soft<00:02:55.629> and<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:57.040> hasn't<00:02:57.280> angle

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
really really soft and it hasn't angle

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.330 
really really soft and it hasn't angle
yet<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:58.690> knew<00:02:59.079> it<00:02:59.230> since<00:02:59.470> it<00:02:59.709> said<00:02:59.890> Betty<00:03:00.099> hair

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.890 
yet I knew it since it said Betty hair
so<00:03:00.549> we're<00:03:00.730> going<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.120> tangle<00:03:01.359> that's<00:03:01.660> kind<00:03:01.840> of

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
so we're going to tangle that's kind of

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.599 
so we're going to tangle that's kind of
mad<00:03:02.079> but<00:03:02.920> I<00:03:03.250> paid<00:03:04.239> fine<00:03:04.480> I<00:03:04.629> know<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:04.900> I've<00:03:04.989> had

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
mad but I paid fine I know that I've had

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:11.580 
mad but I paid fine I know that I've had
pretty<00:03:06.609> decent<00:03:07.150> um<00:03:07.650> so<00:03:08.650> about<00:03:08.920> 25<00:03:09.430> dollars<00:03:10.590> -

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
pretty decent um so about 25 dollars -

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.880 
pretty decent um so about 25 dollars -
something<00:03:12.129> that<00:03:12.370> looks<00:03:13.049> super<00:03:14.049> super<00:03:14.560> super

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
something that looks super super super

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.449 
something that looks super super super
natural<00:03:15.370> Suburbia<00:03:16.470> this<00:03:17.470> one<00:03:17.650> looks<00:03:17.859> like<00:03:17.920> in

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
natural Suburbia this one looks like in

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.330 
natural Suburbia this one looks like in
the<00:03:18.640> middle<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.900> for<00:03:19.930> my<00:03:20.590> edges<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:21.040> didn't

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
the middle and for my edges I didn't

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.699 
the middle and for my edges I didn't
really<00:03:21.519> go<00:03:21.669> close<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.329> my<00:03:22.450> edges<00:03:23.019> because<00:03:23.530> of

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
really go close to my edges because of

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.500 
really go close to my edges because of
the<00:03:23.769> fact<00:03:24.099> that<00:03:24.250> I<00:03:24.639> don't<00:03:24.849> want<00:03:25.389> to<00:03:27.389> weaken<00:03:28.389> my

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
the fact that I don't want to weaken my

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.099 
the fact that I don't want to weaken my
edges<00:03:28.919> so<00:03:29.919> if<00:03:30.160> I<00:03:30.310> decide<00:03:30.609> to<00:03:30.669> were<00:03:31.660> just<00:03:31.930> out

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
edges so if I decide to were just out

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.809 
edges so if I decide to were just out
like<00:03:32.349> this<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:32.889> there's<00:03:33.040> one<00:03:33.190> in<00:03:33.340> time<00:03:33.549> so

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
like this and there's one in time so

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.550 
like this and there's one in time so
that<00:03:33.849> when<00:03:34.060> it's<00:03:34.269> gonna<00:03:34.389> be<00:03:34.599> going<00:03:34.930> I<00:03:35.109> will

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
that when it's gonna be going I will

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.520 
that when it's gonna be going I will
just<00:03:35.709> take<00:03:35.859> a<00:03:35.889> small<00:03:36.250> bobby<00:03:36.639> pin<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.359> pin<00:03:38.139> some

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
just take a small bobby pin and pin some

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.830 
just take a small bobby pin and pin some
of<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.709> hair<00:03:38.889> down<00:03:39.130> like<00:03:39.459> that<00:03:39.730> probably<00:03:40.510> from

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
of the hair down like that probably from

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.250 
of the hair down like that probably from
the<00:03:41.019> inside<00:03:41.470> like<00:03:41.709> this<00:03:41.950> so<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.669> wind<00:03:42.880> blows

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
the inside like this so the wind blows

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.930 
the inside like this so the wind blows
you<00:03:44.260> know<00:03:44.290> you're<00:03:44.560> already<00:03:44.769> seeing<00:03:45.250> things<00:03:45.639> so

you know you're already seeing things so

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.039 
you know you're already seeing things so
that's<00:03:46.569> gonna<00:03:46.720> be<00:03:46.810> my<00:03:46.900> alternative<00:03:48.989> show<00:03:49.989> you

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
when this and this and like I said these

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.820 
when this and this and like I said these
are<00:04:11.900> really<00:04:12.080> really<00:04:12.650> long<00:04:13.780> really<00:04:14.780> full<00:04:15.230> this

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
the Bohemia and I probably won't do too

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.370 
the Bohemia and I probably won't do too
much<00:04:22.490> cutting<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.090> back<00:04:23.360> what<00:04:24.260> I'll

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
much cutting to the back what I'll

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.570 
much cutting to the back what I'll
probably<00:04:24.500> do<00:04:24.860> is<00:04:24.890> just<00:04:25.310> um<00:04:26.890> cut<00:04:27.890> the<00:04:28.010> front<00:04:28.250> to

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
probably do is just um cut the front to

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.740 
probably do is just um cut the front to
shape<00:04:29.090> mess<00:04:29.380> my<00:04:30.380> face<00:04:31.030> but<00:04:32.030> yeah<00:04:32.240> it<00:04:32.300> has<00:04:32.480> a<00:04:32.510> lot

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
shape mess my face but yeah it has a lot

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.010 
shape mess my face but yeah it has a lot
of<00:04:32.780> movement<00:04:33.370> it's<00:04:34.370> really<00:04:34.700> thick<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.450> full

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
of movement it's really thick and full

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.280 
of movement it's really thick and full
is<00:04:36.320> not<00:04:36.500> even<00:04:36.740> completely<00:04:37.100> four<00:04:37.430> packs<00:04:38.170> and<00:04:39.170> I

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
is not even completely four packs and I

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.350 
is not even completely four packs and I
believe<00:04:39.860> I<00:04:40.130> didn't<00:04:40.430> use<00:04:40.640> completely<00:04:41.060> four

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
believe I didn't use completely four

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.910 
believe I didn't use completely four
packs<00:04:41.570> because<00:04:41.780> if<00:04:42.140> I<00:04:42.230> break<00:04:42.470> patterns

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
packs because if I break patterns

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.490 
packs because if I break patterns
everything<00:04:43.220> because<00:04:44.150> my<00:04:44.420> Marley<00:04:45.140> crochet

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
everything because my Marley crochet

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.730 
everything because my Marley crochet
braids<00:04:45.770> that<00:04:45.830> I<00:04:45.950> did<00:04:46.160> before<00:04:46.340> I<00:04:47.320> believe<00:04:48.320> more

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
braids that I did before I believe more

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.500 
braids that I did before I believe more
hair<00:04:49.010> getting<00:04:49.220> those<00:04:49.460> packs<00:04:49.730> then<00:04:50.000> in<00:04:50.300> these

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
hair getting those packs then in these

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.010 
hair getting those packs then in these
facts<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:51.290> I<00:04:51.470> used<00:04:51.770> about<00:04:52.070> eight<00:04:52.490> for<00:04:53.120> that<00:04:53.330> so

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
facts and I used about eight for that so

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.920 
facts and I used about eight for that so
I<00:04:54.760> think<00:04:55.760> the<00:04:56.090> way<00:04:56.210> you<00:04:56.270> do<00:04:56.600> your<00:04:56.750> braid

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
I think the way you do your braid

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.570 
I think the way you do your braid
pattern<00:04:57.140> really<00:04:57.320> helps<00:04:57.680> if<00:04:57.800> you<00:04:57.860> do<00:04:57.980> the<00:04:58.160> exact

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
pattern really helps if you do the exact

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.500 
pattern really helps if you do the exact
it<00:04:59.330> helps<00:04:59.750> so<00:04:59.960> when<00:05:00.230> the<00:05:00.320> wind<00:05:00.500> blows<00:05:01.210> it<00:05:02.210> won't

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
it helps so when the wind blows it won't

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.660 
it helps so when the wind blows it won't
your<00:05:03.470> hair<00:05:03.650> won't<00:05:03.860> separate<00:05:04.190> in<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:04.340> back<00:05:04.490> and

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
your hair won't separate in the back and

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:05.800 
your hair won't separate in the back and
people<00:05:04.820> won't<00:05:05.000> be<00:05:05.180> able<00:05:05.300> to<00:05:05.390> see<00:05:05.480> the<00:05:05.540> breeze

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
people won't be able to see the breeze

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.040 
people won't be able to see the breeze
if<00:05:06.020> you<00:05:06.380> understand<00:05:06.770> I'm<00:05:06.860> trying<00:05:07.100> to<00:05:07.160> say<00:05:07.340> so<00:05:07.400> I

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
if you understand I'm trying to say so I

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.420 
if you understand I'm trying to say so I
think<00:05:09.050> that<00:05:09.170> works<00:05:09.320> a<00:05:09.410> little<00:05:09.440> bit<00:05:09.680> better<00:05:09.740> um
