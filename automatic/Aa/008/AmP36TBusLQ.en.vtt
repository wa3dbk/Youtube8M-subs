Channel<00:00:04.950> today<00:00:05.100> we<00:00:05.700> are<00:00:05.940> going<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.210> learn<00:00:06.629> how

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
Channel today we are going to learn how

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.620 
Channel today we are going to learn how
to<00:00:06.990> build<00:00:07.350> this<00:00:07.830> 2x2<00:00:08.700> pop<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.360> store<00:00:11.630> alright

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
to build this 2x2 pop and store alright

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.650 
to build this 2x2 pop and store alright
guys<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.160> door<00:00:14.400> itself<00:00:14.940> as<00:00:15.599> you

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
guys so this is the door itself as you

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.370 
guys so this is the door itself as you
can<00:00:15.929> see<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.320> blocks<00:00:16.590> stick<00:00:17.190> all<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.000> wall

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
can see the blocks stick all of the wall

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.080 
can see the blocks stick all of the wall
which<00:00:19.380> gives<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.830> nice<00:00:20.010> touch<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.340> it

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
which gives a nice touch to it

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.990 
which gives a nice touch to it
we<00:00:21.359> can<00:00:21.539> even<00:00:22.250> disguise<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.519> little<00:00:23.789> better

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
we can even disguise it a little better

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.720 
we can even disguise it a little better
if<00:00:24.090> we<00:00:24.449> add<00:00:24.600> blocks<00:00:24.930> on<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.260> top<00:00:25.439> here<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.189> we

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
if we add blocks on the top here and we

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.970 
if we add blocks on the top here and we
can<00:00:26.910> activate<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.539> with<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.869> liver<00:00:28.080> or<00:00:28.170> with<00:00:28.710> a

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
can activate it with a liver or with a

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.240 
can activate it with a liver or with a
secret<00:00:29.429> input<00:00:30.260> we<00:00:31.260> can<00:00:31.439> even<00:00:31.619> have<00:00:31.859> lamps

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
secret input we can even have lamps

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.069 
secret input we can even have lamps
inside<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.059> all<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.360> shows<00:00:33.719> from<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
inside it and all it shows from the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.250 
inside it and all it shows from the
inside<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.860> are<00:00:35.640> those<00:00:35.880> Pistons<00:00:36.239> here<00:00:36.450> and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
inside is are those Pistons here and

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.900 
inside is are those Pistons here and
this<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.860> how<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.129> looks<00:00:38.370> from<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> opposite

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
this is how it looks from the opposite

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.780 
this is how it looks from the opposite
side<00:00:39.210> if<00:00:40.079> we<00:00:40.320> close<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.739> as<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.399> can<00:00:41.489> see<00:00:41.550> it's

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
side if we close it as you can see it's

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.180 
side if we close it as you can see it's
pretty<00:00:42.059> fast<00:00:42.300> synchronize<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.980> also

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
pretty fast synchronize it and I also

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.040 
pretty fast synchronize it and I also
added<00:00:44.399> those<00:00:44.760> blocks<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.539> door<00:00:45.780> would<00:00:45.960> not

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
added those blocks so the door would not

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.400 
added those blocks so the door would not
look<00:00:46.500> too<00:00:46.860> ugly<00:00:46.980> whole<00:00:47.309> opposite<00:00:47.760> side<00:00:48.410> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
look too ugly whole opposite side the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.770 
look too ugly whole opposite side the
Redstone<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.070> pretty<00:00:50.399> compact<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.570> is

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
Redstone is pretty compact and this is

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.189 
Redstone is pretty compact and this is
it

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
it

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.549 
it
this<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:53.270> extremely<00:00:54.270> compact<00:00:54.989> version<00:00:55.440> of

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
this is a extremely compact version of

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.599 
this is a extremely compact version of
this<00:00:55.770> door<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:57.899> piston<00:00:58.230> layout<00:00:58.500> I'm<00:00:59.250> using

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
this door the piston layout I'm using

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.830 
this door the piston layout I'm using
here<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.320> not<00:01:01.320> originally<00:01:02.039> mine<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.760> saw<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.600> on

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
here is not originally mine I saw it on

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.440 
here is not originally mine I saw it on
a<00:01:03.870> channel<00:01:04.170> called<00:01:04.430> FedEx<00:01:05.430> craft<00:01:05.790> I'll<00:01:06.240> leave

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
a channel called FedEx craft I'll leave

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.090 
a channel called FedEx craft I'll leave
the<00:01:06.630> link<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.200> video<00:01:07.409> description<00:01:07.439> so

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
the link in the video description so

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.750 
the link in the video description so
guys<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:08.790> check<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.090> out<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.659> want<00:01:09.689> and

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
guys can check that out if you want and

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.760 
guys can check that out if you want and
about<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.939> circuit<00:01:12.420> as<00:01:12.930> usual<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:13.740> my

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
about the circuit as usual with my

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.219 
about the circuit as usual with my
science<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:15.470> extremely<00:01:16.470> weird<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:18.229> let's

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
science is extremely weird but let's

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.690 
science is extremely weird but let's
check<00:01:19.470> out<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.130> piston<00:01:20.549> sequences<00:01:22.670> yeah

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
check out the piston sequences yeah

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.570 
check out the piston sequences yeah
those<00:01:24.270> those<00:01:24.720> guys<00:01:24.780> here<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.710> front<00:01:26.009> they

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
those those guys here in the front they

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.990 
those those guys here in the front they
move<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.509> fast<00:01:27.750> maybe<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:29.130> hard<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.670> see<00:01:29.850> what

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
move so fast maybe it's hard to see what

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.940 
move so fast maybe it's hard to see what
they<00:01:30.150> are<00:01:30.180> doing<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:31.619> quite

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
they are doing but it's quite

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.819 
they are doing but it's quite
interesting<00:01:32.630> at<00:01:33.630> first<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:34.079> had<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.320> different

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
interesting at first I had a different

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.399 
interesting at first I had a different
setup<00:01:35.040> here<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.790> use<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.450> repeater<00:01:37.020> here

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
setup here and I use it a repeater here

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.730 
setup here and I use it a repeater here
and<00:01:37.650> what<00:01:38.130> happened<00:01:38.579> was<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:38.990> all<00:01:39.990> those

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
and what happened was that all those

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.910 
and what happened was that all those
double<00:01:41.100> extenders<00:01:41.610> start<00:01:42.509> retracting<00:01:43.229> at<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
double extenders start retracting at the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.100 
double extenders start retracting at the
left<00:01:44.189> poles<00:01:44.579> those<00:01:45.329> guys<00:01:45.570> would<00:01:45.810> catch<00:01:46.079> that

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
left poles those guys would catch that

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.520 
left poles those guys would catch that
last<00:01:46.649> pulse<00:01:46.950> as<00:01:47.189> well<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.579> they<00:01:47.700> would<00:01:47.939> like

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
last pulse as well and they would like

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.370 
last pulse as well and they would like
doing<00:01:49.530> unnecessary<00:01:50.009> movement<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.380> this

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
doing unnecessary movement and this

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.440 
doing unnecessary movement and this
crazy<00:01:52.770> layout<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.159> made<00:01:53.549> here<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:53.970> front<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.329> it

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
crazy layout I made here in front of it

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.080 
crazy layout I made here in front of it
totally<00:01:55.380> fixed<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.189> it's<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.759> course

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
totally fixed it it's of course

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.050 
totally fixed it it's of course
extremely<00:01:57.479> expensive<00:01:57.990> but<00:01:58.979> what<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.579> does<00:01:59.790> is

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
extremely expensive but what it does is

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.260 
extremely expensive but what it does is
when<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.750> powered<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:02.310> does<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.790> which<00:02:03.090> is

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
when it's powered it does this which is

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.200 
when it's powered it does this which is
very<00:02:03.750> easy<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.020> understand<00:02:04.560> but<00:02:05.340> when<00:02:05.790> how<00:02:06.149> we

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
very easy to understand but when how we

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.199 
very easy to understand but when how we
empower<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.930> circuit

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
empower the circuit

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.630 
empower the circuit
those<00:02:08.810> blocks<00:02:09.079> were<00:02:09.289> tracked<00:02:09.619> but<00:02:09.920> this<00:02:10.459> one

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
those blocks were tracked but this one

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.759 
those blocks were tracked but this one
is<00:02:10.879> these<00:02:11.299> those<00:02:11.510> pistols<00:02:11.840> are<00:02:11.989> extended<00:02:12.590> so

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
is these those pistols are extended so

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.130 
is these those pistols are extended so
they<00:02:12.950> are<00:02:13.310> not<00:02:13.489> going<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.849> to<00:02:14.420> be<00:02:14.540> retracted

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
they are not going to to be retracted

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.640 
they are not going to to be retracted
but<00:02:15.290> this<00:02:15.920> redstone<00:02:16.250> block<00:02:16.579> will<00:02:16.819> so<00:02:17.569> there<00:02:18.530> we

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
but this redstone block will so there we

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.330 
but this redstone block will so there we
want<00:02:18.859> power<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.989> later<00:02:20.989> on<00:02:21.260> this<00:02:21.920> redstone

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
want power and later on this redstone

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.479 
want power and later on this redstone
line<00:02:22.700> is<00:02:22.969> going<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.269> get<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:24.049> one<00:02:24.769> take<00:02:25.010> pulses

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
line is going to get to one take pulses

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.160 
line is going to get to one take pulses
so<00:02:26.120> what<00:02:26.359> happens<00:02:26.810> is<00:02:27.609> first<00:02:29.170> it's

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
so what happens is first it's

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.569 
so what happens is first it's
complicated

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
complicated

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.209 
complicated
this<00:02:31.939> guy<00:02:32.659> is<00:02:32.930> grab<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.319> and<00:02:33.500> place<00:02:33.769> it<00:02:33.950> here

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:34.219 
this guy is grab it and place it here

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.629 
this guy is grab it and place it here
and<00:02:34.400> that<00:02:34.849> redstone<00:02:35.269> block<00:02:35.719> is<00:02:36.519> because<00:02:37.519> of

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:37.639 
and that redstone block is because of

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.580 
and that redstone block is because of
the<00:02:37.790> want<00:02:37.969> ik<00:02:38.120> balls<00:02:38.450> it's<00:02:38.659> just<00:02:38.870> build<00:02:39.200> out<00:02:39.349> so

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
the want ik balls it's just build out so

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.159 
the want ik balls it's just build out so
it<00:02:39.920> gets<00:02:40.310> here<00:02:40.639> and<00:02:40.909> when<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.599> second<00:02:41.930> pulse

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:42.169 
it gets here and when the second pulse

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:44.530 
it gets here and when the second pulse
arrives<00:02:42.620> they<00:02:43.129> just<00:02:43.549> will<00:02:43.760> swap<00:02:44.090> positions

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
arrives they just will swap positions

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.319 
arrives they just will swap positions
just<00:02:45.530> like<00:02:45.739> this<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.159> it<00:02:46.370> will<00:02:46.400> stay<00:02:46.939> in<00:02:47.120> place

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
just like this so it will stay in place

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.449 
just like this so it will stay in place
and<00:02:47.359> the<00:02:47.750> redstone<00:02:48.169> block<00:02:48.439> will<00:02:48.680> get<00:02:49.069> out<00:02:49.280> of

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
and the redstone block will get out of

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.330 
and the redstone block will get out of
the<00:02:49.609> way<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:49.760> those<00:02:50.720> guys<00:02:50.959> I<00:02:51.349> don't<00:02:51.500> get<00:02:51.889> budget

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
the way so those guys I don't get budget

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.059 
the way so those guys I don't get budget
or<00:02:52.609> powered<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:53.840> you<00:02:54.139> can<00:02:54.319> try<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.530> see<00:02:54.859> that

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
or powered so you can try to see that

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.819 
or powered so you can try to see that
now<00:02:55.480> but<00:02:56.480> it's<00:02:56.629> it's<00:02:56.900> really<00:02:56.989> too<00:02:57.319> fast

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.920 

yeah<00:03:00.829> Bob<00:03:01.489> now<00:03:01.819> because<00:03:02.150> we<00:03:02.269> had<00:03:02.419> a<00:03:02.450> little<00:03:02.689> bit

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
yeah Bob now because we had a little bit

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.879 
yeah Bob now because we had a little bit
of<00:03:03.079> lag<00:03:03.379> it<00:03:03.590> was<00:03:03.769> possible<00:03:04.219> to<00:03:04.280> see<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:05.889> here

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
of lag it was possible to see and here

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.940 
of lag it was possible to see and here
we<00:03:07.040> don't<00:03:07.219> have<00:03:07.340> much<00:03:08.349> there<00:03:09.349> is<00:03:09.439> almost<00:03:09.709> all

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
we don't have much there is almost all

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.949 
we don't have much there is almost all
redstone<00:03:10.400> for<00:03:10.639> the<00:03:10.790> double<00:03:11.090> extenders<00:03:11.599> and

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
redstone for the double extenders and

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.770 
redstone for the double extenders and
the<00:03:12.139> synchronization<00:03:12.829> with<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.040> top<00:03:13.780> but

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
the synchronization with the top but

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.199 
the synchronization with the top but
this<00:03:14.930> is<00:03:15.049> a<00:03:15.079> really<00:03:15.889> really<00:03:16.069> weird<00:03:16.459> double

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
this is a really really weird double

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.539 
this is a really really weird double
extender<00:03:17.739> as<00:03:18.739> you<00:03:18.859> can<00:03:19.040> see<00:03:19.159> here<00:03:19.370> we<00:03:19.519> just

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
extender as you can see here we just

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.259 
extender as you can see here we just
power<00:03:20.120> these<00:03:21.049> lines<00:03:21.319> here<00:03:21.739> and<00:03:21.889> then<00:03:22.699> we

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
power these lines here and then we

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.509 
power these lines here and then we
replace<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:23.989> solid<00:03:24.379> block<00:03:24.560> here<00:03:24.889> so<00:03:25.069> this<00:03:25.250> will

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
replace a solid block here so this will

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.240 
replace a solid block here so this will
create<00:03:25.939> a<00:03:26.030> torch<00:03:26.510> burn<00:03:26.750> out<00:03:26.959> but<00:03:27.739> once<00:03:28.069> the

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
create a torch burn out but once the

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.849 
create a torch burn out but once the
door<00:03:28.459> is<00:03:28.729> unpowered<00:03:29.419> this<00:03:30.199> piston<00:03:30.590> is<00:03:30.709> not

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
door is unpowered this piston is not

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.129 
door is unpowered this piston is not
here<00:03:31.220> anymore<00:03:31.459> so<00:03:31.639> this<00:03:32.329> is<00:03:32.540> what<00:03:32.750> create

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
here anymore so this is what create

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:38.110 
here anymore so this is what create
those<00:03:33.949> two<00:03:34.959> very<00:03:35.959> quick<00:03:36.400> one<00:03:37.400> tick<00:03:37.639> pulses

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
those two very quick one tick pulses

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.869 
those two very quick one tick pulses
that<00:03:39.109> happened<00:03:39.560> here<00:03:39.769> and<00:03:39.949> by<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:40.579> way<00:03:40.759> this

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
that happened here and by the way this

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.270 
that happened here and by the way this
comparator<00:03:41.479> is<00:03:41.629> extremely<00:03:42.259> necessary<00:03:42.379> if<00:03:43.009> it

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
comparator is extremely necessary if it

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.899 
comparator is extremely necessary if it
was<00:03:43.549> a<00:03:44.139> repeater<00:03:45.159> nothing<00:03:46.159> would<00:03:46.310> work<00:03:46.340> here

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
was a repeater nothing would work here

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.960 
was a repeater nothing would work here
so<00:03:47.900> this<00:03:48.019> is<00:03:48.199> a<00:03:48.500> pretty<00:03:48.859> small<00:03:49.129> circuit<00:03:49.729> but

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
so this is a pretty small circuit but

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.229 
so this is a pretty small circuit but
very<00:03:50.840> interesting<00:03:51.549> everything<00:03:52.549> around<00:03:52.939> here

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
very interesting everything around here

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.390 
very interesting everything around here
is<00:03:53.269> quite<00:03:53.750> interesting<00:03:54.319> it<00:03:54.739> looks<00:03:54.829> like

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
is quite interesting it looks like

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.939 
is quite interesting it looks like
something<00:03:55.939> that's<00:03:56.150> extremely<00:03:56.959> unstable<00:03:57.439> but

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:57.949 
something that's extremely unstable but

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.339 
something that's extremely unstable but
it's<00:03:58.310> not<00:03:58.549> it's<00:03:58.759> quite<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.030> opposite<00:03:59.540> I<00:03:59.689> tried

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
it's not it's quite the opposite I tried

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.460 
it's not it's quite the opposite I tried
it<00:04:00.560> in<00:04:00.859> every<00:04:01.549> direction<00:04:01.849> and<00:04:02.239> also<00:04:02.720> on<00:04:02.930> bucket

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
it in every direction and also on bucket

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.030 
it in every direction and also on bucket
servers<00:04:03.919> recently<00:04:04.879> and<00:04:05.090> it<00:04:05.720> works<00:04:05.989> just<00:04:06.769> works

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
servers recently and it works just works

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.179 
servers recently and it works just works
so<00:04:07.870> if<00:04:08.870> your<00:04:09.049> guys<00:04:09.290> are<00:04:09.319> interested<00:04:10.040> in

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:10.189 
so if your guys are interested in

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.159 
so if your guys are interested in
building<00:04:10.549> this<00:04:10.669> it's<00:04:11.030> quite<00:04:11.299> easy<00:04:11.569> and<00:04:11.870> I'm

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:12.169 
building this it's quite easy and I'm

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:13.509 
building this it's quite easy and I'm
going<00:04:12.349> to<00:04:12.409> do<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.680> total<00:04:13.009> for<00:04:13.159> that<00:04:13.189> right<00:04:13.489> now

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
going to do the total for that right now

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.479 
going to do the total for that right now
alright<00:04:14.269> guys<00:04:14.569> I'm<00:04:14.959> here<00:04:15.259> in<00:04:15.829> my<00:04:15.949> hotbar

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
alright guys I'm here in my hotbar

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.610 
alright guys I'm here in my hotbar
you<00:04:16.639> can<00:04:16.849> see<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.510> correct<00:04:17.840> amount<00:04:18.169> for<00:04:18.380> each

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
you can see the correct amount for each

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.800

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
really weird how I wired this thing so

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.860 
really weird how I wired this thing so
place<00:04:51.699> repeaters<00:04:52.699> here<00:04:53.000> facing<00:04:53.419> this<00:04:53.810> way

going to grab the top part of the door
and<00:05:46.940> our<00:05:47.720> input<00:05:48.380> block<00:05:48.800> is<00:05:48.979> going<00:05:49.159> to<00:05:49.250> be<00:05:49.370> this

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
and our input block is going to be this

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.510 
and our input block is going to be this
one<00:05:50.060> so<00:05:50.470> weight<00:05:51.470> on<00:05:51.770> top<00:05:51.949> of<00:05:52.099> this<00:05:52.280> sick

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
one so weight on top of this sick

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.159 
one so weight on top of this sick
pistons<00:05:52.880> facing<00:05:53.000> upwards<00:05:53.659> you<00:05:53.840> have<00:05:54.139> a

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
pistons facing upwards you have a

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.790 
pistons facing upwards you have a
cauldron<00:05:55.010> filled<00:05:55.280> with<00:05:55.789> water<00:05:56.150> and<00:05:56.780> then<00:05:57.380> here

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
cauldron filled with water and then here

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.640 
cauldron filled with water and then here
just<00:05:57.830> build<00:05:58.610> a<00:05:58.729> line<00:05:59.060> and<00:05:59.419> we<00:05:59.599> will<00:05:59.720> have<00:06:00.020> the

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
just build a line and we will have the

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.850 
just build a line and we will have the
traditional<00:06:01.250> circuit<00:06:01.729> we<00:06:02.000> usually<00:06:02.690> have<00:06:03.380> for

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
traditional circuit we usually have for

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.270 
traditional circuit we usually have for
jab<00:06:04.159> doors<00:06:04.720> though<00:06:05.720> so<00:06:06.080> set<00:06:06.889> those<00:06:07.130> two

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
jab doors though so set those two

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.870 
jab doors though so set those two
repeaters<00:06:07.580> on<00:06:07.849> two<00:06:08.000> ticks<00:06:08.260> so<00:06:09.260> finally<00:06:09.880> here

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
repeaters on two ticks so finally here

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.050 
repeaters on two ticks so finally here
we<00:06:11.120> can<00:06:11.300> place<00:06:11.510> one<00:06:11.960> piece<00:06:12.169> of<00:06:12.320> redstone<00:06:12.560> dust

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
we can place one piece of redstone dust

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.510 
we can place one piece of redstone dust
one<00:06:14.060> piston<00:06:14.780> facing<00:06:14.990> downwards<00:06:15.800> and<00:06:16.130> one

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
one piston facing downwards and one

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.939 
one piston facing downwards and one
solid<00:06:16.760> block<00:06:17.210> on<00:06:17.659> its<00:06:18.169> face

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:18.949 
solid block on its face

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:22.450 
solid block on its face
so<00:06:19.389> let's<00:06:20.389> power<00:06:20.720> our<00:06:20.990> circuit<00:06:21.590> and<00:06:21.860> test<00:06:22.310> it

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
so let's power our circuit and test it

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.390 
so let's power our circuit and test it
out<00:06:23.139> so<00:06:24.139> as<00:06:24.349> you<00:06:24.440> can<00:06:24.560> see<00:06:24.620> what<00:06:24.889> happens<00:06:25.280> is

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
out so as you can see what happens is

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.029 
out so as you can see what happens is
the<00:06:25.909> double<00:06:26.180> extenders<00:06:26.630> place<00:06:27.039> the

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:28.039 
the double extenders place the

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:29.769 
the double extenders place the
bookshelves<00:06:28.490> there<00:06:28.880> and<00:06:29.120> then<00:06:29.360> the<00:06:29.539> top<00:06:29.750> part

00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:29.779 
bookshelves there and then the top part

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:33.399 
bookshelves there and then the top part
of<00:06:30.200> the<00:06:30.320> circuit<00:06:30.710> activates<00:06:31.190> later<00:06:31.479> to<00:06:32.479> push

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:33.409 
of the circuit activates later to push

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:34.190 
of the circuit activates later to push
them<00:06:33.680> forward

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.200 
them forward

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.970 
them forward
and<00:06:35.180> when<00:06:36.180> we<00:06:36.330> empower<00:06:36.840> the<00:06:37.020> circuit<00:06:37.410> because

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:37.980 
and when we empower the circuit because

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.000 
and when we empower the circuit because
we<00:06:38.130> are<00:06:38.220> using<00:06:38.610> pistons<00:06:39.180> here<00:06:39.420> and<00:06:39.630> not

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.010 
we are using pistons here and not

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.570 
we are using pistons here and not
regular<00:06:41.060> redstone<00:06:42.060> signals<00:06:42.480> it<00:06:43.110> will<00:06:43.580> this

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
regular redstone signals it will this

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.970 
regular redstone signals it will this
piston<00:06:44.910> goes<00:06:45.060> down<00:06:45.270> faster<00:06:45.990> then<00:06:46.320> it<00:06:46.470> goes<00:06:46.680> up

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:46.980 
piston goes down faster then it goes up

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.490 
piston goes down faster then it goes up
so<00:06:47.010> those<00:06:47.640> Pistons<00:06:48.030> activate<00:06:48.480> first<00:06:48.780> then<00:06:49.170> the

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
so those Pistons activate first then the

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.860 
so those Pistons activate first then the
double<00:06:49.770> extender<00:06:49.950> we'll<00:06:50.940> be<00:06:51.090> able<00:06:51.180> to<00:06:51.420> do<00:06:51.540> its

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
double extender we'll be able to do its

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.510 
double extender we'll be able to do its
job<00:06:52.230> and<00:06:52.590> then<00:06:53.490> the<00:06:53.670> door<00:06:53.850> is<00:06:54.000> open<00:06:54.360> so<00:06:55.370> let<00:06:56.370> me

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 
job and then the door is open so let me

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.430 
job and then the door is open so let me
put<00:06:56.730> some<00:06:56.940> blocks<00:06:57.150> around<00:06:57.420> it<00:06:57.780> so<00:06:57.960> we<00:06:57.990> can<00:06:58.290> have

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 
put some blocks around it so we can have

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.410 
put some blocks around it so we can have
a<00:06:58.470> better<00:06:58.710> view<00:06:58.800> of<00:06:59.040> that<00:06:59.160> all<00:06:59.910> right<00:06:59.970> as<00:07:00.270> I

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:00.420 
a better view of that all right as I

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.460 
a better view of that all right as I
covered<00:07:00.840> up<00:07:01.020> the<00:07:01.740> build<00:07:01.980> and<00:07:02.450> just<00:07:03.450> a<00:07:04.140> small

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:04.470 
covered up the build and just a small

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.890 
covered up the build and just a small
note<00:07:04.770> here<00:07:05.130> those<00:07:05.370> pistons<00:07:05.880> are<00:07:06.120> optional<00:07:06.750> I

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 
note here those pistons are optional I

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.170 
note here those pistons are optional I
just<00:07:07.230> included<00:07:07.530> them<00:07:08.040> because<00:07:08.520> they<00:07:09.000> make

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 
just included them because they make

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.110 
just included them because they make
everything<00:07:09.570> look<00:07:09.960> nicer<00:07:10.470> so<00:07:11.340> if<00:07:11.670> you<00:07:11.820> want<00:07:12.000> you

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 
everything look nicer so if you want you

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.140 
everything look nicer so if you want you
can<00:07:12.300> close<00:07:12.570> this<00:07:12.720> off<00:07:12.930> or<00:07:13.290> you<00:07:13.440> can<00:07:13.680> just<00:07:14.340> break

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:15.150 
can close this off or you can just break

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.760 
can close this off or you can just break
those<00:07:15.300> pistons<00:07:15.690> and<00:07:15.810> have<00:07:16.020> solid<00:07:16.530> blocks

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:16.770 
those pistons and have solid blocks

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.490 
those pistons and have solid blocks
there<00:07:17.370> or<00:07:17.640> whatever<00:07:18.420> kind<00:07:18.690> of<00:07:18.840> block<00:07:19.140> yard<00:07:19.350> or

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.500 
there or whatever kind of block yard or

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.850 
there or whatever kind of block yard or
uses<00:07:19.950> if<00:07:20.670> you<00:07:20.940> want<00:07:21.210> to<00:07:21.780> have<00:07:21.930> lamps<00:07:22.380> here<00:07:22.560> how

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 
uses if you want to have lamps here how

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.190 
uses if you want to have lamps here how
the<00:07:23.850> way<00:07:23.970> I<00:07:24.000> showed<00:07:24.300> you<00:07:24.330> in<00:07:24.660> the<00:07:24.690> beginning<00:07:24.930> of

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:25.200 
the way I showed you in the beginning of

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.990 
the way I showed you in the beginning of
the<00:07:25.350> video<00:07:25.470> you<00:07:26.010> can<00:07:26.040> just<00:07:26.220> place<00:07:26.580> Labour's

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 
the video you can just place Labour's

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.540 
the video you can just place Labour's
here<00:07:27.360> underneath<00:07:27.780> the<00:07:28.050> floor<00:07:28.290> and<00:07:28.560> flip<00:07:29.370> those

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:29.550 
here underneath the floor and flip those

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.140 
here underneath the floor and flip those
on<00:07:29.910> and<00:07:30.950> then<00:07:31.950> it<00:07:32.100> will<00:07:32.130> not<00:07:32.460> show<00:07:32.700> when<00:07:33.030> the

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:33.150 
on and then it will not show when the

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.880 
on and then it will not show when the
door<00:07:33.330> is<00:07:33.660> in<00:07:33.720> this<00:07:34.050> position<00:07:34.230> unless<00:07:34.680> you

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:34.890 
door is in this position unless you
