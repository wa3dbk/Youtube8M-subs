that<00:04:39.890> the<00:04:40.890> bottom<00:04:41.250> leave<00:04:41.430> this<00:04:41.700> hair<00:04:41.970> i<00:04:42.000> think

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
that the bottom leave this hair i think

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.350 
that the bottom leave this hair i think
is<00:04:42.390> goddess<00:04:42.630> remi<00:04:43.050> in<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.380> top<00:04:43.620> layer<00:04:43.860> it's<00:04:44.360> a

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
is goddess remi in the top layer it's a

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.600 
is goddess remi in the top layer it's a
go<00:04:45.750> and<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.290> reason<00:04:46.470> why<00:04:46.740> i<00:04:46.770> do<00:04:46.890> that<00:04:47.310> did<00:04:47.580> that

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
go and the reason why i do that did that

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.200 
go and the reason why i do that did that
is<00:04:48.060> because<00:04:48.270> i<00:04:48.510> had<00:04:48.870> ego<00:04:49.290> already<00:04:49.620> in<00:04:49.980> and<00:04:50.310> I

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
is because i had ego already in and I

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.150 
is because i had ego already in and I
want<00:04:51.420> it<00:04:51.540> longer<00:04:51.990> and<00:04:52.020> I<00:04:52.320> want<00:04:52.500> to<00:04:52.590> use<00:04:52.740> goddess

want it longer and I want to use goddess

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.950 
want it longer and I want to use goddess

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
as my last layer and sometimes

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.530 
as my last layer and sometimes
underneath<00:04:55.440> is<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:56.370> first<00:04:56.730> place<00:04:57.030> that<00:04:57.060> get

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
underneath is the first place that get

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.750 
underneath is the first place that get
tangled<00:04:58.110> so<00:04:58.950> I<00:05:00.770> put<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:01.919> garbage<00:05:02.130> man<00:05:02.490> me<00:05:02.640> and

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
as I left that up there at the top later

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.690 
as I left that up there at the top later

and actually I didn't cut any more
layers<00:05:12.180> in<00:05:12.540> it<00:05:12.890> because<00:05:13.890> the<00:05:14.400> top<00:05:14.640> with<00:05:14.940> has<00:05:15.180> so
