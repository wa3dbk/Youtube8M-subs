00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:08.440
 although it is very obvious what happens with the 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:12.190
 equipment that does not work I would give it five 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.650
 name and you can give me the tactical vision 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.620
 why because according to this establishment 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:21.600
 he is the one who make it up and the technician 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:26.950
 Falcioni is the normal 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.200
 present so that I am going to give you five 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.630
 names can you tell me what is the level 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.249
 or the rod with which you gave me 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.949
 Catholic university so that these 

00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:39.159
 players are here if the budget 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.019
 that has perfect Catholic and a better 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:42.370
 player 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:47.070
 wander has a fourth budget that 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.070
 has catholic and has different 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.659
 five matches video championships a 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.659
 wander here I see huachipato here 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.210
 but now one could discuss the 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.740
 arrival of falcioni product is what 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.400
 that speaks a little ricardo in this 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:21.640
 identity in this style in this way 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:25.200
 is exactly what you have to 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.200
 discuss is the present and the present 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.590
 sometimes is it says not catholic has 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.110
 to invest two million dollars it 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.110
 he said as if two million were 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.920
 44 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.190
 but a team like catholic can not not 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.890
 let's lose the perspective 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.900
 but let's not lose a perspective 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.130
 did a ricardo who is online 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.130
 we are still calling us 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.229
 the program was 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.650
 and has provoked a discussion always 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.310
 is very healthy I just want to tell you something 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.870
 I consider the reflection of respect 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.550
 in front of the actions task can 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.510
 be very interesting they were very 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.850
 intense 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.670
 then I agree on a couple of things 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.470
 but let's not lose perspective something 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.900
 the perspective do not lose sight 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.170
 which is very real 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.720
 Catholic comes from being if they were going to say 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.159
 another second time but it comes from being 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.159
 runner-up of the previous tournament 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:56.140
 It gives the impression that we end up talking 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.269
 the color i speak of the correct present 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.099
 but I'm in charge of presenting the five 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.319
 parties that has played Catholic I 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.250
 I take care of when I go to see 90 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.250
 minutes and s 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.379
 you have you are making a 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.840
 evaluation of sports management 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.579
 Catholic and it would seem to me not very 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.599
 superficially do an analysis of the 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.760
 five matches 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.970
 you are in analysis of one more job 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.889
 global forgiveness in that global work 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.189
 Catholics if it's not champion has been 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:28.689
 runner-up 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.760
 sorry because we end with the heart 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:34.170
 defending who we are closest to 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.170
 and with whom we are more than growing 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.909
 We will analyze that accusation between them 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.669
 we analyze seriously runs like 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.530
 analyst with eyes of professional what is 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:47.620
 the football performance of catón 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.810
 Today that's what at least I was not me 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.030
 I'm interested in forgiveness to forgive in 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.950
 first place I will not accept nor now 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.920
 never the accusation that you just 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.270
 do it because I do not know it so I do not know 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.650
 I'm defending then how are you 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.110
 defending a function I'm 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.270
 defending because it seems to me because I 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.520
 seems because I think that what has 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.459
 made by jugás and is not as bad as 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.230
 is I do not listen is just for me 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.739
 I get the impression that you're talking 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.930
 the third division 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.799
 everything that will do the position that has 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.130
 professionally developed 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:24.540
 buljubasich is mediocre for a club 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:28.830
 as a Catholic it is mediocre if it is not 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.830
 Catholic and then and then yourself 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.810
 to analyze is mediocre because the 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.210
 campus that I think you have today is 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:44.229
 mediocre correct answers 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:45.760
 emotional catholic and I do not know if good what 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.410
 we have different then because I 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.390
 sat in three parties are Catholic and 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.090
 the performance the emotional response 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.210
 of the campus is mediocre 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.400
 today 12 the technician's response is 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.490
 ignorance ignorance of 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.790
 half evaluating the work of the 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.260
 sports management for five games 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.720
 I ask it because if it's like that from here 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.880
 forwards the analyzes that I'm going 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.699
 to listen and I'll claim you when 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.479
 be when necessary defend 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.479
 then the charge 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.770
 I'm not going to sit down I do not know how long 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.199
 the actions because to 900 fronts 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:29.310
 microphone for nobody's charge and here 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:31.380
 what I defend is that he sought so 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.760
 I have done perfect in these years that has 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.290
 been in charge catholic that 's what 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:39.050
 wants all I want to say is that 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:41.790
 I find it a bit flexible 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.100
 look what I say with words I'm super 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.569
 technical is mediocre the position 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.759
 developed in a large club 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:51.809
 not even for the titles for the 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:55.149
 Catholic essence has been washed out 

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:58.110
 washed out of his dapper football his 

00:05:55.149 --> 00:06:00.249
 Football at the floor has been washed out 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.529
 permanently has been washed and today 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:04.779
 the catholic present what your fans 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:07.179
 it's not the title what the fans are 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:09.459
 they yearn every weekend that they bank 

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:11.289
 advocating is leaving without shame of san 

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:14.669
 carlos de apoquindo come out with shame 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:14.669
 fernando that 

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:24.309
 doing the introduction of what 

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:27.159
 causes this ricardo I'm going to continue 

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:28.959
 I grab you team this is what I wanted 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:30.939
 say and match so we do not lose the 

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:32.789
 perspective was everything I said because 

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:34.599
 It looked like he was analyzing the 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:36.669
 team that had come down to third 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:37.360
 division and catholic comes to be its 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:39.879
 championship 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.800
 the people were again second good is 

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:50.849
 that if you're not a champion you're a failure 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:53.939
 now so that the last word 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:55.050
 and the other thing I said is that I considered 

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:56.909
 that several of the things that you 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.979
 they had said they were accurate but that 

00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:02.639
 everything was as bad as it seemed 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:05.159
 speech they were giving it did not seem 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:07.169
 I do not analyze the previous years because 

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:10.139
 for that we have made all the 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:12.179
 programs and this has been analyzed 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:14.369
 program for me is to analyze the 

00:07:12.179 --> 00:07:17.309
 present of current catholic university 

00:07:14.369 --> 00:07:19.139
 if I enter the role of the manager 

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:21.539
 technical here for my liking I return it to 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:23.159
 repeat in mediocre with resources with 

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:25.499
 the time he had with the bet that 

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:27.679
 did that is the same has many 

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:27.679
 resources
