I<00:00:43.559> believe<00:00:43.890> when<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.160> comes<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.550> training<00:00:44.789> we

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
I believe when it comes to training we

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.299 
I believe when it comes to training we
have<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> very<00:00:45.809> specific<00:00:46.079> dose<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.920> muscles

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
have a very specific dose that muscles

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.880 
have a very specific dose that muscles
can<00:00:47.460> handle<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.450> beyond<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.320> we<00:00:49.559> wind<00:00:49.770> up

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
can handle that beyond that we wind up

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.069 
can handle that beyond that we wind up
overtraining<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.610> causing<00:00:50.940> damage<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.870> ABS

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
overtraining and causing damage the ABS

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.380 
overtraining and causing damage the ABS
because<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.860> their<00:00:53.039> ever<00:00:53.309> constant<00:00:53.940> firing

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
because of their ever constant firing

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.660

throughout<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.020> day<00:00:55.230> these<00:00:55.980> muscles<00:00:56.520> are

ABS can we have a workout where we

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.120 
ABS can we have a workout where we
highly<00:01:33.180> target<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> ABS<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.320> work<00:01:34.740> them<00:01:34.979> on

every single thing we're doing but we're
not<00:01:37.049> even<00:01:37.290> directly<00:01:37.500> training<00:01:38.040> them<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.460> let

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
not even directly training them so let

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.550 
not even directly training them so let
me<00:01:38.759> go<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.000> break<00:01:39.210> down<00:01:39.450> muscle<00:01:40.259> group<00:01:40.409> by

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
me go and break down muscle group by

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.100 
me go and break down muscle group by
muscle<00:01:40.950> group<00:01:41.130> an<00:01:41.340> example<00:01:42.119> exercise<00:01:42.600> that's

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
muscle group an example exercise that's

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.420 
muscle group an example exercise that's
going<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.350> highly<00:01:43.740> integrate<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.250> ABS

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
going to highly integrate the ABS

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.819 
going to highly integrate the ABS
without<00:01:45.180> us<00:01:45.360> feeling<00:01:45.960> as<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:46.350> we're<00:01:46.560> training

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
without us feeling as if we're training

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.649 
without us feeling as if we're training
the<00:01:46.920> ABS<00:01:47.040> directly<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:48.000> add<00:01:48.149> those<00:01:48.360> two

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.840 
I demonstrate this exercise if I have a
dumbbell<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.140> one<00:02:04.320> single<00:02:04.680> hand<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.520> lower

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
dumbbell in one single hand and I lower

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.109 
dumbbell in one single hand and I lower
it<00:02:05.969> down<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.600> side<00:02:06.930> obviously<00:02:07.770> 60<00:02:08.550> 70<00:02:08.940> 80

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
it down to that side obviously 60 70 80

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.910 
that's all pulling in that one
direction<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:12.150> there's<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.390> lot<00:02:12.630> of<00:02:12.810> demand<00:02:13.709> on

side<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.569> dumbbell<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.260> that's<00:02:28.860> going<00:02:29.040> to

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
side of the dumbbell and that's going to

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.920 
side of the dumbbell and that's going to
make<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.459> even<00:02:29.610> harder<00:02:30.000> for<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.600> resist

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
make it even harder for you to resist

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
pull-ups but as you see with this one

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.640 
pull-ups but as you see with this one
slight<00:02:39.120> modification<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.260> exercise<00:02:40.620> that

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
slight modification of the exercise that

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.400 
slight modification of the exercise that
I'm<00:02:40.920> doing<00:02:41.040> here<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.790> knees<00:02:42.030> come<00:02:42.360> up<00:02:42.390> we<00:02:43.140> get

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
I'm doing here the knees come up we get

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.740 
I'm doing here the knees come up we get
a<00:02:43.560> tremendous<00:02:44.340> amount<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.970> core<00:02:45.239> activity

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
a tremendous amount of core activity

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.229 
a tremendous amount of core activity
matter<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.530> fact<00:02:46.769> we<00:02:47.130> stress<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.760> lower<00:02:47.970> abs

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
matter of fact we stress the lower abs

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.970 
matter of fact we stress the lower abs
which<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.600> even<00:02:48.870> better<00:02:49.019> because<00:02:49.530> these<00:02:49.830> are

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
which is even better because these are

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.160 
which is even better because these are
even<00:02:50.250> harder<00:02:50.550> for<00:02:50.580> us<00:02:50.790> guys<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.030> target<00:02:51.630> now

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
even harder for us guys to target now

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.830 
even harder for us guys to target now
how<00:02:52.920> do<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.130> know<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:53.580> because<00:02:54.060> as<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.660> guys

how do I know this because as you guys

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.420 
how do I know this because as you guys
might<00:02:55.080> remember<00:02:55.260> people<00:02:55.830> watching<00:02:56.220> me<00:02:56.310> for
