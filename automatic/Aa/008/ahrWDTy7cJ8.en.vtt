00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.220
 herewith already the fifth 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.690
 I start at monday and join 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.219
 Thursday stop then there's yes 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.030
 small break and a few days later 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.800
 there is the second part of five totally 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.500
 okay so on Monday morning there was 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.660
 wholemeal roll with tomatoes and two 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.699
 There were different spreads once 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.800
 a flat spread the man behind 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.740
 sees and once such a herb 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.599
 aufstrich from green core to noon there was 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.769
 what totally delicious my mum has 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.989
 every time exceeded 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.620
 There was a red beet kish yes 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.079

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.160
 eat and dinner again 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.140
 the same because you can not 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.030
 imagine a whole cake of vegetables 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.579
 cake quasi is then for me alone 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.379
 because somehow nobody in the house with us 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.850
 still want to eat besides me 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.129
 Tuesday morning there was a standard 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.940
 breakfast he is mostly in paisley 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.609
 or oatmeal porridge with banana with 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.329
 caches year with fruit a bit in it 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.949
 or something 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.080
 I think that's the breakfast too 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.330
 Most of all at noon, there was now 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.729
 A big cake from this one 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.350
 quiche because he has to get away the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.960
 the tastes also totally delicious 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.040
 later I was with my cousin 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.979
 we eat rolls of spring all at once 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.080
 Vegetarian and next to it there was one 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.270
 Soup a vegetable soup and I like that 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.610
 totally as I eat for my life like 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.600
 I have Chinese the next day 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.400

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.650
 No, I did not work now have 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.329

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.869
 have grilled with my friend and 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.060
 I actually have a barbecue too 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.979
 always a lot of choices because many 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.810
 Think vegans can use the barbecue 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.970
 do not eat anything but if you look 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.220
 how many salads are there and I could 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.409
 when five of the six salads eat 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.369
 a true sink than pasta salad but 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.340
 the rest of potato salad red cabbage 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.619
 pasta salad a family with arugula 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.479
 green salad and another white 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.340
 coleslaw and there I could eat everything 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.640
 and then have grilled vegetables 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.320
 and even soy stakes or something like that 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.259
 But were not good in any case 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.150
 because I only show you a short time 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.790

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.379

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.340
