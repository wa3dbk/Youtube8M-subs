in the boss encounter now the game

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.339 
in the boss encounter now the game
itself<00:04:30.470> is<00:04:30.710> pretty<00:04:31.039> easy<00:04:31.599> until<00:04:32.599> you<00:04:32.900> get<00:04:33.199> to

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
itself is pretty easy until you get to

the halfway point then the difficulty

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.520 
the halfway point then the difficulty
shifts<00:04:36.080> dramatically<00:04:38.080> definitely<00:04:39.080> one<00:04:39.320> thing

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
shifts dramatically definitely one thing

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.990 
shifts dramatically definitely one thing
that'll<00:04:39.800> turn<00:04:39.979> a<00:04:40.039> lot<00:04:40.190> of<00:04:40.340> people<00:04:40.610> off<00:04:40.759> though

that'll turn a lot of people off though

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.760 
that'll turn a lot of people off though
is<00:04:41.300> definitely<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:41.990> randomly<00:04:42.320> shifting

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
is definitely the randomly shifting

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.210 
is definitely the randomly shifting
difficulty<00:04:43.490> and<00:04:43.699> the<00:04:44.419> odds<00:04:44.690> scarcity<00:04:45.560> of<00:04:45.710> free
