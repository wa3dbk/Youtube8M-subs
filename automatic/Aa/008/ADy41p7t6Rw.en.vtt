was<00:04:07.739> very<00:04:07.980> keen<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.430> see<00:04:08.579> what<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.849> inside<00:04:09.030> of

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
was very keen to see what the inside of

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.479 
was very keen to see what the inside of
the<00:04:09.569> house<00:04:09.750> looked<00:04:10.019> like<00:04:13.099> overall<00:04:14.099> it<00:04:14.250> seemed

the house looked like overall it seemed

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.219 
the house looked like overall it seemed
pretty<00:04:14.700> good<00:04:15.030> everything<00:04:15.450> was<00:04:15.540> intact<00:04:15.780> and

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
pretty good everything was intact and

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.319 
pretty good everything was intact and
there<00:04:16.320> was<00:04:16.440> no<00:04:16.560> sign<00:04:16.799> of<00:04:17.010> fire<00:04:17.250> damage<00:04:17.489> but

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
there was no sign of fire damage but

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.939 
there was no sign of fire damage but
just<00:04:18.630> how<00:04:18.810> hot<00:04:19.079> it<00:04:19.229> got<00:04:19.440> in<00:04:19.560> there<00:04:19.680> I<00:04:19.709> wasn't
