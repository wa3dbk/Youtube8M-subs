00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
inside and then we can build it and here

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.110 
inside and then we can build it and here
are<00:00:54.420> your<00:00:54.899> contents<00:00:55.679> we<00:00:55.829> get<00:00:56.039> wanna<00:00:56.399> sticker

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120

sheet<00:00:57.800> included<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.920> with<00:00:59.159> this<00:00:59.370> so<00:00:59.579> we<00:00:59.730> get

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
sheet included it with this so we get

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.180 
sheet included it with this so we get
one<00:01:00.210> instruction<00:01:00.929> manual<00:01:01.019> which<00:01:01.499> you<00:01:01.679> expect

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
one instruction manual which you expect

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.600 
one instruction manual which you expect
for<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.179> smaller<00:01:03.569> set<00:01:03.899> son<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.769> guess<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.129> total

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
for the smaller set son we guess a total
