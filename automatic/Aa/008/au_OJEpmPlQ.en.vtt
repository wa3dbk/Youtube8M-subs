00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
I've been drinking a lot cough syrup

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.160 
I've been drinking a lot cough syrup
lately<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:29.400> don't<00:01:29.880> understand<00:01:30.360> why

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
lately and I just don't understand why

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.780 
lately and I just don't understand why
it<00:01:31.229> seems<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.829> only<00:01:32.070> flavor<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.579> cough

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
it seems like the only flavor of cough

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.580 
it seems like the only flavor of cough
syrup<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.240> they<00:01:33.390> have<00:01:33.540> out<00:01:33.750> now<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.140> cherry

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
syrup that they have out now is cherry

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.469 
syrup that they have out now is cherry
and<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.430> cherry<00:01:35.759> flavor

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
and that cherry flavor

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.600 
and that cherry flavor
I<00:01:36.509> think<00:01:36.900> they<00:01:37.020> should<00:01:37.079> switch<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.009> asshole

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
I think they should switch it to asshole

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.550 
I think they should switch it to asshole
flavor<00:01:38.939> cuz<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.630> tastes<00:01:39.869> like<00:01:39.960> asshole

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
flavor cuz it tastes like asshole

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.550
