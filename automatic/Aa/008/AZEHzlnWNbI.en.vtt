00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.139 

I<00:00:00.120> ended<00:00:00.780> up<00:00:00.870> by<00:00:01.079> having<00:00:01.350> mine<00:00:01.829> a<00:00:02.190> little<00:00:03.030> bit

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
I ended up by having mine a little bit

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.099 
I ended up by having mine a little bit
lower<00:00:03.780> there<00:00:04.560> in<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.890> middle<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:06.109> because

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
lower there in the middle and because

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.100 
lower there in the middle and because
the<00:00:07.230> building<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.740> now<00:00:07.919> planted<00:00:08.610> on<00:00:08.760> the

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
the building is now planted on the

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.480 
the building is now planted on the
expanse<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.260> think<00:00:10.469> I<00:00:10.559> have<00:00:10.740> some<00:00:10.950> options<00:00:11.099> both

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
expanse I think I have some options both

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.200 
expanse I think I have some options both
ways

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
ways

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.730 
ways
let's<00:00:12.660> just<00:00:12.870> see<00:00:13.049> what<00:00:13.170> we've<00:00:13.290> got<00:00:13.320> here

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
let's just see what we've got here

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.150 
let's just see what we've got here
phille<00:00:14.750> but<00:00:15.750> another<00:00:16.020> reason<00:00:16.470> why<00:00:16.619> it's<00:00:16.920> nice

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
phille but another reason why it's nice

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.950 
phille but another reason why it's nice
to<00:00:17.430> be<00:00:17.580> able<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.910> have<00:00:18.199> that<00:00:19.199> opportunity<00:00:19.260> to

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
to be able to have that opportunity to

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.099 
to be able to have that opportunity to
keep<00:00:21.960> your<00:00:22.140> options<00:00:22.260> open<00:00:22.560> by<00:00:22.890> having<00:00:23.279> enough

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
keep your options open by having enough

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.980 
keep your options open by having enough
paper<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.699> add<00:00:26.939> something<00:00:27.539> even

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
paper so that you can add something even

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.840 
paper so that you can add something even
if<00:00:28.410> not<00:00:28.760> position<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.910> properly<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:31.520> okay<00:00:32.520> so

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
if not position it properly and okay so

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.940 
if not position it properly and okay so
I'm<00:00:33.600> not<00:00:33.840> going<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.050> do<00:00:34.170> much<00:00:34.320> with<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.680> all

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
I'm not going to do much with this all

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.850 
I'm not going to do much with this all
I'm<00:00:35.250> trying<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> do<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.850> show<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.120> now<00:00:36.899> why

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
I'm trying to do is show you now why

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.880 
I'm trying to do is show you now why
would<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.399> use<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> cotton<00:00:39.059> ball<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.840> can<00:00:40.530> use<00:00:40.710> my

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
would I use a cotton ball I can use my

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.619 
would I use a cotton ball I can use my
breath

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
breath

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.900 
breath
that's<00:00:42.629> very<00:00:42.899> acceptable<00:00:43.530> too<00:00:43.800> because<00:00:44.760> this

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
that's very acceptable too because this

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.600 
that's very acceptable too because this
is<00:00:45.030> going<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.239> distribute<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.840> into<00:00:46.110> all<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
is going to distribute it into all the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.810 
is going to distribute it into all the
area<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.899> don't<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.500> be<00:00:49.649> nearly<00:00:50.550> as

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
area so I don't have to be nearly as

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.060 
area so I don't have to be nearly as
careful<00:00:51.300> if<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.079> have<00:00:52.320> some<00:00:52.530> edges<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.949> my

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
careful if I have some edges to my

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.639 
careful if I have some edges to my
clouds<00:00:53.430> they're<00:00:53.640> going<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.820> hold<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.360> fine

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
clouds they're going to hold just fine

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.689 
clouds they're going to hold just fine
let's<00:00:55.649> go<00:00:55.800> ahead<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.100> get<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> little<00:00:56.399> closer

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
let's go ahead and get a little closer

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.700 
let's go ahead and get a little closer
in<00:00:57.059> here<00:00:57.300> yeah<00:00:57.899> thanks<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:59.460> I<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:01.109> do<00:01:01.260> this

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
in here yeah thanks and I can do this

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.319 
in here yeah thanks and I can do this
if<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.070> really<00:01:02.309> want<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.670> get<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.910> texture<00:01:03.210> out

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
if I really want to get the texture out

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.980 
if I really want to get the texture out
of<00:01:03.600> there<00:01:04.070> this<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:06.060> any<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.540> who<00:01:06.750> don't

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
of there this for any of you who don't

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.649 
of there this for any of you who don't
know<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.640> don't<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.000> or<00:01:09.060> Killians<00:01:09.479> and

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
know I don't like to or Killians and

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.200 
know I don't like to or Killians and
things<00:01:09.869> because<00:01:10.350> they<00:01:10.560> burnish<00:01:11.220> down<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
things because they burnish down to the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.100 
things because they burnish down to the
paper<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:13.049> I'm<00:01:13.890> most<00:01:14.250> often<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.119> don't<00:01:15.659> want<00:01:15.900> as

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
paper and I'm most often I don't want as

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.050 
paper and I'm most often I don't want as
smooth<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.970> texture<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.799> going<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.400> be

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
smooth of a texture that is going to be

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.840 
smooth of a texture that is going to be
achieved<00:01:21.450> with<00:01:21.689> with<00:01:24.110> trillions<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:25.549> this<00:01:26.549> in

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
achieved with with trillions but this in

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.050 
achieved with with trillions but this in
this<00:01:27.060> case<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.740> have<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> lot<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.280> contrast<00:01:29.790> and

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
this case I have a lot of contrast and

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.270 
this case I have a lot of contrast and
if<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.750> have<00:01:31.439> listened<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.979> course<00:01:32.100> you

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
if you have listened to of course you

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.890 
if you have listened to of course you
don't<00:01:32.460> have<00:01:32.579> any<00:01:32.759> choice<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.240> talk<00:01:33.600> all<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
don't have any choice I talk all the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.200 
don't have any choice I talk all the
time<00:01:34.110> but<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.299> love<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.900> different<00:01:37.380> textures

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
time but I love the different textures

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.859 
time but I love the different textures
textures<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.420> me<00:01:39.600> are<00:01:39.979> wonderful<00:01:40.979> ways<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.869> you

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
textures to me are wonderful ways of you

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.330 
textures to me are wonderful ways of you
know<00:01:42.899> having<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.409> contrast<00:01:44.189> between

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
know having that contrast between

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.249 
know having that contrast between
textures<00:01:44.970> not<00:01:45.390> only<00:01:45.630> contrast<00:01:46.140> between

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
textures not only contrast between

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.590 
textures not only contrast between
values<00:01:46.860> but<00:01:47.340> contrast<00:01:47.820> between<00:01:47.970> textures

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
values but contrast between textures

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.020 
values but contrast between textures
contrast<00:01:49.170> between<00:01:49.290> clean<00:01:50.130> edges<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.640> value

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
contrast between clean edges to value

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.749 
contrast between clean edges to value
and<00:01:51.270> contours<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.680> know<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.130> all<00:01:53.399> these

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
and contours you know and all these

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.270 
and contours you know and all these
different<00:01:53.939> things<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.750> if<00:01:55.259> I'm<00:01:55.649> doing<00:01:55.979> this

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
different things so if I'm doing this

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.069 
different things so if I'm doing this
I'm<00:01:56.520> certainly<00:01:57.299> not<00:01:57.540> going<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.840> try<00:01:58.049> and

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
I'm certainly not going to try and

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.330 
I'm certainly not going to try and
smooth<00:01:58.469> down<00:01:58.710> my<00:01:58.890> building

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
smooth down my building

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.690 
smooth down my building
I<00:01:59.460> want<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.540> pencil<00:02:01.200> but<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:02.009> know<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.189> be

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
I want the pencil but you know to be

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.770 
I want the pencil but you know to be
more<00:02:03.420> apparent<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:04.140> my<00:02:04.880> weathered<00:02:05.880> boards<00:02:06.450> and

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
more apparent in my weathered boards and

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.870 
more apparent in my weathered boards and
all<00:02:07.079> those<00:02:07.350> things<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.829> are<00:02:07.950> going<00:02:08.099> on

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
all those things that are going on

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.600 
all those things that are going on
in<00:02:08.970> my<00:02:09.330> building<00:02:09.630> it's<00:02:10.350> there's<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.980> coarseness

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
in my building it's there's a coarseness

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.310 
in my building it's there's a coarseness
to<00:02:11.850> it<00:02:12.030> even<00:02:12.540> though<00:02:12.630> I<00:02:12.660> might<00:02:12.960> try<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.200> be

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
to it even though I might try to be

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.860 
to it even though I might try to be
quite<00:02:13.620> exact<00:02:14.280> but<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.060> can<00:02:15.240> see<00:02:15.480> how<00:02:15.720> I'm

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
quite exact but you can see how I'm

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.540 
quite exact but you can see how I'm
going<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.110> have<00:02:16.320> a<00:02:16.350> chance<00:02:16.710> to<00:02:16.890> have<00:02:17.040> a

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
going to have a chance to have a

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.050 
going to have a chance to have a
believable<00:02:18.420> sky<00:02:18.870> texture<00:02:19.830> it's<00:02:20.220> going<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.460> set

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
believable sky texture it's going to set

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.770 
believable sky texture it's going to set
it<00:02:21.180> apart<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.810> help<00:02:22.500> me<00:02:22.650> show<00:02:23.010> that<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:24.690> know

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
it apart and help me show that you know

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.310 
it apart and help me show that you know
even<00:02:25.200> though<00:02:25.410> there<00:02:25.740> may<00:02:26.160> be<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.960> value<00:02:27.960> that<00:02:28.260> is

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
even though there may be a value that is

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.770 
even though there may be a value that is
even<00:02:29.070> similar<00:02:29.460> I<00:02:29.700> still<00:02:30.660> have<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.900> chance<00:02:30.990> to

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
even similar I still have a chance to

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.000 
even similar I still have a chance to
separate<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.900> because<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.830> two

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
separate it because of the two

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.540 
separate it because of the two
differences<00:02:35.550> in<00:02:35.700> texture<00:02:36.800> so<00:02:37.800> here<00:02:38.040> we<00:02:38.190> go<00:02:40.550> hey

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
differences in texture so here we go hey

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.570 
differences in texture so here we go hey
I<00:02:41.580> hope<00:02:41.820> you<00:02:42.000> enjoyed<00:02:42.330> that<00:02:42.540> video<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:43.340> if<00:02:44.340> you
