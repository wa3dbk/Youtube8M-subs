gauge string on the now than what you'd

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.490

sets<00:02:57.770> of<00:02:57.920> great<00:02:58.100> drones<00:03:11.590> now<00:03:12.590> I<00:03:12.620> find<00:03:12.950> that<00:03:13.090> my

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
sets of great drones now I find that my

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.240 
sets of great drones now I find that my
plan<00:03:14.360> sort<00:03:14.540> means<00:03:14.780> more<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.680> bluesy<00:03:16.040> side

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
plan sort means more to the bluesy side

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.010 
plan sort means more to the bluesy side
of<00:03:16.370> things<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:17.090> this<00:03:17.300> in<00:03:17.420> turn<00:03:17.450> is<00:03:17.660> perfect

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
of things and this in turn is perfect

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.090 
of things and this in turn is perfect
for<00:03:18.140> that<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.650> I<00:03:18.709> think<00:03:18.770> that's<00:03:18.980> the

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
for that and I think that's the

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.740 
for that and I think that's the
combination<00:03:19.550> in<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:19.700> shape<00:03:19.940> and<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.540> middle

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750
