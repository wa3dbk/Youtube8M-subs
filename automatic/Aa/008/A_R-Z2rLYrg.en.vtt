00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.450
 For me, the requirements have 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.700
 a trainer job in recent years 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:21.320
 actually very much changed that 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:24.890
 are good management is on everyone 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.990
 the very first because I already have a lot 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.180
 I saw the tactically excellent 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.289
 but the most important thing is I think 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.220
 to deal with the people 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.570
 the hold together and a good one 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.930
 to bring humor into the team 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.549
 anyway you have a performance or 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.140
 demand performance 

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:44.299
 from this team I think that is 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.470
 the most important one team 

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:50.019
 lead a team in one 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.190
 team a top character prevails 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.140
 because only then can I also achievements 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.869
 call if you only times the 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.670
 french national team in 

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:59.780
 Southern France has seen at the 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.250
 world championship in the preliminary round 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.989
 but have just retired 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.000
 had the best individual players 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.960
 So I think that was no luck 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.130
 that was because of something she did 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.050
 not why they failed there 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.480
 are already in the first round with the 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.440
 I think that the classic 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.490
 actually do not stretch that way 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.830
 could be bad 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.970
 so bad about this team 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.620
 i believe that am 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.420
 character of the team lay and that 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.200
 is the first thing you have to have around 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.850
 to succeed 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.850
 after that comes tactics and technology 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.460
 Of course, the physical anticipate 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.510
 while the preparation is over 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.540
 how do you see every timetable? 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.220
 next game from which makes analyzes 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.620
 you there how do you prepare the team 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.690
 on the other hand there are tactical websites 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.580
 All of which makes your video analysis 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.260
 what are the training focuses on 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.370
 next game 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.650
 yes, of course, if the preparation 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.979
 is over or we have one, of course 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.140
 I'm committed to a game analyst 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.090
 for a good monitor club duty is 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.190
 that he is always there that we too 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.110
 Sustainable are we what 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.850
 document video training 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.740
 that we also have statistics from anna 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.970
 add teams with us 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.019
 look where they no longer respond to the 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.640
 Team that we the players 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.810
 individually with what to hand 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.370
 from the opponent 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.260
 Of course that's very important 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.510
 Of course we prepare ourselves with video 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.250
 if the player is visualizing and 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.980
 of course you can see more with it 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.560
 start in the field then what do you do 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.300
 of course also video and that is for us 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.410
 very very important a bit glad that 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.420
 We have to commit this man 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.360
 because that is really a top man 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.610
 is so general timetable so that the 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.470
 of course first of all tell that 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.160
 generation then how is the intensity 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.040
 increased 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.660
 to the game in which on sunday starts 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.950
 for the sundays for those who played 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.840
 of course have regeneration day 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.790
 regeneration day the others have to 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.930
 then load is mostly motor 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.989
 however, start me twice 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.730
 training with power and running on 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.350
 In the afternoon we go tactical things 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.150
 again on tactical things one of 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.340
 Last game will do video analysis 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.959
 on the Tuesday before the training and 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.760
 look what can we do there later then 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.860
 We will then implement on Wednesday 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.269
 Thursday already with videos to prepare 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.190
 on the new against also with tactical 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.450
 things and on friday a few more 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.709
 make standards and then it works 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.989
 saturday again a game like already 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.570
 choice what has to happen that you then 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.850
 You can not say that better 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.030
 was a perfect game from us is 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.900
 So difficult really some also 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.840
 not seen yet 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.850
 great maybe once from 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.010
 Barcelona or something will be difficult 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.890
 be that we play a perfect game 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.620
 bring 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.150
 but there is always something 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.890
 improve going you can not 90 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.230
 Playing minutes perfectly you always see 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.880
 situations we say we want there 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.250
 that even better , it looked wrong 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.590
 I have been going wrong since 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.670
 I want to blackmail because I want there 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.000
 the goalie may have to go there 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.200
 play or 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.160
 there is always something that 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.600
 standard situation , we need better 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.830
 There is no perfect game 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.530
 what must happen to a player like that 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.780
 really problems with her gets so 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.120
 really problems if he is not a team work 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.450
 shows if he is very selfish though 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.980
 He does not discipline a hero in 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.930
 tactical aspect is therefore no 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.640
 lose a game and so on 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.220
 most important is that a player everything 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.900
 there and that he is there for the other one 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.250
 and that the player thinks what can I do 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.810
 do for the team and not what 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.760
 no team for me if that 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.169
 player keeps thinking so then he has 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.340
 with us no chance we accepted 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.680
 put them back together in a year 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.820
 what has to happen that you say I 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.330
 I have a really good job here 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.000
 made 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.820
 yes I hope that until 23 years here 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.080
 here that you go then something 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.220
 bring in the sustainable because it is 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.450
 maybe in two or three years' time 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.000
 one or the other out with the first 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.160
 youth work where then young players 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.380
 Two barbarians are developing them now as well 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.669
 not different and come again and again 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.590
 young players out and there we have to 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.000
 work on it is so receives two 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.470
 three years I need that one says there 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.430
 I'm there when I'm three years here 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.650
 I did a good job 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.130
 then i can say i have got it right 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.620
 good job 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:03.050
 or would I say so that's mine 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.000
 The goal is to build something together here 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.340
 Next year as we said 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.290
 reach an international place there 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.669
 and that means among the first four for 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.590
 I think I have one too 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.940
 done a good job and I 'm stuck 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.510
 convinced if we have six players left 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:21.020
 shopping the category are from 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.430
 what do I know then then of course the 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.410
 be higher but we will 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.490
 probably not coming anymore but 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.840
 I think 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.000
 salzburg and rapid are just that 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.100
 the crews are still right at the moment 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.560
 really strong it again the now 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.700
 salzburg invests work anyway 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.610
 not even if she's two three 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.320
 play player as weak will be there 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.300
 a lot has grown there everything is there 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.930
 from the training center 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.300
 training conditions 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.730
 I do not think it's great 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.960
 gets worse and that 's why they are 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.510
 both are still pushing the last two 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.190
 years simply gained too much distance 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.020
 to us but after that we can do everything 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.800
 to reach 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.200
 especially interested in putting that 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.550
 intro repeatedly spoken of the 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.120
 promoting young talent and offspring 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.250
 install 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.900
 how difficult is this balancing act of 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.370
 on the one hand young player on one 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.930
 Amateur team pull up one hand 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.660
 but to have this pressure to succeed the 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.770
 In this case just there is that 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.120
 It's hard to do that now 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.530
 takes a bit because the 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.510
 training he needs to be that one 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.880
 same philosophy has that top 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.560
 The trainer there had the same training 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.430
 the people the winner mentality too and 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.960
 already bring in 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.970
 that may take a little bit that's it 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.230
 not certainly difficult but us 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.060
 Only young players can install if 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.520
 we succeed because here you can 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.820
 not 67 very young players or eight 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.560
 Just bring in Vienna because we are out 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.610
 forbid because we are under pressure 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.410
 must also in the European 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.660
 competition we have a top 4 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.340
 we want to see performance and that 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.960
 not only with young players we go 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.370
 if we have to succeed 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.710
 from time to time to install the 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.320
 Slowly club grows like that when we get together 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.410
 could integrate one each year 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.370
 that would be very good 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.170
 only we had to look the same 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.190
 I get quality works now 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.630
 with boys and then we will be back 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.550
 seventh that's not you already have 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.660
 to be able to survey about 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.040
 the club which players from the 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.630
 offspring may be 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.280
 could become interesting in the future 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.750
 All in all, we have a boy
