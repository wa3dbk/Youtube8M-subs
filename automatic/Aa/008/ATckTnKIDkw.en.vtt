00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.030 

we'll<00:00:57.760> give<00:00:57.910> it<00:00:57.940> a<00:00:58.060> quick<00:00:58.210> check<00:00:58.650> and<00:00:59.650> we<00:00:59.830> are

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
we'll give it a quick check and we are

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.860 
we'll give it a quick check and we are
not<00:01:00.250> quite<00:01:00.490> there<00:01:00.820> yet<00:01:00.850> just<00:01:01.360> a<00:01:01.450> little<00:01:01.660> bit

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870

longer

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.240 

and<00:01:08.750> these<00:01:08.930> are<00:01:08.990> looking<00:01:09.500> more<00:01:09.680> like<00:01:09.890> soft

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
and these are looking more like soft

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.040 
and these are looking more like soft
peaks<00:01:10.580> so<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:10.940> can<00:01:11.090> see<00:01:11.270> when<00:01:11.450> you<00:01:11.480> lift<00:01:11.780> it<00:01:11.930> up

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
peaks so you can see when you lift it up

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.500 
peaks so you can see when you lift it up
you<00:01:12.350> have<00:01:12.500> a<00:01:12.530> little<00:01:12.740> soft<00:01:13.100> peak<00:01:13.520> form<00:01:13.940> with

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
you have a little soft peak form with

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.390 
you have a little soft peak form with
the<00:01:14.660> egg<00:01:14.780> whites<00:01:15.020> so<00:01:15.890> now<00:01:16.040> what<00:01:16.190> we're<00:01:16.310> gonna

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
the egg whites so now what we're gonna

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.880 
the egg whites so now what we're gonna
do<00:01:16.700> is<00:01:16.970> take<00:01:17.060> this<00:01:17.600> sugar<00:01:18.050> gelatin<00:01:18.290> mixture

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
do is take this sugar gelatin mixture

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.430 
do is take this sugar gelatin mixture
and<00:01:19.460> we're<00:01:19.640> gonna<00:01:19.760> add<00:01:19.940> 1<00:01:20.300> tablespoon<00:01:21.110> at<00:01:21.410> a

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
and we're gonna add 1 tablespoon at a

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.170 
and we're gonna add 1 tablespoon at a
time<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:22.100> our<00:01:22.190> egg<00:01:22.340> white<00:01:22.550> mixture<00:01:22.580> until

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
time to our egg white mixture until

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.240 
time to our egg white mixture until
stiff<00:01:23.930> peaks<00:01:23.990> form<00:01:24.440> so<00:01:24.800> you<00:01:24.860> can<00:01:24.980> see<00:01:25.130> the

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
stiff peaks form so you can see the

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.830 
stiff peaks form so you can see the
difference<00:01:25.550> between<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.940> soft<00:01:26.210> peak<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:26.720> a

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
difference between a soft peak and a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.140 
difference between a soft peak and a
stiff<00:01:27.229> peaks<00:01:27.500> I'll<00:01:27.740> show<00:01:27.950> you<00:01:28.010> so<00:01:28.820> we'll<00:01:28.940> just

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
stiff peaks I'll show you so we'll just

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.130 
stiff peaks I'll show you so we'll just
get<00:01:29.300> one<00:01:29.570> tablespoon<00:01:30.280> put<00:01:31.280> that<00:01:31.400> right<00:01:31.700> in

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
get one tablespoon put that right in

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:43.139 
get one tablespoon put that right in
I'll<00:01:33.140> get<00:01:33.290> that<00:01:33.500> mixer<00:01:33.860> going

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.240 

so<00:01:44.149> these<00:01:44.299> Peaks<00:01:44.750> look<00:01:45.049> nice<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:45.619> stiff<00:01:45.950> so

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
so these Peaks look nice and stiff so

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.700 
so these Peaks look nice and stiff so
we're<00:01:46.399> ready<00:01:46.549> for<00:01:46.880> our<00:01:46.939> next<00:01:47.210> step<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:48.409> i<00:01:48.439> have
