00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.130
 Hello 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.440
 today the moment health will talk about a 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.080
 disease that has been scaring more and more 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.360
 Brazilians are lung cancer. 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.059
 main villain we already know is the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.770
 cigarette use at the moment health 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.140
 You will know a technique that comes 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.750
 revolutionizing surgery for removal 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.869
 of this disease a moment in health begins 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.869
 now 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.190
 lung cancer is a very 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.800
 serious health problem is a public health 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.700
 one of the diseases of the neoplasms that most 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.379
 leads to the most lethal death in the world. 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.200
 main risk factor for cancer 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.960
 of smoking is the smoking 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.719
 is the cigarette is the main risk factor 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.360
 not only the cigarette but other substances 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.239
 also produced by combustion 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.829
 combustion vapors of certain 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.379
 are risk factors for breast cancer. 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.190
 but the main one is the act of 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.769
 smoke 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.330
 about 80-90 percent of people 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.460
 who have lung cancer 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.590
 there is an association with the habit of 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.970
 smoking the treatment of lung cancer is 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.760
 multidisciplinary 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.840
 What is this involves since the surgeon 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.360
 thoracic surgery than for surgical 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.549
 oncologists who seek treatment 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.650
 clinical chemotherapy the radio 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.570
 therapists who are the experts in 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.290
 oncological treatment that makes the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.299
 radiation treatment and doctors 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.020
 radiologists who are also 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.189
 involved in the issue of diagnosis 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.020
 making the diagnosis through 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.640
 methods of image examination as 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.259
 multidisciplinary treatment 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.630
 the lung cancer surgery has undergone a 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.740
 big breakthrough in the last 20 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.180
 years 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.610
 surgery is a major surgery 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.110
 always performed the surgery of 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.829
 through the whole economy. 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.840
 to large cuts in the chest with the use of 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.939
 rib retractors to extend the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.070
 surgical field and allows the 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.600
 surgeon to enter for surgery 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.100
 in the last 20 years there has been a 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.719
 advance 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.360
 minimally invasive techniques 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.670
 guided by video cameras with small 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.760
 decisions and nowadays the 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.650
 recommended gold standard is 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.500
 minimally invasive to the stadiums 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.080
 initials people instead of using 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.200
 big decisions people use 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.870
 incisions of four to five centimeters and 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.180
 an accessory incision that is guided by the 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.990
 a micro camera that allows us to view 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.810
 chest and we do not look at the 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.090
 the surgical field into the patient 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.890
 we always look at the screens of 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.959
 monitors because the incision is very 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.550
 small does not allow us not to 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.730
 we can look through it and not 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.140
 our hand does not pass through the incision 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.280
 only the special instruments for 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.690
 do the surgery 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.489
 what are the advantages of this 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.860
 minimally invasive surgery procedure 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.110
 Invasive Behind Recovery Much More 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.910
 for the patient 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.770
 in addition to reducing the risks of 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.680
 bleeding patient during surgery 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.900
 loses less blood recovery in 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.270
 postoperative period is usually much more 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.650
 the patient submitted to the 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.570
 surgery for cancer treatment 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.400
 The cure for lung cancer stays in 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.870
 average three days interned 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.390
 while the patients who make the 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.120
 conventional surgery are located around 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.920
 5 to 6 days hospitalized or almost 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.980
 half the hospital stay 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.500
 postoperative pain is much lower 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.690
 with minimally invasive surgery when 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.430
 compared with conventional surgery 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.870
 the surgery that we say surgery 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.000
 conventional open 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.820
 when we observe the comparative with 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.340
 conventional surgery and if on the 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.799
 left is an open patient 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.420
 mia a minimally invasive surgery 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.090
 for lung cancer 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.549
 on the right side the patient submitted to 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.440
 conventional surgery nor is it 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.580
 the two decisions and see the size of the 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.130
 surgical aggression 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.510
 the difference is the aesthetic result 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.239
 much higher 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.760
 This is an 83-year-old patient who was 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.070
 operated and left in the fifth day after 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.260
 very well 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.900
 a younger patient who had to 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.670
 stay seven and ten days hospitalized for 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.120
 account of a surgery is really very 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.120
 bigger 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.419
 And that was your moment of health today. 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.730
 we returned in an upcoming edition with more 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.730
 a tip for you to live well
