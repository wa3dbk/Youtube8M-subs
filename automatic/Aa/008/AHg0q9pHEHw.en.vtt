in<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.790> dark<00:02:17.080> don't<00:02:18.080> know<00:02:18.260> about<00:02:18.350> that<00:02:18.620> and

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
in the dark don't know about that and

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.440 
in the dark don't know about that and
the<00:02:21.040> visor<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.490> want<00:02:22.820> to<00:02:22.880> call<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.240> visor

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
the visor I want to call it the visor

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.210 
the visor I want to call it the visor
but<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:23.840> know<00:02:23.900> there's<00:02:24.200> like<00:02:24.350> a<00:02:24.380> better<00:02:24.950> name

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
but I know there's like a better name

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.490 
but I know there's like a better name
for<00:02:25.250> it<00:02:25.580> but<00:02:26.240> it<00:02:26.330> articulates<00:02:26.750> at<00:02:27.080> that<00:02:27.230> one

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
for it but it articulates at that one

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.250 
for it but it articulates at that one
joint<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.370> opens<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.209> we<00:02:29.840> will<00:02:30.020> see

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
joint and it opens and we will see

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.750 
joint and it opens and we will see
whether<00:02:30.530> that<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:31.070> of<00:02:31.250> any<00:02:31.430> use<00:02:31.880> of<00:02:31.910> later<00:02:32.330> on

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
whether that is of any use of later on

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.949 
whether that is of any use of later on
alright<00:02:34.760> now<00:02:35.060> we<00:02:35.120> have<00:02:35.270> come<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.720> mean<00:02:35.870> of

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
alright now we have come to the mean of

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.560 
alright now we have come to the mean of
this<00:02:36.080> review<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.650> articulation<00:02:37.580> starting

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
this review the articulation starting

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.930 
this review the articulation starting
with<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.870> head<00:02:39.190> Sonic's<00:02:40.190> head<00:02:40.370> articulates

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
with the head Sonic's head articulates

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.650 
with the head Sonic's head articulates
like<00:02:41.120> any<00:02:41.330> old<00:02:41.570> Jazwares<00:02:42.020> figure<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:43.660> this

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
like any old Jazwares figure and this

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.240 
like any old Jazwares figure and this
time<00:02:44.959> around<00:02:45.170> they've<00:02:45.530> actually<00:02:45.739> used<00:02:45.980> some

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
time around they've actually used some

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.330 
time around they've actually used some
kind<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.670> ratcheting<00:02:47.570> joints<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.770> structure

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
kind of ratcheting joints the structure

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.940 
kind of ratcheting joints the structure
is<00:02:49.459> similar<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:50.300> I<00:02:50.690> don't<00:02:51.230> know<00:02:51.470> if<00:02:51.530> anyone's

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
is similar to I don't know if anyone's

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.010 
is similar to I don't know if anyone's
seen<00:02:52.550> these<00:02:52.850> or<00:02:53.150> if<00:02:53.209> any<00:02:53.360> of<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.540> viewers<00:02:53.720> have

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
seen these or if any of the viewers have

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.610 
seen these or if any of the viewers have
known<00:02:54.470> about<00:02:54.709> these<00:02:54.920> but<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.220> Nendoroids<00:02:55.820> and

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
known about these but the Nendoroids and

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.490 
known about these but the Nendoroids and
it<00:02:57.620> retains<00:02:58.010> most<00:02:58.400> standard<00:02:58.970> Jazwares

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
it retains most standard Jazwares

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.220 
it retains most standard Jazwares
articulation<00:03:00.700> having<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:02.090> elbow<00:03:03.050> and

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
articulation having the elbow and

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.520 
articulation having the elbow and
shoulder<00:03:03.290> joints<00:03:03.650> be<00:03:04.160> very<00:03:04.430> similar<00:03:05.530> so

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
shoulder joints be very similar so

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.920 
shoulder joints be very similar so
basically<00:03:06.890> all<00:03:07.010> these<00:03:07.519> joints<00:03:08.150> are<00:03:08.239> ratcheted

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
basically all these joints are ratcheted

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.780 
basically all these joints are ratcheted
so<00:03:09.110> they<00:03:09.260> stay<00:03:09.500> put<00:03:09.769> which<00:03:10.070> is<00:03:10.220> good<00:03:10.459> for<00:03:10.670> the

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
so they stay put which is good for the

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.390 
so they stay put which is good for the
sword<00:03:11.150> holding<00:03:11.600> arm<00:03:11.810> at<00:03:11.959> least<00:03:12.200> but<00:03:13.010> it<00:03:13.130> does

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
sword holding arm at least but it does

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.580 
sword holding arm at least but it does
limit<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.910> range<00:03:14.330> of<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.690> pose<00:03:14.870> ability<00:03:15.410> I

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
limit the range of the pose ability I

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.650 
limit the range of the pose ability I
mean<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.340> pose<00:03:16.519> ability<00:03:16.880> is<00:03:16.940> already<00:03:17.209> low<00:03:17.450> due

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
mean the pose ability is already low due

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.110 
mean the pose ability is already low due
to<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.840> armor<00:03:18.320> and<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:19.430> don't<00:03:19.610> know<00:03:19.700> why<00:03:19.910> I'm

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
to the armor and I don't know why I'm

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.400 
to the armor and I don't know why I'm
not<00:03:20.360> naming<00:03:20.690> all<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:20.989> points<00:03:21.320> of

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
not naming all the points of

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.259 
not naming all the points of
articulation<00:03:21.530> like<00:03:22.310> any<00:03:22.519> standard<00:03:22.790> review

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
articulation like any standard review

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.729 
articulation like any standard review
assured<00:03:23.660> but<00:03:23.959> who<00:03:24.290> cares<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:26.290> then<00:03:27.290> there's<00:03:27.680> a

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
assured but who cares and then there's a

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.480 
assured but who cares and then there's a
disome<00:03:28.640> there's<00:03:29.090> some<00:03:29.299> ankle<00:03:29.840> action

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.460 

but<00:03:34.090> wait<00:03:34.330> before<00:03:34.480> we<00:03:34.780> move<00:03:34.960> on<00:03:35.170> there<00:03:35.440> are

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
but wait before we move on there are

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.590 
but wait before we move on there are
some<00:03:35.620> notes<00:03:35.860> I<00:03:36.070> have<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.430> include<00:03:39.330> most<00:03:40.330> of<00:03:40.510> the

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
some notes I have to include most of the

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.660 
some notes I have to include most of the
limbs<00:03:40.870> on<00:03:41.110> this<00:03:41.290> figure<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.890> avoid<00:03:42.190> breaking

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
limbs on this figure to avoid breaking

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.410 
limbs on this figure to avoid breaking
them<00:03:43.180> are<00:03:43.740> actually<00:03:44.740> removable<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.580> wrist<00:03:46.240> is

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
them are actually removable the wrist is

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.420 
them are actually removable the wrist is
removable<00:03:46.990> and<00:03:47.140> there's<00:03:47.320> a<00:03:47.410> peg<00:03:47.680> and<00:03:47.980> it<00:03:48.070> goes

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
removable and there's a peg and it goes

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.360 
removable and there's a peg and it goes
back<00:03:48.700> on<00:03:48.940> this<00:03:49.840> is<00:03:50.020> like<00:03:50.200> some<00:03:50.530> figure<00:03:51.100> arts

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
back on this is like some figure arts

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.070 
back on this is like some figure arts
tamashii<00:03:51.760> level<00:03:52.210> kind<00:03:52.360> of<00:03:52.570> thing<00:03:52.750> but<00:03:52.930> it

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
tamashii level kind of thing but it

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.600 
tamashii level kind of thing but it
shows<00:03:53.290> Jazwares<00:03:53.800> is<00:03:54.010> learning<00:03:54.340> that<00:03:54.460> their

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
shows Jazwares is learning that their

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.630 
shows Jazwares is learning that their
figures<00:03:54.910> do<00:03:55.150> break<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:55.750> they<00:03:56.440> are<00:03:56.650> finding

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
figures do break and they are finding

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.580 
figures do break and they are finding
ways<00:03:57.880> around<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:58.480> which<00:03:59.020> is<00:03:59.200> pretty

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
ways around it which is pretty

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.890 
ways around it which is pretty
interesting<00:04:00.130> if<00:04:00.490> you<00:04:00.580> ask<00:04:00.760> me<00:04:01.030> and<00:04:01.210> I<00:04:01.690> think

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
interesting if you ask me and I think

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.810 
interesting if you ask me and I think
it's<00:04:02.050> an<00:04:02.170> achievement<00:04:02.290> on<00:04:02.800> their<00:04:02.950> part<00:04:03.250> I<00:04:03.430> mean

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
it's an achievement on their part I mean

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.720 
it's an achievement on their part I mean
it<00:04:04.230> does<00:04:05.230> take<00:04:05.410> a<00:04:05.440> hell<00:04:05.800> of<00:04:05.830> a<00:04:06.100> lot<00:04:06.280> of<00:04:06.310> pressure

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
it does take a hell of a lot of pressure

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.450 
it does take a hell of a lot of pressure
to<00:04:07.000> get<00:04:07.180> some<00:04:07.960> of<00:04:08.080> the<00:04:08.170> joints<00:04:08.500> back<00:04:08.650> in<00:04:08.920> but

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
to get some of the joints back in but

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.640 
to get some of the joints back in but
most<00:04:09.730> if<00:04:09.910> not<00:04:09.940> all<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.540> limbs<00:04:10.780> on<00:04:11.020> this<00:04:11.260> figure

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
most if not all the limbs on this figure

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.100 
most if not all the limbs on this figure
are<00:04:11.860> removable<00:04:12.580> that<00:04:13.150> does<00:04:13.420> include<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.930> head

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
are removable that does include the head

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.220 
are removable that does include the head
and<00:04:14.320> that<00:04:14.770> leads<00:04:15.010> me<00:04:15.160> to<00:04:15.190> another<00:04:15.310> thing<00:04:16.230> at

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
and that leads me to another thing at

fitted<00:06:24.520> better<00:06:24.729> but<00:06:25.090> hey<00:06:27.000> now<00:06:28.000> we<00:06:28.060> can<00:06:28.479> compare

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
fitted better but hey now we can compare

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.810 
fitted better but hey now we can compare
some<00:06:29.140> previous<00:06:29.650> five<00:06:29.890> inch<00:06:30.130> figures<00:06:30.520> we've

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820 
some previous five inch figures we've

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.770 
some previous five inch figures we've
got<00:06:31.090> the<00:06:31.470> the<00:06:32.610> generations<00:06:33.610> line<00:06:34.090> not<00:06:34.600> the

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
got the the generations line not the

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.560 
got the the generations line not the
generations<00:06:35.290> like<00:06:35.530> Sonic<00:06:36.010> through<00:06:36.250> time<00:06:36.570> five

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570 
generations like Sonic through time five

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.840 
generations like Sonic through time five
inch<00:06:37.840> Sonic<00:06:38.350> with<00:06:38.530> the<00:06:38.800> new<00:06:39.220> much<00:06:39.550> better

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
inch Sonic with the new much better

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
inch Sonic with the new much better
sculpt<00:06:40.330> and<00:06:41.100> then<00:06:42.100> we've<00:06:42.430> got<00:06:42.790> old<00:06:43.150> crappy

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
sculpt and then we've got old crappy

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.560 
sculpt and then we've got old crappy
black<00:06:44.320> night<00:06:44.590> sonic<00:06:45.040> which<00:06:45.940> everyone<00:06:46.360> thought

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.570 
black night sonic which everyone thought

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.120 
black night sonic which everyone thought
was<00:06:46.780> so<00:06:47.020> accurate<00:06:47.260> to<00:06:47.680> Sonic<00:06:48.100> at<00:06:48.220> the<00:06:48.250> time<00:06:48.550> and

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.130 
was so accurate to Sonic at the time and

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.060 
was so accurate to Sonic at the time and
right<00:06:51.130> here<00:06:51.760> you<00:06:52.120> can<00:06:52.180> see<00:06:52.390> that<00:06:53.050> um<00:06:53.290> they<00:06:53.890> both

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.070 
right here you can see that um they both

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:59.219 
right here you can see that um they both
have<00:06:54.310> the<00:06:54.490> swords<00:06:54.970> yep<00:06:55.360> and<00:06:58.020> Excalibur<00:06:59.020> is

00:06:59.219 --> 00:06:59.229 
have the swords yep and Excalibur is

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:02.100 
have the swords yep and Excalibur is
much<00:06:59.800> bigger<00:07:00.130> than<00:07:00.370> caliber<00:07:00.910> and<00:07:01.030> I<00:07:01.240> mean<00:07:01.720> you

much bigger than caliber and I mean you

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.370 
much bigger than caliber and I mean you
probably<00:07:02.380> won't<00:07:02.680> be<00:07:02.950> able<00:07:03.039> to<00:07:03.280> see<00:07:03.430> that<00:07:04.380> and

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.380 
probably won't be able to see that and

probably won't be able to see that and

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:22.810 
is a bastard to take off but anyway

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.110

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 
looks quite similar and sculpt to the

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:33.000 
looks quite similar and sculpt to the
Black<00:07:30.640> Knight<00:07:30.880> Sonic's<00:07:31.450> face<00:07:31.720> although<00:07:32.140> they

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:40.690 
the face had to be adjusted and that's

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:42.570 
the face had to be adjusted and that's
