00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 laura the markets that say the 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.440
 markets well as I had advanced you 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.250
 the markets are happy with the 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.929
 triumph of macri because macri is in 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.509
 effect the favorite of the markets you 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.970
 you will say good but today the stock market fell 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.710
 the stock market fell by almost 3% but here what 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.869
 you have to bear in mind is that the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.180
 market is governed by a logic of 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.310
 Anticipation anticipates what will happen 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.199
 and this result this victory of the pro 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.150
 it was discounted it was already incorporated 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.619
 in prices it did not mean anything new 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.590
 and that's why today the market does not 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.690
 reacted to this issue but it was seen not 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.950
 influenced by other issues what 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.040
 interesting is that Argentina is 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.200
 living a stock market boom that is this 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.840
 phenomenon that came to be called the effect 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.840
 ciao christina that strictly speaking 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.239
 has to do more than with the successor with 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.570
 the expectation generated by the closure of 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.160
 this cycle of the Kirchner model like this 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.190
 it's like the merval that is the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.530
 porteÃ±a stock market indicator goes up 40 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.809
 percent so far in 2015 and by 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.280
 example the country risk drops 200 points 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.290
 basic only as far as it goes 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.330
 this year that is still a paradox 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.030
 a little bit a portrait of this Argentina 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.920
 backwards we are in default 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.990
 we are in contempt of court 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.090
 New Yorkers we can not pay for 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.300
 maturities of our bonds and we have 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.430
 this climate of market euphoria not the 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.180
 appreciation one third of the capacity 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.830
 idle said brother that was ability 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.810
 idle industry that is not baptized 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.460
 is a stock market woman that is dissociated 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.740
 of the macro of what is the evolution of 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.600
 the economy where the distortions are 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.030
 they are accumulating do not call themselves late 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.100
 exchange rate overflow tax erosion 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.320
 trade surplus now let's go to 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.659
 macri not because macri is the option 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.060
 favorite of the market because good they see it 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.069
 to macri as the friendliest option 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.860
 because he embodies what is the turn to the 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.659
 orthodoxy after this one not this 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.310
 exacerbated heterodoxy of Kirchnerism 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.300
 with a lot of interventionism in the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.800
 economy 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.569
 macri is today the option of orthodoxy and 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.830
 the interesting thing is that his two referents 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:07.050
 economic 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.450
 federico sturzenegger and rogelio frigerio 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.170
 they were quite convincing in this 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.780
 round 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.530
 visit with investors who have done 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.110
 a wall street 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.989
 told me that some bankers 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.300
 they were quite eloquent and left a 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.069
 very good impression on wall street the 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.660
 machismo is not something so different from 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.370
 macrismo in the eyes of investors 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.720
 but it seems that they were a little 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.480
 less effective in this operation 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.430
 seduction the wall street what yes 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.780
 mark as something very different is the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.540
 sciolism because they see it as a 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.150
 unknown is not known how much will be of 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.830
 break and continuity in its management and 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.019
 They also see him as someone very attached to 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.319
 hands when facing the adjustment that 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.299
 will need the Argentina of 2016 for 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.910
 that they are more comfortable with macri but 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.410
 what really excites us today is 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.340
 the chance to say goodbye to christina 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.410
 to see you saw carla to the businessmen 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.750
 you were chatting with them to see what 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.769
 is what they think about the future of 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.630
 scioli mass macri what is it 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.480
 they say in the end it's not that the 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.680
 entrepreneurs have an importance 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.550
 different from the rest of the 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.010
 citizens by 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.190
 the votes because they do not represent everyone 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.050
 every citizen is a vote but yes because 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.060
 finances in the campaigns and if in a 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.580
 certain moment they cut you the jet 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.200
 of funding for a candidate is 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.330
 very difficult to move forward with a 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.880
 campaign without money yes totally 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.300
 Fernando the one spoke of the subject of 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.800
 enthusiasm from the market for the chau 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.900
 christina a little bit the same are 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.660
 living entrepreneurs who are 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.180
 they were pleasantly surprised by what 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.730
 for the results of yesterday but that to the 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.860
 they were disappointed a little with the 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.950
 polls are kind of angry 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.690
 with the surveys because no 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.850
 they represented what reality does not 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.790
 coincided with what finally happened and 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.110
 it's a little misplaced by this that you 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.630
 raised fernando 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.520
 until you get to the elections there are 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.120
 a meanwhile and while the 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.400
 expectation is that in October all 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.940
 would change and that there would be an end of cycle 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.250
 beyond the candidate who wins and the 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.989
 reality is that entrepreneurs in the 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.150
 meanwhile they have to take 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.040
 decisions executives of the 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.320
 multinationals have to define their 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.000
 strategies have to convince the 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.880
 motor homes of what is it going to 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.130
 do and why and in this dance also 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.470
 they have to play politics 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.419
 this is to define how they will distribute the 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.790
 eggs that have the long in the in the 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.030
 canasta who give more to whom the 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:46.930
 less and that's not a very easy decision 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:49.030
 also above all in this case in 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.510
 the election is not a decision 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:55.000
 simple because there is a lot of uncertainty 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.070
 the economy is cold they had to take 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.660
 many of isolates some companies that 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.800
 are taking measures like for example 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.690
 in the automotive sector there was 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.020
 Suspensions mentioned by the crossing 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.150
 from Brazil 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.759
 in the newspaper we took out a few days ago 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.710
 that a major cosmetics company 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.930
 because of the issue of the stocks 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.479
 had to start firing staff is 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.389
 say the macro context is not easy 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:20.860
 internal costs tighten what he said 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:24.979
 an entrepreneur is the model will endure 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.530
 that is the plan is that the model 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.210
 endure tomorrow there is a maximum note 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.430
 before black or with the chronicler who 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.009
 I recommend that it is very good that says 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:37.580
 that the model went from being the model of 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:39.110
 inclusion and production and matrix 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.569
 diversified from all the things that they 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.020
 like to say make the dollar model 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:45.750
 tranqui 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.949
 have managed with the dollar to try that 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.970
 the thing more or less go to the maximum 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.220
 but yes, of course 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.669
 in the exchange rate where the 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.379
 wages grow practically double 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:01.349
 that the exchange rate in the middle of the 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:04.289
 inflation and so the subject is pulling is 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:06.000
 that businessmen say good up 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:07.919
 when he arrived in the meantime 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.720
 where I put these games of those that 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:11.400
 We were talking to whom he deals more here 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.430
 in the cast less still have a 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.960
 climate of uncertainty and then there is a 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.460
 part of the business community that believes in 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.220
 continuity the continuity of 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.349
 scioli operation and they ask good 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.840
 as a little what laura said saying 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:26.490
 how it will handle in reach 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.620
 win what is it going to handle by 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.289
 example a possible coexistence in the 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.750
 case that x and accompany him with Miguel 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:36.840
 September 20 that generate you another 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.669
 issue how to get out of the stocks is another issue 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.919
 it also takes away the dream to 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.110
 entrepreneurs and a businessman and get better 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:45.810
 in two fraga said did not imply 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.849
 until August 9 kicillof after no 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.780
 August Miguel Bein or something by 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:51.760
 style 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.970
 yes yes what I was told a little 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:57.220
 entrepreneurs is that they are scared that 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:07:00.040
 whoever wins, put the car in front of the 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:04.060
 horse is to say the need to leave 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:06.610
 of this stock ends up affecting a 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:09.639
 economy that today is full of pesos 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:13.290
 in full in a country where no 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:13.290
 Argentine saves in local currency
