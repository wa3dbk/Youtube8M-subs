 he suffered colo colo but he got the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.219
 triumph if he managed to make his game on 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.480

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.300
 the only goal of the meeting was a 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.130
 self-roberto roberto after the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.780
 party an exultant dressing room albo spoke 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.790
 of the victory already looking at santiago 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.480
 wanderers next opponent in the stadium 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.480
 monumental 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.870
 and 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.880
 yes 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.730
 many more 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.180
 and I'm happy because 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.030
 especially because we are fighting the 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.970
 tournament needs deep as time 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.190
 we are now we are close now we know 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.330
 that is going to be difficult like all 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.700
 the matches that we have played in the 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.830
 tournament but we depend on us and that 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.780
 achieved the happy now I think that 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.270
 difficult part a match that the last 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.619
 quite the objective was to add and add 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.330
 theater and we got it and that what 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.560
 leaves happy but what is important is 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.509
 video the important thing was to win what 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.710
 important was to add what is important not 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.750
 was losing and we got it 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.550
 we knew that catholic had won if not 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.080
 had fenced but there are still three 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.610
 parties we can no longer think that the 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.710
 another week we are going to be champions and 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.300
 we have to face the game a whole 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.680
 last week they talked about what color 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.880
 I won already turn around and without 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.920
 however say predictions in order to 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.690
 last week was lost we had to 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.190
 wait another week but we 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.590
 aware that still championship and with 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.759
 three dates and that little water a match 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.149
 but but let's work the week 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:56.670
 thinking about the next yes yes the truth 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.320
 that was a complicated match 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.700
 we were not playing against any 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.280
 we were against a great team 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.630
 and we were able to achieve what 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.969
 that I came to seek the advantage after 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.420
 had to endure it in any way 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:13.330
 without us 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.280
 as I said in several countries game 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.230
 classic in all places where the 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.209
 same way generally the team that 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.540
 it has worse in the table the better 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.819
 play 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.909
 and good was the session still played well as 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.400
 very well we needed to win from 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:31.540
 any way and you had to defend and 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.159
 we did it in a good way to win if 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.500
 suffering that won suffering and well there 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:39.319
 a moment that had a good match 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.769
 previous and maybe and today we have to suffer 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.489
 before a rival of much of much 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.489
 importance so 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.020
 to continue thinking about the next one 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.210
 next game and that without a doubt that 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.200
 we made very important points good in 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.200
 all campus the entire campaign 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.050
 and so we're up so 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.570
 we want to take advantage of that distance that 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.590
 we have the rivals and try to 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:11.930
 secure the next match logically 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.930
 we prepare it in another way 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:18.000
 trying to dominate us more but 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.820
 good for the lack the lack of some 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.490
 players so it was the week that 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.230
 I made a tremendous effort on behalf of the 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.930
 players and part of america physics 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.570
 to be able to count on them we 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.970
 we find the matches that we 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.460
 it touched refugee we defend ourselves order 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.310
 comes the defensive part and a little 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.130
 try to get out playing when against 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.900
 I think that we also find ourselves 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.230
 with him with the goal and then what 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.460
 we defend to death and in the end it leaves us 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.850
 three points that are tremendously 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:54.120
 valuable is to be can be but 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:58.110
 the most important thing is that there is a team 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:02.380
 that has a lot of offensive vocation and today 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.830
 day he had to defend with everything he defended 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.560
 the solidarity of 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.650
 all in having to come to positions 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.260
 defensive and in the end that effort and that 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.660
 understanding and knowing how to read the game 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.880
 from inside the court makes us win 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.860
 a classic makes us win three points 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.750
 which are tremendously tremendously 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.620
 valuable for what is our task 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.620
 final that is the field
