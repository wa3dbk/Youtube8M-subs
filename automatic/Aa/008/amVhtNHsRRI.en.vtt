00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
 how 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.800
 plus 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.800
 plus 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.260
 Well, on Saturday in Almeria everyone was 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.570
 good news for real madrid 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.660
 because he won the match with sum 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.700
 ease 0 5 against an almeria that a 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.980
 almerÃ­a that and will win matches in 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.750
 their previous encounters but we saw a 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.150
 remedy a little what he promised 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.550
 Ancelotti when he arrived at the 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.890
 real madrid he had trumpeted that 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.860
 Real Madrid was going to be a team that 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.960
 that was going to be the protagonist of all 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.180
 his matches that panetta the ball to 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.390
 make combinations are going to play do 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.699
 It's nice because it has not always 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.470
 gotten since I was in the 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.960
 Real Madrid bench some courtyards 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.390
 and others not so much we have seen some 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.960
 of bears matches now said 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.390
 we have always seen this backlash myself 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.060
 I can get involved in an afternoon-night 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.760
 in the sports prison do when he says 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.590
 that this team is made to 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.170
 counterattack because not for me this 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.210
 equipment is also made for 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.850
 kickback have footballers 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.240
 really good technically as 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.370
 people that lies in perfection but 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.650
 I had never played with such creativity 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.840
 so I think that mother is armed 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.600
 for it and so we saw it in the first 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.990
 half a problem that he became an owner and 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.880
 lord of the match and with the ball had 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.850
 a strangulation is and combinations 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.040
 really splendid is that nobody 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.160
 follow shadows while madrid dominable 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.700
 I find in its totality, if we 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.250
 come to rest by winning 0-1 or 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.860
 have been more than four or five if not 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.460
 was for the good performance of esteban 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.140
 he wants very feline from under the sticks 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.270
 in the second half and they are not madrid 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.310
 and if mother a little more dull but with 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.560
 that punch is tremendous because if mother 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.930
 have something even when he does not play 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.590
 everything is well stuck and marked 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.380
 four more goals coming to the court 05 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.440
 but I precisely although I marked 4 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.050
 goals in the second half I prefer to 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.570
 madrid the first half when I went with 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.840
 the minimum advantage because I'm sure 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.180
 Real Madrid plays like he plays 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.750
 in the first half madrid can play 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.350
 against any team in the world and 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.230
 we are talking about champions madrid goes 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.660
 qualify for the round of 16 but 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.840
 madrid who owns the ball we fulfill 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.209
 in the first half is more equipped to 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.150
 play in europe against very teams 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.310
 good that a team that we saw the 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.380
 second half with less ball with more 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.930
 stuck because when you play against the 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.090
 great teams from europe and you do not have 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.250
 so much the ball they are so good that 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.959
 You can do a lot of pupa but against 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.020
 good teams and it's you who have the 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.590
 ball 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.360
 It does not hurt so much then 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.730
 paradoxically I think that madrid is 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.400
 much better playing with the first half 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.430
 when he won 1-0 than in the second 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.200
 half when they scored four goals 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.840
 that Madrid we will see with close the 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.000
 third and I hope I hope that 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.240
 we will see the madrid of the first 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.240
 half
