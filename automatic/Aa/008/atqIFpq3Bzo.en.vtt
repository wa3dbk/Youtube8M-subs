00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.920
 just Schwegmann Advent week that knows that you first game in which it makes sense 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.239
 is that you have come every equipped opponent announced 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:15.239
 No 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.640
 After playing in the new multiplayer mode with Thomas Eshold, they also play 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.850
 Pages of the bad boys 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.190
 and because the big ones have such a life that it quite well fallen down 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.720
 To be an opponent and if now think of AACS you have Anbar in front of me 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.300
 in his in the pats Dortmund off 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.300
 For one thing, the costs can not be seen through walls 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.899
 to be as far as no opponent is late 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.409
 It will be a so-called text for everyone in the team with a red router 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:45.680
 marked 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.450
 Hamilton which man is even displayed as the player is called 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.630
 and whether he has already scored many points in this round, he also speaks 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.630
 is dangerous opponent 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.270
 Dr 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.030
 on the other hand, the sv-team Kempten may because at least on this map 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.030
 protect three anti-aircraft positions 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.100
 to unseen to both play as the role of the commander the comeback 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.400
 other city Hassfurt his fuss and Werner made 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.400
 third big in the container so probably thinks for his way already 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.110
 Silverman me 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.190
 the granules silenced with Sarah in the 5 a relatively weak weapon 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.840
 but they can always catch names of opponents 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.120
 Ever about an assault rifle with grenade launcher and that's pretty much that 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.660
 thickest thing in the game so 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.130
 The gram was also removed from the tax by colleagues who removed their pink 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.690
 mark on the button press finish there's points as for 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.690
 any other decision maker activity in game construction 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.260
 Dr 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.750
 At regular intervals Fannie Mae Sot promotions are still getting on the 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.600
 Battlefield better weapons and equipment 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.629
 here however not exactly our old find would be 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.629
 been for it 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.749
 Of course, this can sometimes be cheaper on launch points too 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.969
 renounce and, unnoticed, destroy a flagged one 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.969
 because then all team members can get back into the game 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.439
 we hope that no one has spotted us 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.599
 Sound can be 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.599
 I think one of them will be scarce 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:39.419
 after you 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.269
 We can not play ball anymore but we can still watch it 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.559
 so-called Cham 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:50.329
 Here we take a look at the helmet camera of a superior camera 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:56.759
 US 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:03:00.819
 Opponents who run us into the target circle are the Techt and we get for it 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:01.909
 again points 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.169
 but the colleague so c4 because we look around for him 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:08.169
 can not help him, however 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.950
 because they viewed so and Texas does not necessarily have a life insurance policy - 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:15.019
 you can see it here again 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.849
 over there has a new or even a how done but I still have it 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.849
 a child captured by him the big coup they lay that 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:26.139
 but unfortunately can not do it 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.049
 Although we now have new sniper rifles 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.059
 maybe it will even shoot through the lens but if we do not have it 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:35.080
 they use so position betrayed so wait and see 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:44.759
 but Kempen allowed as I said only the defenders 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.609
 v 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.969
 No 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:54.099
 in this case has six used 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.099
 the solution provider jumps to Flake we have lost 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:08.119
 all the beginning had not even played as a debate player mode of Pipe 2 

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:09.229
 thought my god 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:12.629
 the slowest one here I'm still such a polemic back out to the 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.729
 Luck must be or what is not a bit sluggish and far from being so 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.889
 as fast as Counterstrike or Battle Field when you're there but it was 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.900
 then it gets really exciting and then you have one 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.909
 great feeling when the colleagues say Annemie last 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:29.680
 to the singer therefore mode I could show him no scenes now Dean have 

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:31.919
 but I already played 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.919
 In short, just as before, Euro is much better under why 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.620
 This is exactly what they learn in the region in the magazine
