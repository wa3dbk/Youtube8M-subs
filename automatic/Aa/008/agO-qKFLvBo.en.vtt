00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
controlled system of scarce resources

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.400 
controlled system of scarce resources
which<00:02:06.960> we<00:02:07.170> call<00:02:07.380> our<00:02:07.619> manatee

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
which we call our manatee

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.840 
which we call our manatee
system<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:10.000> how<00:02:10.360> do<00:02:10.420> you<00:02:10.630> resolve<00:02:10.780> that<00:02:11.260> and

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
system so how do you resolve that and

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.210 
system so how do you resolve that and
what<00:02:12.850> principle<00:02:13.510> can<00:02:13.750> we<00:02:13.960> live<00:02:14.200> by<00:02:14.500> so<00:02:15.190> that

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
what principle can we live by so that

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.060 
what principle can we live by so that
when<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:16.120> do<00:02:16.360> want<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.200> live<00:02:17.350> on<00:02:17.380> purpose<00:02:17.890> to

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
when you do want to live on purpose to

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.740 
when you do want to live on purpose to
bring<00:02:18.160> what<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:18.430> love<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:19.180> money<00:02:19.450> does

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
bring what you love the money does

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.930 
bring what you love the money does
follow<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.470> glad<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.160> asked<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.550> question

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
follow you glad you asked the question

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.370 
follow you glad you asked the question
because<00:02:21.970> it's<00:02:22.330> a<00:02:22.420> really<00:02:22.630> good<00:02:22.840> question<00:02:22.960> to

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
because it's a really good question to

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.430 
because it's a really good question to
us<00:02:23.940> well<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.360> answer<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.020> first<00:02:26.260> question

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
us well the answer to the first question

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.860 
us well the answer to the first question
is<00:02:27.040> answered<00:02:27.460> in<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.300> second<00:02:28.660> question

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
is answered in the second question

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.290 
is answered in the second question
really<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:29.920> be<00:02:30.250> with<00:02:30.460> me<00:02:30.640> on<00:02:30.760> this<00:02:30.910> let<00:02:31.150> me

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
really so be with me on this let me

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.550 
really so be with me on this let me
explain<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:33.550> live<00:02:33.760> by<00:02:33.930> instead<00:02:34.930> what

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
explain you live by instead what

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.530 
explain you live by instead what

plain<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:04.950> simple<00:03:05.950> we<00:03:06.730> need<00:03:07.080> structure<00:03:08.080> we

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
plain and simple we need structure we

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.720 
plain and simple we need structure we
also<00:03:09.220> need<00:03:09.660> mass<00:03:10.660> or<00:03:11.080> gravity<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:12.670> pulls

towards us that which we desire so

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.300 
towards us that which we desire so
here's<00:03:16.480> an<00:03:16.600> example<00:03:16.690> if<00:03:17.290> we<00:03:17.470> were<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.830> pour<00:03:18.070> the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
here's an example if we were to pour the

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.060 
here's an example if we were to pour the
ocean<00:03:18.640> of<00:03:18.760> abundance<00:03:19.270> for<00:03:19.510> example<00:03:20.110> into<00:03:20.890> our

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
ocean of abundance for example into our

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.460 
ocean of abundance for example into our
hands<00:03:21.490> guess<00:03:22.000> what's<00:03:22.209> going<00:03:22.420> to<00:03:22.480> happen<00:03:22.810> the

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
hands guess what's going to happen the

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.170 
hands guess what's going to happen the
ocean<00:03:24.040> of<00:03:24.130> abundance<00:03:24.340> is<00:03:24.700> going<00:03:24.910> to<00:03:24.970> fall

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
ocean of abundance is going to fall

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.150 
ocean of abundance is going to fall
through<00:03:25.390> our<00:03:25.600> fingers<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:26.050> money<00:03:26.560> often<00:03:26.800> does

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
through our fingers and money often does

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.610 
through our fingers and money often does
fall<00:03:27.459> for<00:03:27.670> our<00:03:27.790> fingers<00:03:27.970> doesn't<00:03:28.510> it<00:03:28.620> because

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
fall for our fingers doesn't it because

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.430 
fall for our fingers doesn't it because
there's<00:03:29.860> no<00:03:30.040> structure<00:03:30.550> to<00:03:31.209> capture<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:31.750> to

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
there's no structure to capture it to

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.490 
there's no structure to capture it to
grow<00:03:32.770> it<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.580> outflow<00:03:34.270> it<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:34.990> it<00:03:35.140> can<00:03:35.170> mean

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
grow it to outflow it so it can mean

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.250 
grow it to outflow it so it can mean
flow<00:03:35.770> back<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.220> us<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:36.670> we<00:03:36.700> need<00:03:37.120> structure<00:03:37.570> so

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
flow back to us so we need structure so

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.770 
flow back to us so we need structure so
that<00:03:38.290> can<00:03:38.650> attract<00:03:39.040> more<00:03:39.340> money<00:03:39.580> to<00:03:39.910> you<00:03:40.120> you

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
that can attract more money to you you

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.650 
that can attract more money to you you
add<00:03:41.020> structure<00:03:41.890> let's<00:03:42.640> say<00:03:43.000> for<00:03:43.239> example<00:03:43.270> you

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
add structure let's say for example you

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.630 
add structure let's say for example you
have<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:43.930> cup<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.500> then<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.220> ocean<00:03:45.520> of

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
have a cup and then the ocean of

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.750 
have a cup and then the ocean of
abundance<00:03:46.120> flows<00:03:46.330> into<00:03:46.660> that<00:03:46.959> cup<00:03:47.290> well<00:03:48.130> now

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
abundance flows into that cup well now

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.670 
abundance flows into that cup well now
it's<00:03:49.239> going<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:49.600> fill<00:03:50.020> up<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:50.440> we're<00:03:50.530> going<00:03:50.650> to

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
it's going to fill up and we're going to

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.440 
it's going to fill up and we're going to
capture<00:03:51.070> some<00:03:51.280> of<00:03:51.310> that<00:03:51.400> ocean<00:03:51.730> of<00:03:52.000> abundance

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
capture some of that ocean of abundance

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.479 
capture some of that ocean of abundance
and<00:03:52.570> then<00:03:53.170> if<00:03:53.290> you<00:03:53.380> keep<00:03:53.590> going<00:03:54.010> it's<00:03:54.220> going<00:03:54.430> to

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
and then if you keep going it's going to

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.130 
and then if you keep going it's going to
overflow<00:03:54.820> isn't<00:03:55.360> it<00:03:55.420> so<00:03:55.600> that<00:03:55.780> your<00:03:55.930> cut

favorite laws and this is all about

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.070 
favorite laws and this is all about

gravitational pull that you need

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.650 
gravitational pull that you need
to<00:04:17.410> attract<00:04:17.980> that<00:04:18.340> money<00:04:18.670> following<00:04:19.300> you<00:04:19.480> as

will follow because you've got the

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.440 
will follow because you've got the
structure<00:04:27.460> and<00:04:27.550> you've<00:04:27.700> got<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.880> mess<00:04:28.180> and

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
structure and you've got the mess and
