00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.030
 radically opposed goals for 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.320
 evian and lila if evian wants to get away 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.810
 more of the relegation zone 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.450
 lille wants to keep his third place 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.759
 Endangered by a bad journey 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.950
 since early 2014 with just a 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.990
 victory it was during the last 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.420
 day facing sochaux and evian of his 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.850
 side has not won since early 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.010
 December and his victory over the psg and 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.580
 stays on a drawn draw at 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.590
 montpellier 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.720
 evian fit well in this part with 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.300
 a first situation and the foot strike 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.700
 left of the Argentine marco ruben well 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.940
 feel enyama goes to bed well for 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.460
 prevent the old villarreal player 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.280
 to score the first goal of this 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.020
 part 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.149
 evian has more incisive in the minutes 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.100
 who are following is going to be rewarded the meaning 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.789
 of modou sougou is cut by kévin 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.940
 beats the scorer's head of the tg and 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.240
 victorious vincent enyama can not do anything 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.830
 make 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:15.030
 1 to 0 for the dg and lille completely 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.560
 apathetic bérigaud de vence stone but 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.689
 less than ten minutes later the losc 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.869
 will react via divo to 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.090
 rigi the small number of soloist of the Belgian 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.920
 trompe bertrand lacquered 1 goal everywhere 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.650
 it's the second goal in two matches 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.869
 for divock origi and already scorer facing 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:37.700
 sochaux a week ago 1 goal everywhere 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.700
 it's the half-time score 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:49.070
 in the stands the official look-alike of 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.850
 pascal dupraz and the true and pascal 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.760
 dupraz on his slightly teasing bench 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.260
 with his staff 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.490
 but pascal dupraz is not going to see anymore 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.340
 smile because lille will go up in 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.980
 diet with this attempt at nolan 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.160
 red and it takes a decisive horizontal 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.100
 of bertrand lacquered to prevent nolan 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.460
 red to score the goal of 2 1 lille is 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.560
 better 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.080
 lille is in a strong time but it's 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.290
 in this period that the tgv is going to get 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.860
 a penalty barbosa incursion is 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:26.480
 stopped by Pope's illicit hand 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:31.340
 souged penalty for the tg transformed by 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:36.110
 Cedric Mongongu his sixth goal in league 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.090
 1 of which five penalties and well leads 2 goals 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.209
 at 1 in the 64th minute 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.940
 we thought to see a success of the tg well 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.890
 no to the 93rd at the end of time 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.340
 additional 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:52.670
 it's ryan mendes on this center-shot that 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.550
 will find the returning pole 2 goals 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.739
 everywhere evian lets go 23 points 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.410
 since the beginning of the season after having 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.690
 led to score lille tear off a point 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.840
 precious to maintain his third 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.840
 square
