goodwill<00:00:41.370> that's<00:00:42.329> why<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.570> used<00:00:45.800> spliced<00:00:46.800> off

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
goodwill that's why I used spliced off

goodwill that's why I used spliced off
the<00:00:47.129> end<00:00:48.320> kept<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.469> male<00:00:49.649> end<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.430> connect

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
the end kept the male end to connect

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.080 
the end kept the male end to connect
into<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.030> Genesis<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.020> then<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.460> worked

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
into the Genesis and then so that worked

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.779 
into the Genesis and then so that worked
and<00:00:54.300> then<00:00:54.960> wanted<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.890> used<00:00:58.250> now<00:00:59.250> before<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.609> was

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
and then wanted to used now before I was

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.360 
and then wanted to used now before I was
saying<00:01:00.059> what<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.539> didn't<00:01:01.050> what<00:01:01.260> wires<00:01:01.530> what<00:01:01.859> its

I didn't know what color wire goes to
what<00:01:05.280> 10<00:01:05.580> now<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:06.180> probably<00:01:06.330> diagram

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
what 10 now I can just probably diagram

an LCD screen so it's five more
prominent<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.130> could<00:01:41.250> actually<00:01:41.400> see<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.790> off

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
prominent you could actually see it off

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.130 
prominent you could actually see it off
of<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.259> LCD<00:01:44.009> screen<00:01:44.159> than<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.759> CRT<00:01:45.570> screen<00:01:48.140> so

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
of the LCD screen than a CRT screen so

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.279 
of the LCD screen than a CRT screen so
yeah

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.529 

and<00:01:53.289> there<00:01:53.409> you<00:01:53.469> have<00:01:53.530> it<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:55.060> looks<00:01:55.210> cleaner

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
and there you have it it looks cleaner

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.950 
and there you have it it looks cleaner
actually<00:01:56.109> I<00:01:56.140> don't<00:01:56.350> I<00:01:56.619> don't<00:01:57.460> want<00:01:57.640> like

actually I don't I don't want like
totally<00:01:58.960> ruin<00:01:59.259> the<00:02:00.100> system<00:02:00.579> while<00:02:00.969> drilling

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
totally ruin the system while drilling

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.190 
totally ruin the system while drilling
holes<00:02:01.509> near<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:01.899> necklace<00:02:02.289> soldering<00:02:04.200> outputs

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
holes near a necklace soldering outputs

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.859 
holes near a necklace soldering outputs
on<00:02:05.380> it<00:02:05.880> that's<00:02:06.880> kind<00:02:07.209> of<00:02:07.240> another<00:02:07.359> way<00:02:07.630> and

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
on it that's kind of another way and

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.539 
on it that's kind of another way and
that's<00:02:08.019> cleaner<00:02:08.319> look<00:02:08.590> just<00:02:09.190> grab<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:11.519> like<00:02:12.519> a
