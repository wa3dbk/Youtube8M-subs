00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.550
 hello everyone this is the first video e 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:07.870
 now i'll show you make up which i think it is 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.280
 suitable for the first day of school 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.519
 of the first averages 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.429
 let's start right away then let's get started 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:19.480
 applying a light yellow tooth 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:23.279
 do not put on the whole eyelid 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:28.779
 I think this seasoned here instead 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:33.160
 however it adheres better with the fingers therefore 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:35.140
 must apply even before I made a 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.940
 video with wanted marello bond the 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.940
 our case indeed still a bit of 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.220
 trick is there 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.740
 then the applications of the fund of 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.350
 see collector optional but if 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.020
 just want to put you advise if 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.130
 you have dry skin I recommend a 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.660
 concealer cream foundation has some 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.040
 the same did not tell us on the dock 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.030
 I want to dare to apply 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.350
 a moisturizer before more cables 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.900
 then if you want shiny skin instead 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.020
 fat advisers use the products in 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.800
 dust also other bands is born 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.800
 optional 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.979
 within the color quite fast because 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.990
 anyway for the morning in the school 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.700
 so that's fine but he is n't doing a 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.340
 complex thought and that anyway son 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.360
 I have to do it 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.080
 ok then each one applied 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.330
 yellow eyeshadow 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.030
 let's fade into the colomb interior 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.470
 Rectina belgium is this guy you see 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.720
 in his sea towards the understanding that this 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.070
 because not the beautiful knuckles 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.070
 event this my commitment 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.460
 the beast eyeshadow would be a 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.030
 neutralizing is yellow that too 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.890
 on because it is too visible 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:14.780
 let's take abundance because it's in 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:18.560
 color very similar to the complexion e 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.370
 you don't see my head very perfect 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.370
 what is the soc 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.680
 I repeat 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.870
 ok bellocchio should be finished 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.000
 trick though is if you want you can as well 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.920
 go create a Colombian light spot 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.270
 white brow relay 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.460
 the eyes see how it comes then and then if 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.330
 you want you can then put it with 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.330
 white lambertine 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.020
 this is why we have it 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.550
 my dear point 903 overlap like this 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.140
 however if you want to go and create 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:32.989
 a light point to buffer again below 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:34.730
 at the Chilean helmet then it goes to fade with 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:41.120
 the other half of its nature is useful 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:43.239
 just that it is enough to amalgamate the 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.239
 all 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.530
 I wait for Saturday 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.790
 ok the trick that's over with people 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.290
 in the light source but not even in the application 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.990
 how to call the blush card 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:03.220
 highly educated you go wrong year I already 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:09.370
 applied a lip balm before this 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:10.800
 here the palms of the vanilla or it looks like one 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.130
 glue but it is not 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:18.070
 this is nothing here is the trick is over 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.500
