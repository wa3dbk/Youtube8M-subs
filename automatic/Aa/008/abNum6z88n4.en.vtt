00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 on the shows the stands said 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.670
 a lot about brands 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.830
 I do not know if you remember 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.070
 corot what is presented first 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.350
 time last year in Geneva that rock 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.220
 this Chinese brand that has big 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.680
 ambitions since want to become a 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.080
 generalist a little way warned a buzz 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.630
 reggae are not yet brought 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.039
 definitely in France he was going 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.609
 present the year behind this sedan 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.380
 very inspired by the passat and there they 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.940
 broaden the range including a 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.400
 compact hatchback are 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.510
 today the French market 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.350
 bayer look a little closer but 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.489
 what is interesting is to see 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.489
 that they have thought for a moment 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.760
 all germany's codes in aunis and 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:52.670
 black they are mostly next to maserati 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:54.980
 and royce rolls that are paid pink 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.149
 big big booth for anthony he gets 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.850
 will recognize that I have been asked to 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.480
 to tell without big but we see that 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.629
 it's serious 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:08.030
 and so there after the sedan 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:12.170
 here are his megan markets of 308 so 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:17.470
 with a very reassuring drawing it's 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.470
 consensual but takes its source 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.640
 it's not necessarily what 's more 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:26.760
 horny but we see that it is well done 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.980
 cars made in china but with big 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.880
 big fat Germanic influence 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.630
 many people who were hired 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.890
 from volkswagen 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.780
 without really doing anything 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.090
 everything appears digital since there the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.679
 dashboard to the air and 1 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.220
 a little dark so it's funny because 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.760
 that finally the street 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.760
 and at my place 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.460
 he can make quality 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.470
 so they count all the archetypes 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.690
 German of 6 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.760
 to be the quality is pretty funny 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.580
 that's what marc is another it was 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.790
 the incredible night because we are 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.680
 really at pvc hallucinating then there 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.930
 yes and dirty blow modo there is no kelly 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:16.160
 tv but that's it really to 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.750
 the German by Cedric would be there the 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.770
 even the glove box that it has to be 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:26.540
 a diffuser why the saas is 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:32.079
 completely audi there in the hour 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.079
 a big screen that must it comes back 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.760
 always the same for having started 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.410
 it betrays these things 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.300
 it's curious me I think that the 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.730
 Chinese will be strong the day they 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.290
 will be two Chinese cars and the 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.250
 Chinese to highlight their 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.010
 values ​​but it will take time 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.750
 maybe ten or fifteen years ago it was me 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.459
 looks very serious is very boring 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.459
 for me but my 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.540
 I think the bet of saying koros does 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.540
 of the car 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.680
 of good quality 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.099
 webbing 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.099
 acta
