 put a virtual shop counter 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.309
 Lausanne is a very extensive one 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.469
 role play the three years 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.120
 development time on the hump has in 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.429
 the game takes you to the 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.530
 once thriving city keen 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:07.930
 lately, however, life is here 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.570
 not quite as blooming one 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.980
 mysterious plague engulfs people and 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.780
 animals of the city 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.450
 This is at the beginning of the game, however 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.060
 not really your worry then you 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.160
 plays a hired bodyguard 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.210
 a wealthy dispatched 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.550
 to protect 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.100
 you should find out what with yours 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.470
 The ambassadors in Shaan have done so 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.310
 reception is anything but 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.470
 friendly 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.690
 next to crazy and already 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.280
 He makes infected inhabitants of the city 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.680
 the acquaintance with the palace guard 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.660
 which greets you grumpily and 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.700
 then even in a trap lures 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.040
 together with you to help 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.870
 hurrying inhabitant of the city creates her 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.580
 to overwhelm the guards 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.440
 we learn that the ruler of 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.660
 Shah since the arrival of new 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.820
 Adviser behaves strangely 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.620
 The same is already true of you 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.110
 alaric come to ears 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.750
 and so you break the secret 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.580
 to lift the mysterious forces in the country 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.930
 The story of the game will be above all else 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.850
 about the dialogues between the 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.310
 Characterized driven 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.179
 almost exclusively in text form 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.980
 respectively 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.360
 like many roleplaying games that is 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.410
 language of the shadows at only in 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.410

 graphics engine very good and atmospheric 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.000
 looks and too 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.310
 still weaker devices 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.260
 running smoothly the control is over 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.150
 a virtual analog stick below 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.100
 left on the screen and a button 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.110
 bottom right on the screen 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.910
 depending on the situation to fight or 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.150
 interact with objects and people 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.980
 serves the shadows is a classic 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.800
 roleplaying means that there is one 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.080
 extensive upgrade system for 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.850

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.620
 skills points 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.590
 Also different sub-points like strength 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.020
 endurance intelligence charisma attack 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.120
 steal magic and many more 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.920
 distribute properties it remains 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.140
 Of course, leave it to you in which 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.420
 direction to develop your character 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.850
 Wanted how you like yours 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.020
 if you have developed character in the game 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.880
 you while playing 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.980
 different possibilities offered 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.870
 to solve the situation 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.570
 gets a charismatic character 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.610
 For example, further conversation options 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.010
 while you have a particularly strong 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.640
 character in the fight better possibilities 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.640
 provides 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.090
 the real game is then in 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.340
 subdivided various missions 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.349
 whom you break from a hiding place 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.360
 In this hiding you can be in front of everyone 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.160
 mission with various companions 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.040
 different strengths and weaknesses 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.569
 choose which ones will accompany you then 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.370
 escorts you can via symbols 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.349
 give different instructions like 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.630
 attack or assist 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.790
 so your companion will be on your own 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.590
 attack or heal, for example 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.560
 if he has the appropriate 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.959
 of course there are features 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.850
 in lausanne also a lot of objects 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.880
 which at different points in the game 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.680
 obtained or defeated character 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.690
 so had your own character in the 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.180
 Gameplay with ever stronger weapons 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.030
 and armor or modify yours 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.889
 equipment with magical objects frequently 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.810
 needed items like healing potions 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:39.030
 you can access a fast 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.030
 strip at the screen edge place 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.470
 My conclusion is classic role-playing games 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.260
 rare and often enough too 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.840
 under their complexity of the shadows at 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.700
 but makes many things right the 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.550
 history is exciting the unity 3d 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.320
 graphics fluid and detailed and that 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.870
 Game is in every relationship 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.210
 In addition, it is very positive 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.130
 that of the cellos despite the complex 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.680
 gameplays and related 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.380
 sprawling menus remains clear 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.850
 The shadows on is an epic game 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.400
 with many characters and 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.230
 This will give you a good ten 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.990
 hours to the screens will tie 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:20.180
 Graphics and sound are atmospheric without 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.620
 to the current ios graphic reference 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.840
 to be able to reach 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.670
 a pity is that the story only 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.010
 is told about text boxes and the 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.740
 title only available in English 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.760
 the many text softens a bit the 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.920
 the atmosphere 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.160
 nevertheless, wait with the shadows 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.020
 a completely recommendable and 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.000
 extensive role-playing title he has 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.280
 the game already played then writes 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.030
 your opinion as usual in the 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.710
 Comments 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.510
 thanks for watching and until the 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.510
 next video fabian
