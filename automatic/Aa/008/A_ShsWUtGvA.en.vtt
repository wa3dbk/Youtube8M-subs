first<00:02:54.420> crafting<00:02:54.810> recipe<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.290> called<00:02:55.440> the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
first crafting recipe is called the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.800 
first crafting recipe is called the
collector<00:02:56.070> of<00:02:56.190> experience<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.120> they<00:02:57.240> need<00:02:57.510> a

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
collector of experience and they need a

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.230 
collector of experience and they need a
hammer<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.410> also<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.680> wrench<00:02:59.220> now<00:02:59.550> are<00:02:59.760> doing

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
hammer and also a wrench now are doing

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.210 
hammer and also a wrench now are doing
this<00:03:00.360> crafting<00:03:00.810> this<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:01.110> extremely<00:03:01.740> easy<00:03:01.770> and

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
this crafting this is extremely easy and

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.360 
this crafting this is extremely easy and
I<00:03:02.370> reckon<00:03:02.670> is<00:03:03.050> completely<00:03:04.050> overpowered<00:03:04.800> so

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
I reckon is completely overpowered so

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
I reckon is completely overpowered so

just keep on spray spamming 100 and you

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.260 
just keep on spray spamming 100 and you
gain<00:03:28.080> XP<00:03:28.350> slowly<00:03:29.280> but<00:03:29.520> surely<00:03:29.550> you<00:03:29.880> will<00:03:30.060> get

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270

it down anyway I've placed them in the

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.010 
it down anyway I've placed them in the
ground<00:04:02.130> but<00:04:02.430> that's<00:04:02.820> how<00:04:03.030> how<00:04:03.420> you<00:04:03.480> should

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
ground but that's how how you should

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.600 
ground but that's how how you should
implement<00:04:04.500> them<00:04:04.830> I'm<00:04:05.070> not<00:04:05.220> saying<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:05.460> you

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
implement them I'm not saying that you

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.030 
implement them I'm not saying that you
have<00:04:05.820> to<00:04:05.850> but<00:04:06.420> it<00:04:06.900> will<00:04:06.990> be<00:04:07.350> best<00:04:07.590> implemented

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
have to but it will be best implemented

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.130
