00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.210 
now this stem of the game shows us a
little<00:02:21.480> bit<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.870> different<00:02:22.319> like<00:02:22.739> angle<00:02:23.099> on

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
little bit of a different like angle on

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.979 
little bit of a different like angle on
how<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.400> game<00:02:23.640> plays<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.180> here<00:02:24.510> we're<00:02:24.720> seeing

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
how the game plays and here we're seeing

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.830 
how the game plays and here we're seeing
like<00:02:25.200> some<00:02:25.700> action<00:02:26.700> sequences<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.239> have<00:02:27.690> you

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
like some action sequences that have you

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.050 
like some action sequences that have you
running<00:02:28.110> up<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.319> rope<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.830> some<00:02:29.580> more<00:02:29.730> combat

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
running up a rope and some more combat

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.970 
running up a rope and some more combat
sequences<00:02:30.299> so<00:02:31.230> how<00:02:31.409> does<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:31.680> all<00:02:31.799> fit

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
sequences so how does that all fit

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.309 
sequences so how does that all fit
together<00:02:32.120> okay<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.180> there's<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.900> number<00:02:34.170> of

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
together okay so there's a number of

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.229 
together okay so there's a number of
different<00:02:34.440> things<00:02:35.040> like<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.730> say<00:02:35.910> we've<00:02:36.090> got

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
different things like to say we've got

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.509 
different things like to say we've got
the<00:02:36.390> big<00:02:36.810> hero<00:02:37.080> sequences<00:02:37.830> when<00:02:38.099> you're<00:02:38.310> where

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
the big hero sequences when you're where

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.280 
the big hero sequences when you're where
you<00:02:38.640> can<00:02:38.849> get<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.239> run<00:02:39.480> down<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:39.780> roads<00:02:39.959> and

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
you can get a run down the roads and

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.229 
you can get a run down the roads and
jump<00:02:40.530> side<00:02:40.890> side<00:02:41.099> do<00:02:41.370> things<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:41.790> are<00:02:41.849> you

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
jump side side do things that are you

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:52.880 
jump side side do things that are you
know<00:02:42.330> kind<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.629> pretty<00:02:42.900> crazy

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.089 

in<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.069> combat<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.970> combat<00:02:55.269> ranges<00:02:55.750> from
