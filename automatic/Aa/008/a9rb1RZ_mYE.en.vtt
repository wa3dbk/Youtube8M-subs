Steve<00:02:15.379> out<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:16.069> mean<00:02:16.459> I<00:02:16.489> guess<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:17.209> best<00:02:17.360> thing

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
Steve out I mean I guess the best thing

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.380 
Steve out I mean I guess the best thing
to<00:02:17.599> do<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.170> take<00:02:18.349> out<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.890> King<00:02:19.519> of<00:02:19.700> Comedy<00:02:19.909> I

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
to do is to take out a King of Comedy I

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.839 
to do is to take out a King of Comedy I
think<00:02:21.319> in<00:02:21.409> this<00:02:21.500> particular<00:02:21.830> fashion<00:02:22.280> I<00:02:22.640> think

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
think in this particular fashion I think

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.210 
think in this particular fashion I think
it<00:02:22.909> could<00:02:23.030> have<00:02:23.150> been<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.390> handle<00:02:24.129> probably<00:02:25.129> in

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
it could have been to handle probably in

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.559 
it could have been to handle probably in
a<00:02:25.280> different<00:02:25.610> way<00:02:25.700> but<00:02:25.760> then<00:02:26.030> again<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.480> know

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
a different way but then again you know

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.509 
a different way but then again you know
people<00:02:26.599> don't<00:02:26.989> know<00:02:27.170> how<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.560> what<00:02:28.010> extent

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
people don't know how to what extent

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.110 
people don't know how to what extent
can't<00:02:29.420> was<00:02:29.659> pissed<00:02:29.959> off<00:02:30.170> or<00:02:30.470> upset<00:02:30.860> but<00:02:31.819> again

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
can't was pissed off or upset but again

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.030 
can't was pissed off or upset but again
I<00:02:32.360> think<00:02:32.780> it's<00:02:33.110> very<00:02:33.140> very<00:02:33.440> vital<00:02:33.709> that<00:02:33.980> we

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
I think it's very very vital that we

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.610 
I think it's very very vital that we
understand<00:02:34.610> as<00:02:34.819> as<00:02:35.090> artists<00:02:35.599> as<00:02:35.870> comics
