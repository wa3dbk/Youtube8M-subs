00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:10.369
 hi I'm michelangelo moggia 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:13.849
 today I want to present you one of the most beautiful and special paintings of 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.609
 caravaggio the sacrifice of Isaac 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.699
 this painting was painted in 1603 and is intended for an episode of the ancient 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:22.699
 will 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.609
 the one in which god to test the faith of abraham asks him to 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.489
 sacrifice them his only son Isaac 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.750
 I abruptly accept but as he is about to kill the child an angel sent 

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:35.860
 sperm comes from the sky 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.830
 caravaggio photographs this very moment 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.260
 it is a very agitated moment where various forces act against each other 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.280
 isacco creed and agitates to try to free himself from his father's iron grip 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.280
 the thumb of the new product on his life confirms it 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.170
 I try to restrain my son with one arm 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.580
 while with the other he holds tightly the knife with which he is about to hit him 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.990
 at the same time it tries to free itself from the grip of the angel and it seems not 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.360
 to understand why he tries to stop it and not by chance he looks at it 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.260
 frowning 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.700
 the angel finally blocks the arm of abraham just in time 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.250
 hotels indicates the network you were next to 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.410
 ram remained entangled with horns in a bush and then will come then 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.570
 sacrificed in place of isacco as if it were a sign 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.420
 like all the paintings of all the caravaggio paintings ovolo light 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.980
 fundamental 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.070
 in fact, everything in the foreground is illuminated by a grazing light that is not there 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.600
 strong that sculpts volumes making them stand out and highlight the crucial points 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.380
 for example the back and arms of the angel the face the knife d 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.170
 hug 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.860
 the shoulder the vote of sack the muzzle of the ram 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.040
 it is a light that also symbolizes the divine light able to illuminate and not 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.649
 only 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.290
 the forms but also the mind and heart 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.430
 Speaking of symbols also the ram was traditionally considered one 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.260
 metaphor of Christ who offers himself to be sacrificed instead of 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.520
 humanity that in this case represented by isa 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.680
 everything in the picture is painted with a lot of realism, it almost looks like a photograph 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.579
 taken at the climax of the action 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:19.389
 what you see looks like a real and concrete image looks like an image of people 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.819
 in flesh and blood in all their humanity 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.779
 truth generates figurative without any filter as it appears 

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:29.379
 it is one of the typical features of the caravaggio style as you can 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.799
 check from his other eyes 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.989
 the landscape in the background in the representation of a real place not 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.979
 it is the classic ideal landscape that appears in many paintings of the time 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:43.789
 and it is an anomalous choice for caravaggio, as his scenes usually do 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:48.449
 they play an unlimited number of indoors just a little or indoors 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:49.719
 details 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:51.679
 finally a curiosity 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:55.979
 some say that in this painting Caravaggio sent requests for help 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:03:00.539
 in code to his protector that the cardinal de pieri scarpina of the world 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:05.719
 the artist is hiding, he would be hiding because hunted by some 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:07.559
 goons who want to kill him 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:11.389
 in the painting, therefore, isarco represents caravaggio while 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:15.509
 the angel the cardinal belmonte who is asked to intervene to save 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:17.639
 the painter from those who want to kill 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.819
 the angel would also indicate with his finger not the ram but the landscape for 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.349
 the place where the painter hides 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.540
 to me personally this seems an unlikely hypothesis seen 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.640
 Caravaggio was condemned to death and if later in hiding from 1606 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.769
 that is two or three years after the realization of this picture
