 maximum expectation to see the outcome 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.699
 it was not the first sleeve of being 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.779
 three pilots reported the championship with 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:51.229

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.639
 few important changes until the return price 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.189
 the pilot of ktm francesc cucharrera advanced failure of the wto 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.259

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.509
 there is nothing here 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:11.509

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:21.779
 dominic can

 Nestor Jorge Volpi like this 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.960
 first since the start and I would not leave this position until the end 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.529
 of love 

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:31.020

00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:33.550
 try to win the championship that month 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.090
 this made that dominic polish will occupy with relative tranquility the second place 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.009
 throughout the manga 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.800

 the race was clean and with the championship decided no one risked 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.759
 too much and there were hardly any changes of positions during the manga 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.420
 albert roca maintained the fifth position josé porto and the sixth and josé 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.440

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:27.659
 last year to green 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.979
 it is known that the struggle has influenced 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.309

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.759
 from sm1 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:50.449
 Nestor Jorge imposed his law from the beginning demonstrating that it is not accidental that 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:53.770
 be one of the best pilots in the world of supermotard 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.020
 excellent series also for the champion of last season txabi 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.759
 Rodriguez and getting the most out of his sling at the first braking he got 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.839
 sneak into second position after finishing fifth on the grid 

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:07.409

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.720
 Israeli ladder fell to the ground after crashing are consistent with the pilot of 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.199
 suzuki wide of the ocde 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:24.590
 the latter was able to stay on top of the motorcycle but when leaving the track 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.590
 he lost two positions while the ladder became sixth 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.830
 he lost options to crown himself but he did not take advantage of the 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.949
 incident to stand fourth 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:37.559
 while Nestor jorge 12 days and marked the fast lap leading the 

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:38.400
 career 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.150
 chari rodríguez followed second and a very fast tomás ferrer third 

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:45.619
 Israel ladder fell again on the penultimate round 

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:46.789
 and to another position 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:49.969
 but it was already too late for francesc cucharrera that he needed to 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:53.099
 lamp like esquerra and charlie rodríguez to proclaim champion 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:57.830
 In the end the victory went to Nestor Jorge and the Spanish Championship of

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:05.069
