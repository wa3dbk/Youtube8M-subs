a backup engine to go with it it's also
for<00:01:26.890> maneuverability<00:01:27.429> so<00:01:28.170> simply<00:01:29.170> by

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
for maneuverability so simply by

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.850 
for maneuverability so simply by
sticking<00:01:29.799> one<00:01:30.430> motor<00:01:30.670> in<00:01:30.880> Reverse<00:01:31.560> one<00:01:32.560> motor

sticking one motor in Reverse one motor
and<00:01:33.100> forward<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:34.600> can<00:01:34.750> actually<00:01:35.020> spin<00:01:35.259> this

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
and forward we can actually spin this

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.010
