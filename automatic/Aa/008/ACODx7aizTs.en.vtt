00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
something with some wind protection so I

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.200 
something with some wind protection so I
went<00:00:08.820> home<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.980> then<00:00:10.980> little<00:00:11.340> web<00:00:11.610> research

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
went home and then little web research

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.370 
went home and then little web research
and<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.690> found<00:00:14.389> the<00:00:15.619> s1000<00:00:16.619> F<00:00:17.779> it's<00:00:18.779> probably

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
and I found the s1000 F it's probably

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.380 
and I found the s1000 F it's probably
not<00:00:19.500> gonna<00:00:19.619> be<00:00:19.800> called<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.220> F<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.910> production

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
not gonna be called the F in production

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.359 
not gonna be called the F in production
might<00:00:21.539> my<00:00:21.990> bet<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.560> it'll<00:00:22.949> be<00:00:23.070> called<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
might my bet is it'll be called the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.900 
might my bet is it'll be called the
s1000<00:00:24.300> GT<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.619> sport<00:00:26.220> touring<00:00:26.670> bike

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
s1000 GT it is a sport touring bike

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.550 
s1000 GT it is a sport touring bike
built<00:00:27.660> on<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.230> s1000<00:00:29.010> motor<00:00:30.050> my<00:00:31.050> guess<00:00:31.320> is

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
built on the s1000 motor my guess is

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.139 
built on the s1000 motor my guess is
they'll<00:00:31.740> all<00:00:31.859> have<00:00:32.070> also<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.759> tweak<00:00:33.000> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
they'll all have also have to tweak the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.400 
they'll all have also have to tweak the
frame<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.420> think<00:00:33.780> you're<00:00:33.899> gonna<00:00:33.989> want<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.320> be

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
frame I think you're gonna want to be

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.639 
frame I think you're gonna want to be
able<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.710> get<00:00:35.280> more<00:00:35.460> steering<00:00:35.850> angle<00:00:36.630> out<00:00:37.020> of

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
what I would really like is if it was

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.650 
what I would really like is if it was
basically<00:02:34.110> just<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.709> longer<00:02:35.099> travel<00:02:35.660> wind

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
that's really all the bike needs over

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.520 
that's really all the bike needs over
the<00:02:42.780> arm<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:45.420> if<00:02:45.599> that<00:02:46.050> was<00:02:46.230> what<00:02:46.410> we're

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
the arm and if that was what we're

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.490 
the arm and if that was what we're
looking<00:02:46.860> at<00:02:48.050> I'd<00:02:49.050> be<00:02:49.379> in<00:02:49.910> I'd<00:02:50.910> be<00:02:51.180> all<00:02:51.660> down

with<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:54.290> of<00:02:55.290> course<00:02:55.560> there's<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:55.950> devil<00:02:56.250> in

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
with that of course there's a devil in

with that of course there's a devil in
the<00:02:56.430> details<00:02:56.849> here<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.120> course<00:02:57.420> we<00:02:57.780> don't<00:02:57.959> know

the details here of course we don't know

the details here of course we don't know
any<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.560> this<00:02:58.769> stuff<00:02:58.920> about<00:02:59.159> the<00:02:59.459> bike<00:02:59.870> the

any of this stuff about the bike the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.500 
any of this stuff about the bike the
styling<00:03:01.440> looks<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.800> bit<00:03:01.830> Dunsey<00:03:02.700> but<00:03:03.000> we're<00:03:03.180> the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
styling looks a bit Dunsey but we're the

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.110 
styling looks a bit Dunsey but we're the
only<00:03:03.540> thing<00:03:04.200> we<00:03:04.349> have<00:03:04.590> our<00:03:04.950> artist<00:03:05.370> concepts

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
only thing we have our artist concepts

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.559 
only thing we have our artist concepts
which<00:03:06.569> are<00:03:06.750> pretty<00:03:08.150> consider<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.269> be<00:03:09.300> pretty

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
which are pretty consider to be pretty

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.260 
which are pretty consider to be pretty
accurate

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270

fuels<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:15.200> can't<00:03:15.440> judge<00:03:15.740> the<00:03:15.890> styling<00:03:16.340> off

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
fuels you can't judge the styling off

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.210 
fuels you can't judge the styling off
that<00:03:16.700> so<00:03:16.820> it's<00:03:16.940> really<00:03:17.000> hard<00:03:17.330> to<00:03:17.420> say<00:03:17.690> that<00:03:18.220> you

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
that so it's really hard to say that you

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.860 
that so it's really hard to say that you
can<00:03:19.370> expect<00:03:19.790> something<00:03:20.150> like<00:03:20.180> this<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.720> be<00:03:20.750> a

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
can expect something like this to be a

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.810 
can expect something like this to be a
little<00:03:21.140> less<00:03:21.380> aggressively<00:03:22.130> styled<00:03:22.430> at<00:03:22.730> the

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
little less aggressively styled at the

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.670 
little less aggressively styled at the
naked<00:03:23.150> bike<00:03:23.360> unfortunately<00:03:24.230> I<00:03:24.260> love<00:03:24.560> the

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
naked bike unfortunately I love the

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.990 
naked bike unfortunately I love the
styling<00:03:25.130> of<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.310> R<00:03:27.250> so<00:03:28.250> we'll<00:03:28.580> have<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:28.970> see

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
styling of the R so we'll have to see

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.850 
styling of the R so we'll have to see
what<00:03:29.330> it<00:03:29.420> really<00:03:29.630> looks<00:03:29.720> like<00:03:29.990> what<00:03:30.710> it's

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
what it really looks like what it's

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.620 
what it really looks like what it's
really<00:03:31.010> called<00:03:31.130> what<00:03:31.760> it's<00:03:31.880> really<00:03:32.000> expect<00:03:32.450> in

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
really called what it's really expect in

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.480 
really called what it's really expect in
as<00:03:32.930> in<00:03:33.670> production<00:03:35.680> but<00:03:36.680> if<00:03:36.980> all<00:03:37.340> of<00:03:37.460> that

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
as in production but if all of that

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.350 
as in production but if all of that
comes<00:03:37.970> true<00:03:38.590> it<00:03:39.590> could<00:03:39.800> be<00:03:39.980> on<00:03:40.190> my<00:03:40.360> serious

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
comes true it could be on my serious

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.400 
comes true it could be on my serious
wand<00:03:41.750> list<00:03:42.080> now<00:03:42.650> my<00:03:43.100> if<00:03:43.700> I<00:03:43.910> end<00:03:44.240> up<00:03:44.480> taking<00:03:45.140> it

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
wand list now my if I end up taking it

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.380 
wand list now my if I end up taking it
up<00:03:45.530> a<00:03:45.650> notch<00:03:45.680> and<00:03:46.250> that<00:03:46.430> I<00:03:46.460> would<00:03:46.880> be<00:03:46.910> for<00:03:47.360> a

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
up a notch and that I would be for a

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.510 
up a notch and that I would be for a
bike<00:03:47.570> like<00:03:47.780> that<00:03:48.020> won't<00:03:48.800> happen<00:03:49.070> right<00:03:49.370> away

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
bike like that won't happen right away

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.430 
bike like that won't happen right away
so<00:03:49.670> even<00:03:50.180> if<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:50.330> bike<00:03:50.510> comes<00:03:50.750> out<00:03:51.020> before<00:03:51.140> the

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
so even if the bike comes out before the

so even if the bike comes out before the
end<00:03:51.560> of<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:51.740> year<00:03:51.980> I'm<00:03:52.610> probably<00:03:53.090> not<00:03:53.510> a
