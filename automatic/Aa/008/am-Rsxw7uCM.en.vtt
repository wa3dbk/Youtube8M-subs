 interesting archaeological site of the states 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.950

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.140
 defined by modern scientific 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.190
 methods but the fact is that she is very 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.140
 deep 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.330

 texas visitors 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.709
 you can not go down into the cave but in the summer 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.370
 can see more than 3 million volatile

 you didn't just disappear just like that 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.370
 huge hole 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.380
 but which is viewed only with

 the helicopter is not the first karst 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.750
 funnel in guatemala in 2007 there 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.630
 formed a crater like 150 depth

 meters staff geological service 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.160
 can't explain how black came out 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.319
 a hole of the correct shape on the local 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.920
 residents are confident that the cause of the collapse was 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.780
 nearest sewer system of the city 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.880
 ninth in the last three 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.040
 decades in the dry parts constantly 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.989
 diminishing dead sea appeared 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.359
 over three thousand karst craters 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.600
 whereas in 1990 there were 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:38.760
 only 40 crevices become larger 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.980
 and that means the dead sea continues to die 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.620
 its coastline is shrinking by about 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.780
 per meter per year is largely to blame 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.359
 irrational irrigation in relation to 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.639
 the Jordan River feeding the dead sea and 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.160
 over extraction of resources 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.209

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.609
 middle east 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.709
 the less salt water are in the sea 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.079
 so much easier freshwater underground sources 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.730
 dissolve salt and destroy habitual 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.940
 landscape of the dead sea 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.970
 eighth place diamond mining

 The worldâ€™s deposits in Yakutia began in 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:15.479
 1957 Korea has a depth of 525 meters 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.009

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.190
 2009 diamond mining is underway 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.290
 only in the underground mine his world 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.560
 capacity is 1 million tons of ore 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.000
 in the year 2013, the mine produced more than 2 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.240
 million carats of diamonds 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.530
 seventh place in Siberia, scientists find 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.139
 all new giant craters 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.060
 of unknown origin by one of 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.669
 versions deepen formed by explosions 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.229
 methane accumulated underground 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.180
 and on the other as a result of melting 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.130
 underground glaciers due to 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.650
 previously established abnormal heat in 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.720
 the region until scientists discovered 7 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.190
 craters however in their opinion just 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.490
 crater in over 30 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.620
 the sixth place is the Croatian hole this cave 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.979
 located in the southern part of the new zealand 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.289
 on the surface its diameter is 50 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.630
 meters and as diving comes to 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:12.330
 one hundred eighty three meters total 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.990
 Croatian hole depth is 357 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:18.270
 meters since her research in 1959 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.120
 the year the cave remained deepest in 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.699
 New Zealand for many years this place 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.979
 montichello dam known for 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.350
 original design of the spillway 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.130
 in the form of a giant funnel called 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.740
 glory hole 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.900
 set in the middle of the lake Berriess 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.690
 big concrete pipe pogrom's hole 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.789
 which streams of water from 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.800
 it may seem that water is forming 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:43.380
 the giant funnel merges into the most 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.220

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.620
 rain season 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.600
 because the drain is not constant and 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.460
 only when the water level in the world is there and 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.710
 rises high enough 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.199
 there used to be a city at the dam site 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.220
 monticello which flooded and created 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:00.190
 artificial lake berriessa 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.290
 fourth place blue hole dina is 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.410
 deepest not unknown blue 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.330
 the hole on the planet its depth is

 years in the blue hole dina he reached 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.450
 depth of 101 meters 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.980
 becoming the first person to overcome 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:30.640
 depth of 100 meters without using 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.560
 last third place bingham canyon 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.470
 Mining point in the West United States 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.540
 one of the largest quarries in the world where 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.420
 giant copper is being developed 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.660
 open pit deposits of copper 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:46.780
 ore here was first discovered in 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:49.180
 1850 and since 1863 began 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.640
 career development that continues 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.070
 to this day over a career more than a kilometer 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.980
 depth and 4 kilometers wide work 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:07:00.490
 about 1,400 people who daily 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:03.370
 extract about 450 thousand tons of rock 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.860
 second place is another blue hole on 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.870
 bahamas so will sing has big 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.320
 scientific value than blue hole dyne 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:13.060
 this funnel was the site of archaeological 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.979
 excavations that helped scientists change 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.800
 its point of view about what was 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:20.169
 the land about a thousand years ago is interesting 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.320
 that once this dora was dry but 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:24.310
 gradually began to fill with water 

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.800
 remains of birds 

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:29.290
 giant tortoises and crocodiles who 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.360
 sailed here also researchers found 

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.590
 remains of one of the very first inhabitants 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.370
 bahamas 

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:39.010
 which is already about 1050 years first place 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:41.680
 this huge karst funnel in china 

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:44.110
 called heavenly pit formed yet 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.330
 one hundred and twenty eight thousand years ago this 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:49.300
 funnel is the deepest in the world and 

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:51.850
 and the depth is as much as 662 meters 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.050
 due to its huge size it 

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.840
 is a favorite place 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:58.120
 extreme skydiving at the bottom 

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.820
