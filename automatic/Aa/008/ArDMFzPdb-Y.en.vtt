00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 there we are at peter real there is 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.980
 the vegetables are fast and never mind 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.250
 is super simple about heavy with the 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.210
 Ingredients rice waffles or two big ones 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.190
 Onions 40 grams of tomatoes and 300 bis 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.650
 400 milliliters of water are already water 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:34.680
 because we no longer need one 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:39.210
 Real and it starts in ours 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.840
 size as I said two small sievert 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.350
 or how far that is all that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.350
 go fast 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.920
 rank 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.010
 in all big has recovered again 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.820
 from my 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:29.770
 experience with a tail is currently cheap 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:38.010
 is actually so bad that 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:40.590
 She's so healthy that we'll see you next time 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.420
 that we might be there next 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.970
 her so i'm going to take a simple in now 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.010
 Three to four liters of water take first 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.830
 know less that is muddy 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.850
 if I'm wrong somehow 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.590
 Of course it would be nice again 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.240
 dry had so much time still has a 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:04.360
 Some skate free at 310 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:10.600
 but potato mash and then stood 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:13.410
 I always do that until the relatively way 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.410
 it looks the moment 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.940
 with the onion right through 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.360
 a bit out but that must be fast 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.370
 go 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.710
 as I said tomatenmark the sudden 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.380
 frame or 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.900
 just a little bit on emotions 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.170
 are just a bit tight short 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.170
 Life 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.270
 the onions are just behind now 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:45.030
 Sleeping bag was used 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:48.120
 with the partner red color easy 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.660
 even more tomatoes vegas the mud 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.400
 Pampe Now maybe tell me another 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.400
 a little bit already know 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:06.670
 make a decent movie but we will 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:13.990
 The apache properly as a soldier 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:23.290
 still taste a few 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:25.710
 rice waffles crumbles best there 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.710
 the number 1 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:38.400
 and then you can do it powerfully afterwards 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.400
 With 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.860
 a little bit, this format will be fine 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.930
 I like that more often because 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.060
 they are just very simple things 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.500
 also for vegan vegetarians too 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.330
 very normal people super interesting 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.220
 are also super fast and go 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.160
 gastro man for example in any case 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.430
 easy times that a two weeks determined 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:04.209
 hold and taste due to smear 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.220
 Of course you can get a little info 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.870
 Eat directly and if you like it in the evening 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.670
 makes overnight in the refrigerator are 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.380
 that tastes even better off 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.019
 it will only lubricate the whole 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.209
 taken but when is a roll 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:19.389
 anywhere he tastes great 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.370
 also tried and will say we say 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.370
 it's done it mostly whole lot 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.430
 a victory in any case still has to 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:35.520
 how pretty dangerous on goal 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:37.630
 finished writing off 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.310
 the sorry that can definitely be 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.860
 bit of tomato still tolerated 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.169
 she does not have one like that 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.450
 he could be overjoyed and onions 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.010
 one still definitely needs one 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.690
 Looks pretty much the onions here 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.979
 you can actually see the cat 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.039
 not if they were weapons now 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:56.200
 not as has been very meaty and 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.639
 mettwurst similar consistency one can 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.870
 Now almost say like that said 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.310
 you can do that with colors 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.470
 Just remember it a bit 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.680
 like tomatenmark tried the whole thing 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.680
 first time 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.870
 I'm good at playing 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.460
 important banks lay overnight and 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.560
 then from the next day with mettwurst 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.180
 and can be in a long conversation 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.130
 it surprises me with surprise 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.320
 maybe if you bock is from lopar 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.080
 Of course, say about therapies and worries 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.430
 but otherwise super super easy 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:36.670
 You will do this until next week 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.670
 appears again 100 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.610
 that on 24 9 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.750
 OK
