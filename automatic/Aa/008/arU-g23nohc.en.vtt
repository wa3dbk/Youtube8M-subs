00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.090
 Hello guys 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.190
 in this video we will demonstrate how 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.309
 set the pump to run 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.619
 solar heating at dose md.x 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.930
 first hold the p key 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.480
 pressed for eight seconds 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.840
 the code word code will appear in the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.060
 through the increment keys 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.990
 and increment up arrow and arrow 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.599
 down 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.649
 set the value 162 and press 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.500
 again on the display will appear for 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.290
 configuration and b1 is what is the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.590
 heating parameter 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.239
 we typed pop100 one that is the first 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.399
 parameter is where you set the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.530
 temperature difference between the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.300
 sensor and reservoir sensor 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.030
 to start the pump 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.559
 we will leave in 10 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.730
 put the desired value by 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.949
 arrows and press pb10 2 is the differential 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.989
 temperature between the collector sensor 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.770
 and the pump shut-off reservoir 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.810
 for example we will put 5 or 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.850
 when the temperature difference between 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.040
 the collector and reservoir sensor 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.040
 reach 10 degrees celsius which was the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.740
 value stipulated at 101 the pump will 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.280
 call when the difference dropped to 5 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.119
 degrees to 102 from the pump will 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.829
 off 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.259
 simple as well and to advance p1 03 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.360
 it's the freezing temperature 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.420
 when the collector is at temperature 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.729
 here placed in the case five degrees 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.720
 the pump switches on to circulate the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.640
 prevent freezing the p1 04 is 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.340
 the minimum time for pump activation 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.259
 freezing or when 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.570
 there is a favorable situation for the 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.820
 antifreeze and this will be the time in 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.409
 minutes the pump will turn on for 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.479
 make the water exchange 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.840
 select the desired time and press p 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.390
 op 10 5 is the temperature of 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.670
 to switch off the pump 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.320
 this parameter was implemented for the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.940
 population protection 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.250
 when the water reaches the value here 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.060
 configured the pump is switched off to 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.430
 avoid water circulates through 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.690
 years and the deterioration and function of 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.830
 temperature 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.870
 the snp to go ahead and 106 is the 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.260
 the overheating temperature of the 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.030
 sensor t2 the reservoir temperature 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.610
 thus reaching the value 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.830
 programmed in this parameter the pump 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.540
 disconnected by ceasing water circulation 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:40.150
 and avoiding thermal discomfort and 10 7 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.730
 is the parameter to enable or disable the 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.310
 differential temperature control in 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.370
 zero the control is disabled in a 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.400
 which is the factory-set value has 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.709
 108 is the parameter for enabling or 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.750
 disable sensor 3 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.910
 the auxiliary sensor, remembering that this 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.459
 must always be connected 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.430
 power 10 sensor is disabled 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.790
 in one which is the factory value of 13 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.010
 is enabled and the p1 10 name 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.590
 our last parameter to lose only one 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.630
 non-preferential indicator or here 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.709
 chosen temperature that will be displayed 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.660
 on the display 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.880
 this Bahia will only be available if the 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:23.200
 differential control is enabled 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:26.769
 of p170 the displayed temperature will be 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.590
 t1 of the solar collectors in 1 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.650
 the temperature is t2 that is the 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.690
 thermal reservoir in two of three 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.109
 will be the selected displays on the temperature 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.769
 to assist in the demarcation with the 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.340
 temperature difference between t1 and t2 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.220
 typing p 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.780
 we closed the p1 setting if you 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.750
 already set everything you wanted 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.799
 scroll through the menu to the word in you and 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.170
 tag p 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.970
 the other parameters will be applied in the 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.680
 next videos 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.180
 that is why all the 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.920
 information can also be found 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.319
 in the product manual 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.700
