video<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.290> tell<00:00:46.410> i<00:00:46.470> made<00:00:46.830> the<00:00:46.980> map

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
video is you can tell i made the map

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.190 
video is you can tell i made the map
much<00:00:47.670> wider<00:00:48.060> i<00:00:48.360> increase<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.900> distance

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
much wider i increase the distance

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.600 
much wider i increase the distance
between<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.800> two<00:00:49.830> lanes<00:00:51.020> 299<00:00:52.020> chunks

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
between the two lanes 299 chunks

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.020 
between the two lanes 299 chunks
approximately<00:00:53.990> it<00:00:54.990> it<00:00:55.650> doesn't<00:00:56.340> quite<00:00:56.490> look

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
approximately it it doesn't quite look

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.020 
approximately it it doesn't quite look
as<00:00:57.210> aesthetically<00:00:57.900> a<00:00:58.020> pleasing<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.740> me<00:00:58.860> i<00:00:59.070> like

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
as aesthetically a pleasing to me i like

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.440 
as aesthetically a pleasing to me i like
the<00:01:00.270> idea<00:01:00.450> of<00:01:00.960> how<00:01:01.260> close<00:01:01.680> they<00:01:01.860> were<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
the idea of how close they were in the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.119 
the idea of how close they were in the
rail<00:01:03.450> line<00:01:03.480> going<00:01:03.900> under<00:01:04.019> with<00:01:04.589> making<00:01:05.009> that

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
rail line going under with making that

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.429 
rail line going under with making that
tunnel<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:06.210> that's<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:06.720> visual<00:01:07.170> stuff

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
tunnel but that's just visual stuff

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.849 
tunnel but that's just visual stuff
hopefully<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.070> gameplay<00:01:08.490> will<00:01:08.640> be<00:01:08.759> smoother

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:09.859 
hopefully the gameplay will be smoother

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:12.469 
hopefully the gameplay will be smoother
unfortunately<00:01:10.859> SMP<00:01:11.399> is<00:01:11.579> still<00:01:11.820> buggy<00:01:11.999> nothing

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
unfortunately SMP is still buggy nothing

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.660 
unfortunately SMP is still buggy nothing
I<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.749> do<00:01:12.840> about<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.280> but<00:01:14.280> I've<00:01:14.579> been

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
I can do about that but I've been

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.919 
I can do about that but I've been
working<00:01:14.969> on<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.179> map<00:01:15.390> for<00:01:15.630> months<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:15.929 
working on this map for months and

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:20.749 
working on this map for months and
months<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:18.140> I<00:01:19.140> may<00:01:19.859> make<00:01:20.039> a<00:01:20.100> few<00:01:20.399> additional

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
months and I may make a few additional

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.819 
months and I may make a few additional
tweaks<00:01:21.060> if<00:01:21.270> anything<00:01:21.630> comes<00:01:21.780> up<00:01:22.049> but<00:01:22.649> at<00:01:22.740> this

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
tweaks if anything comes up but at this

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.099 
tweaks if anything comes up but at this
point<00:01:23.069> that<00:01:23.359> everyone<00:01:24.359> who<00:01:24.569> plays<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.960> game

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:25.109 
point that everyone who plays the game

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:27.380 
point that everyone who plays the game
is<00:01:25.289> officially<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.770> beta<00:01:26.039> tester<00:01:26.490> or<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.700> or<00:01:27.030> a

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
to see how a wide range of people play

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.029 
to see how a wide range of people play
the<00:01:46.829> map<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:48.049> eventually<00:01:49.049> down<00:01:49.319> the<00:01:49.499> line<00:01:49.740> and

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
the map and eventually down the line and

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:51.410 
the map and eventually down the line and
I'm<00:01:50.219> saying<00:01:50.459> down<00:01:50.639> the<00:01:50.759> line<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:50.939> really<00:01:51.240> mean

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
I'm saying down the line I really mean

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.449 
I'm saying down the line I really mean
it<00:01:51.569> I<00:01:51.719> will<00:01:52.409> probably<00:01:52.829> make<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.009> second<00:01:53.429> one

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
it I will probably make a second one

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:59.390 
it I will probably make a second one
called<00:01:53.909> fun<00:01:54.270> with<00:01:54.479> dispensers<00:01:55.429> and<00:01:56.429> rain

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.040 

let's<00:02:00.000> see<00:02:00.150> at<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.330> point<00:02:00.600> I'm<00:02:00.750> going<00:02:00.870> to<00:02:00.960> do

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
let's see at this point I'm going to do

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.920 
let's see at this point I'm going to do
a<00:02:01.080> few<00:02:01.320> tutorials<00:02:01.530> on<00:02:02.220> some<00:02:02.580> some<00:02:03.330> stuff<00:02:03.720> I

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
a few tutorials on some some stuff I

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.800 
a few tutorials on some some stuff I
have<00:02:04.110> ideas<00:02:04.530> for<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.420> after<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.540> I'm<00:02:06.690> not

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
have ideas for and after that I'm not

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.430 
have ideas for and after that I'm not
sure<00:02:07.850> globul<00:02:08.850> number<00:02:09.210> two<00:02:09.540> has<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> lot<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.140> work

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
sure globul number two has a lot of work

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.190 
sure globul number two has a lot of work
put<00:02:10.860> into<00:02:11.040> it<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.490> it<00:02:11.730> probably<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.510> fairly

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
put into it and it probably is fairly

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.840 
put into it and it probably is fairly
close<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.770> release<00:02:14.010> within<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.430> next<00:02:14.550> week<00:02:14.730> or

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
close to release within the next week or

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.820 
close to release within the next week or
two<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.920> that's<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.250> have<00:02:17.790> fun<00:02:18.030> enjoy<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.480> map
