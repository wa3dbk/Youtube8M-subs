00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:16.000
 Hmm 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:17.110
 If you saw the last of the lessons of hair b is 1 is the underground Hello underground anxiety is your 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.830
 As is proposed 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:25.000
 I know I went to a wedding in Hawaii on the weekend 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:29.380
 Although the wedding it was a well of American wedding style 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.900
 I want to do a little cultural lesson today . 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.650
 Japanese style 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:39.530
 Because of the wedding and of Meri stock wedding also various different Toka week in completely different to about it 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:46.010
 I want to talk a little 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:50.839
 I have not been to the wedding so much, but this time is the fourth time 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:56.420
 After all, about three in the American American wedding and only one of them 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:59.520
 I went to a Japanese-style wedding at that company's synchronized wedding . 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.130
 Hey it's an American wedding 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.010
 Ah ah ah 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:14.410
 A culture called "prize mail" of that big different mouse right now is also popular in Japan recently 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:20.120
 I just use it, but some of my bride's friends gather and I just watch the wedding ceremony 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:25.010
 Some people in the form of actually participating in the fluorescent color rather than just select it nowadays 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:32.150
 If you look closely at the magazine or maybe you will wear the same dress with everyone in the bridesmaid dress or something 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:35.820
 The new Roman side is also on the bride's side and the friends who are good friends gather and actually get married 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:41.130
 In the form of participating together 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.080
 There is an old tradition, but such a wedding I went to the weekend 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.840
 The name is Blythe 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:53.580
 A person who says that even if there are 4 people in the prize-made, there is no e-mail among them 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.960
 It is when you can I Well quite the father is to be best friend Te outside 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.060
 In Oh's 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.780
 The male side 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:06.490
 Even among men's friends 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:13.690
 And some people say Weiss light and dark it is also its father Gaano 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:20.590
 For the groom side of the two people Toka is chosen by friends to 2 people that get married and between speech 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:21.770
 When a couple of people in the old days feel like this about the father in the name of a fat name rubber ne on the bride side 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.260
 I mean the story Tsu Corde 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:30.900
 Bake a bird and Beth's name on the groom's side is also a little about the splendor of s 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:35.819
 Tell the story, each will give a speech 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:39.810
 It's do things that did not see me in the cherry tree ending of Japan of Japanese style is quite probably in Japan 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:43.090
 But in the United States we have been doing tradition as a tradition 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:49.599
 Another thing that was interesting was that 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:53.440
 A little number of stages but I have a dance the father is the father himself of professional itself and your father 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:56.500
 Oh and I seem to dance with the groom side mother 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:04.000
 Last dance 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:05.620
 Before you let your daughter-in-law go to your daughter's wife, let 's say a scene where you dance with two people 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.310
 It's not like Japan 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:13.570
 Tradition also I'd was pretty interesting because many there 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:16.490
 After the was a little fun in this is always not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not based Noto 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.940
 There is a number but the next person to marry 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:26.590
 Bouquet and number to decide 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:30.310
 Anochotto usually white Nice wedding to drop everyone humanities facing the bride's is behind 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:35.170
 Women who took part in are receiving it but it is not so 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.220
 Museuko that I did in that chair taking game The other chair taking game is Museuko healing 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.960
 I will say 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:43.880
 Music Yosuke one than Well number of people 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:49.910
 In When the accumulated music if there is a chair who did not sit everyone sitting that Tteyuu out 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:51.020
 There was no one left who said that I squeezed in and out, but now the people are in the air 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:56.720
 Say to get 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:58.950
 It was great fun at a certain playful wedding that I played games 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.580
 After all I really got married 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.520
 Man 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:08.830
 I am Japanese who is a Seattle related child but I have been in the US for a long time and the other party is 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.680
 Because some people also were much better in the United States grew up 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:15.109
 Already 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:21.049
 Well I have quite kiss also much to in Risepushon of wedding char front of the parent 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:23.360
 Since that he was doing with pretty infix intraoperative Oh fixed felt No it is not well seen too much in Japan 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:29.670
 It is said that its openness 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:32.880
 The family is ok at all so it 's not just the wedding 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:38.460
 I see a little culture and it's amazing how 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:44.500
 Wow say What is that feeling of life Toka What atmosphere is me what kind of culture of the 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:51.130
 Oh also Naa a good opportunity to look because I think about wedding 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:52.450
 When I get married, I really think about which style I am ahead 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.610
 I do not have 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:05:03.150
 Oh, I thought it would be better to introduce the best part 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.470
 The big difference is Dattari 30,000 yen have a celebration that it is the Japan if even one that 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.470
 that 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:12.410
 The participant is quite fine already 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:18.260
 There is a way to give money after the ace, but in the United States there is no evasion principle 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:23.460
 Because there is a present without that position, it is a department store as how to give the present 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:28.259
 Check out everything you want the bride and groom to go to the department store 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:32.280
 I say "Red Produce Tea", but with asp this time, for example, to a new place 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:35.759
 I'd say anything or was a thing Mick Sir now oven or needed when you lived 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:40.740
 Check the tableware and so on 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:43.480
 Tteyuu we made here of the department store delle jst logistic to join you 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:48.130
 The contact came to the participants 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.640
 I went to the net online shop I'd watch a total of I a Sudo proposal now Asakki net 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:54.010
 The 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:06:00.129
 If you enter the name of the bride and groom , you will find the products registered by the two in a row. 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:06:07.089
 Automatically Oh there decided had decided I Is that what you buy is also 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:12.560
 It is a form that will be sent to the bride and groom the day after, so it is a feeling that only marriage will really go hand in hand 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:18.770
 There is no loneliness, and it is said that it is borne by my father in the first place 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:22.790
 tradition More and more, the bride's side bears the wedding expenses 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:28.580
 I used to say that I do 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:32.580
 Because it also changed habits or have also changed culture even the bride and groom which way that 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:36.969
 There are no hard rules in particular because they are together 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:42.339
 Fear is still a big difference from Japan 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:47.709
 Anyway Losing This week is a great fun event for both of them 

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:51.339
 It was a wonderful day and I enjoyed that part of it and I enjoyed it very much 

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:56.240
 So today is a cultural lesson rather than English 

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:59.599
 Because I think that there are many people who are conscious of marriage fairly around Nanto city too 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:07.060
 That I was a little to the story 

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:12.270
 Play 2 way Junko 2 behavior file is named army j 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:12.270

 So I really congratulated both of you in the next lesson 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.490
 Hmm 

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.409

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.409
 Hmm 

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:30.409

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.190
