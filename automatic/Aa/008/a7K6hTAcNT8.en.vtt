sewing the edges in order to do this you

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.600 
sewing the edges in order to do this you
must<00:02:12.930> fold<00:02:13.260> your<00:02:13.530> knitting<00:02:13.860> in<00:02:14.010> half<00:02:14.220> so<00:02:14.580> that

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
must fold your knitting in half so that

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.030 
must fold your knitting in half so that
your<00:02:14.820> longer<00:02:15.180> side<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.510> knitting<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:16.040> folded

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
your longer side of knitting is folded

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.640 
your longer side of knitting is folded
in<00:02:17.250> half<00:02:17.730> make<00:02:18.660> sure<00:02:18.900> when<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.200> fold<00:02:19.470> your

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
in half make sure when you fold your

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.230 
in half make sure when you fold your
knitting<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.130> knot<00:02:20.340> pattern<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:20.940> on<00:02:20.970> the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
knitting the knot pattern is on the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.750 
knitting the knot pattern is on the
outside<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.050> braid<00:02:22.290> pattern<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.830> in<00:02:23.100> the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
outside and the braid pattern is in the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.090 
outside and the braid pattern is in the
inside<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.810> when<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:24.990> flip<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.320> hat<00:02:25.680> inside

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
inside so when you flip the hat inside

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.740 
inside so when you flip the hat inside
out<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.490> will<00:02:26.670> get<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.970> nice<00:02:27.120> braid<00:02:27.510> pattern

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
out you will get the nice braid pattern

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.650 
out you will get the nice braid pattern
on<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.200> outside<00:02:28.670> next<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:30.030> have<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.240> sew

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
on the outside next you have to sew

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.870 
on the outside next you have to sew
together<00:02:30.900> all<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.560> edges<00:02:31.980> but<00:02:32.250> one<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.670> these

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
together all the edges but one of these

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.570 
together all the edges but one of these
shortest<00:02:33.420> sides<00:02:33.660> which<00:02:34.500> will<00:02:34.709> be<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.100> opening

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
shortest sides which will be the opening

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.630 
shortest sides which will be the opening
where<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.090> baby<00:02:36.480> head<00:02:36.690> goes<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.640> your

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
where the baby head goes in your

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.730 
where the baby head goes in your
knitting<00:02:39.030> should<00:02:39.270> look<00:02:39.450> like<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:40.020> paper<00:02:40.530> sack

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
knitting should look like a paper sack

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.479 
knitting should look like a paper sack
now<00:02:41.690> opposite<00:02:42.690> from<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.440> open<00:02:43.920> side<00:02:44.130> take<00:02:44.459> the

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
now opposite from the open side take the

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.550 
now opposite from the open side take the
two<00:02:44.820> edges<00:02:45.300> of<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.660> hat<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.110> sew<00:02:46.380> them

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
two edges of the hat and sew them

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.560 
two edges of the hat and sew them
together<00:02:46.739> so<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.519> they<00:02:47.670> form<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.060> loop<00:02:48.300> and

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
together so that they form a loop and

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.470 
together so that they form a loop and
pull<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.500> string<00:02:49.800> tight<00:02:50.070> so<00:02:50.519> what<00:02:50.790> won't<00:02:51.209> come

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
pull the string tight so what won't come

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.259 
pull the string tight so what won't come
out<00:02:51.690> then<00:02:52.560> tie<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.890> knot<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.400> cut<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.820> excess

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
out then tie a knot and cut the excess

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.750 
out then tie a knot and cut the excess
string<00:02:54.680> finally<00:02:55.680> now<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:55.950> need<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.370> turn<00:02:56.550> the

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
string finally now you need to turn the

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.120 
string finally now you need to turn the
hat<00:02:56.910> inside<00:02:57.330> out<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:58.080> if<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.440> want<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.920> you

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
hat inside out and if you want to you

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.250 
hat inside out and if you want to you
can<00:02:59.370> fold<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.760> bottom<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.420> hat<00:03:00.600> isn't<00:03:01.080> too

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
can fold the bottom so the hat isn't too

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.670 
can fold the bottom so the hat isn't too
long

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.380 

if<00:03:08.680> you<00:03:09.490> want<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.790> add<00:03:10.000> some<00:03:10.240> extra

if you want to add some extra
decorations<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.560> Hat<00:03:11.860> you<00:03:12.070> definitely

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
decorations to the Hat you definitely

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.550 
decorations to the Hat you definitely
could<00:03:12.850> do<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.270> by<00:03:13.450> using<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.960> tape<00:03:14.170> history

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
could do so by using the tape history

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.160 
could do so by using the tape history
needle<00:03:14.860> I<00:03:15.040> use<00:03:15.400> some<00:03:15.940> crocheted<00:03:16.390> flowers<00:03:16.900> and

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170
