camera but I will in just a second it's
not<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:58.950> tint<00:02:59.370> in<00:02:59.610> look<00:02:59.850> it's<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.150> it's<00:03:00.420> not<00:03:00.540> a

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
not a tint in look it's a it's not a

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.960

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.590 
privacy glass I think is what they call
it<00:03:08.100> so<00:03:08.220> it's<00:03:08.370> difficult<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:09.030> see<00:03:09.239> in<00:03:09.360> it's
