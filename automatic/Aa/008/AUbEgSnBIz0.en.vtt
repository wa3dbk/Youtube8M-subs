like to drill a tooth on a real patient
you've<00:00:43.910> then<00:00:44.060> got<00:00:44.270> a<00:00:44.329> virtual<00:00:44.840> reality<00:00:45.230> campus

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
you've then got a virtual reality campus

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.979 
you've then got a virtual reality campus
which<00:00:46.340> tracks<00:00:46.700> where<00:00:47.060> the<00:00:47.090> handpiece<00:00:47.570> is<00:00:47.630> in

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.850 
45 thousand pound image and these ones
were<00:01:01.730> designed<00:01:02.239> so<00:01:02.600> that<00:01:02.630> the<00:01:02.870> students<00:01:03.320> could

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
were designed so that the students could

were designed so that the students could
try<00:01:04.159> out<00:01:04.370> things<00:01:04.580> over<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:05.089> over<00:01:05.180> again

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
try out things over and over again

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.350 
try out things over and over again
these<00:01:06.530> students<00:01:07.310> have<00:01:07.430> got<00:01:07.580> to<00:01:07.700> be<00:01:07.790> safer<00:01:08.270> to

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
these students have got to be safer to

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.510 
these students have got to be safer to
practice<00:01:08.900> in<00:01:09.140> about<00:01:09.470> 18<00:01:09.860> months<00:01:10.250> time

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
practice in about 18 months time

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.149 
practice in about 18 months time
dentists<00:01:11.450> do<00:01:11.600> make<00:01:11.840> mistakes<00:01:12.020> they<00:01:12.740> can<00:01:12.890> drill

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
dentists do make mistakes they can drill

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.460 
dentists do make mistakes they can drill
too<00:01:13.400> far<00:01:13.670> inch<00:01:13.880> up<00:01:14.060> to<00:01:14.270> they<00:01:14.720> can<00:01:14.930> remove<00:01:15.229> too

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
too far inch up to they can remove too

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.859 
too far inch up to they can remove too
much<00:01:15.500> healthy<00:01:16.100> teeth<00:01:16.400> even<00:01:17.180> after<00:01:17.540> years<00:01:17.720> of

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
much healthy teeth even after years of

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.260 
much healthy teeth even after years of
training<00:01:18.170> here<00:01:18.890> it<00:01:19.250> tells<00:01:19.549> them<00:01:19.790> in<00:01:19.940> the<00:01:20.060> very

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
training here it tells them in the very

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.780 
training here it tells them in the very
first<00:01:20.570> year<00:01:20.690> how<00:01:21.560> much<00:01:21.799> healthy<00:01:22.250> to<00:01:22.490> favor

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
first year how much healthy to favor

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.850 
first year how much healthy to favor
removed<00:01:23.180> how<00:01:23.510> much<00:01:23.690> decayed<00:01:24.110> material<00:01:24.710> they

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
removed how much decayed material they

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.550 
removed how much decayed material they
are<00:01:25.100> so<00:01:25.729> they<00:01:25.940> can<00:01:25.970> get<00:01:26.330> a<00:01:26.510> much<00:01:26.780> higher<00:01:27.080> level

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
are so they can get a much higher level

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.740 
are so they can get a much higher level
of<00:01:27.619> perfection<00:01:27.950> in<00:01:28.250> their<00:01:28.400> first<00:01:28.610> year<00:01:28.880> when

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
of perfection in their first year when

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.090 
of perfection in their first year when

you do your first filling on your on
your<00:01:31.130> first<00:01:31.430> patient<00:01:31.700> it<00:01:31.939> does<00:01:32.060> make<00:01:32.210> you<00:01:32.330> very

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
your first patient it does make you very

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.480 
your first patient it does make you very
very<00:01:32.630> aware<00:01:33.110> of<00:01:33.409> what<00:01:33.770> you're<00:01:33.920> looking<00:01:34.130> for

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
this in dentistry

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.899 
this in dentistry
we've<00:01:40.950> developed<00:01:41.950> ways<00:01:42.159> that<00:01:42.700> can<00:01:42.880> be

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
we've developed ways that can be

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.179 
we've developed ways that can be
translated<00:01:43.479> into<00:01:43.840> others<00:01:44.350> disciplines<00:01:45.040> like

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
translated into others disciplines like

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.240 
translated into others disciplines like

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
stroke victims for example you could

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.289 
stroke victims for example you could
change<00:01:50.710> this<00:01:50.920> device<00:01:51.280> so<00:01:51.549> that<00:01:51.729> people<00:01:52.060> could

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
change this device so that people could
