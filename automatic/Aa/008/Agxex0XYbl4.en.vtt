however<00:01:23.290> when<00:01:23.470> I<00:01:23.500> finished<00:01:23.890> those<00:01:24.070> studies<00:01:24.490> I

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
however when I finished those studies I

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.730 
however when I finished those studies I
came<00:01:24.880> out<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.240> Alberta<00:01:25.600> and<00:01:25.869> I<00:01:26.409> started

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
came out to Alberta and I started

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.530 
came out to Alberta and I started

and<00:01:28.810> that<00:01:29.259> was<00:01:29.380> really<00:01:29.530> interesting<00:01:30.280> because

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
and that was really interesting because

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.149 
and that was really interesting because
there<00:01:30.940> was<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.270> switch<00:01:31.600> between<00:01:32.009> coming<00:01:33.009> from

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
there was the switch between coming from

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.820 
there was the switch between coming from
pure<00:01:33.460> science<00:01:33.940> to<00:01:34.149> applied<00:01:34.509> science<00:01:35.080> to<00:01:35.440> using

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
pure science to applied science to using

pure science to applied science to using
it<00:01:35.979> in<00:01:36.220> industry<00:01:36.759> and<00:01:37.000> that<00:01:37.660> was<00:01:37.810> neat<00:01:38.020> but<00:01:38.289> I

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
it in industry and that was neat but I

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.900 
it in industry and that was neat but I
wanted<00:01:38.649> to<00:01:38.800> switch<00:01:39.009> to<00:01:39.220> government<00:01:39.670> and<00:01:39.789> work

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.010 
science that it comes naturally and
going<00:02:08.399> out<00:02:08.550> into<00:02:08.820> the<00:02:09.240> workforce<00:02:09.539> I've

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
going out into the workforce I've

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.720 
going out into the workforce I've
realized<00:02:10.410> that's<00:02:10.560> not<00:02:10.740> something<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.520> comes

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
realized that's not something that comes

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.360 
realized that's not something that comes
naturally<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.570> lot<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.900> people<00:02:13.320> so<00:02:14.070> that's<00:02:14.250> a

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
naturally to a lot of people so that's a

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.170 
naturally to a lot of people so that's a
great<00:02:14.610> skill<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.030> bring<00:02:15.709> in<00:02:16.709> in<00:02:17.610> my<00:02:17.820> work<00:02:18.000> we

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
great skill to bring in in my work we

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.330 
great skill to bring in in my work we
call<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.450> systems<00:02:18.900> thinking<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.709> we're<00:02:20.220> not

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
call it systems thinking of we're not

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.920 
call it systems thinking of we're not
only<00:02:20.640> thinking<00:02:21.030> about<00:02:21.270> this<00:02:21.390> one<00:02:21.630> problem

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
only thinking about this one problem

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.290 
only thinking about this one problem
that<00:02:22.230> we're<00:02:22.350> talking<00:02:22.500> about<00:02:22.770> today<00:02:23.300> it's

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
that we're talking about today it's

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.390 
that we're talking about today it's
impacted<00:02:25.050> by<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.470> impacting<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:26.370> many

impacted by and impacting so many

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.550 
impacted by and impacting so many
different<00:02:27.090> things<00:02:27.300> out<00:02:27.450> there<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.900> if<00:02:28.350> we're

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
different things out there and if we're

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.410 
different things out there and if we're
going<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:28.830> as<00:02:29.190> government<00:02:29.730> for<00:02:29.910> example<00:02:30.000> where

I'm<00:02:30.480> working<00:02:30.690> make<00:02:31.350> good<00:02:31.590> policy<00:02:31.830> we<00:02:32.640> need<00:02:32.790> to

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
I'm working make good policy we need to

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.030 
I'm working make good policy we need to
have<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.180> skill<00:02:33.630> so<00:02:34.200> when<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.530> walk<00:02:34.739> into<00:02:34.920> a

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
have that skill so when you walk into a

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.280 
have that skill so when you walk into a
job<00:02:35.310> interview<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.940> science<00:02:36.300> degree<00:02:36.450> that's

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
job interview of a science degree that's

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.750 
job interview of a science degree that's
a<00:02:37.410> skill<00:02:37.709> that<00:02:37.739> you're<00:02:37.980> bringing<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.459> you're

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
a skill that you're bringing that you're

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.580 
a skill that you're bringing that you're
not<00:02:38.910> even<00:02:39.239> thinking<00:02:39.600> about<00:02:39.720> normally<00:02:40.350> and

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
not even thinking about normally and

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.250 
not even thinking about normally and
I'll<00:02:41.070> something<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.880> remember<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.660> another

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
I'll something to remember and another

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.530 
I'll something to remember and another
thing<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.770> that<00:02:43.950> scientists<00:02:44.700> are<00:02:45.030> trained<00:02:45.300> to

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
thing is that scientists are trained to

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.990 
thing is that scientists are trained to
be<00:02:45.660> very<00:02:45.900> detailed<00:02:46.530> oriented<00:02:47.000> oriented

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
be very detailed oriented oriented

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.740 
be very detailed oriented oriented
people<00:02:48.560> who<00:02:49.560> understand<00:02:50.040> process<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.690> you

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
people who understand process and so you

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.229 
people who understand process and so you
could<00:02:52.410> go<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:53.010> job<00:02:53.310> interview<00:02:53.489> saying<00:02:54.000> I

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
could go to a job interview saying I

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.120 
could go to a job interview saying I
know<00:02:54.299> how<00:02:54.600> to<00:02:54.660> do<00:02:54.870> scientific<00:02:55.230> experiments

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
know how to do scientific experiments

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.670 
know how to do scientific experiments
that<00:02:56.910> may<00:02:57.060> not<00:02:57.239> be<00:02:57.420> very<00:02:57.570> helpful<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:58.049> employer

know how to work through a complex

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.590 
know how to work through a complex
problem<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.739> come<00:03:05.070> up<00:03:05.190> with<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.430> solution<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:06.150> I

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
problem to come up with a solution and I

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.300 
problem to come up with a solution and I
have<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.019> grit<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.410> stick<00:03:07.680> with<00:03:07.830> it<00:03:07.860> until<00:03:08.070> I

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
have the grit to stick with it until I

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.400 
have the grit to stick with it until I
walk<00:03:08.610> out<00:03:08.790> with<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.060> solution<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:09.870> something

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
walk out with a solution is something

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.520 
walk out with a solution is something
that's<00:03:10.560> very<00:03:10.620> valuable

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.670
