00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:09.120
 let's see how we system 10 10 cfs ei 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:13.099
 its thickeners are important for the 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.099
 construction of a new deck 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.640
 the artisan accepts the new techniques 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:25.259
 after it has proven its effectiveness 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.840
 ascertained the reliability of the work in the 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:31.430
 time to employees and implemented 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.260
 with their own mastery continuously 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.450
 we integrate the technology provided by 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.750
 houses with the experience made by 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.079
 shipyards shipyards and garages because the 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.449
 goal set is largely 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:49.190
 passed and become a starting point for 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.190
 a similar job next 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.440
 the old blanket is impregnated with 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.860
 the tech strips first with the resin 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.860
 fluid 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.110
 then on the blanket with cfs lightly 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.899
 thickened to fill all the spaces 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.979
 not perfectly collimating and filling 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.979
 the screw heads 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.400
 it is important to observe how the nobles 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.020
 stars go to fall in the middle of the 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.020
 old rubber comment 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.500
 the cfs is all the more reliable because 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.500
 also paste the rubber part 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.250
 another alternating cfs is prepared 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.250
 always pumping 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.580
 the strips are pressed laterally 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.790
 by means of a small wedge and dal 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.470
 above with a small wood nailed to 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.470
 knight of the comment 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.280
 the pressure required for the cfs 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:30.130
 I make an exceptional grip and a lot 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:34.210
 low and sufficient that the parts remain 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.750
 in substance we will be able to put them to 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.750
 knight 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.160
 albeit thickened the cfs easily for 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.920
 the time required for implementation is skillful 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.360
 of the blanket exceeds in summer 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.360
 broadly two hours 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.640
 with winter temperatures is 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.010
 the use of the catalyst is advisable 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.570
 fast that has the usual cost e 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.570
 decreases processing times 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.770
 this is the gumming one of the phases 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.840
 and it is important that the skirt keeps in 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.379
 time its elasticity and have also 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.229
 good adhesion on the support la 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:11.379
 nautilus rubber from which it is to all these 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.379
 requirements 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:20.149
 maintenance is also important 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:24.949
 next of the blanket and rubber 

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:24.949
 using the right products and materials
