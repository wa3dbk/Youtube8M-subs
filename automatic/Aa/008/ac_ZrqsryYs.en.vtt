00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
it up a little bit when I sending it

you<00:00:57.660> see<00:00:57.840> over<00:00:58.079> here<00:00:58.609> is<00:00:59.609> the<00:01:00.030> original<00:01:00.149> design

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
you see over here is the original design

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.119 
you see over here is the original design
was<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.109> use<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.829> plastic<00:01:02.129> box<00:01:02.609> as<00:01:02.969> our<00:01:03.329> base

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
was to use the plastic box as our base

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.070 
was to use the plastic box as our base
with<00:01:05.129> an<00:01:05.250> L<00:01:05.369> bracket<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:06.060> needed<00:01:06.600> more<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
with an L bracket but needed more of a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.469 
with an L bracket but needed more of a
turret<00:01:07.439> design<00:01:08.090> because<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:11.180> servo<00:01:12.180> couldn't

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
turret design because the servo couldn't

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.660 
turret design because the servo couldn't
hold<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.720> weight<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> camera<00:01:13.670> works

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
hold the weight of the camera works

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.890 
hold the weight of the camera works
pretty<00:01:14.939> good<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:16.770> want<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.040> go<00:01:17.159> up<00:01:17.720> you<00:01:18.720> come

turn<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:24.840> first<00:01:25.340> try<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.430> know<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.670> see<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
turn it on first try to know you see the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.600 
turn it on first try to know you see the
light<00:01:27.180> comes<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.680> back<00:01:28.890> here<00:01:31.100> damn

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.640 
left right and that's on three votes
that's<00:01:39.320> running<00:01:39.590> on<00:01:39.710> three<00:01:40.010> votes<00:01:41.470> this<00:01:42.470> is

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
that's running on three votes this is

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.640 
that's running on three votes this is
going<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:42.950> go<00:01:43.070> on<00:01:43.100> church<00:01:44.140> more<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.820> more<00:01:46.820> the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
going to go on church more the more the

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.870 
going to go on church more the more the
support<00:01:48.650> once<00:01:48.830> i<00:01:48.950> get<00:01:49.100> a<00:01:49.130> level<00:01:49.460> of<00:01:49.550> it<00:01:49.730> i<00:01:49.850> think

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
support once i get a level of it i think

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.820 
support once i get a level of it i think
it<00:01:50.180> worked<00:01:50.390> fine<00:01:50.570> worried<00:01:51.530> about<00:01:51.680> the

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
it worked fine worried about the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.200 
it worked fine worried about the
distance<00:01:52.250> going<00:01:52.610> probably<00:01:52.940> 150<00:01:53.450> feet<00:01:54.640> but<00:01:55.640> we

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
distance going probably 150 feet but we

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.700 
distance going probably 150 feet but we
can<00:01:56.390> overcome<00:01:56.630> that<00:01:56.840> I<00:01:56.990> think<00:01:57.260> with<00:01:57.410> just

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
can overcome that I think with just

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.730 
can overcome that I think with just
sending<00:01:58.160> up<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.280> voltage<00:01:58.520> a<00:01:58.700> little<00:01:58.910> bit<00:01:59.740> as

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
sending up the voltage a little bit as

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.570 
sending up the voltage a little bit as
you<00:02:00.890> can<00:02:00.950> see<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:01.160> works<00:02:01.310> pretty<00:02:01.490> good<00:02:06.400> use<00:02:07.400> the

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
you can see it works pretty good use the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:14.070 
you can see it works pretty good use the
simple<00:02:07.910> little<00:02:09.550> Z<00:02:11.380> wire<00:02:12.380> bracket<00:02:12.890> there<00:02:13.130> to

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
simple little Z wire bracket there to

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.760 
simple little Z wire bracket there to
control<00:02:15.080> that<00:02:15.230> download<00:02:15.800> movement<00:02:17.500> we<00:02:18.500> still

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
control that download movement we still

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:19.900 
control that download movement we still
got<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:18.980> work<00:02:19.130> out<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.400> kinks<00:02:19.430> in<00:02:19.730> that<00:02:19.880> a

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
got to work out the kinks in that a

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.160 
got to work out the kinks in that a
little<00:02:20.180> bit<00:02:20.270> but<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.600> see<00:02:20.780> it<00:02:20.870> worked<00:02:21.020> pretty

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
little bit but it see it worked pretty

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:29.260 
little bit but it see it worked pretty
back<00:02:21.410> i'm<00:02:21.560> good<00:02:23.170> for<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.290> most<00:02:24.440> part<00:02:28.270> there

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
back i'm good for the most part there

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.920 
back i'm good for the most part there
