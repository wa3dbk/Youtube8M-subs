00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 what's up kids welcome back to 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.580
 the area today I bring you a king said 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.960
 now it is worse to director and good as 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.960
 we are always going to analyze it here 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.330
 as a school principal sees a 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.580
 sword has a rule is typical 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.650
 sexy teacher the power erotica no 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.960
 so I think that this does not have 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.300
 finally leads to a pencil holding the 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.730
 tail 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.279
 It is an old and good go with the 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.580
 cries of war with the war cry 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.580
 number 1 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.020
 let's hear again that he has 2 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:46.460
 let me show you 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.460
 the criterion number 2 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.500
 that is to abide by the cullen rule 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.500
 but again the two 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.219
 the dance 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.740
 and laughter 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.840
 and well now let's show the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.840
 attacks and how it hits the rule 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.160
 we go for a Cuba 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.160
 another with more 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.990
 a good w and he has seen us very well 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.659
 that has gotten in between 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.800
 a good one that does not change much 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.640
 just be the wake behind 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.720
 and runs and hits faster and another with more 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.390
 another comfortable one is that we have things from 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.960
 free the w that is the shield this that 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.960
 you see in front 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.000
 the e again so you can see how it runs 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.250
 more and tam 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.390
 and finally if I find champions 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.390
 enemies show the air 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.080
 and good here has finally come to ni 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.080
 so that we can do the r 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.319
 is the r 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.209
 for you to see her and good 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.680
 and a little bit apart so that we do not 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.739
 kill and well I hope you liked it 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.849
 as much as me and I hope to see you in the 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.849
