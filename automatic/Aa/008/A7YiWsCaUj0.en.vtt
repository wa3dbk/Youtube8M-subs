and<00:00:06.210> I'm<00:00:06.299> beginning<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.660> think<00:00:06.779> that

up<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.300> help<00:00:12.420> us<00:00:12.690> out<00:00:12.840> before<00:00:13.650> we<00:00:13.830> get<00:00:14.040> going<00:00:14.099> I

up to help us out before we get going I

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.300 
up to help us out before we get going I
know<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.639> lot<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:14.940> people<00:00:15.240> wanted<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.570> see<00:00:15.750> a

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:16.310 
know a lot of people wanted to see a

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.710 
know a lot of people wanted to see a
comparison<00:00:17.310> between<00:00:17.430> rhythm<00:00:18.000> studio<00:00:18.390> and

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
comparison between rhythm studio and

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.750 
comparison between rhythm studio and
tabletop<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.920> I'm<00:00:20.130> not<00:00:20.220> gonna<00:00:20.340> be<00:00:20.460> doing<00:00:20.640> that

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
tabletop and I'm not gonna be doing that

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.810 
tabletop and I'm not gonna be doing that
I<00:00:21.330> feel<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.170> tabletops<00:00:22.800> pricing<00:00:23.369> model<00:00:23.640> is

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
I feel that tabletops pricing model is

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.089 
I feel that tabletops pricing model is
both<00:00:24.119> greedy<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.689> deceptive<00:00:25.320> if<00:00:25.650> they<00:00:25.920> want

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
both greedy and deceptive if they want

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.560 
both greedy and deceptive if they want
to<00:00:26.130> charge<00:00:26.340> $40<00:00:26.849> for<00:00:26.970> their<00:00:27.090> app<00:00:27.180> they<00:00:27.420> should

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
to charge $40 for their app they should

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.630 
to charge $40 for their app they should
charge<00:00:27.779> $40<00:00:28.320> for<00:00:28.470> their<00:00:28.590> app<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.949> I'll<00:00:29.369> charge

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
charge $40 for their app and I'll charge

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.160 
charge $40 for their app and I'll charge
$5<00:00:30.179> for<00:00:30.240> their<00:00:30.449> app<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.750> then<00:00:30.900> they<00:00:31.019> have

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
$5 for their app and then they have

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.540 
$5 for their app and then they have
users<00:00:31.500> discovered<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.070> they<00:00:32.130> need<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.369> spend

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
users discovered that they need to spend

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.190 
users discovered that they need to spend
more<00:00:32.730> money<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.969> get<00:00:33.210> basic<00:00:33.540> functionality

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
more money to get basic functionality

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.740 
more money to get basic functionality
that's<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:35.130> exploiting<00:00:36.120> consumers<00:00:36.600> and

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
that's just exploiting consumers and

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.569 
that's just exploiting consumers and
pisses<00:00:36.989> me<00:00:37.170> right<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.649> off<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.460> we're

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
pisses me right the off so we're

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.360 
pisses me right the off so we're
not<00:00:38.640> doing<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.000> instead<00:00:39.960> rhythm<00:00:40.770> studio<00:00:41.100> by

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
not doing that instead rhythm studio by

specific<00:01:29.670> scales<00:01:31.790> it's<00:01:32.790> also<00:01:32.939> got<00:01:33.150> two

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
specific scales it's also got two

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.630 
specific scales it's also got two
effects<00:01:33.659> units<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.740> first<00:01:35.040> has<00:01:35.310> a

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
effects units and the first has a

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.539 
effects units and the first has a
blender<00:01:36.500> chorus

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
blender chorus

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.319 
blender chorus
and<00:01:39.509> delays<00:01:40.070> yeah<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.250> amount<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.700> pulled

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
and delays yeah the amount can be pulled

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.580 
and delays yeah the amount can be pulled
the<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.570> stops

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.450 

and<00:01:46.460> a<00:01:46.610> second<00:01:47.079> insert<00:01:48.079> is<00:01:48.399> controlled<00:01:49.399> by

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
and a second insert is controlled by

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.990 
and a second insert is controlled by
this<00:01:49.610> button<00:01:51.070> which<00:01:52.070> has<00:01:52.280> various

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
this button which has various

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.649 
this button which has various
distortions<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:53.960> box<00:01:54.409> filters<00:02:01.450> there<00:02:02.450> are

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
distortions and box filters there are

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.429 
distortions and box filters there are
pan<00:02:02.990> knobs<00:02:03.320> as<00:02:03.590> well<00:02:04.100> as<00:02:04.509> faders<00:02:05.509> but<00:02:05.840> you'll

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
pan knobs as well as faders but you'll

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.249 
pan knobs as well as faders but you'll
notice<00:02:06.770> that<00:02:07.149> there<00:02:08.149> is<00:02:08.179> no<00:02:08.599> multi-touch<00:02:09.140> so

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
notice that there is no multi-touch so

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.470 
notice that there is no multi-touch so
you<00:02:09.380> can't<00:02:09.619> do<00:02:09.950> two<00:02:10.550> faders<00:02:10.849> at<00:02:10.970> once<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:11.300> just

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
you can't do two faders at once you just

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.190 
you can't do two faders at once you just
zoom<00:02:11.660> it<00:02:11.810> around

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
zoom it around

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.059 
zoom it around
I<00:02:13.480> really<00:02:14.480> like<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.810> vu<00:02:15.200> meter<00:02:15.440> which<00:02:15.709> I<00:02:15.890> think

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
I really like the vu meter which I think

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.670 
I really like the vu meter which I think

this was really helpful when I needed a
transition<00:05:20.870> between<00:05:21.050> patterns<00:05:21.650> I<00:05:21.860> just<00:05:22.340> hit

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
transition between patterns I just hit

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.010 
transition between patterns I just hit
the<00:05:22.760> random<00:05:23.060> to<00:05:23.150> see<00:05:23.300> what<00:05:23.420> it<00:05:23.510> didn't<00:05:23.660> do<00:05:23.810> and

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
the random to see what it didn't do and

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.390 
the random to see what it didn't do and
they<00:05:24.170> got<00:05:24.320> it<00:05:24.470> right<00:05:24.680> on<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:24.890> first<00:05:25.040> try<00:05:25.280> I

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.400 
they got it right on the first try I
just<00:05:25.880> had<00:05:26.030> to<00:05:26.150> change<00:05:26.330> the<00:05:26.570> last<00:05:26.750> two<00:05:26.930> notes<00:05:27.170> to

get<00:05:27.680> it<00:05:27.770> to<00:05:27.920> transition<00:05:28.550> the<00:05:28.700> way<00:05:28.790> I<00:05:28.820> wanted<00:05:29.180> it

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
great for iOS devices but you need to be

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.510 
great for iOS devices but you need to be
