00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
here you have the option to to close it

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.100 
here you have the option to to close it
to<00:02:20.560> open<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:20.920> again<00:02:21.040> but<00:02:22.000> also<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.570> change<00:02:23.020> the

to open it again but also to change the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.220 
to open it again but also to change the
font<00:02:23.530> so<00:02:24.460> they<00:02:24.880> say<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.330> this<00:02:25.540> font<00:02:25.930> is

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
font so they say that this font is

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.500 
font so they say that this font is
better<00:02:26.590> for<00:02:26.890> people<00:02:27.040> with<00:02:28.050> like<00:02:29.910> make<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:30.940> make

better for people with like make it make
it<00:02:31.540> easier<00:02:32.020> to<00:02:32.050> them<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:34.380> what<00:02:35.380> they<00:02:35.470> are

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
it easier to them to what they are

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.980 
it easier to them to what they are
saying<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:36.280> again<00:02:36.880> I<00:02:36.910> think<00:02:37.060> this<00:02:37.300> is<00:02:37.660> a<00:02:37.690> very
