downside is that it's quite fragile and

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.170 
downside is that it's quite fragile and
quite<00:01:49.530> small<00:01:49.979> radius<00:01:50.399> as<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.820> can<00:01:50.939> see<00:01:51.090> it

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
quite small radius as you can see it

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.120 
quite small radius as you can see it
doesn't<00:01:51.509> have<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.720> very<00:01:52.649> wide<00:01:53.100> radius<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.299> it's

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
doesn't have a very wide radius and it's

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.709 
doesn't have a very wide radius and it's
doesn't<00:01:56.130> inspire<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.909> whole<00:01:57.450> lot<00:01:57.689> of

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
doesn't inspire a whole lot of

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.219 
doesn't inspire a whole lot of
confidence<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.649> vicious<00:01:59.329> wind<00:02:00.329> rain<00:02:00.840> storm

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
confidence in a vicious wind rain storm

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.770 
confidence in a vicious wind rain storm
it<00:02:02.219> seems<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.939> thing<00:02:03.180> would<00:02:03.390> would

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
it seems that this thing would would

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.469 
it seems that this thing would would

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
is this one it's called the flashlight

model and you can never guess why that
is<00:02:41.480> this<00:02:42.590> is<00:02:43.590> cool<00:02:43.980> for<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.280> number<00:02:44.519> of<00:02:44.550> reasons

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
is this is cool for a number of reasons

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.990 
is this is cool for a number of reasons
number<00:02:45.540> one<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.860> has<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.280> reflective

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
number one it is has a reflective

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.630 
number one it is has a reflective
coating<00:02:48.450> as<00:02:48.599> you<00:02:48.720> can<00:02:48.870> see<00:02:49.080> number<00:02:49.860> two<00:02:50.010> you

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
coating as you can see number two you

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.339 
coating as you can see number two you
push<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:50.849> button<00:02:50.970> in<00:02:51.390> Wow<00:02:52.250> quite<00:02:53.250> cool<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:54.349> so

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
push a button in Wow quite cool and so

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:56.960 
push a button in Wow quite cool and so
it's<00:02:55.530> just<00:02:55.590> like<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.980> go<00:02:56.129> like<00:02:56.370> chrome<00:02:56.700> dome

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
it's just like the go like chrome dome

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.580 
it's just like the go like chrome dome
and<00:02:57.180> since<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.629> has<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.780> reflective<00:02:58.260> which<00:02:58.470> is

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
and since that has a reflective which is

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.000 
and since that has a reflective which is
very<00:02:58.769> good<00:02:58.920> for<00:02:59.099> outdoor<00:02:59.629> activities<00:03:00.830> in<00:03:01.830> the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
very good for outdoor activities in the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.570 
very good for outdoor activities in the
Sun<00:03:02.330> but<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.569> has<00:03:03.840> its<00:03:04.019> bonus<00:03:04.409> feature<00:03:04.620> when

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
Sun but it has its bonus feature when

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.170 
Sun but it has its bonus feature when
you<00:03:05.700> twist<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:06.030> handle<00:03:06.390> voila<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:07.230> flashlight

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
you twist the handle voila a flashlight

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.699 
you twist the handle voila a flashlight
again<00:03:09.180> for<00:03:09.659> backpackers<00:03:10.170> that's<00:03:10.379> probably<00:03:10.650> a

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
again for backpackers that's probably a

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.009 
again for backpackers that's probably a
whole<00:03:10.920> not<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.519> huge<00:03:12.000> importance<00:03:12.690> but<00:03:12.810> maybe

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
whole not a huge importance but maybe

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.809 
whole not a huge importance but maybe
you<00:03:13.290> can<00:03:13.409> see<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.590> as<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.769> backup<00:03:14.099> device<00:03:14.519> you

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
you can see it as a backup device you

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.729 
you can see it as a backup device you
know<00:03:14.909> if<00:03:15.030> all<00:03:15.150> sudden<00:03:15.599> you<00:03:15.780> your<00:03:16.260> flashlight

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
know if all sudden you your flashlight

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.410 
know if all sudden you your flashlight
dies<00:03:16.980> batteries<00:03:17.580> run<00:03:17.760> out<00:03:17.849> you<00:03:18.090> didn't<00:03:18.300> bring

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
dies batteries run out you didn't bring

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.750 
dies batteries run out you didn't bring
extra<00:03:18.569> batteries<00:03:19.140> then<00:03:19.739> this<00:03:20.040> thing<00:03:20.250> could

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
extra batteries then this thing could

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.229 
extra batteries then this thing could
save<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.239> nice<00:03:21.780> LED<00:03:22.140> light<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:23.069> the<00:03:23.730> downside

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
save you nice LED light so the downside

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.670 
save you nice LED light so the downside
of<00:03:24.390> this<00:03:24.510> thing<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.840> only<00:03:24.959> reason<00:03:25.319> I'm<00:03:25.409> not<00:03:25.530> in

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
of this thing the only reason I'm not in

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.920 
of this thing the only reason I'm not in
love<00:03:25.920> with<00:03:26.069> this<00:03:26.220> is<00:03:26.549> that<00:03:26.760> it's<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:27.030> bit<00:03:27.299> on<00:03:27.629> the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
love with this is that it's a bit on the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.309 
love with this is that it's a bit on the
heavy<00:03:28.110> side<00:03:28.200> so<00:03:29.000> that's<00:03:30.000> that's<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:31.049> only

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
heavy side so that's that's the only

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.559 
heavy side so that's that's the only
knock<00:03:31.890> against<00:03:32.280> this<00:03:32.370> but<00:03:32.549> otherwise<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:33.150> well

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
knock against this but otherwise a well

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.410 
knock against this but otherwise a well
designed<00:03:33.930> thing<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.560> I<00:03:35.129> typically<00:03:35.610> don't

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
designed thing and I typically don't

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.070 
designed thing and I typically don't
need<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.870> have<00:03:37.080> this<00:03:37.700> this<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:39.569> flashlight<00:03:39.959> I

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
need to have this this the flashlight I

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.170 
need to have this this the flashlight I
probably<00:03:40.409> wouldn't<00:03:40.739> carry<00:03:40.950> this<00:03:41.099> in<00:03:41.700> under

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
probably wouldn't carry this in under

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.380 
probably wouldn't carry this in under
most<00:03:42.330> circumstances<00:03:42.629> and<00:03:43.349> finally<00:03:44.330> this<00:03:45.330> is

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
most circumstances and finally this is

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.630 
most circumstances and finally this is
the<00:03:45.599> I<00:03:46.110> would<00:03:46.349> say<00:03:46.500> their<00:03:46.709> their<00:03:46.980> coolest<00:03:47.459> one

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
the I would say their their coolest one

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.300 
the I would say their their coolest one
it's<00:03:47.819> the<00:03:47.970> light<00:03:48.150> flex<00:03:48.870> should<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.739> say<00:03:49.920> coolest

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
it's the light flex should I say coolest

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.860 
it's the light flex should I say coolest
one<00:03:50.459> it's<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.819> most<00:03:51.030> functional<00:03:51.569> for<00:03:51.780> the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
one it's the most functional for the

one it's the most functional for the
ultralight<00:03:52.319> backpacker<00:03:53.930> it's<00:03:54.930> like<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:55.080> sward

for<00:04:24.810> me<00:04:25.160> my<00:04:26.160> favorite<00:04:26.400> one

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
for me my favorite one

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.270 
for me my favorite one
of<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.270> four<00:04:27.560> because<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:28.590> combines<00:04:29.070> that

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
of the four because it combines that

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.190 
of the four because it combines that
strength<00:04:29.700> rigidity<00:04:30.300> as<00:04:30.480> well<00:04:31.170> as<00:04:31.410> a

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
strength rigidity as well as a

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.520 
strength rigidity as well as a
lightweight<00:04:34.200> form<00:04:34.950> factor<00:04:35.310> so<00:04:36.290> and<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.350> fact

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
lightweight form factor so and the fact

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.690 
lightweight form factor so and the fact
that<00:04:37.590> it<00:04:37.710> doesn't<00:04:37.860> collapse<00:04:38.130> is<00:04:38.370> not<00:04:38.520> a<00:04:38.550> big

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
that it doesn't collapse is not a big

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.890 
that it doesn't collapse is not a big
deal<00:04:38.850> actually<00:04:39.000> structurally<00:04:39.630> he's<00:04:39.720> more

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
deal actually structurally he's more

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.630 
deal actually structurally he's more
sound<00:04:40.140> if<00:04:40.320> it<00:04:40.410> doesn't<00:04:40.650> collapse<00:04:40.740> so<00:04:41.100> those

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
sound if it doesn't collapse so those

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.180 
sound if it doesn't collapse so those
are<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:41.880> four<00:04:42.090> ones<00:04:42.770> they<00:04:43.770> all<00:04:43.860> have<00:04:44.040> their

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
are the four ones they all have their

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.400 
are the four ones they all have their
