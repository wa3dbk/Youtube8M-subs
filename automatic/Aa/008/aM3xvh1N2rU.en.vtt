stage<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:40.450> pick<00:02:40.870> up<00:02:40.989> choreography<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.590> move

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
stage and pick up choreography and move

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:42.900 
stage and pick up choreography and move
just<00:02:42.040> as<00:02:42.190> well<00:02:42.310> as<00:02:42.400> people<00:02:42.550> who've<00:02:42.790> been

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
just as well as people who've been

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.160 
just as well as people who've been
dancing<00:02:43.239> their<00:02:43.330> whole<00:02:43.450> lives<00:02:43.600> that<00:02:43.930> means<00:02:44.110> a

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
dancing their whole lives that means a

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.170 
dancing their whole lives that means a
lot

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
lot

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.860 
lot
I<00:02:47.159> think<00:02:48.159> our<00:02:48.280> average<00:02:48.849> group<00:02:49.209> size<00:02:49.480> is<00:02:49.719> about

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
I think our average group size is about

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.530 
I think our average group size is about
20<00:02:50.469> yeah<00:02:50.890> we<00:02:51.549> would<00:02:51.670> like<00:02:51.849> to<00:02:51.879> take<00:02:52.120> more<00:02:52.390> and

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
20 yeah we would like to take more and

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.750 
20 yeah we would like to take more and
there's<00:02:52.719> a<00:02:52.780> lot<00:02:53.019> more<00:02:53.349> talent<00:02:54.010> than<00:02:54.040> just<00:02:54.340> 20

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
there's a lot more talent than just 20

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.270 
there's a lot more talent than just 20
but<00:02:55.269> we<00:02:56.230> can't<00:02:56.469> set<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:56.769> money<00:02:56.980> on<00:02:57.040> the

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
but we can't set that money on the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.670 
but we can't set that money on the
stadium<00:02:57.760> think<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.299> like<00:02:58.450> you<00:02:59.290> know<00:02:59.319> even

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
stadium think of like you know even

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.899 
stadium think of like you know even
without<00:02:59.769> dance<00:03:00.099> experience<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:00.579> can<00:03:00.700> still

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
without dance experience you can still

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.690 
without dance experience you can still
be<00:03:01.030> good<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.629> even<00:03:02.260> though<00:03:02.430> we're<00:03:03.430> not<00:03:03.459> so

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
be good and even though we're not so

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.740 
be good and even though we're not so
much<00:03:03.819> about<00:03:03.939> technique<00:03:04.450> we're<00:03:04.629> not

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
much about technique we're not

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.440 
much about technique we're not
classically<00:03:05.319> trained<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.950> think<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:06.639> there's

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
classically trained I think that there's

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.420 
classically trained I think that there's
some<00:03:07.659> value<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:08.109> that<00:03:08.349> that<00:03:08.709> were<00:03:08.889> just<00:03:09.159> like

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
some value to that that were just like

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.240 
some value to that that were just like
I've<00:03:09.700> doing<00:03:10.060> our<00:03:10.180> own<00:03:10.209> choreography<00:03:10.959> were

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
I've doing our own choreography were

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.899 
I've doing our own choreography were
individually<00:03:12.250> we're<00:03:12.489> completely

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
individually we're completely

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.300 
individually we're completely
student-run<00:03:13.900> all<00:03:14.170> of<00:03:14.349> our<00:03:14.590> choreography<00:03:15.250> is

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
student-run all of our choreography is

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.179 
student-run all of our choreography is
from<00:03:16.209> within<00:03:16.450> our<00:03:16.750> group<00:03:17.019> and<00:03:17.560> I<00:03:17.769> just<00:03:17.980> think

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:18.189 
from within our group and I just think

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:20.280 
from within our group and I just think
that<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.639> brings<00:03:19.060> like<00:03:19.329> an<00:03:19.510> applicability<00:03:20.079> to

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
that it brings like an applicability to

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.259 
that it brings like an applicability to
dance<00:03:20.709> to<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.069> community<00:03:21.340> where<00:03:21.760> people<00:03:21.819> can

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
dance to a community where people can

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.289 
dance to a community where people can
relate<00:03:22.419> to<00:03:22.599> it<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.200> appreciate<00:03:23.889> it

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
relate to it and appreciate it

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.220 
relate to it and appreciate it
regardless<00:03:25.299> of<00:03:25.419> whether<00:03:25.569> or<00:03:25.720> not<00:03:25.840> they've

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
there's any way they could find an

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.129 
there's any way they could find an
outlet<00:04:05.620> in<00:04:06.040> dance<00:04:06.370> in<00:04:06.609> any<00:04:06.819> other<00:04:07.060> way<00:04:07.359> so<00:04:07.810> that

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
actually led us to start up the dance

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.179 
actually led us to start up the dance
collective<00:04:11.049> just<00:04:11.500> because<00:04:11.739> there's<00:04:11.949> such<00:04:12.159> a

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:12.189 
collective just because there's such a

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:13.830 
collective just because there's such a
high<00:04:12.430> demand<00:04:12.669> for<00:04:12.879> dance<00:04:13.239> and<00:04:13.540> there's<00:04:13.659> not

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
high demand for dance and there's not

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.569 
high demand for dance and there's not
enough<00:04:14.109> sources<00:04:15.659> we<00:04:16.659> really<00:04:16.930> just<00:04:17.019> wanted<00:04:17.590> to

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
enough sources we really just wanted to

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.749 
enough sources we really just wanted to
fix<00:04:18.759> this<00:04:18.940> because<00:04:19.060> it<00:04:19.419> was<00:04:19.570> such<00:04:20.139> a<00:04:20.530> huge<00:04:21.459> need

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:21.759 
fix this because it was such a huge need

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.710 
fix this because it was such a huge need
on<00:04:22.090> campus<00:04:22.630> so<00:04:22.990> we<00:04:23.020> really<00:04:23.470> just<00:04:23.620> wanted<00:04:23.979> to<00:04:24.190> do

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
on campus so we really just wanted to do

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.420 
on campus so we really just wanted to do
something<00:04:25.720> that<00:04:26.020> wasn't<00:04:26.199> as<00:04:26.470> competitive<00:04:27.159> or

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
something that wasn't as competitive or

time<00:07:06.660> but<00:07:07.020> I<00:07:07.230> don't<00:07:07.470> think<00:07:07.620> any<00:07:07.860> of<00:07:08.010> us<00:07:08.130> would

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 
time but I don't think any of us would

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.980 
time but I don't think any of us would
give<00:07:08.610> it<00:07:08.700> up<00:07:08.820> for<00:07:09.000> anything<00:07:09.060> because<00:07:09.810> that's

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:09.990 
give it up for anything because that's

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.430 
give it up for anything because that's
where<00:07:10.230> we<00:07:10.320> all<00:07:10.500> bond<00:07:11.430> and<00:07:11.730> become<00:07:11.820> so<00:07:12.810> close

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 
where we all bond and become so close

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.620 
where we all bond and become so close
and<00:07:13.740> we<00:07:13.830> really<00:07:14.130> feel<00:07:14.370> like<00:07:14.430> that's<00:07:15.330> really

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:15.630 
and we really feel like that's really

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.590 
and we really feel like that's really
when<00:07:15.960> we<00:07:16.710> come<00:07:16.950> together<00:07:17.100> as<00:07:17.280> a<00:07:17.490> group<00:07:17.670> which
