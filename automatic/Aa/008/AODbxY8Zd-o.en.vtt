00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.100
 no 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.920
 and the geeks today we get 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.020
 find on gt5 online for a whole 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.820
 new guide to stÃ©phanie so here I 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.800
 am currently on next gen but that 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.330
 also walk on jane so everything 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.669
 you will simply go to 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.489
 point where we were doing indicated or all 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:29.130
 simply called pegasus to ask 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:31.200
 the fraudster if you do not find it 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.030
 will go faster any case me it's 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.610
 what I did so there you go either 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.110
 take a grenade or your mini gun 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.719
 it's as you wish for 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.280
 blow up your fraudsters me for my 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.199
 part I took my mini war because 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.449
 I had no other ammunition for 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.030
 so expose it there as soon as I exposed 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.890
 I had of course the police who make 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.210
 always a little shit when we 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.160
 wants to do something 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.350
 I called Leicester for the dodges 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.539
 and then what interested us 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.370
 the back of the fraudster so everything 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.710
 simply you will try to 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.080
 return if he's like me on the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.860
 video to have the lilies well right 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.860
 the rear 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.229
 finally the thing goes it's sharp in front of 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.140
 you and there you go out your rifle 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.410
 of distress to finally shoot the 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.510
 tip of the back of the helicopter and 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.520
 normally it will propel you finally 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.250
 to make you fly a little in the air 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.410
 normally if you get super good at 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.910
 do it you can go very very 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.590
 high in the air so it's pretty fun 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.360
 i in any case do not hesitate to redo it 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.250
 with your friends it can be really 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.680
 very very funny so I hope that 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.110

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.330

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.650

 you are new or new 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.440
 not to subscribe to the statement at the 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.440

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.049
