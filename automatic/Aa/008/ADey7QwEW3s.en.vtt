00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:18.929
 I play 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.710
 on the screen of a clear that is one 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.089
 there can thus hold region 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:29.300
 above the Munich part of Princeton in the background you can see the percent use 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.039
 floor 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.039
 and this is the so-called big car meandering

 Airbiquity northbound 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.870

 on the rock face 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 which is even active 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.450
 that is unimaginable, there is such a thing in nature 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.240
 Inventor of the mistakes, however, beside her 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.240
 in retrospect was three meters distance 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.290
 it's worth it 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.590
 think the first order 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.590

 a good reason for the decline 000 euros 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:02:01.439
 about the UN DÃ¼lmen 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:15.579
 Economic risks occurred at number Murray 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.579
 and you like 000 euros 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.659
 come 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:33.789
 the high up 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:37.529

 fundamental changes point behind the FCK and gamma radiation together 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:09.869

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:13.679
 I have always measured this exactly here is worldwide 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.609
 there is about 3

 because the focus is on working but without the start 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.169
 but with so little loss of comfort 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.169
