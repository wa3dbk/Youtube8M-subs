00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
a very rigid base so when you go into a

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.559 
a very rigid base so when you go into a
tight<00:02:20.709> turn<00:02:20.980> all<00:02:21.340> right<00:02:21.640> traditionally

skates will torque to some extent this

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.270 
skates will torque to some extent this
one<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:25.780> what<00:02:25.930> happens<00:02:26.320> is<00:02:26.500> because<00:02:26.980> the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
one so what happens is because the

problem<00:02:32.830> you<00:02:33.370> either<00:02:33.520> lose<00:02:34.120> energy<00:02:34.330> transfer

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
problem you either lose energy transfer

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.449 
problem you either lose energy transfer
or<00:02:35.080> community<00:02:35.440> slow<00:02:35.680> down<00:02:35.860> into<00:02:36.130> your<00:02:36.250> turn

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459

and<00:02:36.730> also<00:02:37.330> players<00:02:38.260> will<00:02:38.440> pull<00:02:38.620> out<00:02:38.739> of<00:02:38.770> the

and also players will pull out of the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.979 
and also players will pull out of the
turn<00:02:39.130> so<00:02:39.340> they<00:02:39.430> don't<00:02:39.610> fall<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.300> go<00:02:40.660> into<00:02:40.810> the

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989
