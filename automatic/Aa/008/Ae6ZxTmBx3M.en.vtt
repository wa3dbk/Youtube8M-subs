00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:07.330
 we see the new control unit of the tender 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.090
 868 megahertz st 6 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:14.350
 the control panel is presented with a panel 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.910
 touch and very elegant a display that 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:20.710
 indicates all the main functions 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:23.560
 of the control unit as the time and system 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.330
 that disarmed the gsm signal 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.580
 let's look at the part for a while 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.039
 back where i 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.439
 links we have one 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.800
 terminal block where they can be connected 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.629
 up to eight inputs via wire the output 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.079
 of the siren 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:45.030
 the output also at 12 volts to power 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:48.489
 some his as well as the clamp for 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.469
 insert a LED and a light with system 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.139
 armed sim housing e 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.239
 the feeder is the attack for so much 

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:59.559
 cern energy in addition to the wheel for the 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:02.260
 volume we also see the functions 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:06.089
 main features of this unit of which 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.089
 we enter its configuration menu 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.299
 with the default password that 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.299
 obviously you can change 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:31.509
 we listen to the menu we have the classics 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:33.789
 one hundred password change functions 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.890
 services called where we put the 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:39.219
 phone numbers to which we want the 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.759
 central calls when you go to alarm on 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:45.270
 system to be able to manage that we go to 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.270
 see him 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.459
 classic time siren entry time 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.910
 exit time duration ring and we have 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.780
 also an additional function 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:20.630
 we have other objective settings 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.870
 in the middle with the large magnetic sensors 4 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.260
 tamper wireless devices 5 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.830
 line interruption in ferment 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.739
 telephone that purified alarm for the 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.830
 listening time 9 a true principal a 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.090
 earthly that we want other functions than 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.730
 in the previous version of the 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.220
 there were no ecu and that us 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.140
 we can enable the output we can 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.940
 do 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.940
 forced insertion in case there is 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.650
 both a magnetic sensor open to us 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.890
 we can leave it open to fans in the series 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.170
 of the control unit and the excluded sensor 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.360
 deliberately so we can leave one 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.790
 window an open door and the rest 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.860
 leave the implant inserted then 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:11.780
 we have other interesting features but 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:13.190
 in the manual they are described again 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:27.230
 back 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:29.440
 then we mentioned the possibility of 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.110
 record the message that we can 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.090
 listen during the call in case of 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.790
 alarm on both GSM and line 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:44.440
 fixed phone then we have others 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.440
 system settings and exit 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.760
 we always have the tsm e rating 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:54.019
 other features that are challenged in the menu 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.910
 we keep out then we try to look 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.040
 also its accessories that we have in 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.320
 contact the vibration 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.200
 the sensor awaits working on 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.680
 infrared the infrared sensor the 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.930
 volumetric which is dual technology 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.450
 infrared and movement 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.239
 then we have the magnetic contact 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.449
 classic remote control and keyboard from 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.609
 which the portal functions of the control unit 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:25.699
 let's try the sea system from the people 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:28.009
 from the keyboard to what control unit gives us 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.289
 all reports both visual and 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:32.449
 Acoustics of what is happening e 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.759
 what we can do now 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.919
 control unit is armed 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.410
 so just a sensor is seen 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.330
 or is read and the central goes into 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.380
 alarm we find with the sensor 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.870
 magnetic that we open it of the plant 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:51.530
 obviously goes into alarm now in mute 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.740
 his theory does not work but the 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.139
 call is starting with the gsm and is 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:02.210
 almost immediate 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:05.990
 then of course we need a system 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.970
 and in the event that i 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.800
 messages also sends a message from 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.639
 text with all the settings of 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.310
 system 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.840
 the two functions can be kept separate 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.449
 bit we can enable oi call 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.960
 massages or both and on messages 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.979
 we can decide what kind of allan 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.900
 we can send as management 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:25.610
 battery management system 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.699
 etc. etc. the alarm remains 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.919
 purposefully displayed us to do it 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:34.220
 go diaz after we have all seen 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.169
 the functions of the system we press on 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.289
 remote control again the charm rate 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:42.370
 and the central returns with his 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:42.370
 normal operation 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.789
 let's see a very function 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.380
 very interesting that allows us to 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:52.729
 listen to the telephone credit 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:58.250
 we press the call button court 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:06:04.220
 but we hold and it works 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:06.470
 exactly like a phone even with 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.449
 we keep can also perform 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.849
 wanting a phone call from 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:12.259
 duration of 240 seconds but this is a lot 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:14.500
 useful for listening to credit 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:14.500
 telephone 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.779
 when the terrible 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.710
 in addition from updated then we go out and 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.110
 is very not very interesting 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:33.050
 because if we never know how much credit 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:36.889
 telephone then remains as the last one 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.689
 what I wanted to show you the ecu 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:43.009
 even with little lighting that is a lot 

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:45.620
 very elegant and presents itself in this 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:48.710
 way in the normal situation or 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:51.590
 when we light up half of this 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:55.210
 color that indicates the status in which it is 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.210
 in this case unarmed
