00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
to go over wave ski David can you tell

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.700 
to go over wave ski David can you tell
us<00:00:43.370> how<00:00:43.460> you<00:00:43.610> went<00:00:43.850> in<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.000> way<00:00:44.120> ski<00:00:44.500> all<00:00:45.500> right

us how you went in the way ski all right
one<00:00:45.950> fine<00:00:46.580> but<00:00:47.360> I'm<00:00:47.420> surprised<00:00:48.170> because<00:00:48.350> it's

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
one fine but I'm surprised because it's

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.680 
one fine but I'm surprised because it's
very<00:00:49.010> demanding<00:00:49.190> balls<00:00:49.790> physically<00:00:50.390> and

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
very demanding balls physically and

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.290 
very demanding balls physically and
technically<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:51.530> it's<00:00:52.520> been<00:00:52.610> pretty<00:00:52.880> tough<00:00:52.970> on

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
technically so it's been pretty tough on

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.960 
technically so it's been pretty tough on
the<00:00:53.420> first<00:00:53.630> few<00:00:54.170> days<00:00:54.440> but<00:00:54.830> now<00:00:55.040> I'm<00:00:55.220> getting

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
the first few days but now I'm getting

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.660 
the first few days but now I'm getting
more<00:00:56.270> and<00:00:56.390> more<00:00:56.450> comfortable<00:00:57.080> in<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.230> way<00:00:57.410> so

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
more and more comfortable in the way so

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.049 
more and more comfortable in the way so
yeah<00:00:58.670> I<00:00:58.910> think<00:00:58.970> it<00:00:59.330> I'm<00:00:59.960> hooked<00:01:00.650> up<00:01:00.800> now<00:01:01.059> so

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
yeah I think it I'm hooked up now so

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.750 
yeah I think it I'm hooked up now so
David<00:01:02.480> how<00:01:02.660> does<00:01:02.870> it<00:01:03.020> compare<00:01:03.200> to<00:01:03.760> river

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
David how does it compare to river

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.550 
David how does it compare to river
kayaking<00:01:05.449> and<00:01:05.690> what's<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:05.990> advantages<00:01:06.530> and

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
kayaking and what's the advantages and

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.340 
kayaking and what's the advantages and
disadvantages<00:01:07.450> at<00:01:08.450> first<00:01:08.720> I<00:01:08.960> was<00:01:09.170> very

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
disadvantages at first I was very

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.340 
disadvantages at first I was very
surprised<00:01:10.009> because<00:01:10.280> you<00:01:10.670> don't<00:01:10.940> have<00:01:11.350> support

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
surprised because you don't have support

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.859 
surprised because you don't have support
on<00:01:12.560> your<00:01:12.590> hips<00:01:12.860> which<00:01:13.580> is<00:01:13.850> what<00:01:14.060> you<00:01:14.240> use<00:01:14.479> first

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
on your hips which is what you use first

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.700 
on your hips which is what you use first
on<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.290> river<00:01:15.610> but<00:01:16.610> after<00:01:16.910> a<00:01:16.940> couple<00:01:17.390> of<00:01:17.600> days

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
on the river but after a couple of days

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.130 
on the river but after a couple of days
I<00:01:18.710> feel<00:01:18.950> way<00:01:19.400> more<00:01:19.430> comfortable<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:20.450> I<00:01:20.900> think

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
I feel way more comfortable and I think

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.109 
I feel way more comfortable and I think
the<00:01:21.410> technique<00:01:22.400> overall<00:01:22.790> it's<00:01:22.910> very

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
the technique overall it's very

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.880 
the technique overall it's very
different<00:01:23.330> you<00:01:23.780> don't<00:01:23.990> use<00:01:24.170> your<00:01:24.200> paddle<00:01:24.770> as

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
different you don't use your paddle as

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.670 
different you don't use your paddle as
much<00:01:25.130> as<00:01:25.369> we<00:01:25.550> do<00:01:25.670> on<00:01:25.820> rivers<00:01:26.150> but<00:01:27.110> on<00:01:27.440> the<00:01:27.590> other

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
much as we do on rivers but on the other

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.730 
much as we do on rivers but on the other
hand<00:01:27.860> is<00:01:28.250> much<00:01:28.490> more<00:01:29.800> technical<00:01:30.800> technical

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
hand is much more technical technical

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.440 
hand is much more technical technical
having<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.920> right<00:01:34.070> angle<00:01:34.670> when<00:01:34.970> you<00:01:35.090> carve<00:01:35.330> on

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
having the right angle when you carve on

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.240 
having the right angle when you carve on
the<00:01:35.540> waves<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.140> stuff<00:01:36.530> like<00:01:36.649> that<00:01:36.710> but<00:01:36.890> that

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
the waves and stuff like that but that

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.180 
the waves and stuff like that but that
we<00:01:37.369> don't<00:01:37.490> find<00:01:37.790> much<00:01:38.180> on<00:01:38.450> rivers<00:01:38.890> when<00:01:39.890> I<00:01:39.920> see

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
we don't find much on rivers when I see

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.669 
we don't find much on rivers when I see
what<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:40.460> guys<00:01:40.640> are<00:01:41.030> able<00:01:41.660> to<00:01:41.810> do<00:01:41.960> here<00:01:42.289> even

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
what the guys are able to do here even

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.650 
what the guys are able to do here even
in<00:01:42.800> small<00:01:42.979> ways<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.610> speeder<00:01:43.880> can<00:01:44.090> take<00:01:44.360> on

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
in small ways the speeder can take on

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.130 
in small ways the speeder can take on
the<00:01:44.960> wave<00:01:45.140> skis<00:01:45.440> I'm<00:01:45.649> sure<00:01:45.979> it's<00:01:46.130> best<00:01:46.899> toy<00:01:47.899> you

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
the wave skis I'm sure it's best toy you

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.100 
the wave skis I'm sure it's best toy you
can<00:01:48.170> have<00:01:48.530> here<00:01:48.860> on<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.100> ocean<00:01:49.300> and<00:01:50.300> i'll<00:01:50.960> keep

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
can have here on the ocean and i'll keep

00:01:51.110 --> 00:02:08.630 
can have here on the ocean and i'll keep
my<00:01:51.530> for<00:01:51.710> rivers

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.770 

I

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
the competition circuit with the wave

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.619 
the competition circuit with the wave
ski<00:02:20.319> too<00:02:20.620> yeah<00:02:21.459> after<00:02:21.760> four<00:02:22.000> days<00:02:22.150> i<00:02:22.300> think<00:02:22.540> i

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
ski too yeah after four days i think i

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.930 
ski too yeah after four days i think i
can<00:02:22.780> say<00:02:23.080> i'm<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.560> new<00:02:23.800> shining<00:02:24.129> star<00:02:24.519> of<00:02:24.550> wave

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
can say i'm the new shining star of wave

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.269 
can say i'm the new shining star of wave
king
