00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.739
 this rich vegetable pizza with the dough 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:31.310
 integral we will need to prepare 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:34.430
 the dough 300 grams of wholemeal flour 20 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.040
 grams of fresh yeast 190 milliliters 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.750
 of water at room temperature 2 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.839
 tablespoons olive oil 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.480

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.520
 to knead and a couple of tablespoons of 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.590
 more oil for the mold for the filling 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.800
 a red pepper roasted three onions 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.519
 medium roasted three large tomatoes 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.250
 Roasted 120 grams of mozarella herbs 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.950
 of provenza oregano or basil for 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.540
 sprinkle salt to taste and a splash 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:15.130
 of extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.130
 we started crumbling the yeast 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:27.160
 we put a little water and stir 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.160
 until it dissolves completely 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.510
 On the other hand we put the flour in a 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.560
 big bowl we make a hole in the center 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:52.250
 and we throw out the sugar and salt and stir 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.250
 a little 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.299
 two 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.960
 we put also in yeast since 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.960
 dissolved 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.780
 the oil 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.360
 and a little water 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.540
 with a spatula or a spoon 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.450
 wood 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.160
 we are going to mix and incorporate little 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.160
 to little the rest of the water 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.530
 when the mixture is homogeneous and 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.360
 can work with our hands we throw a 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.650
 little flour on the work table 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:19.330
 and knead for about 10 minutes until 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.400
 get a mass that is not sticky and smooth if 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.950
 You see that the mass stays stuck in 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.970
 the hands as it has happened to me you throw 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.970
 a little more flour 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.209
 ah 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.700
 or not 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.840
 Y 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.190
 when the dough looks like this 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.190
 we make a ball 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.630
 we put some oil in a bowl 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.590
 we place the dough we anoint it with the 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.590
 oil 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.280
 and we cover with film 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.250
 We cover with some cloths and leave it 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.880
 rest 30 minutes or until you double your 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.880
 size 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.240
 and when it has doubled its size with the 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.600
 fist we crush to get all the 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.600
 air 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.530
 if you have seen the mass video of 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.570
 spongy pizza I leave here a link 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.460
 in case you have not seen it, I usually 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.460
 help from a tray of this type to 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.910
 Stretching the dough is easier for me and 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.910
 Quick 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.870
 you can divide the more in two and do 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.160
 two small pizzas but I've decided 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.160
 make a big 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.320
 we preheat the oven to full power 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:47.380
 heat up and down the vegetables I've 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:51.700
 been for 30 to 40 minutes in the 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:53.530
 220 degree oven if you want in this 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.590
 video that I leave here you can see how 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:59.350
 it's done and we can distribute it all over 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.720
 the dough the chopped tomato I have 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.260
 drained to remove the maximum 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.260
 possible liquid 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:14.610
 the cheese reserving a little bit for 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.610
 throw in the end 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.140
 the onion cut in julienne 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.090
 and the red pepper cut into strips 

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:06.650
 we tossed over the cheese that we had 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.650
 reserved 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:13.530
 and sprinkle with provenza herbs 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:17.120
 if you do not have you can use oregano 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.120
 basil what you like 

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:25.600
 and the oven is placed halfway up 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:30.300
 we lower the temperature to 200 degrees and 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.300
 we bake about 20 30 minutes 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.830
 once ready we take it out we put salt 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.970
 to taste and a good splash of oil 

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.970
 extra virgin olive 

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:50.110
 I hope you encourage yourself to prepare it 

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.260
