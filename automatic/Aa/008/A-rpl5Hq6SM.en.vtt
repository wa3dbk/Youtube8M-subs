tweak initially but it's kind of

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.560 
tweak initially but it's kind of
incorporated<00:01:11.340> into<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.760> app<00:01:11.970> itself<00:01:12.330> which

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
incorporated into this app itself which

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.649 
incorporated into this app itself which
is<00:01:12.600> amazing<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.920> am<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:15.150> should<00:01:15.330> see<00:01:15.509> here

bottom this is slide to unlock obviously

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.719 
bottom this is slide to unlock obviously
and<00:01:19.710> then<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.890> could<00:01:20.040> go<00:01:20.159> ahead<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.340> slide

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.740 
this now this is the unfold one you can
see<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.369> nice<00:01:23.610> little<00:01:23.850> kind<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.150> crimping<00:01:24.540> of

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
see a nice little kind of crimping of

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.170 
see a nice little kind of crimping of
paper<00:01:24.960> there<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.580> unlock<00:01:26.580> your<00:01:26.729> device<00:01:26.820> which

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
paper there to unlock your device which

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.480 
paper there to unlock your device which
is<00:01:27.299> really<00:01:27.479> nice<00:01:27.979> like<00:01:28.979> say<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.310> was<00:01:29.460> a

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
is really nice like say that was a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.450 
is really nice like say that was a
separate<00:01:30.329> app<00:01:30.420> itself<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:31.619> one<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.979> in<00:01:32.159> also

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
separate app itself this one is in also

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.950 
separate app itself this one is in also
you<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.640> see<00:01:32.820> lots<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.329> different<00:01:33.600> ones<00:01:33.750> here

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
you can see lots of different ones here

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.649 
you can see lots of different ones here
so<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:34.860> we<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.130> go<00:01:35.250> ahead<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.640> do<00:01:36.180> slice<00:01:36.509> to

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
so if we just go ahead and do slice to

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.270 
so if we just go ahead and do slice to
unlock<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.350> know<00:01:37.500> it's<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.860> i'm<00:01:37.979> not<00:01:38.009> having

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
unlock you know it's that i'm not having

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.830 
unlock you know it's that i'm not having
to<00:01:38.430> respring<00:01:38.850> at<00:01:39.000> all<00:01:39.150> once<00:01:39.360> i'm<00:01:39.509> doing<00:01:39.750> this

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
to respring at all once i'm doing this

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.840 
to respring at all once i'm doing this
which<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.110> really<00:01:40.320> nice<00:01:40.500> as<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:41.549> we<00:01:41.640> go<00:01:41.790> ahead

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
which is really nice as if we go ahead

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.420 
which is really nice as if we go ahead
and<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.360> slice<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:43.070> kind<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.189> nice

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
and do the slice one kind of a nice

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.569 
and do the slice one kind of a nice
little<00:01:44.729> m<00:01:45.350> kind<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.439> horizontal<00:01:47.040> bars<00:01:47.250> there

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
little m kind of horizontal bars there

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.340 
little m kind of horizontal bars there
and<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.689> mean<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.960> probably<00:01:49.079> wouldn't

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
and so I mean you probably wouldn't

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.600 
and so I mean you probably wouldn't

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
quite quickly but if i'll go ahead and

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.109 
quite quickly but if i'll go ahead and
do<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.040> slowly<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.579> sort<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.850> see<00:01:53.970> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119
