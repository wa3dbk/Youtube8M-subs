not quite middle parting enough so you

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.270 
not quite middle parting enough so you

can just go back in and make it a little

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:33.680 
can just go back in and make it a little
more<00:02:23.640> centered<00:02:29.990> so<00:02:30.990> there's<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:32.330> because<00:02:33.330> i

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
more centered so there's that because i

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.650 
more centered so there's that because i
