00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
double click with two fingers so if I

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.279 
double click with two fingers so if I
tap<00:00:41.100> two<00:00:41.340> fingers<00:00:41.700> at<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.879> same<00:00:41.940> time<00:00:42.300> all

right<00:00:43.440> all<00:00:44.129> right<00:00:44.160> that'll<00:00:44.700> do<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> double

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
right all right that'll do a double

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.020 
right all right that'll do a double
click<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.410> close<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:47.280> with<00:00:47.430> single

right<00:00:57.600> hand<00:00:57.780> mass<00:00:58.410> blick<00:00:58.710> then<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.430> do

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
right hand mass blick then I can do

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.700 
right hand mass blick then I can do
something<00:00:59.760> like<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.030> left<00:01:00.570> leg<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.140> or

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
something like a left leg with that or

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.250 
something like a left leg with that or
an<00:01:02.280> alternate<00:01:02.670> way<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.789> do<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> left<00:01:03.269> click<00:01:03.449> as<00:01:03.930> I

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
an alternate way to do a left click as I

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.750 
an alternate way to do a left click as I
can<00:01:04.500> instead<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.160> holding<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.550> down

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
can instead of just holding that down

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.090 
can instead of just holding that down
hold<00:01:06.330> down<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.660> right<00:01:06.930> finger<00:01:07.320> press<00:01:07.890> with

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
hold down with a right finger press with

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.670 
hold down with a right finger press with
a<00:01:08.130> left<00:01:08.520> nearby<00:01:09.300> and<00:01:09.660> then<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.810> get<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:09.990> left

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
a left nearby and then I get a left

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.620 
a left nearby and then I get a left
click<00:01:10.770> as<00:01:10.980> well<00:01:11.160> so<00:01:13.130> all<00:01:14.130> right<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.760> this

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
click as well so all right so this

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.710 
click as well so all right so this
essentially<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.260> the<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.270> basis<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
essentially is the is the basis of the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.510 
essentially is the is the basis of the
multi-touch<00:01:19.140> mouse<00:01:19.200> emulator<00:01:19.800> but<00:01:20.310> let's

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
multi-touch mouse emulator but let's

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.980 
multi-touch mouse emulator but let's
look<00:01:20.670> at<00:01:20.880> another<00:01:21.300> feature<00:01:21.660> which<00:01:21.810> is

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
look at another feature which is

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.280 
look at another feature which is
scrolling<00:01:22.620> so<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.490> move<00:01:23.730> use<00:01:24.090> an<00:01:24.900> anchor

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
scrolling so I can move use an anchor

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.690 
scrolling so I can move use an anchor
point<00:01:25.320> what<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.800> call<00:01:26.010> an<00:01:26.130> anchor<00:01:26.340> point<00:01:26.370> is<00:01:26.670> a

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
point what I call an anchor point is a

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.220 
point what I call an anchor point is a
point<00:01:26.760> that<00:01:27.000> doesn't<00:01:27.450> move<00:01:27.540> removes<00:01:27.960> very

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
point that doesn't move removes very

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.080 
point that doesn't move removes very
very<00:01:28.440> slightly<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:29.040> little<00:01:29.520> wobble<00:01:29.730> would<00:01:29.970> be

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
very slightly a little wobble would be

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.510 
very slightly a little wobble would be
okay<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.440> have<00:01:31.680> an<00:01:31.830> anchor<00:01:32.010> point<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
okay so you have an anchor point on the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.070 
okay so you have an anchor point on the
left<00:01:32.700> hand<00:01:32.880> side<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.300> the<00:01:33.540> right<00:01:33.720> hand<00:01:33.990> side

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
left hand side on the right hand side

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.230 
left hand side on the right hand side
you<00:01:35.040> simply<00:01:35.310> move<00:01:35.460> your<00:01:35.640> finger<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:35.910> and<00:01:36.120> down

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
you simply move your finger up and down

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.990 
you simply move your finger up and down
and<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.690> will<00:01:37.530> scroll<00:01:37.800> the<00:01:38.040> mouse<00:01:38.430> wheel<00:01:38.580> so

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
and that will scroll the mouse wheel so

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.110 
and that will scroll the mouse wheel so
here<00:01:39.180> I'm<00:01:39.270> using<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.570> inside

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
here I'm using that inside

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.890 
here I'm using that inside
of<00:01:40.360> a<00:01:40.540> web<00:01:41.200> page<00:01:41.230> so<00:01:42.040> I<00:01:42.070> can<00:01:42.610> surf<00:01:43.360> around<00:01:43.540> with
