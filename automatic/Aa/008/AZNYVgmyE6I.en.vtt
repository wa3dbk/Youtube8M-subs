00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.980 
smallest possible so normally I'm
between<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.400> six<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:37.970> an<00:02:38.090> eight<00:02:38.120> in<00:02:38.450> Australian

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
between a six and an eight in Australian

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.080 
between a six and an eight in Australian
so<00:02:39.230> most<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:39.770> these<00:02:39.890> pieces<00:02:40.130> are<00:02:40.340> an<00:02:40.760> extra

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
so most of these pieces are an extra

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.790 
so most of these pieces are an extra
small<00:02:41.360> or<00:02:41.570> small<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:42.200> next<00:02:42.440> piece<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:42.770> I

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
small or small the next piece that I

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.650 
small or small the next piece that I
ordered<00:02:43.070> are<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.580> short<00:02:43.940> tier<00:02:44.180> which<00:02:44.450> were

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
ordered are the short tier which were

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.300 
ordered are the short tier which were
probably<00:02:44.960> my<00:02:45.200> most<00:02:45.410> favored<00:02:45.860> ones<00:02:46.070> that<00:02:46.280> I

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
probably my most favored ones that I

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.950 
probably my most favored ones that I
ordered<00:02:46.610> but<00:02:46.850> they<00:02:47.000> don't<00:02:47.180> fit<00:02:47.390> as<00:02:47.540> well<00:02:47.570> in

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
ordered but they don't fit as well in

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.420 
ordered but they don't fit as well in
person<00:02:47.990> as<00:02:48.470> I'd<00:02:48.650> hoped<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:49.070> they're<00:02:49.160> made<00:02:49.310> of

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
person as I'd hoped and they're made of

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.920 
person as I'd hoped and they're made of
cotton<00:02:49.640> so<00:02:49.910> they're<00:02:50.090> really<00:02:50.180> nice<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.540> thick

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
cotton so they're really nice and thick

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.330 
cotton so they're really nice and thick
and<00:02:51.080> opaque<00:02:51.230> so<00:02:51.800> you're<00:02:51.920> not<00:02:51.980> going<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.220> see

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
and opaque so you're not going to see

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.010 
and opaque so you're not going to see
underwear<00:02:52.850> or<00:02:52.940> anything<00:02:53.300> through<00:02:53.600> them<00:02:53.750> but

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
underwear or anything through them but

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.480 
underwear or anything through them but
with<00:02:54.170> mine<00:02:54.350> they're<00:02:54.650> just<00:02:54.860> a<00:02:54.950> little<00:02:55.220> bit<00:02:55.340> too

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.160 
with mine they're just a little bit too
big<00:02:55.670> unfortunately<00:02:56.390> so<00:02:56.570> they<00:02:56.720> do<00:02:56.780> sit<00:02:57.080> a

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
big unfortunately so they do sit a

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.510 
big unfortunately so they do sit a
little<00:02:57.320> bit<00:02:57.560> loose<00:02:57.770> but<00:02:57.800> then<00:02:58.160> along<00:02:58.310> the

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
little bit loose but then along the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.770 
little bit loose but then along the
bottom<00:02:58.670> as<00:02:58.910> you<00:02:59.030> can<00:02:59.150> see<00:02:59.300> they<00:02:59.480> have<00:02:59.630> these

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
bottom as you can see they have these

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.810 
bottom as you can see they have these
really<00:02:59.959> nice<00:03:00.200> cut<00:03:00.560> mesh<00:03:00.830> out<00:03:01.070> detail<00:03:01.520> which<00:03:01.700> is

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
really nice cut mesh out detail which is

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.490 
really nice cut mesh out detail which is
why<00:03:02.000> I<00:03:02.030> got<00:03:02.300> these<00:03:02.420> in<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.720> first<00:03:02.900> place<00:03:03.050> and<00:03:03.440> i

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
why I got these in the first place and i

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.930 
why I got these in the first place and i
think<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.770> mesh<00:03:03.980> detail<00:03:04.370> at<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:04.550> bottom<00:03:04.850> just

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
think the mesh detail at the bottom just

think the mesh detail at the bottom just
makes<00:03:05.180> it<00:03:05.300> really<00:03:05.450> really<00:03:05.570> nice<00:03:05.990> and<00:03:06.200> dressy

simple because the shirt is so out there
now<00:05:03.420> for<00:05:03.480> the<00:05:03.630> last<00:05:03.780> thing<00:05:04.050> that<00:05:04.080> I<00:05:04.200> got

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
now for the last thing that I got

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.440 
now for the last thing that I got
unfortunately<00:05:05.160> it<00:05:05.340> doesn't<00:05:05.610> fit<00:05:05.910> me<00:05:06.030> exactly

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
unfortunately it doesn't fit me exactly

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.390 
unfortunately it doesn't fit me exactly
as<00:05:06.570> I<00:05:06.840> wanted<00:05:07.200> it<00:05:07.320> to<00:05:07.560> on<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.950> model<00:05:08.220> in<00:05:08.310> the

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
as I wanted it to on the model in the

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.620 
as I wanted it to on the model in the
picture<00:05:08.700> it<00:05:08.790> look<00:05:08.910> really<00:05:09.210> nice<00:05:09.360> and

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
picture it look really nice and

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.480 
picture it look really nice and
form-fitting<00:05:09.960> and<00:05:10.410> on<00:05:10.560> me<00:05:10.740> I<00:05:11.010> really<00:05:11.400> don't

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
form-fitting and on me I really don't

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.100 
form-fitting and on me I really don't
have<00:05:11.670> much<00:05:11.700> shape<00:05:12.120> so<00:05:12.360> it<00:05:12.390> doesn't<00:05:12.720> really<00:05:12.780> fit

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
have much shape so it doesn't really fit

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.080 
have much shape so it doesn't really fit

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
my body too well but i'll see if i can

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.220 
my body too well but i'll see if i can
get<00:05:15.150> it<00:05:15.300> tailored<00:05:15.480> or<00:05:15.780> something<00:05:16.020> like<00:05:16.170> that

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
get it tailored or something like that

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
was one size fits all so unfortunately I

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.130

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
what i can do it i'll see if i can make

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.890 
what i can do it i'll see if i can make
it<00:05:38.730> fit<00:05:38.910> a<00:05:38.940> little<00:05:39.240> bit<00:05:39.330> better<00:05:39.510> so<00:05:39.810> let's

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
it fit a little bit better so let's

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.210 
it fit a little bit better so let's
pretty<00:05:40.110> much<00:05:40.230> everything<00:05:40.650> that<00:05:40.680> i<00:05:40.830> had<00:05:41.070> to

that you pretty much saw so for the most

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.070 
that you pretty much saw so for the most
part<00:05:53.400> the<00:05:53.580> sizing<00:05:53.970> is<00:05:54.120> pretty<00:05:54.390> well<00:05:54.570> on<00:05:54.780> par
