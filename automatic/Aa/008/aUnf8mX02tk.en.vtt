00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Secrets of beautifying oils 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 Coldness affects my hair badly. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Closed spaces, central heating, and outside most of the time I have to wear a hat. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 I have to find a solution for damaged hair. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 Macadamia oil does wonders. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 I use it once a week as a mask. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 The oil is applied equally to the hair, so that the hair will absorb all its benefits. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 For even better results, wake your head with a warm towel. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 15 minutes later, after shampooing, my hair is rejuvenated, smooth and shiny. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 The feeling of fatigue is increasing every day 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 which is visible on my eyes. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 But I also know the solution for this problem. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 Flower Wrap Different reduces clutter, 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Avocado oil nourishes and protects the skin around the eyes. 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 That's what the cotton blazinice is 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 and let it operate for 10 minutes in the eyes. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 In the winter, because of the cold air and the wearing of long legs, the skin of my legs is dry. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 My solution is Argan Oil that rejuvenates the skin. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 I scatter the flowers of Orange Flower Orange by the feet 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 by subtracting Argan oil that is currently being absorbed. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Winter temperature has damaged my sensitive skin. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 I want to give her a sense of pleasure again. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Before applying moisturizing creams to dry skin, I wet a few oily oils. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 My skin is now dyed and ready for winter time. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Dry and damaged hair: Oil of macadamia 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Tired eyes: Avocado oil and Flower Hanger Different 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Reducing sleepiness and signs of aging and skin protection. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Dry skin: Argan oil 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 Rejuvenating dry skin, regenerating and restoring elasticity. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 Irritated skin: Nausea oil 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 Tendering and protecting sensitive skin, restoring softness and elasticity.
