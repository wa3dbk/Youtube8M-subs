00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:12.490
 Let's go and let's have three people Mike again Wood 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:16.359
 It is I would like to hear the enthusiasm from everyone 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:20.560
 At first I am in charge of all night Nippon gold from 10 pm on Thursday 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:24.800
 Feeling when talk was carried out from town Minko of Kubo Mitsurou's 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.380
 And please tell us about your enthusiasm 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.460
 Also 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.490
 Japan is a cartoonist Kubo Mitsurou 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.510
 Tan had 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:42.970
 When I was told by Nippon Broadcasting-san that I would not do it again, I often called out again 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:49.210
 I think it sounds like you would like to talk to him before, but once it was over last year 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:52.579
 There were a lot of things like this kind of feeling there, but we guys 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:56.539
 I have always been compared to Japanese as a former boyfriend, yes 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:01:01.429
 1 year v The number that he said he was going to get involved was a complicated feeling 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:03.949
 The baby to say or not it is said that looking at the farewell Well is there another little surely also soon 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:09.920
 Can you imagine there? 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:11.180
 We have not entered each other's office when there was an offer, so we have no office 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.570
 That was the cut is weaker 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:18.150
 It's Urinari ç“œ 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:22.470
 I do not even what variety is growing Toka back and entered the operation once the other party in the sale is Uri 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:28.409
 The suggestion that I can only do to sell it is easy for me 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:31.950
 That all means were sold Nante I think we should I cut the neck at any time but it is But already this time 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.590
 Instead unchanged with us unchanged last sanity 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.100
 Same law 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:40.149
 I would like to air was already called 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.920
 Because I have chosen here is that Tteyuu'll go out to like 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:46.180
 I see a teapot 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.840
 Somehow the time zone is so good each two times have zero time 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.580
 And there was a late night time but this time say from 10 o'clock 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.560
 By Yes of a little early half 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.000
 What should have been said lightly that the jokes softening I guess what went to refrain from some 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.840
 The petition was said to Hiyama 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.910
 Yes, I'm not going to was telling us such separately 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:11.930
 But quite the medium Well, I'm from the old days and I thought that radio of prime time 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.569
 Also how he will listen to before going to sleep better hear from that this's time zone 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.709
 Turn off the television 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:21.299
 Time to listen and study when you are prepared before going to bed 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:27.540
 Unlike midnight I think also be nice If you Could hear new mouth to the people 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:32.189
 I want to accelerate new customers, so I 'm going to go, yet I am relaxed from Nippon Broadcasting side 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.590
 It seems that the lower news item is said not to care so much even if it is said to be light 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:38.680
 Drone 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:40.060
 Let's speak to the Well it safely make sure that the I mean if okay jokes of up to 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.150
 I think 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.680
 To the extent that not to apply the face of a board this past twice already firmly 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.420
 Considerably everywhere sides of detection it is not alive as a lesson is or than those of hard other Tsun 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.440

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.480
 I 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:30.600
 I think that I want to do my best so that I can do my best relationship so that I can not break my head 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.580
 I hear that while being asked variously to the senior Mrs. 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.270
 To overflowing really Variety 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.240
 I think if I could do the program I will do my best 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:44.820
 If I see something in a project book, I'm already the third generation j soul who is now in a blaze 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:49.950
 250 seniors also read in more and more reading great roots members of brothers 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:52.569
 It is written that the source is going to be a gorgeous night, but how is it today ? 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.079
 Well a big group called exile tribe 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:04:01.480
 9 and to that really ldh call a lot of guest 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:03.670
 Part of the I say this is masu Toka or was our activity, you'll know more 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.959
 I wonder Toka that way in a variety or was 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:12.159
 We think that we are shy that you can dig deeper and know us 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.560
 What kind of image did you have about radio? I was that student 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:19.310
 study 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:23.360
 After Toka or heard that is is that his usually Toka listen pretty music Toka in the car ineffective in 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:28.340
 No genre is also a good putt and it is the study of No. various music at the timing to say 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:32.930
 Has become a real strong is in or a Nde are of sensibility 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:36.620
 That it's a pretty talkative person when the private to hear the good people of talk also with it 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:41.240
 That a love talking your many people such do I do that quite 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:46.390
 Well feel like a mood maker even among the third generation j soul brothers 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:50.750
 I'm working hard at that, I want to ask Mr. Yamashita, but this 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:52.870
 Well I want to select various members and I also want to hear the story 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.100
 But that 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.910
 Dry material 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.190
 After all private talk of the member is quite that 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.630
 For example 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:07.740
 Even if there is a little no in TV program or concert, it is Otsu book thing 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.900
 I don't think there is much I can hear, but I'm getting more and more like that. 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.670
 It looks like 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.820
 That's right 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:22.260
 Members are really together often 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:25.770
 Well this even though I'm mesh also share the 5 hours to eat together 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:30.120
 A little way maybe it but I know 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:32.840
 I don't know the listeners, so I thought it would be nice if I could convey that well 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:37.550
 It is a part but it is a private part 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.180
 It is a chance that you have a taste like this recently, or you know the individual a little 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.030
 Because I think 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:46.990
 Sano we thought that would like to hear firm that recently a little of Erie Mr. 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:49.910
 That I was There are many something even talk of love this even talk like say bedding 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:52.320
 Let's take a look on the radio, so let's get Rutena 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:55.320
 Man 's Love Bananka 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:00.150
 Well Well that 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:03.150
 I do I kind of talk can also be well or than it Well firm 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:07.320
 Thinking fan's eyes firmly 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:12.129
 Since doing the artist as servants performer would do such and its music launch 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:17.909
 Or say whether Well palette began to you but as much as possible resale Mr. say is 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:17.909
 I want to talk to you to know the individual well Yes 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:26.150
 But if you can do it, for example, it would be light in a weekly magazine etc. 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.150
 It is to say that I want you to 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:37.910
 Or are you trying to directly article come easy trying to'm not radio a great deal 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:41.530
 Cormorant be nice Once you get used to 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.530
 There is no opportunity but it is quite easy 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:49.710
 So there you'll I tired after the pastor as a request 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:53.090
