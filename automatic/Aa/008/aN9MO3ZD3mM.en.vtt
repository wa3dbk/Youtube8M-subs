might<00:02:24.660> have<00:02:24.750> been<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> good<00:02:25.050> choice<00:02:25.290> from<00:02:25.530> for

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
might have been a good choice from for

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.590 
might have been a good choice from for
me<00:02:26.130> but<00:02:26.760> she's<00:02:26.970> already<00:02:27.150> playing<00:02:27.420> the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
me but she's already playing the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.060 
me but she's already playing the
witching<00:02:27.870> into<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.110> woods<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.440> she's<00:02:28.980> not

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
witching into the woods so she's not

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.530 
witching into the woods so she's not
going<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.310> be<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:29.490> sideral<00:02:29.670> also<00:02:30.270> there's<00:02:30.450> a

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
going to be in sideral also there's a

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.730 
going to be in sideral also there's a
scene<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.840> sit<00:02:30.960> around<00:02:31.110> being<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.470> printer

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
scene of sit around being the printer

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.710 
scene of sit around being the printer
for<00:02:31.920> she<00:02:32.040> goes<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.370> fall<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:32.940> mean<00:02:33.600> that's

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
for she goes to the fall I mean that's

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.660 
for she goes to the fall I mean that's
obviously<00:02:34.500> not<00:02:34.590> in<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.980> Disney<00:02:35.250> movie<00:02:35.430> at<00:02:35.520> all

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
obviously not in the Disney movie at all

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.760 
obviously not in the Disney movie at all
which<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:36.630> good<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:36.930> mean<00:02:37.260> they're<00:02:37.560> clearly

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
which is good I mean they're clearly

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.560 
which is good I mean they're clearly
developing<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.820> Prince<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.120> little<00:02:39.300> bit<00:02:39.390> more

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
developing the Prince a little bit more

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.270 
developing the Prince a little bit more
which<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:39.780> always<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.500> plus<00:02:40.560> for<00:02:40.860> developing

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
which is always a plus for developing

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.060 
which is always a plus for developing
characters<00:02:42.090> however<00:02:42.630> cindarella<00:02:43.290> herself<00:02:43.860> is

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
characters however cindarella herself is

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.100 
characters however cindarella herself is
a<00:02:44.100> really<00:02:44.610> developed<00:02:45.150> character<00:02:45.540> due<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:46.020> her

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
a really developed character due to her

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.750 
a really developed character due to her
sequels<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.770> even<00:02:47.070> her<00:02:47.160> movie<00:02:47.370> she's<00:02:47.520> a<00:02:47.550> lot

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
sequels and even her movie she's a lot

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.100 
sequels and even her movie she's a lot
more<00:02:47.790> developed<00:02:48.300> than<00:02:48.330> sleeping<00:02:48.630> beauty<00:02:48.930> and

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
more developed than sleeping beauty and

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.690 
more developed than sleeping beauty and
a<00:02:49.170> lot<00:02:49.290> more<00:02:49.320> developing<00:02:49.770> Snow<00:02:50.010> White<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:50.490> I

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
a lot more developing Snow White so I

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.440 
a lot more developing Snow White so I
don't<00:02:51.240> see<00:02:51.600> a<00:02:51.630> true<00:02:52.170> reason<00:02:52.800> to<00:02:53.460> having<00:02:53.940> this

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
who's already developed but I guess it's

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.060 
who's already developed but I guess it's
just<00:03:51.960> another<00:03:52.290> way<00:03:52.440> for<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.710> distant<00:03:52.950> umber

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
just another way for the distant umber

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.830 
just another way for the distant umber

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
to make money the trailer was good I

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.260

thought it was okay I mean it's kind of

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.730 
thought it was okay I mean it's kind of
a<00:03:57.360> contradicting<00:03:57.870> statement<00:03:58.290> I<00:03:58.350> thought<00:03:58.560> it

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740

was a good trailer for a trailer but I

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.470 
was a good trailer for a trailer but I
thought<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.400> was<00:04:02.550> okay<00:04:02.940> because<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:03.150> don't<00:04:03.330> see
