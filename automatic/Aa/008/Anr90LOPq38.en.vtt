a couple seconds so yeah this isn't a

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.800 
a couple seconds so yeah this isn't a
good<00:02:54.810> toner<00:02:55.050> if<00:02:55.380> you're<00:02:55.910> not<00:02:56.910> into<00:02:57.240> smelling

one at all good toners to use would be

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.600 
one at all good toners to use would be
like<00:03:10.920> Burt's<00:03:11.190> Bees<00:03:11.930> carrot<00:03:12.930> seed<00:03:13.110> oil<00:03:13.320> or<00:03:13.680> you

have Alba Botanica toners but for me I

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.900 
have Alba Botanica toners but for me I

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790
