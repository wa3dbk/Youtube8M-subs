00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.410

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.590
 we'll talk a little bit about 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.930

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.000
 and of course solutions to give for 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.700
 overcome bitterness to overcome 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.950
 bitterness is to remove it especially from 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.710
 our life the text I thought 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.260
 for you especially and Psalm 37 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.510
 it says do not inherit against 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.400
 bad guys and do not envy those who do 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.040
 badly confides thouars the eternal and practical 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.040
 the good and the country for abode and the 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.190
 fidelity for food makes the internet 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:47.030
 and lices and he will give you what your 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.610
 heart desires recommend your fate to 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.480
 the eternal but in him you trust and 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.730
 he will act it will make appear injustice 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.700
 like light and have right like the 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.030
 sun at noon silences in front 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.009
 the eternal hope in him does not inherit 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.930
 against whoever succeeds in these voices 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.950
 against the man who overcomes these 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:13.130
 bad designs let anger 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.750
 give up the fury does not go away because in 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.229
 effect the bitterness can scream of 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.910
 irritation of understanding and can 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.550
 block us from our situation because we 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.780
 wonders why it does not work 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.390
 why others have success is 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.250
 not me why life does not smile at me 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.440
 why do I always stay 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.479
 in the same problems the story 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.520
 next one illustrates a little bit of all this 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.220
 and most importantly she gives us keys to 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.560
 solutions the divine solutions and 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.380
 supernatural solutions within the reach of 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.099
 each from the text of 1 samuel 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.610
 chapter 1 is the story of failure to 

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:52.459
 the sea ​​of ​​the prophet samuel before 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.039
 become the mother of samuel 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:57.140
 she was married to a man who had 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.789
 already another wife and she lived in 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.739
 because of this a complicated situation 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.630
 which caused him bitterness because 

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:04.970
 the other wife had kids but 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.009
 anne was sterile 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.619
 this sterility but posed a lot of 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:14.870
 problems of course we can understand 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:18.349
 but to her allowed some by that 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.640
 but to the bitterness of coming into a corner 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.900
 from his heart 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.260
 gnawed weigh down his life and saddened 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.170
 distressed his soul 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.730
 the Bible tells us that l is and godly 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.689
 that she feared God and that she is 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.650
 part pray 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:38.049
 prayer is always the right solution 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.620
 and we are told this interesting text at 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:45.129
 chapter 1 verse 10 bitterness in 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.980
 the soul she took to the eternal and wept 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.400
 a lot of bitterness in the soul one can 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.060
 pray 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.670
 even with bitterness in the soul itself 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.640
 being filled with bad things one can 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.659
 still pray and shout especially to god who 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.489
 us as we that it comprises 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.810
 we do not need to tell him lord 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.280
 do you understand what I want 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.019
 say 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.090
 because he always understands us there is 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.510
 today where you are 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.840
 there was secret place where you are 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:18.099
 guests where I am invited to go and 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.980
 to immerse myself in his presence to me 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:23.170
 return in his presence to release my 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.609
 heart of everything that weighs me of everything 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.090
 who charges me with everything that upsets me 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:32.560
 because I need to let go in front 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:35.769
 god who understands me because even tears 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.250
 are counted the psalm 59 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:43.629
 yes 50 by which 56 for 9 tells us that 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:46.720
 god counts the tears in his off and 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:49.260
 he is inscribed in his book he is good 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.930
 to cry before God is liberating 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:56.260
 anne did not receive right away 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.030
 answer she came a long time in the 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.849
 presence of god before receiving the 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.799
 answer and come year after year 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:05.620
 the solution did not arrive the child 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.449
 did not arrive she prayed long 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.959
 with patience and perseverance 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:13.599
 she prayed in faith and in the tent 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.060
 that something is happening this time 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.340
 of expectations is always difficult to 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.340
 believe that god heard us while 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.340
 waiting for his answer but the day 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.840
 will come where the answer comes and in 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:31.449
 waiting is the heart of haan who is 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.770
 touched and his look will change that's what 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.200
 that I would like to point out because 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.110
 it's the job that the lord 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.720
 would like to do 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.750
 may God reoperate in us in everyone 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.060
 of us is to give us his look 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.710
 on the situation 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.690
 bitterness and suffering can we 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.250
 center sunu even where we can see only 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:56.390

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.890
