00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
vengeance a lot of big sunspots are

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.700 
vengeance a lot of big sunspots are
coming<00:00:13.980> back<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:15.890> a<00:00:17.900> lot<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.050> activity

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
coming back in and a lot of activity

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.970 
coming back in and a lot of activity
popping<00:00:20.160> up<00:00:20.390> after<00:00:21.390> what<00:00:21.720> was<00:00:21.930> supposed<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.830> be

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
popping up after what was supposed to be

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.509 
popping up after what was supposed to be
the<00:00:23.160> peak<00:00:23.930> was<00:00:24.930> quieter<00:00:25.529> than<00:00:25.769> normal<00:00:25.830> so

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
the peak was quieter than normal so

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.179 
the peak was quieter than normal so
everything's<00:00:27.269> been<00:00:27.539> out<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.019> whack<00:00:28.349> with<00:00:28.380> Sun

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
everything's been out of whack with Sun

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.770 
everything's been out of whack with Sun
and<00:00:30.500> here<00:00:31.500> lately<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.520> coming<00:00:33.090> back<00:00:33.329> with

and here lately it is coming back with
it<00:00:33.989> increased<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:35.040> flurry<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.969> activity<00:00:36.980> a<00:00:37.980> lot

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
it increased a flurry of activity a lot

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.520 
it increased a flurry of activity a lot
of<00:00:39.379> HF<00:00:40.379> blackouts<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.399> flares<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.960> all<00:00:43.230> that

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
of HF blackouts and flares and all that

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.150 
of HF blackouts and flares and all that
wonderful<00:00:43.739> stuff<00:00:44.870> so<00:00:45.870> don't<00:00:46.350> forget<00:00:46.710> about

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
wonderful stuff so don't forget about

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.580 
wonderful stuff so don't forget about
the<00:00:47.489> Sun<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:47.879> because<00:00:48.420> 2012<00:00:49.320> didn't<00:00:50.129> happen

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
the Sun just because 2012 didn't happen

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.680 
the Sun just because 2012 didn't happen
the<00:00:52.590> Sun<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.190> still<00:00:53.520> there<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.480> could

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
the Sun is still there and it could

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.930 
the Sun is still there and it could
still<00:00:55.020> throw<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.289> temper<00:00:55.649> tantrum<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.579> send

and hey big big things happen now just

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.109 
and hey big big things happen now just
because<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.040> big<00:01:32.220> thing<00:01:32.460> happens<00:01:32.880> doesn't

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
because the big thing happens doesn't

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.770 
because the big thing happens doesn't
mean<00:01:33.329> it's<00:01:33.509> pointed<00:01:34.229> towards<00:01:34.590> Earth<00:01:35.180> but<00:01:36.180> when

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
mean it's pointed towards Earth but when

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.319 
mean it's pointed towards Earth but when
it<00:01:36.869> happens<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.770> look<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.340> see<00:01:39.000> if<00:01:39.030> it's

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
it happens you can look and see if it's

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.429 
it happens you can look and see if it's
in<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.979> plane<00:01:41.119> with<00:01:42.119> earth<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.930> get<00:01:43.229> concerned

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
in the plane with earth I get concerned

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.429 
in the plane with earth I get concerned
when<00:01:43.920> there<00:01:44.159> are<00:01:44.310> huge<00:01:44.700> sun<00:01:45.000> spots<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:46.170> are

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
when there are huge sun spots that are

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.980 
when there are huge sun spots that are
in<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.680> same<00:01:46.920> orbital<00:01:47.640> plane<00:01:48.030> as<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.450> earth

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
in the same orbital plane as the earth

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.530 
in the same orbital plane as the earth
you<00:01:49.680> know<00:01:49.799> on<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.040> Sun<00:01:50.310> when<00:01:50.610> they're<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.329> our

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
you know on the Sun when they're in our

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.760 
you know on the Sun when they're in our
orbital<00:01:52.259> plane<00:01:53.869> those<00:01:54.869> are<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.290> ones<00:01:55.590> we

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
orbital plane those are the ones we

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.350 
orbital plane those are the ones we
really<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.369> watch<00:01:56.640> out<00:01:56.909> for<00:01:56.939> because

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
really have to watch out for because

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.330 
really have to watch out for because
that's<00:01:57.600> where<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.840> really<00:01:58.200> big<00:01:58.380> flares<00:01:58.829> come

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
that's where the really big flares come

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.260 
that's where the really big flares come
from<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:01.159> things<00:02:02.159> are<00:02:02.340> getting<00:02:02.430> active<00:02:03.030> right

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
from and things are getting active right

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.069 
from and things are getting active right
now<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:04.200> usually<00:02:05.040> in<00:02:05.430> wintertime<00:02:05.880> hf<00:02:06.719> clears

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
now and usually in wintertime hf clears

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.410 
now and usually in wintertime hf clears
up<00:02:07.320> but<00:02:07.680> i<00:02:07.950> don't<00:02:08.729> know<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.209> has<00:02:09.390> been

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
up but i don't know this has been

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.050 
up but i don't know this has been
unusual<00:02:10.550> solar<00:02:11.550> cycle

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
unusual solar cycle

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.729 
unusual solar cycle
so<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:14.500> could<00:02:15.489> say<00:02:15.700> get<00:02:16.300> ready<00:02:16.510> for<00:02:16.870> solar

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
so I could say get ready for solar

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.640 
so I could say get ready for solar
Armageddon<00:02:18.640> or<00:02:18.970> what<00:02:19.840> was<00:02:19.959> that<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.560> the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
just did a show called lights out yeah

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.199 
just did a show called lights out yeah
that<00:02:29.560> everybody<00:02:30.130> is<00:02:30.340> going<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.640> run<00:02:30.910> around

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
that everybody is going to run around

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.240 
that everybody is going to run around
and<00:02:31.360> chop<00:02:31.569> each<00:02:31.720> other's<00:02:32.080> heads<00:02:32.319> off<00:02:32.560> get

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
and chop each other's heads off get
