K&amp;N Racing stickers that makes my truck
go<00:00:59.870> faster<00:01:00.610> so<00:01:01.870> I'll<00:01:02.870> take<00:01:03.050> it<00:01:03.110> out<00:01:03.290> and<00:01:03.469> start

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
go faster so I'll take it out and start

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.989 
go faster so I'll take it out and start
installing<00:01:04.009> it<00:01:04.339> I'll<00:01:04.429> show<00:01:04.579> how<00:01:04.639> that's<00:01:04.819> done

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:04.999 
installing it I'll show how that's done

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:07.779 
installing it I'll show how that's done
so<00:01:05.299> I'll<00:01:05.420> be<00:01:05.539> right<00:01:05.630> back<00:01:06.009> okay<00:01:07.009> so<00:01:07.490> here's<00:01:07.729> the

so I'll be right back okay so here's the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:10.359 
so I'll be right back okay so here's the
airbox<00:01:08.149> underneath<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.689> hood<00:01:08.840> it's<00:01:09.109> on<00:01:09.619> the

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
airbox underneath the hood it's on the

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.149 
airbox underneath the hood it's on the
driver<00:01:10.969> side<00:01:11.060> in<00:01:11.359> the<00:01:11.420> US<00:01:11.450> I<00:01:12.159> disconnected

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
driver side in the US I disconnected

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.090 
driver side in the US I disconnected
this<00:01:13.420> plug<00:01:14.420> in<00:01:14.600> here<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:14.929> just<00:01:15.139> squeeze<00:01:15.859> right

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
this plug in here you just squeeze right

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.580 
this plug in here you just squeeze right
here<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:16.579> pull<00:01:16.969> it<00:01:17.060> out<00:01:17.119> gently<00:01:17.509> with<00:01:17.689> maybe

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
here and pull it out gently with maybe

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.080 
here and pull it out gently with maybe
used<00:01:18.829> two<00:01:19.009> hands<00:01:19.279> so<00:01:19.399> you<00:01:19.490> don't<00:01:19.639> damage<00:01:19.850> it

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
used two hands so you don't damage it

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.449 
used two hands so you don't damage it
should<00:01:20.959> be<00:01:21.049> two<00:01:21.229> clips<00:01:21.560> here<00:01:21.740> that<00:01:22.039> hold<00:01:22.279> this

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:22.459 
should be two clips here that hold this

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:23.679 
should be two clips here that hold this
into<00:01:23.060> place

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
into place

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:29.309 
into place
and<00:01:24.459> then<00:01:25.459> this<00:01:25.609> sort<00:01:26.329> of<00:01:26.509> should<00:01:26.920> rotate<00:01:27.920> out

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
and then this sort of should rotate out

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:31.719 
and then this sort of should rotate out
and<00:01:30.319> you<00:01:31.069> should<00:01:31.130> be<00:01:31.219> able<00:01:31.279> to<00:01:31.369> get<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.579> old

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
and you should be able to get the old

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.809 
and you should be able to get the old
filter<00:01:32.149> out<00:01:32.329> which<00:01:32.990> is<00:01:33.109> right<00:01:33.349> here<00:01:33.819> still

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
filter out which is right here still

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:36.269 
filter out which is right here still
very<00:01:35.060> clean<00:01:35.299> I<00:01:35.329> just<00:01:35.659> changed<00:01:35.929> it<00:01:35.990> recently

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:36.279 
very clean I just changed it recently

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:40.919 
very clean I just changed it recently
and<00:01:37.569> the<00:01:38.569> new<00:01:38.749> one<00:01:38.899> should<00:01:38.929> just<00:01:39.319> pop<00:01:39.529> right<00:01:39.590> in

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
and the new one should just pop right in

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.809 
and the new one should just pop right in
to<00:01:41.929> the<00:01:42.049> same<00:01:42.289> location<00:01:45.159> so<00:01:46.159> if<00:01:46.310> I<00:01:46.399> can<00:01:46.520> get<00:01:46.639> it

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
to the same location so if I can get it

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.139 
to the same location so if I can get it
unbagged<00:01:47.240> here

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
unbagged here

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.539 
unbagged here
we<00:01:49.750> will<00:01:50.020> slide<00:01:50.350> it<00:01:50.500> in<00:01:50.619> there<00:01:50.799> and<00:01:51.009> see<00:01:51.369> if<00:01:51.399> it

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
we will slide it in there and see if it

00:01:51.549 --> 00:02:00.679 
we will slide it in there and see if it
goes<00:01:51.670> in<00:01:54.659> okay<00:01:55.659> so<00:01:56.409> let's<00:01:56.979> see<00:01:57.189> what<00:01:57.369> happens

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.910 

okay<00:02:01.689> so<00:02:01.990> it<00:02:02.319> fits<00:02:02.500> right<00:02:02.679> in<00:02:02.859> there<00:02:03.069> like<00:02:03.280> that

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
okay so it fits right in there like that

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.620 
okay so it fits right in there like that
it's<00:02:05.920> kind<00:02:06.100> of<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.219> snug<00:02:06.490> fit<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:07.360> then<00:02:07.509> I<00:02:07.600> put

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
it's kind of a snug fit so then I put

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.499 
it's kind of a snug fit so then I put
this<00:02:07.899> back<00:02:08.170> on<00:02:08.429> snap<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:09.459> back<00:02:09.640> down<00:02:10.000> put<00:02:10.390> this

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
this back on snap it back down put this

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.990 
this back on snap it back down put this
back<00:02:10.720> in<00:02:10.989> or<00:02:11.200> ready<00:02:11.530> to<00:02:11.620> go<00:02:11.799> and<00:02:12.220> I'll<00:02:12.610> write<00:02:12.849> in

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
back in or ready to go and I'll write in

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.559 
back in or ready to go and I'll write in
the<00:02:13.120> comment<00:02:13.510> section<00:02:14.220> if<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:16.209> performance

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
the comment section if the performance

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.930 
the comment section if the performance
improves<00:02:17.110> over<00:02:17.500> at<00:02:17.950> one<00:02:18.069> or<00:02:18.190> two<00:02:18.220> tank<00:02:18.610> folds

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
improves over at one or two tank folds

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.750 
improves over at one or two tank folds
you<00:02:18.970> have<00:02:19.209> to<00:02:19.360> let<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.660> ECU<00:02:20.110> adjust<00:02:20.579> also<00:02:21.579> I'll

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
you have to let the ECU adjust also I'll

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.000 
you have to let the ECU adjust also I'll
want<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.000> put<00:02:22.120> this<00:02:22.209> sticker<00:02:22.510> on<00:02:22.720> here<00:02:23.010> to
