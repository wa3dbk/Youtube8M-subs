all<00:00:00.539> the<00:00:00.690> parts<00:00:01.020> of<00:00:01.199> the<00:00:01.589> outhouse<00:00:02.310> are<00:00:02.610> now<00:00:02.790> in

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
all the parts of the outhouse are now in

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.000 
all the parts of the outhouse are now in
the<00:00:04.049> same<00:00:04.319> group<00:00:04.859> in<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.220> same<00:00:05.520> family<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:07.010> if

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
the same group in the same family and if

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.110 
the same group in the same family and if
I<00:00:08.220> move<00:00:08.460> one<00:00:08.760> part<00:00:10.460> all<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.670> parts<00:00:11.969> move

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
I move one part all the parts move

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.240 
I move one part all the parts move
together<00:00:12.330> whereas<00:00:12.870> if<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.349> didn't<00:00:13.650> add<00:00:13.980> them

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
together whereas if I didn't add them

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.279 
together whereas if I didn't add them
into<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.610> same<00:00:15.139> grouping<00:00:16.580> they<00:00:18.109> would<00:00:19.109> move

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
into the same grouping they would move

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.920 
into the same grouping they would move
separately<00:00:21.859> they're<00:00:22.859> not<00:00:22.980> joined<00:00:23.930> they're

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
separately they're not joined they're

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.679 
separately they're not joined they're
just<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> same<00:00:25.680> group<00:00:26.070> as<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:27.240> difference

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
just in the same group as a difference

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.750 
just in the same group as a difference
if<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.320> had<00:00:28.500> joined<00:00:28.859> them<00:00:29.130> using<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.460> joint

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
if I had joined them using the joint

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.959 
if I had joined them using the joint
tool<00:00:30.060> which<00:00:30.720> will<00:00:30.900> look<00:00:31.080> at<00:00:31.230> much<00:00:31.439> later<00:00:31.969> they

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
tool which will look at much later they

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.870 
tool which will look at much later they
would<00:00:33.500> be<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.739> same<00:00:34.980> object<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:35.640> they<00:00:35.760> are

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
would be the same object but they are

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.700 
would be the same object but they are
still<00:00:36.090> separate<00:00:36.480> objects<00:00:36.899> they're

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
still separate objects they're

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.799 
still separate objects they're
independent<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.610> they<00:00:38.790> are<00:00:39.450> grouped

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
independent but they are grouped

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.869 
independent but they are grouped
together<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.350> they<00:00:40.469> move<00:00:40.680> together<00:00:40.890> there's<00:00:41.790> a

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
together so they move together there's a

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.799 
together so they move together there's a
difference<00:00:42.270> there<00:00:43.910> there's<00:00:44.910> one<00:00:45.180> last<00:00:45.390> step

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
difference there there's one last step

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.680 
difference there there's one last step
that<00:00:46.079> we<00:00:46.530> need<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.739> perform<00:00:47.190> before<00:00:47.370> our<00:00:47.969> model

that we need to perform before our model
is<00:00:48.750> ready<00:00:49.020> for<00:00:49.260> use<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> game<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.280> ready

start<00:01:09.869> with<00:01:10.110> we're<00:01:10.770> just<00:01:10.860> going<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.310> to

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
start with we're just going to have to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.770 
start with we're just going to have to
cover<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:12.869> model<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:13.799> one<00:01:14.210> overall<00:01:15.210> texture

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
cover the model with one overall texture

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.499 
cover the model with one overall texture
and<00:01:16.110> that's<00:01:16.650> because<00:01:16.860> MSTS<00:01:17.759> requires<00:01:18.240> that

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
and that's because MSTS requires that

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.200 
and that's because MSTS requires that
every<00:01:18.780> surface<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.680> textured<00:01:20.640> otherwise<00:01:20.970> it

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
every surface is textured otherwise it

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.719 
every surface is textured otherwise it
will<00:01:21.450> fail<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:22.049> export<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.710> won't<00:01:22.920> it'll

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
will fail to export and it won't it'll

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.940 
will fail to export and it won't it'll

crash the boat of the game when we go to

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.140 
crash the boat of the game when we go to
load<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.369> up<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.710> panel<00:01:29.549> we've<00:01:29.729> we've

load it up so in this panel we've we've

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.330 
load it up so in this panel we've we've
got<00:01:30.450> down<00:01:30.750> different<00:01:31.140> panels<00:01:31.470> up<00:01:31.619> here<00:01:31.799> we'll

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
got down different panels up here we'll

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.080 
got down different panels up here we'll
go<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:33.409> material<00:01:34.409> panel<00:01:35.060> which<00:01:36.060> is

go to the material panel which is

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.760 
go to the material panel which is
represented<00:01:36.720> by<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.930> paint<00:01:37.850> bottle<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.770> in

represented by the paint bottle and in
the<00:01:41.130> texture<00:01:41.640> library<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:42.329> will<00:01:42.479> click<00:01:42.689> on<00:01:42.899> one

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the texture library we will click on one

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.330 
the texture library we will click on one
of<00:01:43.649> these<00:01:43.890> textures

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
of these textures

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.279 
of these textures
it<00:01:45.909> doesn't<00:01:46.210> matter<00:01:46.359> which<00:01:46.509> one<00:01:46.570> is<00:01:46.899> just<00:01:47.079> to

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
it doesn't matter which one is just to

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:48.749 
it doesn't matter which one is just to
like<00:01:47.590> an<00:01:47.710> undercoat<00:01:48.159> that's<00:01:48.460> going<00:01:48.640> to<00:01:48.700> be

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
like an undercoat that's going to be

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.370 
like an undercoat that's going to be
covered<00:01:49.090> up<00:01:49.179> later<00:01:50.049> and<00:01:50.850> select<00:01:51.850> this<00:01:52.380> granite

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
covered up later and select this granite

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.300 
covered up later and select this granite
looking<00:01:54.189> one<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:55.450> then<00:01:55.929> you<00:01:56.350> go<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.619> this

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
looking one and then you go to this

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.240 
looking one and then you go to this
picture<00:01:58.060> which<00:01:58.210> is<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.530> little<00:01:59.530> landscape

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
picture which is a little landscape

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.819 
picture which is a little landscape
image<00:02:00.670> with<00:02:00.909> a<00:02:00.939> red<00:02:01.329> square<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:02.229> that's

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
image with a red square and that's

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.819 
image with a red square and that's
called<00:02:03.069> the<00:02:03.310> crop<00:02:03.579> texture<00:02:04.649> function<00:02:05.649> and

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
called the crop texture function and

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.680 
called the crop texture function and
we'll<00:02:06.189> click<00:02:06.520> on<00:02:06.670> that<00:02:08.910> when<00:02:09.910> we<00:02:10.030> click<00:02:10.330> on<00:02:10.509> the

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
we'll click on that when we click on the

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.860 
we'll click on that when we click on the
crop<00:02:10.959> texture<00:02:11.470> button<00:02:11.830> we<00:02:12.310> end<00:02:12.730> up<00:02:12.970> with<00:02:13.209> a

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
crop texture button we end up with a

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.380 
crop texture button we end up with a
full<00:02:14.739> screen<00:02:14.980> view<00:02:15.370> of<00:02:15.489> our<00:02:15.640> texture<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.299> this

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
full screen view of our texture and this

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.750 
full screen view of our texture and this
one<00:02:16.599> happens<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:17.049> be<00:02:17.140> 512<00:02:18.069> by<00:02:19.060> 512<00:02:19.840> pixels<00:02:20.760> now

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
one happens to be 512 by 512 pixels now

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.559 
one happens to be 512 by 512 pixels now
we<00:02:22.390> grab<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.690> square<00:02:23.170> section<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.829> this<00:02:23.920> texture

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
we grab a square section of this texture

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.000 
we grab a square section of this texture
just<00:02:25.569> play<00:02:25.750> click<00:02:26.049> dragging<00:02:26.500> like<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.860> would

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.170 
going back to the materials panel I will
make<00:05:30.250> a<00:05:30.520> new<00:05:30.760> selection<00:05:31.090> from<00:05:31.479> the<00:05:31.570> texture<00:05:32.440> of

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
make a new selection from the texture of

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:45.060 
make a new selection from the texture of
the<00:05:34.180> wall<00:05:40.590> and<00:05:42.389> I'll<00:05:43.389> rotate<00:05:43.660> the<00:05:44.320> model<00:05:44.500> so

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
the wall and I'll rotate the model so

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.520 
the wall and I'll rotate the model so
you<00:05:45.130> can<00:05:45.310> see<00:05:45.550> the<00:05:45.729> side<00:05:45.970> better<00:05:46.350> select<00:05:47.350> that

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
you can see the side better select that

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:53.790 
you can see the side better select that
face<00:05:49.500> go<00:05:50.500> to<00:05:50.560> the<00:05:50.710> operations<00:05:52.470> and<00:05:53.470> apply<00:05:53.770> it

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
face go to the operations and apply it

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.220 
face go to the operations and apply it
and<00:05:54.960> to<00:05:55.960> the<00:05:56.050> back<00:05:56.260> same<00:05:56.949> thing

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.230 
and to the back same thing

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:04.320 
and to the back same thing
and<00:06:00.070> to<00:06:00.490> the<00:06:00.580> last<00:06:00.820> side<00:06:03.000> and<00:06:04.000> there's<00:06:04.180> our

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
and to the last side and there's our

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.060 
and to the last side and there's our
model<00:06:06.750> the<00:06:07.750> walls<00:06:08.020> of<00:06:08.320> the<00:06:08.470> outhouse<00:06:08.860> are

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
model the walls of the outhouse are

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:17.270 
model the walls of the outhouse are
fully<00:06:09.310> textured<00:06:10.270> and<00:06:11.610> it<00:06:12.610> looks<00:06:12.790> fairly<00:06:13.500> okay

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.190 

there<00:06:18.280> is<00:06:18.370> one<00:06:18.580> thing<00:06:18.790> about<00:06:19.060> texturing<00:06:19.780> there

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
there is one thing about texturing there

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.340 
there is one thing about texturing there
are<00:06:20.380> options<00:06:20.560> you<00:06:21.130> can<00:06:21.280> use<00:06:21.610> to<00:06:22.320> try<00:06:23.320> and

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.350 
are options you can use to try and

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.550 
are options you can use to try and
simulate<00:06:23.800> certain<00:06:24.430> materials<00:06:25.240> and<00:06:26.230> I<00:06:26.290> didn't

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
simulate certain materials and I didn't

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.950 
simulate certain materials and I didn't
do<00:06:26.740> that<00:06:26.950> so<00:06:27.250> I'm<00:06:27.340> going<00:06:27.490> to<00:06:27.520> undo<00:06:27.940> all<00:06:28.630> those

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
do that so I'm going to undo all those

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.279 
do that so I'm going to undo all those
texture<00:06:29.470> applications

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:32.289 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:38.929 

and<00:06:32.830> then<00:06:33.039> set<00:06:33.460> up<00:06:33.580> properly<00:06:35.009> I'll<00:06:36.009> set<00:06:36.309> up<00:06:36.339> the

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:38.939 

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:44.070 

texturing<00:06:40.529> process<00:06:41.529> so<00:06:41.830> that<00:06:41.860> it<00:06:42.699> the<00:06:43.689> texture

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
texturing process so that it the texture

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.200 
texturing process so that it the texture
applied<00:06:44.289> will<00:06:44.830> look<00:06:45.009> as<00:06:45.550> realistic<00:06:45.939> as

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 
applied will look as realistic as

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.649 
applied will look as realistic as
possible<00:06:47.039> go<00:06:48.039> back<00:06:48.219> to<00:06:48.399> the<00:06:48.490> materials<00:06:49.089> panel

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:49.659 
possible go back to the materials panel

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:53.249 
possible go back to the materials panel
and<00:06:50.669> we'll<00:06:51.669> look<00:06:51.819> here<00:06:52.270> at<00:06:52.419> these<00:06:52.689> there's

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:53.259 
and we'll look here at these there's

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.339 
and we'll look here at these there's
some<00:06:53.649> settings<00:06:54.039> as<00:06:54.219> diffuse<00:06:54.839> which<00:06:55.839> will<00:06:56.110> tell

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:56.349 
some settings as diffuse which will tell

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:58.439 
some settings as diffuse which will tell
us<00:06:56.379> how<00:06:56.499> the<00:06:56.740> light<00:06:57.159> the<00:06:57.819> diffuse<00:06:58.270> the<00:06:58.419> light

00:06:58.439 --> 00:06:58.449 
us how the light the diffuse the light

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:01.739 
us how the light the diffuse the light
will<00:06:58.839> react<00:06:59.139> with<00:06:59.259> our<00:06:59.559> object<00:06:59.889> is<00:07:00.749> ambient

00:07:01.739 --> 00:07:01.749 
will react with our object is ambient

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:03.600 
will react with our object is ambient
which<00:07:01.990> tells<00:07:02.349> us<00:07:02.529> how<00:07:02.710> the<00:07:02.770> ambient<00:07:03.279> light<00:07:03.460> we

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610 
which tells us how the ambient light we

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:04.799 
which tells us how the ambient light we
react<00:07:03.819> we're<00:07:03.969> going<00:07:04.089> to<00:07:04.180> leave<00:07:04.330> those<00:07:04.569> two

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:04.809 
react we're going to leave those two

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:08.510 
react we're going to leave those two
then<00:07:05.770> there's<00:07:06.009> specula<00:07:06.639> which<00:07:06.849> which<00:07:07.240> can<00:07:08.050> say

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 
then there's specula which which can say

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.600 
then there's specula which which can say
how<00:07:09.520> much<00:07:09.729> glow<00:07:10.539> the<00:07:10.740> object<00:07:11.740> has<00:07:11.919> zero<00:07:12.309> is

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:12.610 
how much glow the object has zero is

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.489 
how much glow the object has zero is
meaning<00:07:13.300> that<00:07:13.389> the<00:07:13.599> object<00:07:14.050> will<00:07:14.199> radiate

00:07:14.489 --> 00:07:14.499 
meaning that the object will radiate

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:17.129 
meaning that the object will radiate
some<00:07:14.979> sort<00:07:15.189> of<00:07:15.219> light<00:07:15.520> will<00:07:16.240> set<00:07:16.479> this<00:07:16.629> to<00:07:16.869> five

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:17.139 
some sort of light will set this to five

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:20.820 
some sort of light will set this to five
and<00:07:18.479> that<00:07:19.479> means<00:07:19.779> if<00:07:20.050> the<00:07:20.289> objects<00:07:20.619> in<00:07:20.709> the

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:20.830 
and that means if the objects in the

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.799 
and that means if the objects in the
dark<00:07:21.539> you<00:07:22.539> will<00:07:22.749> not<00:07:23.229> see<00:07:23.529> it<00:07:24.809> translucency

00:07:25.799 --> 00:07:25.809 
dark you will not see it translucency

00:07:25.809 --> 00:07:27.770 
dark you will not see it translucency
we'll<00:07:25.959> leave<00:07:26.139> that<00:07:26.169> for<00:07:26.379> now

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780 
we'll leave that for now

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:33.890 
we'll leave that for now
so<00:07:28.050> go<00:07:28.620> back<00:07:28.889> to<00:07:29.520> our<00:07:30.350> texture<00:07:32.480> we're<00:07:33.480> using

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:33.900 
so go back to our texture we're using

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.190 
so go back to our texture we're using
the<00:07:34.110> texture<00:07:34.470> that<00:07:34.590> I<00:07:34.740> made<00:07:34.950> earlier<00:07:34.980> and<00:07:36.200> the
