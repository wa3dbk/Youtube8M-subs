00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
in between the carters layers and then

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.650 
in between the carters layers and then
the<00:00:43.800> carters<00:00:44.129> layer<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.399> split<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.059> there's

the carters layer is split and there's

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.479 
the carters layer is split and there's
blood<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.230> between<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> two<00:00:46.800> Carter's<00:00:47.219> layers

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.180 
blood in between the two Carter's layers
and<00:00:47.910> if<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.210> don't<00:00:48.390> suck<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.870> blood<00:00:49.170> out<00:00:49.440> it

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and if you don't suck that blood out it

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.220 
and if you don't suck that blood out it
organizes<00:00:50.489> into<00:00:51.239> cartilage<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.960> then<00:00:52.110> you

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
organizes into cartilage and then you

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.840 
organizes into cartilage and then you
have<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> stiff<00:00:52.649> here<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.100> gotta<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:53.670> you

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
have a stiff here so you gotta but you

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.049 
have a stiff here so you gotta but you
know<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.809> maybe<00:00:54.989> about<00:00:55.250> five<00:00:56.250> days<00:00:56.460> max<00:00:56.820> to

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
know but maybe about five days max to

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.670 
know but maybe about five days max to
get<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.390> my<00:00:57.809> five<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.109> seven<00:00:58.320> days<00:00:58.350> max

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
get that my five to seven days max

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.430 
get that my five to seven days max
depends<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.160> how<00:00:59.280> fast<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.840> whether

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
depends on how fast that that is whether

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.070 
depends on how fast that that is whether
it's<00:01:01.590> fluid<00:01:01.800> or<00:01:01.949> blood<00:01:02.120> is<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.480> there<00:01:03.719> whether

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
it's fluid or blood is in there whether

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.100 
it's fluid or blood is in there whether
it's<00:01:04.350> fluid<00:01:04.860> or<00:01:05.040> blood<00:01:05.390> but<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:06.900> about

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
it's fluid or blood but you have about

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.750 
it's fluid or blood but you have about
five<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.470> seven<00:01:07.710> days<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.920> get<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.400> out<00:01:08.580> there

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
five to seven days to get that out there

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.340 
five to seven days to get that out there
or<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.030> going<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.210> start<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.540> get<00:01:09.630> hard<00:01:09.990> and

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
or it's going to start to get hard and

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.380 
or it's going to start to get hard and
then<00:01:10.979> you're<00:01:11.159> gonna<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.670> you're<00:01:12.330> not

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
then you're gonna have to you're not

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.580 
then you're gonna have to you're not
gonna<00:01:12.540> be<00:01:12.630> able<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.840> suck<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.140> out<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.470> there

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
gonna be able to suck that out of there

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.899 
gonna be able to suck that out of there
and<00:01:13.680> then<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.950> know<00:01:14.010> once<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.340> get<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> blood

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
and then you know once you get the blood

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.399 
and then you know once you get the blood
out<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.180> there<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:16.020> compute<00:01:16.290> and

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
out of there then we can compute and

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.039 
out of there then we can compute and
compress<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.130> by<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:18.119> lot<00:01:18.659> different<00:01:18.900> ways<00:01:18.960> you

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
compress it by a lot different ways you

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.359 
compress it by a lot different ways you
can<00:01:19.110> put<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> cast<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> ear<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.220> put

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
can put a cast on the ear you can put

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.460 
can put a cast on the ear you can put
compression<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.659> head<00:01:21.810> wrap<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.320> things

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
compression and a head wrap and things

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.520 
compression and a head wrap and things
like<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:23.030> but<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.990> calm<00:01:25.170> state<00:01:25.350> it's<00:01:25.439> not

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
like that but it's a calm state it's not

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.140 
like that but it's a calm state it's not
a<00:01:25.560> serious<00:01:25.920> name<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.280> more<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.580> cosmetic

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
a serious name it's more of a cosmetic

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.530 
a serious name it's more of a cosmetic
thing<00:01:27.710> remove<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.890> fluid<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.180> try<00:01:30.390> and
