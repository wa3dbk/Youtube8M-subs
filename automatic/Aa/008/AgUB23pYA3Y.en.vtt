00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 this morning we woke up with a 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.359
 new update of origin 9.5 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.580
 point 10 that although it brings some 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.070
 improvements have gotten a very 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.469
 extended and that does not allow you to play 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.030
 the sims had other games this error 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.890
 It happens when you try to open the game 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.420
 that you come across this dwarf window 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.980
 in which you have the logo of the sims and 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.270
 the option to minimize and close nothing else 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.640
 in this video what I'm going to do is 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.619
 teach you how to solve it forget about 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.570
 reinstall to repair and all these 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.810
 things because it's much simpler than 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.810
 that 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.270
 the solution is to deactivate origin 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.710
 where in the game in the case of the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.510
 cinemas you're not going to notice the difference of 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.309
 whether it is or not unless you use the option 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.100
 to chat from within the game 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.690
 pressing the keys mayos and f1 but in 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.000
 general the majority of players neither 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.800
 we even use it so you have two 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.659
 options or deactivate in all 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.400
 games or disable only in games 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.350
 in those who bother you in those who give you 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.030
 problems come on I'm going to teach you 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.890
 either of the two forms and you choose 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.560
 the one you want to deactivate in 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.540
 all the games you have to give him origin 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.640
 application settings and you're going to 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.350
 origin in the game here you have a 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.679
 option that tells you to activate origin in the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.500
 game if you turn it off then you have already 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:25.679
 deactivated origin in all games 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.539
 ok if you want to deactivate 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.610
 only in the sims 4 then you are going to give 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.950
 right button on the cover and on 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.869
 game properties here we are going to 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.740
 say disable origin in the game to 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.000
 this title you accept and you are now 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.350
 when you try to play you do not go to 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.400
 find again with this window 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.650
 minimized 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.840
 until they solve the matter you will have 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.400
 to play like this and once they solve it 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.750
 not that you use origin in the game or 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.550
 it's even worth going back to 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.590
 activate it because it gives enough problems 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.600
 and it may be the cause of even the 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.340
 game will stop you from working so if 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.290
 you have problems with what the sims 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.810
 4 has stopped working should you 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.430
 try this too just for me 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.650
 part I am elvira de peques and I hope that 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.810
 this little arrangement will help you all 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.250
 those who have this problem await you 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.250
 the next video until soon
