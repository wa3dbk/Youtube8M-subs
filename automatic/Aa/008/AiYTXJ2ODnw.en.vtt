this<00:04:09.579> look<00:04:09.880> but<00:04:10.780> on<00:04:10.959> the<00:04:11.079> other<00:04:11.230> side<00:04:11.470> I'm

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
this look but on the other side I'm

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.140 
this look but on the other side I'm
going<00:04:11.650> to<00:04:11.709> try<00:04:11.890> a<00:04:12.069> little<00:04:12.340> bit<00:04:12.430> more<00:04:12.670> of<00:04:12.970> a

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
going to try a little bit more of a

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.930 
going to try a little bit more of a
methodical<00:04:13.739> placement<00:04:14.739> pattern<00:04:15.160> and<00:04:15.489> see<00:04:15.819> how

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
methodical placement pattern and see how

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.180 
methodical placement pattern and see how
that<00:04:16.180> works<00:04:16.389> out<00:04:16.540> for<00:04:16.600> me<00:04:16.840> all<00:04:17.709> right<00:04:17.799> so<00:04:18.130> I'm

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
that works out for me all right so I'm

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.550 
that works out for me all right so I'm
gonna<00:04:18.310> start<00:04:18.400> applying<00:04:19.090> my<00:04:19.359> glue<00:04:19.600> again

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
gonna start applying my glue again

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.050 
gonna start applying my glue again
and<00:04:20.979> this<00:04:21.190> time<00:04:21.370> I'm<00:04:21.489> just<00:04:21.579> gonna<00:04:21.729> go<00:04:21.940> ahead

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
and this time I'm just gonna go ahead

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.870 
and this time I'm just gonna go ahead
and<00:04:22.510> put<00:04:22.990> just<00:04:23.260> a<00:04:23.380> tiny<00:04:23.680> dot<00:04:24.010> and<00:04:24.250> just<00:04:24.430> do<00:04:24.550> one

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
and put just a tiny dot and just do one

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.779 
and put just a tiny dot and just do one
at<00:04:25.180> a<00:04:25.240> time<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:26.260> see<00:04:26.440> how<00:04:26.830> hard<00:04:27.340> this<00:04:27.580> is<00:04:27.639> gonna

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
at a time and see how hard this is gonna

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.219 
at a time and see how hard this is gonna
be<00:04:28.030> because<00:04:28.210> I'm<00:04:28.300> just<00:04:28.389> using<00:04:28.600> my<00:04:28.660> fingers<00:04:28.750> are

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
be because I'm just using my fingers are

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.950 
be because I'm just using my fingers are
not<00:04:29.380> using<00:04:29.650> tweezers<00:04:30.300> and<00:04:31.300> I<00:04:31.419> start<00:04:31.660> with<00:04:31.750> a

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
not using tweezers and I start with a

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.900 
not using tweezers and I start with a
start

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
start

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.629 
start
all<00:04:33.910> right<00:04:34.150> so<00:04:34.510> placing<00:04:35.500> in<00:04:35.620> all<00:04:35.860> by<00:04:36.190> yourself

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
all right so placing in all by yourself

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.520 
all right so placing in all by yourself
is<00:04:36.789> definitely<00:04:37.330> way<00:04:37.630> harder<00:04:38.080> I<00:04:38.350> don't<00:04:38.470> even

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
is definitely way harder I don't even

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.990 
is definitely way harder I don't even
know<00:04:38.650> we<00:04:38.770> can<00:04:38.889> pick<00:04:39.010> up<00:04:39.130> on<00:04:39.250> cameras<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:39.760> stars

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
know we can pick up on cameras the stars

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.600 
know we can pick up on cameras the stars
are<00:04:40.210> so<00:04:40.360> light-colored<00:04:41.039> but<00:04:42.039> alternating

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
are so light-colored but alternating

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.600 
are so light-colored but alternating
them<00:04:42.870> takes<00:04:43.870> a<00:04:43.990> lot<00:04:44.229> more<00:04:44.260> time<00:04:44.740> and<00:04:45.099> it<00:04:45.430> does

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
them takes a lot more time and it does

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.129 
them takes a lot more time and it does
look<00:04:45.760> very<00:04:46.120> nice<00:04:46.389> I<00:04:46.660> can<00:04:46.810> see<00:04:46.900> that<00:04:47.020> working

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
look very nice I can see that working

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.070 
look very nice I can see that working
very<00:04:47.500> nicely<00:04:47.770> above<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.580> eyebrows<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.539> just

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
very nicely above the eyebrows and just

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.779 
very nicely above the eyebrows and just
doing<00:04:50.260> time<00:04:50.530> like<00:04:50.740> a<00:04:50.830> gem<00:04:51.160> all<00:04:51.430> around<00:04:51.669> your

doing time like a gem all around your

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:53.339 
doing time like a gem all around your
eye<00:04:51.940> look<00:04:52.150> like<00:04:52.180> that<00:04:52.510> but<00:04:52.810> really<00:04:53.050> the

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:53.349 
eye look like that but really the

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:55.350 
eye look like that but really the
eye-popping<00:04:53.770> look<00:04:54.250> that<00:04:54.460> I<00:04:54.490> saw<00:04:54.729> and<00:04:55.030> hard<00:04:55.300> you

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
eye-popping look that I saw and hard you

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.900 
eye-popping look that I saw and hard you
do<00:04:55.660> and<00:04:56.080> Shibuya<00:04:56.470> that<00:04:56.770> was<00:04:56.950> definitely<00:04:57.550> the

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
do and Shibuya that was definitely the

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.960 
do and Shibuya that was definitely the
glitter<00:04:58.330> of<00:04:58.389> blush<00:04:58.780> look<00:04:59.169> I<00:05:00.039> personally<00:05:00.729> think

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
glitter of blush look I personally think

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.670 
glitter of blush look I personally think
that<00:05:01.090> that<00:05:01.300> is<00:05:01.539> more<00:05:01.900> dynamic<00:05:02.110> and<00:05:02.470> if<00:05:02.560> you're

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
that that is more dynamic and if you're

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.990 
that that is more dynamic and if you're
gonna<00:05:02.770> go<00:05:02.950> for<00:05:03.099> this<00:05:03.280> look<00:05:03.400> you<00:05:03.639> might<00:05:03.880> as<00:05:03.970> well

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
gonna go for this look you might as well

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.790 
gonna go for this look you might as well
go<00:05:04.210> all<00:05:04.419> the<00:05:04.539> way<00:05:04.570> and<00:05:05.020> just<00:05:05.470> go<00:05:05.800> for<00:05:06.070> it
