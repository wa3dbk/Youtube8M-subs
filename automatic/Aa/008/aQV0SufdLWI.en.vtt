 history 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.950
 with 2007 when the company's 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.620

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.170
 quickly around the world 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.540
 revolutionizing cell phones and in 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.700
 less than 5 years there were five versions 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.500
 different from iphone 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.780
 iphone 3g already had a gps device 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.659
 iphone 3gs had one more processor 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.750
 fast iphone 4 had a more design 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.820
 radical with glass forward and back 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.920
 iphone 4s improved the processor and already 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.770
 allowed facetime video calls to 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.259
 via wifi but according to its creators 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.869
 all that is a thing of the past because the 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.130
 iphone 5 arrived to revolutionize 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.460
 again the telephone market 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.460

 but who has the new iphone know 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.250
 his main innovations 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.140
 Its screen is more elongated and allows 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.630
 The best visibility of the images is 18% 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.440
 finer and weighs 20% less than the version 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.720
 previous 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.210
 your a6 processor has twice as much 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.450
 performance than version 4 s and now 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.250
 has 4g connection for example if 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.500
 before to download a song it 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.020
 it took several minutes with this system 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.420
 it can be done in seconds the 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.429
 video calls through facetime now 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.019

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:21.799
 at any time of the day and the best of 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.810
 all without the need for wifi connection 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.060
 advantages are so attractive that in such 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.829
 only 24 hours a paul has received orders 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.829

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.360
 Ecuador is not the exception we visit a 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.879
 of the technology stores and the 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.230
 expectations are very high we had 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.319
 many customers who are we and 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.549

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.409
 approximately we have already more than 100 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.900

 will come to our country of the 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.160
 approaches that we have had with the 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.540
 macintosh people we know that it is 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.280
 possible that it is released for 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.120
 Latin America for the month of November 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.920
 of this year 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.079
 no doubt the iphone5 promises to be 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.879
 revolutionary but the 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.040
 technological platform of our country 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.560
 for this device to work at 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.910
 100% the iphone supports csp technology 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.379

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.599
 use in Ecuador and the deployment of 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.670

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.840
 telephony telephony generation 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.959
 cell that the iphone is coming 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.850
