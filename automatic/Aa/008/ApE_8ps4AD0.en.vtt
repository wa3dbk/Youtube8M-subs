00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
there's also the inspiration side so

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.650 
there's also the inspiration side so
it's<00:01:44.370> creating<00:01:44.520> those<00:01:44.730> images<00:01:45.000> either<00:01:45.330> early

is<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.150> Illusive<00:01:54.510> man<00:01:54.830> when<00:01:55.830> we<00:01:55.920> were<00:01:55.980> trying

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
is the Illusive man when we were trying

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
to figure him out part of it was he had

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.820 
to figure him out part of it was he had
to<00:01:58.950> remain<00:01:59.310> somewhat<00:01:59.640> neutral<00:01:59.930> so<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.680> was

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
to remain somewhat neutral so it was

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.290 
to remain somewhat neutral so it was
more<00:02:02.040> about<00:02:02.100> creating<00:02:02.580> an<00:02:02.790> interesting

your 100th helmet your 200th ailment
something<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:54.080> just<00:02:54.200> can't<00:02:54.410> look<00:02:54.530> at<00:02:54.650> them

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
something you just can't look at them

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.020 
something you just can't look at them
anymore<00:02:54.950> it's<00:02:55.790> lights<00:02:56.600> visor<00:02:57.200> okay<00:02:57.830> that

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
anymore it's lights visor okay that

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.160 
anymore it's lights visor okay that
blurs<00:02:59.030> together<00:02:59.239> I<00:02:59.630> think<00:02:59.750> it's<00:02:59.989> pretty

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
blurs together I think it's pretty

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.190 
blurs together I think it's pretty
subtle<00:03:00.739> but<00:03:01.190> I'm<00:03:01.430> really<00:03:01.910> happy<00:03:02.120> with<00:03:02.420> where

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
subtle but I'm really happy with where

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.660 
subtle but I'm really happy with where
we<00:03:03.380> went<00:03:03.560> even<00:03:03.890> with<00:03:04.010> Shepherds<00:03:04.400> armor

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
we went even with Shepherds armor

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.130 
we went even with Shepherds armor
because<00:03:05.090> it's<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.510> one<00:03:05.720> thing<00:03:05.900> that<00:03:05.959> you're

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
because it's the one thing that you're

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.740 
because it's the one thing that you're
going<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.290> see<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.920> whole<00:03:07.160> time<00:03:07.360> but<00:03:08.360> I<00:03:08.420> think

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
going to see the whole time but I think

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.810 
going to see the whole time but I think
it<00:03:09.380> serves<00:03:09.860> as<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.040> metaphor<00:03:10.430> for<00:03:10.610> where<00:03:10.700> the

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
it serves as a metaphor for where the

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.270 
it serves as a metaphor for where the
whole<00:03:10.970> game<00:03:11.180> went<00:03:11.540> that<00:03:11.840> it's<00:03:12.230> it's<00:03:13.040> more

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
whole game went that it's it's more

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.490 
whole game went that it's it's more
grounded<00:03:13.730> it's<00:03:13.940> more<00:03:14.150> solid<00:03:14.660> more<00:03:15.050> more

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
grounded it's more solid more more

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.199 
grounded it's more solid more more
believable<00:03:15.920> there's<00:03:16.220> there's<00:03:16.550> more<00:03:16.820> detail

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
believable there's there's more detail

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.360 
believable there's there's more detail
in<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:17.450> if<00:03:17.570> you're<00:03:17.690> willing<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:18.019> look<00:03:18.370> to

in it if you're willing to look to
design<00:03:19.700> overall<00:03:20.090> it's<00:03:20.450> just<00:03:20.660> so<00:03:20.780> much<00:03:20.870> more

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
design overall it's just so much more

one<00:03:27.470> of<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.650> characters<00:03:27.980> that<00:03:28.069> I'm<00:03:28.190> most

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
one of the characters that I'm most

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.119 
one of the characters that I'm most
proud<00:03:28.519> of<00:03:28.610> is<00:03:28.970> subject<00:03:29.390> zero<00:03:29.680> that<00:03:30.680> was<00:03:30.920> one<00:03:31.099> of

effect 2 and mass effect 3 and so in a
way<00:04:23.630> I<00:04:23.660> think<00:04:23.750> that<00:04:24.050> that<00:04:24.229> made<00:04:24.560> it<00:04:24.710> not<00:04:25.360> easier

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
way I think that that made it not easier

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.689 
way I think that that made it not easier
but<00:04:26.900> we<00:04:27.260> push<00:04:27.620> ourselves<00:04:27.770> as<00:04:28.130> hard<00:04:28.310> as<00:04:28.400> we<00:04:28.520> can

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
every time almost so that we know that

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.110

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
the next time around we have to work

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.839 
the next time around we have to work
