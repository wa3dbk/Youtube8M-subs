00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello girls today I want to show you another 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.819
 of the makeups typical of my model 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.819
 favorite face 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.790
 The first thing we are going to do is apply 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.860
 a prime in the eyelid of the eyes 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.619
 let's apply a shadow on all the 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.160
 eyelid that is graduated and we can 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.820
 choose in a pink or golden tone rita more 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.820
 the eyelash 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.370
 we mark a half eyeliner towards 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.230
 outside the peak that we throw from the 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.309
 line of tabs below has to be 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.309
 quite long 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.740
 eyeliner we will carry high to 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.740
 minor to the lacrimal 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.859
 the lacrimal area has to be a 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:52.859
 very finite line 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:08.860
 let's mark the eye socket with a 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:11.500
 brown a chocolate a dark tone 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.950
 we can apply a point of light in the 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.720
 Lachrymal remember to mark the point of light 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.140
 from under the eyebrow 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.790
 let's go simulating like hairs with the 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.790
 brush or what we use 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.970
 once made up we are always going to 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.580
 accept to make them more natural 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.180
 we will apply the mascara as always in 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.180
 fan 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.380
 finally in the part of the eyes what 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.870
 what we are going to do is with an eyeliner that 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.060
 be a little liquid or waterproof 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.000
 let's mark it to give you more 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.369
 intensity to black something that always 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.810
 face mark are the cheekbones what can we 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.030
 do or before the makeup base 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.190
 with a concealer a little bit darker or 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.729
 as I am doing it and a few powders 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.729
 bronze 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.130
 the color chosen by face for this 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.730
 makeup was the fuchsia first we're going to 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.540
 delineate the lips and fill them 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.540
 little inside 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:25.020
 the most similar tone I had is a 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.090
 pink throwing a little strawberry or red 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.770
 the truth any tone that you have that 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.770
 ask dark rosita you're worth 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.719

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.719
 models and we can see it on the covers 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:44.829
