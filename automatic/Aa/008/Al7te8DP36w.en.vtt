00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
I feel like a bit of an idiot at the

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.120 
I feel like a bit of an idiot at the
moment<00:00:07.950> because<00:00:08.870> i've<00:00:09.870> had<00:00:09.929> this<00:00:10.349> camera<00:00:10.860> for

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
moment because i've had this camera for

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.279 
and they almost a year now and I've just
realized<00:00:17.449> because<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.630> was<00:00:18.720> thinking<00:00:19.140> about

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
realized because I was thinking about

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.990 
realized because I was thinking about
getting<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.920> Canon<00:00:20.880> 550d<00:00:22.369> which<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.580> kind<00:00:23.970> of

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
getting a Canon 550d which is kind of

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.779 
getting a Canon 550d which is kind of
like<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.180> like<00:00:24.779> 70<00:00:25.410> they<00:00:25.830> call<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.130> mini<00:00:26.340> 70

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
like a like 70 they call it the mini 70

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.580 
like a like 70 they call it the mini 70
but<00:00:27.710> I<00:00:29.510> know<00:00:30.510> because<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.810> had<00:00:31.050> really

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
but I know because it had really

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.950 
but I know because it had really
interesting<00:00:32.369> options<00:00:33.360> like<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.719> could

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
interesting options like you could

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.290 
interesting options like you could
change<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.770> shutter<00:00:35.040> speed<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
change the shutter speed and the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.270 
change the shutter speed and the
aperture<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.170> things<00:00:37.590> like<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.739> if<00:00:38.070> you're

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
aperture and things like that if you're

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.760 
aperture and things like that if you're
a<00:00:38.420> if<00:00:39.420> you're<00:00:39.570> into<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.809> sort<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.230> your<00:00:40.530> film

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
a if you're into that sort of your film

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.319

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
maker or a photographer you under some

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.680 
maker or a photographer you under some
of<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.629> bitchin<00:00:42.840> open<00:00:43.370> you<00:00:44.370> know<00:00:44.690> there's

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
of that is bitchin open you know there's

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.560 
of that is bitchin open you know there's
many<00:00:45.840> matter<00:00:45.989> anyway<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:47.010> just<00:00:47.670> found<00:00:48.030> out<00:00:48.360> that

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
many matter anyway I just found out that

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.270 
many matter anyway I just found out that
I<00:00:48.660> could<00:00:48.870> change<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.590> camera<00:00:49.890> as<00:00:50.219> well

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
I could change it on this camera as well

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.430 
I could change it on this camera as well
I<00:00:50.460> mean<00:00:50.700> obviously<00:00:51.270> there<00:00:51.840> isn't<00:00:51.989> as<00:00:52.230> many

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
I mean obviously there isn't as many

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.000 
I mean obviously there isn't as many
options<00:00:52.739> as<00:00:53.100> there<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.940> canon<00:00:54.539> 550d<00:00:55.010> at

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
options as there is on the canon 550d at

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.810 
options as there is on the canon 550d at
the<00:00:56.100> moment<00:00:56.460> i'm<00:00:56.579> using<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.149> canon<00:00:57.690> HD<00:00:58.170> 20<00:00:58.920> so

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
the moment i'm using the canon HD 20 so

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
the moment i'm using the canon HD 20 so
if<00:00:59.969> you're<00:01:00.059> interesting<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:00.660> some

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
if you're interesting that with some

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.900 
if you're interesting that with some
test<00:01:01.050> footage<00:01:01.140> for<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.649> at<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.430> moment<00:01:02.579> I

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
test footage for that at the moment I

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.539 
test footage for that at the moment I
think<00:01:03.180> I've<00:01:03.300> got<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.480> shutter<00:01:03.870> speed<00:01:04.290> at

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
think I've got the shutter speed at

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.719 
think I've got the shutter speed at
2,000<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:06.360> if<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.689> notice<00:01:06.960> there<00:01:06.990> isn't<00:01:07.380> any

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
2,000 so if you notice there isn't any

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.039 
2,000 so if you notice there isn't any
sort<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.790> motion<00:01:09.180> blur<00:01:09.360> my<00:01:09.540> face<00:01:09.570> won't<00:01:09.900> do

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
sort of motion blur my face won't do

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.620 
sort of motion blur my face won't do
that<00:01:10.189> I've<00:01:11.189> quick<00:01:11.510> and<00:01:12.510> some<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.520> was<00:01:14.630> loved

that's<00:01:56.189> what<00:01:56.460> they<00:01:56.610> stopped<00:01:56.820> doing<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.299> stop

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
that's what they stopped doing I stop

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.389 
that's what they stopped doing I stop
the<00:01:57.810> wind<00:01:57.930> from<00:01:58.079> doing<00:01:58.409> making<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.310> noise
