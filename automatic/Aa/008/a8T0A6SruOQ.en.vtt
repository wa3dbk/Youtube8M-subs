right now well why do I need to program
tweens<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.800> what<00:00:23.100> can't<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.369> just<00:00:23.430> use<00:00:23.609> fleshies

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
tweens I what can't I just use fleshies

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.609 
tweens I what can't I just use fleshies
new<00:00:24.300> motion<00:00:24.480> model<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.019> create<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.439> tween

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
new motion model and create the tween

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.679 
new motion model and create the tween
like<00:00:25.830> two<00:00:25.980> seconds<00:00:26.400> well<00:00:27.029> let's<00:00:27.330> say<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.630> you

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
like two seconds well let's say that you

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.769 
like two seconds well let's say that you
want<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.019> create<00:00:28.320> an<00:00:28.500> elastic<00:00:28.949> effect<00:00:29.279> and

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
want to create an elastic effect and

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.999 
want to create an elastic effect and
doing<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.900> manually<00:00:31.349> with<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> new<00:00:31.830> motion

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
doing this manually with the new motion

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.430 
doing this manually with the new motion
model<00:00:32.250> may<00:00:32.910> take<00:00:33.180> quite<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.420> long<00:00:33.480> time<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.410> I

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
model may take quite a long time so I

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.260 
model may take quite a long time so I
why<00:00:34.620> not<00:00:34.800> use<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> prebuilt<00:00:35.640> class<00:00:36.000> ination

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
why not use a prebuilt class ination

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.670 
why not use a prebuilt class ination

script<00:00:42.239> free<00:00:42.420> another<00:00:43.320> reason<00:00:43.530> may<00:00:43.800> be<00:00:43.829> to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
script free another reason may be to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.090 
script free another reason may be to
increase<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:45.600> accuracy<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.230> your<00:00:46.410> animations

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
increase the accuracy of your animations

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.310 
increase the accuracy of your animations
for<00:00:47.850> example<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.539> tween<00:00:48.750> class<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.170> can

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
for example in the tween class you can

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.110 
for example in the tween class you can
put<00:00:49.620> different<00:00:49.710> parameters<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.579> specify

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
put different parameters and specify

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.760 
put different parameters and specify
exactly<00:00:51.300> what<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.050> want<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.289> happen<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.739> your

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
exactly what you want to happen in your

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.160 
exactly what you want to happen in your
tweens<00:00:53.239> another<00:00:54.239> reason<00:00:54.480> why<00:00:54.719> what<00:00:54.960> will<00:00:55.110> you

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
tweens another reason why what will you

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.310 
tweens another reason why what will you
use<00:00:55.199> twin<00:00:55.559> class<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.399> functionality<00:00:57.320> it's

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
use twin class is for functionality it's

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.260 
use twin class is for functionality it's
very<00:00:58.559> very<00:00:58.770> flexible<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.370> can<00:00:59.399> replace

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
very very flexible you can replace

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.569 
very very flexible you can replace
parameters<00:01:00.930> with<00:01:01.140> variables<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.430> can

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
parameters with variables and you can

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.830 
parameters with variables and you can
use<00:01:02.670> different<00:01:02.820> functions<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.600> stuff<00:01:03.660> like

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
use different functions and stuff like

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.840 
use different functions and stuff like
that<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> tween<00:01:05.010> class<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.460> very<00:01:05.549> very

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
that so the tween class is very very

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.789 
that so the tween class is very very
flexible<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.540> enables<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.470> program

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
flexible and enables you to program

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.690 
flexible and enables you to program

now we've imported all the classes we

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.580 
now we've imported all the classes we
need<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.520> use<00:03:27.700> we<00:03:28.240> can<00:03:28.420> now<00:03:28.510> start<00:03:28.840> coding<00:03:29.320> the

need to use we can now start coding the

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.520 
need to use we can now start coding the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
going to do VAR the tween class can be

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.300 
going to do VAR the tween class can be
stored<00:03:34.840> in<00:03:35.050> a<00:03:35.110> variable<00:03:35.260> therefore<00:03:35.950> to

assign the tween data types is variable

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.840 
assign the tween data types is variable
so<00:03:46.360> it<00:03:46.480> can<00:03:46.600> reference<00:03:46.810> between<00:03:47.410> equals<00:03:48.280> new

regular<00:04:54.360> dots<00:04:55.360> ease<00:04:55.599> out<00:04:56.560> and<00:04:56.919> that<00:04:57.819> will

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:57.909 
regular dots ease out and that will

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:59.939 
regular dots ease out and that will
conclude<00:04:58.060> our<00:04:58.419> function<00:04:58.870> how<00:04:59.289> odd<00:04:59.500> swing<00:04:59.680> will

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
conclude our function how odd swing will

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:01.709 
conclude our function how odd swing will
look<00:05:00.129> the<00:05:00.699> next<00:05:00.939> parameter<00:05:01.060> that<00:05:01.419> we<00:05:01.479> need<00:05:01.629> to

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:01.719 
look the next parameter that we need to

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:03.689 
look the next parameter that we need to
input<00:05:01.840> is<00:05:02.080> they<00:05:02.199> begin<00:05:02.500> value<00:05:02.919> the<00:05:03.370> beginning

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
input is they begin value the beginning

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.969 
input is they begin value the beginning
of<00:05:03.729> value<00:05:04.029> for<00:05:04.240> our<00:05:04.270> X<00:05:04.629> property<00:05:05.110> so<00:05:05.710> where<00:05:05.919> do

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
of value for our X property so where do

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.769 
of value for our X property so where do
we<00:05:06.039> want<00:05:06.219> our<00:05:06.340> twin<00:05:06.580> to<00:05:06.669> begin<00:05:06.939> well<00:05:07.240> if<00:05:07.449> I<00:05:07.599> just

00:05:07.769 --> 00:05:07.779 
we want our twin to begin well if I just

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:09.600 
we want our twin to begin well if I just
put<00:05:07.960> my<00:05:08.050> twin<00:05:08.319> to<00:05:08.439> the<00:05:08.469> bigger<00:05:08.770> the<00:05:09.189> left<00:05:09.400> hand

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
put my twin to the bigger the left hand

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.390 
put my twin to the bigger the left hand
side<00:05:09.669> of<00:05:10.000> my<00:05:10.150> estate<00:05:10.479> so<00:05:10.719> the<00:05:11.620> x<00:05:11.860> value<00:05:12.250> is

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
side of my estate so the x value is

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.269 
side of my estate so the x value is
minus<00:05:12.580> 2<00:05:12.939> so<00:05:13.629> just<00:05:14.050> to<00:05:14.229> be<00:05:14.500> more<00:05:14.770> accurate<00:05:14.889> I'm

00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:15.279 
minus 2 so just to be more accurate I'm

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:17.790 
minus 2 so just to be more accurate I'm
going<00:05:15.400> to<00:05:15.520> put<00:05:15.639> a<00:05:15.669> zero<00:05:15.879> comma<00:05:16.629> and<00:05:16.900> the<00:05:17.560> next

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
going to put a zero comma and the next

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.159 
going to put a zero comma and the next
parameter<00:05:17.949> is<00:05:18.400> the<00:05:18.580> end<00:05:18.789> value<00:05:19.210> well<00:05:19.870> if<00:05:20.050> I

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
parameter is the end value well if I

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.200 
parameter is the end value well if I
want<00:05:20.349> my<00:05:20.469> objects<00:05:21.189> between<00:05:21.370> to<00:05:21.789> the<00:05:21.939> right

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
want my objects between to the right

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.659 
want my objects between to the right
hand<00:05:22.479> side<00:05:22.750> of<00:05:23.110> the<00:05:23.199> stage<00:05:23.439> the<00:05:23.740> x<00:05:24.250> value<00:05:24.639> is

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
hand side of the stage the x value is

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.679 
hand side of the stage the x value is
going<00:05:24.879> to<00:05:25.060> finish<00:05:25.270> at<00:05:25.569> the<00:05:25.810> value<00:05:26.110> of<00:05:26.460> 436<00:05:27.689> so

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:28.689 
going to finish at the value of 436 so

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.260 
going to finish at the value of 436 so
let's<00:05:28.870> put<00:05:28.960> in<00:05:29.080> a<00:05:29.110> value<00:05:29.349> of<00:05:29.430> 436<00:05:30.430> as<00:05:30.819> I<00:05:30.969> lender

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
let's put in a value of 436 as I lender

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.689 
let's put in a value of 436 as I lender
value<00:05:31.539> for<00:05:31.810> our<00:05:31.839> X<00:05:32.080> property<00:05:32.500> the<00:05:33.490> next

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
value for our X property the next

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.760 
value for our X property the next
parameter<00:05:33.789> is<00:05:34.240> the<00:05:34.270> duration<00:05:34.629> and<00:05:35.020> this<00:05:35.650> is

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
parameter is the duration and this is

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.469 
parameter is the duration and this is
very<00:05:35.860> important<00:05:36.370> this<00:05:36.460> is<00:05:36.610> how<00:05:36.789> long<00:05:37.060> we<00:05:37.300> want

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
very important this is how long we want

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.809 
very important this is how long we want
the<00:05:37.569> twin<00:05:37.779> to<00:05:37.900> be<00:05:38.050> so<00:05:38.740> let's<00:05:39.190> say<00:05:39.339> I<00:05:39.370> want<00:05:39.669> it<00:05:39.789> to

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:39.819 
the twin to be so let's say I want it to

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:42.510 
the twin to be so let's say I want it to
be<00:05:39.909> five<00:05:40.270> seconds<00:05:40.839> let's<00:05:41.139> put<00:05:41.349> five<00:05:41.620> but<00:05:42.400> how

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
be five seconds let's put five but how

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.769 
be five seconds let's put five but how
do<00:05:42.580> we<00:05:42.699> know<00:05:42.789> these<00:05:42.969> are<00:05:43.089> seconds<00:05:43.509> it<00:05:43.599> can<00:05:43.690> be

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:43.779 
do we know these are seconds it can be

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:45.659 
do we know these are seconds it can be
frames<00:05:44.110> it<00:05:44.349> can<00:05:44.469> just<00:05:44.589> be<00:05:44.710> generated<00:05:45.339> by<00:05:45.490> how

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
frames it can just be generated by how

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.640 
frames it can just be generated by how
fast<00:05:45.879> our<00:05:46.120> processor<00:05:46.599> is<00:05:46.750> or<00:05:47.379> it<00:05:47.529> can<00:05:47.620> be

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
fast our processor is or it can be

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.709 
fast our processor is or it can be
seconds<00:05:48.159> it<00:05:48.250> can<00:05:48.370> just<00:05:48.430> be<00:05:48.520> any<00:05:48.849> time

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:49.719 
seconds it can just be any time

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:51.869 
seconds it can just be any time
measurement<00:05:50.229> to<00:05:50.919> determine<00:05:51.490> that<00:05:51.729> we're

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:51.879 
measurement to determine that we're

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:53.820 
measurement to determine that we're
going<00:05:52.000> to<00:05:52.089> use<00:05:52.210> seconds<00:05:52.779> other<00:05:53.020> than<00:05:53.500> frames

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
going to use seconds other than frames

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.619 
going to use seconds other than frames
is<00:05:54.069> by<00:05:54.190> putting<00:05:54.400> in<00:05:54.610> a<00:05:54.699> boolean<00:05:55.000> value<00:05:55.060> at<00:05:55.599> the

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:55.629 
is by putting in a boolean value at the

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:57.510 
is by putting in a boolean value at the
end<00:05:55.839> of<00:05:56.080> our<00:05:56.169> parameters<00:05:56.650> so<00:05:57.250> I'm<00:05:57.310> going<00:05:57.490> to

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
end of our parameters so I'm going to

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.909 
end of our parameters so I'm going to
try<00:05:57.639> true<00:05:58.020> what<00:05:59.020> will<00:05:59.139> this<00:05:59.259> true<00:05:59.529> statement

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
try true what will this true statement

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.429 
try true what will this true statement
do<00:06:00.039> it<00:06:00.310> will<00:06:00.729> tell<00:06:00.969> compiler<00:06:01.449> that<00:06:01.779> we<00:06:02.319> are

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:02.439 
do it will tell compiler that we are

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:05.159 
do it will tell compiler that we are
going<00:06:02.620> to<00:06:02.740> use<00:06:02.860> seconds<00:06:03.490> in<00:06:03.639> this<00:06:04.150> tween<00:06:04.449> as<00:06:04.659> a

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
going to use seconds in this tween as a

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.920 
going to use seconds in this tween as a
poster<00:06:05.680> frames<00:06:05.949> so<00:06:06.909> I'm<00:06:07.150> just<00:06:07.449> put<00:06:07.599> true<00:06:07.810> at

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
poster frames so I'm just put true at

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.350 
poster frames so I'm just put true at
the<00:06:07.960> end<00:06:08.169> if<00:06:08.319> you<00:06:08.349> want<00:06:08.650> to<00:06:08.800> use<00:06:09.180> seconds<00:06:10.180> and

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
the end if you want to use seconds and

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.959 
the end if you want to use seconds and
put<00:06:10.479> false<00:06:10.839> if<00:06:11.110> you<00:06:11.229> want<00:06:11.379> to<00:06:11.469> use<00:06:11.589> frames<00:06:11.969> so

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:12.969 
put false if you want to use frames so

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:14.399 
put false if you want to use frames so
at<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:13.270> moment<00:06:13.419> we've<00:06:13.719> created<00:06:13.990> the<00:06:14.259> new

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:14.409 
at the moment we've created the new

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:16.469 
at the moment we've created the new
tween<00:06:14.680> and<00:06:15.159> we're<00:06:15.580> going<00:06:15.699> to<00:06:15.729> be<00:06:15.849> animating

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 
tween and we're going to be animating

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.719 
tween and we're going to be animating
the<00:06:16.750> rectangle<00:06:17.289> object<00:06:17.620> our<00:06:18.039> object<00:06:18.520> on<00:06:18.639> the

the rectangle object our object on the
stage<00:06:18.939> called<00:06:19.270> my<00:06:19.509> rectangle<00:06:20.050> the<00:06:20.650> property

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:21.069 
stage called my rectangle the property

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:22.649 
stage called my rectangle the property
we're<00:06:21.219> going<00:06:21.339> to<00:06:21.400> be<00:06:21.460> animating<00:06:22.060> is<00:06:22.210> the<00:06:22.389> X

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
we're going to be animating is the X

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:24.510 
we're going to be animating is the X
property<00:06:23.319> and<00:06:23.500> we're<00:06:24.219> going<00:06:24.339> to<00:06:24.370> use<00:06:24.490> a

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
property and we're going to use a

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.059 
property and we're going to use a
regular<00:06:24.879> ezel<00:06:25.750> function<00:06:26.229> and<00:06:26.409> this<00:06:26.889> will

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:27.069 
regular ezel function and this will

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:28.499 
regular ezel function and this will
determine<00:06:27.189> what<00:06:27.610> our<00:06:27.819> twin<00:06:28.120> will<00:06:28.270> look<00:06:28.360> like

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:28.509 
determine what our twin will look like

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:30.839 
determine what our twin will look like
our<00:06:28.839> begin<00:06:29.529> value<00:06:29.830> is<00:06:29.979> going<00:06:30.099> to<00:06:30.250> be<00:06:30.339> 0<00:06:30.580> in

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:30.849

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
east alt effects at the end what if we

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.620 
east alt effects at the end what if we
want<00:06:50.949> to<00:06:51.070> use<00:06:51.160> an<00:06:51.400> elastic<00:06:51.610> effects<00:06:52.090> well<00:06:52.449> we

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:52.630 
want to use an elastic effects well we

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.390 
want to use an elastic effects well we
just<00:06:52.720> need<00:06:52.930> to<00:06:53.020> replace<00:06:53.350> regular<00:06:53.710> with

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 
just need to replace regular with

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.360 
just need to replace regular with
elastic<00:06:55.000> and<00:06:55.800> as<00:06:56.800> you<00:06:56.889> can<00:06:57.040> see<00:06:57.070> we've

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:57.370 
elastic and as you can see we've

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.520 
elastic and as you can see we've
imported<00:06:57.669> all<00:06:58.090> the<00:06:58.150> classes<00:06:58.990> inside<00:06:59.380> the

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
imported all the classes inside the

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.680 
imported all the classes inside the
easing<00:06:59.770> package<00:07:00.130> therefore<00:07:00.940> we<00:07:01.090> have<00:07:01.120> access

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.690 
easing package therefore we have access

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.710 
easing package therefore we have access
to<00:07:01.900> elastic<00:07:02.380> regular<00:07:02.919> bounce<00:07:03.250> etc<00:07:03.910> so<00:07:04.510> when<00:07:04.690> I

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 
to elastic regular bounce etc so when I

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.050 
to elastic regular bounce etc so when I
test<00:07:04.960> my<00:07:05.050> movie<00:07:05.380> now<00:07:05.530> our<00:07:05.860> objects<00:07:06.580> will<00:07:06.760> tween

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.060 
test my movie now our objects will tween

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.939 
test my movie now our objects will tween
from<00:07:07.330> the<00:07:07.449> left-hand<00:07:07.900> side<00:07:08.020> of<00:07:08.410> the<00:07:08.560> stage<00:07:08.770> to

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:08.949 
from the left-hand side of the stage to

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:10.560 
from the left-hand side of the stage to
the<00:07:09.010> right<00:07:09.070> and<00:07:09.520> we'll<00:07:10.090> have<00:07:10.180> an<00:07:10.360> elastic

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:10.570 
the right and we'll have an elastic

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.190 
the right and we'll have an elastic
effect<00:07:11.080> so<00:07:11.470> I'm<00:07:11.530> going<00:07:11.650> to<00:07:11.710> test<00:07:11.860> my<00:07:11.979> movie<00:07:12.250> and

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:13.200 
effect so I'm going to test my movie and

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.620 
effect so I'm going to test my movie and
there<00:07:14.200> we<00:07:14.290> go<00:07:14.440> elastic<00:07:15.040> effect<00:07:15.340> and<00:07:15.630> as

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:16.630 
there we go elastic effect and as

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:17.879 
there we go elastic effect and as
mentioned<00:07:16.960> at<00:07:17.169> the<00:07:17.200> beginning<00:07:17.350> of<00:07:17.620> this<00:07:17.710> video

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:17.889 
mentioned at the beginning of this video

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:20.659 
mentioned at the beginning of this video
this<00:07:18.580> would<00:07:18.820> originally<00:07:19.360> be<00:07:19.510> quite<00:07:19.780> hard<00:07:20.050> to

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:20.669 
this would originally be quite hard to

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:23.370 
this would originally be quite hard to
accomplish<00:07:21.669> using<00:07:22.150> the<00:07:22.479> motion<00:07:22.990> model<00:07:23.139> in

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:23.380 
accomplish using the motion model in

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.040 
accomplish using the motion model in
flash<00:07:23.620> and<00:07:23.919> the<00:07:24.490> twink<00:07:24.820> loss<00:07:25.030> is<00:07:25.419> a<00:07:25.479> lot

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.050 
flash and the twink loss is a lot

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.990 
flash and the twink loss is a lot
quicker<00:07:26.229> so<00:07:27.100> I'm<00:07:27.190> going<00:07:27.310> to<00:07:27.340> exit<00:07:27.639> my<00:07:27.729> Swift

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 
quicker so I'm going to exit my Swift

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.750 
quicker so I'm going to exit my Swift
and<00:07:29.250> i'm<00:07:30.250> just<00:07:30.370> going<00:07:30.460> to<00:07:30.580> demonstrate

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:30.760 
and i'm just going to demonstrate

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.029 
and i'm just going to demonstrate
changing<00:07:31.660> the<00:07:31.750> duration<00:07:32.260> to<00:07:32.410> let's<00:07:32.590> say<00:07:32.740> one

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 
changing the duration to let's say one

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:35.820 
changing the duration to let's say one
second<00:07:33.490> test<00:07:33.850> my<00:07:34.000> movie<00:07:34.240> again<00:07:34.450> and<00:07:34.660> it<00:07:35.530> lasts

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:35.830 
second test my movie again and it lasts

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.150 
second test my movie again and it lasts
for<00:07:36.039> one<00:07:36.130> second<00:07:36.900> so<00:07:37.900> this<00:07:38.229> hell<00:07:38.620> do<00:07:38.770> I<00:07:38.860> video
