00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.720
 first step we will set apart butter chocolate and the 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.720
 praline obama vanilla extracts succeeded 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:12.129
 first cut 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:14.789
 butter in small pieces 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.339
 e white in all its states so a bar husband a pan 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.960
 some water 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.119
 a fire of god for the summer a salad bowl inside 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.940
 convenient 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.230
 p the second part 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.380
 of butter 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.460
 I add inside the chocolate 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.020
 so the cover chocolate 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.490
 unsweetened chocolate street we will say 70% 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.490
 Cocoa 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.500
 in the salad bowl 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.500
 vanilla extract 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.060
 the praline 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.670
 so there after fine dinner then praline almond to find it 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.979
 several possibilities 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.979
 do not ask your pastry chef a little praline 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.640
 in specialized groceries you can eventually find your praline 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.720
 but you can also make your palate 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.470
 how to make praline 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.670
 we make lightly tobos gather hazelnuts and fines to the furnaces 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.870
 they are removed and left to cool to give a caramel 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.310
 we put the almonds and hazelnuts in the caramel 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.460
 we withdraw 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.030
 this mixture is allowed to cool and then we switch to the mixer and we make a 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.030
 fac terrena to pradines and house 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.690
 arthur he's the first one inside 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.600
 and his valet collapsed quietly 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.030
 so this is my spread recipe it has different variations and 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.039
 recipes we can start with a caramel 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.039
 yesterday morning caramel with concentrates 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.239
 only the spread that we all love but we keep 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.210
 refrigerator and that can possibly spread on the bun 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.099
 and there on small butter so it was worth its own funds and mans 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.119
 will add 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:20.609
 in this saucepan 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.829
 concentrated milk 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.399
 I will take 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:28.399
 another spoon 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.159
 and here it's a bit of hide and seek 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:40.169
 bring the condensed milk 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:41.569
 for caramel 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:42.959
 so the gemmi 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.959
 power of 5 to 4 on the on the gas 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.509
 and it's going to be quite long 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:52.709
 count you can between 10 and 13 minutes on anger the pan 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.209
 a blond color 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.919
 caramel the milk was concentrated 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:00.169
 What I propose is to finish them quietly a list 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.820
 caramel a little recap of the recipe of the spread 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.879
 found right after 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.620
 the caramel condensed milk now we will finish a spread 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.939
 so in we will add 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.939
 chocolate and melted butter with praline 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.599
 so just fade to 1 not need it be very very hot eventually 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.599
 you can melt it in the microwave 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:38.439
 alas you mix 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.859
 of a very good end of 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.859
 praline that comes out first after you smell chocolate 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:54.189
 we will keep 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.189
 our spreads ans small jars to put it in the refrigerator 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.039
