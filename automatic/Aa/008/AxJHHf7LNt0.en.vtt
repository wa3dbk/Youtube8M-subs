00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
here is much much better than I was

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.860 
here is much much better than I was
expecting<00:02:25.860> I'll<00:02:26.459> just<00:02:26.700> expecting<00:02:27.239> a<00:02:27.330> plastic

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
box that the normal hammer I case you

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.320 
box that the normal hammer I case you
might<00:02:31.020> get<00:02:31.260> wind<00:02:31.500> person<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.420> DVD<00:02:33.420> but<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.590> is

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
might get wind person a DVD but this is

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.479 
might get wind person a DVD but this is
substantially<00:02:36.330> better<00:02:37.010> just<00:02:38.010> have<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.250> see

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
substantially better just have to see

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.600 
substantially better just have to see
what's<00:02:39.060> in<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.780> box<00:02:39.959> like<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.380> said<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.920> don't

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
what's in the box like I said I don't

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.670 
what's in the box like I said I don't
know<00:02:41.970> if<00:02:42.239> this<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.510> actually<00:02:42.989> any<00:02:43.290> different

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
know if this is actually any different

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.370 
know if this is actually any different
to<00:02:43.830> what<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.180> Kickstarter<00:02:45.180> guys<00:02:45.750> got<00:02:46.230> the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
to what the Kickstarter guys got the

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.880 
to what the Kickstarter guys got the
ones<00:02:46.560> who<00:02:46.680> filter<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.100> box<00:02:47.280> on<00:02:47.489> Kickstarter

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
ones who filter the box on Kickstarter

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.990 
ones who filter the box on Kickstarter
if<00:02:49.890> they've<00:02:50.130> got<00:02:50.310> something<00:02:50.580> better<00:02:50.730> than

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
if they've got something better than

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.050 
if they've got something better than
this<00:02:51.180> then<00:02:51.450> they're<00:02:51.630> in<00:02:51.750> for<00:02:52.019> a<00:02:52.050> real<00:02:52.440> treat

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
this then they're in for a real treat

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.060 
this then they're in for a real treat
so<00:02:54.060> we've<00:02:54.660> got<00:02:54.840> another<00:02:55.200> case<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.620> their

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
so we've got another case of their

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.680 
so we've got another case of their
inside<00:02:57.680> we've<00:02:58.680> got<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:59.220> box<00:02:59.610> that<00:03:00.150> looks<00:03:00.390> like

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
inside we've got a box that looks like

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:08.290 
inside we've got a box that looks like
it<00:03:01.100> unfolds<00:03:02.100> out<00:03:02.280> in<00:03:02.690> multiple<00:03:04.880> layers<00:03:05.880> and

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.259 

indeed<00:03:09.300> each<00:03:10.579> each<00:03:11.579> side<00:03:11.940> there's<00:03:12.209> another

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
indeed each each side there's another

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.050 
indeed each each side there's another
