00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
folder we navigate to the runtime

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.080

folder<00:01:51.299> if<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.899> double<00:01:52.290> click<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.799> you'll

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
folder if you double click on it you'll

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.520 
folder if you double click on it you'll
find<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.850> inside<00:01:54.360> there<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> runtime

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
find that inside there is a runtime

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.370 
find that inside there is a runtime
directory<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.299> can<00:01:57.659> just<00:01:57.960> install

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
that directory to your poser library so

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.720 
that directory to your poser library so
this<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.790> all<00:02:12.090> there<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.720> about<00:02:12.870> installation
