00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:19.470
 mulching is one of the alternatives to chemical weed control 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.289
 is to cover the ground to prevent grass growth 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.050
 otherwise it preserves aggression and conditions 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.449
 climates the soil life 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.079
 to ensure good efficiency it is essential to ensure that 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.190
 spontaneous plants already present and apply a layer and 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.260
 fisa less thick different solutions available to you among 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.559
 which the countries of the trade but also those resulting from recycling 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.260
 favor the materials from your garden and avoid a journey in 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.630
 dump the air tents the dry may have gone into the ranks of 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.460
 crops for their feet 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.840
 in the same way the device days to different complementary roles to 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.049
 this goal to prevent the pose of a wait-and-see attitude 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:02.979
 when we have the device on the ground we protect it against it was against the 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.600
 heat one to do a cross on 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.650
 and birthday the legal loopholes in part and so that protects the ground 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.880
 and so in spring it's nice to tell me to come in the fall and in the spring we have 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.860
 need to let go I said I pay age 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.020
 eighteen useful especially to take the summer 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.080
 because we put them at the foot of plants 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.180
 eidos that prevents training you have to know that when you water a lot 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.640
 other parents evaporation and very little in the plant the fact of not 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.810
 swim well hurried information 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.590
 and so 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.450
 according to the ground the only legal aspect interplay and friable 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.420
 and plants have always pouted with humility to push 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.810
 it is therefore reached excessive watering alas our side too so it's a

 grind tree and shrub waste of smaller diameter 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.919
 at 7 centimeters
