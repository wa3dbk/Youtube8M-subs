00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
different here I was going to make the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.400 
different here I was going to make the
the<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:21.580> the<00:01:22.510> hoop<00:01:22.720> house<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:23.200> full

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
end but you see what I did here I

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.970 
end but you see what I did here I
decided<00:01:28.360> to<00:01:28.980> just<00:01:29.980> go<00:01:30.130> ahead<00:01:30.250> and<00:01:31.620> do<00:01:32.620> a<00:01:32.650> half

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
decided to just go ahead and do a half

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.100 
decided to just go ahead and do a half
hoop<00:01:33.820> house<00:01:34.030> or<00:01:34.330> whatever<00:01:34.600> you<00:01:34.810> call<00:01:34.930> it<00:01:34.960> a

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
hoop house or whatever you call it a

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.540

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
short small one on that side and I'll

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.400

probably<00:01:36.820> do<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.270> same<00:01:37.300> thing<00:01:37.480> over<00:01:37.840> here<00:01:37.990> and

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
probably do the same thing over here and

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.540 
probably do the same thing over here and
then<00:01:39.130> I'll<00:01:39.250> make<00:01:39.430> it<00:01:39.610> accessible<00:01:41.490> from<00:01:42.490> the
