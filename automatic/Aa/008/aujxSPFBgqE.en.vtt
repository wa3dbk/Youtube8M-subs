you<00:00:35.850> really<00:00:36.000> think<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.360> has<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> future<00:00:36.739> yes<00:00:37.739> I

you really think it has a future yes I
do<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.309> think<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.610> single<00:00:38.940> biggest

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
do and I think the single biggest

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.100 
do and I think the single biggest
challenge<00:00:39.390> we've<00:00:39.510> got<00:00:39.660> involving<00:00:39.960> an

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
challenge we've got involving an

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.389 
challenge we've got involving an
electronic<00:00:40.559> patient<00:00:40.680> records<00:00:41.280> is

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
electronic patient records is

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.790 
electronic patient records is
accessibility<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.350> typical<00:00:43.350> example<00:00:43.379> of

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
accessibility a typical example of

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.709 
accessibility a typical example of
awards<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.460> country<00:00:44.730> today<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:45.600> that

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
awards in the country today and one that

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.369 
awards in the country today and one that
I<00:00:45.780> was<00:00:45.870> at<00:00:46.020> recently<00:00:46.950> 30<00:00:47.910> beds<00:00:48.149> five<00:00:49.020> different

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
I was at recently 30 beds five different

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.880 
I was at recently 30 beds five different
rooms<00:00:49.590> 10<00:00:49.980> staff<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.879> one<00:00:51.420> pc<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:51.870> desk<00:00:52.140> so

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
rooms 10 staff and one pc on desk so

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.439 
rooms 10 staff and one pc on desk so
it's<00:00:53.039> around<00:00:53.250> accessibility<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.120> patient

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
it's around accessibility of the patient

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.580 
it's around accessibility of the patient
retro<00:00:54.750> if<00:00:54.960> we're<00:00:55.079> really<00:00:55.199> going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.440> make<00:00:55.559> a

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
retro if we're really going to make a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.479 
retro if we're really going to make a
difference<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.070> move<00:00:56.190> away<00:00:56.340> from

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
difference and move away from

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.580 
difference and move away from
paper-based<00:00:57.030> systems<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:58.140> have<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.379> provide

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
paper-based systems we have to provide

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.319 
paper-based systems we have to provide
access<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.670> i<00:00:59.760> think<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.210> ipad

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
access and i think that the ipad

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.750 
access and i think that the ipad
provides<00:01:00.899> an<00:01:01.500> additional<00:01:01.800> dimensions<00:01:02.670> are

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
provides an additional dimensions are

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.399 
provides an additional dimensions are
some<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.000> ones<00:01:03.120> we've<00:01:03.239> already<00:01:03.359> got<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.320> we

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
some of the ones we've already got so we

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.719 
some of the ones we've already got so we
had<00:01:04.530> these<00:01:04.710> seas<00:01:04.920> around<00:01:05.040> for<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> while<00:01:05.460> we've

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
had these seas around for a while we've

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.020 
had these seas around for a while we've
had<00:01:05.850> pcs<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:07.460> available<00:01:08.460> on<00:01:08.549> walls<00:01:08.820> are

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
had pcs that available on walls are

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.910 
had pcs that available on walls are
filled<00:01:09.180> away<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:10.110> we've<00:01:10.229> had<00:01:10.350> computers<00:01:10.799> on

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
filled away and we've had computers on

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.399 
filled away and we've had computers on
wheels<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.490> they're<00:01:12.450> always<00:01:12.600> successful<00:01:13.320> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
wheels and they're always successful to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.230 
wheels and they're always successful to
a<00:01:13.439> relative<00:01:13.830> point<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:14.820> i<00:01:14.850> think<00:01:15.090> with<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
a relative point but i think with the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.060 
a relative point but i think with the
ipad<00:01:15.630> was<00:01:15.810> not<00:01:15.990> an<00:01:16.170> opportunity<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.680> can

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
ipad was not an opportunity that can

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.910 
ipad was not an opportunity that can
really<00:01:17.729> take<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.570> patient<00:01:19.140> information<00:01:19.290> at<00:01:19.860> a

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
really take the patient information at a

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.359 
really take the patient information at a
relative<00:01:20.310> cost<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.850> security<00:01:21.890> to<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
relative cost and the security to the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.160 
relative cost and the security to the
clinical<00:01:24.090> setting<00:01:24.270> right<00:01:24.600> at<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.869> point<00:01:25.020> of

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
clinical setting right at the point of

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.719 
clinical setting right at the point of
care<00:01:25.229> where<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:25.650> needed<00:01:25.770> marks<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.400> yeah<00:01:26.700> I

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
care where it's needed marks so yeah I

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:27.770 
care where it's needed marks so yeah I
really<00:01:26.909> do<00:01:27.090> see<00:01:27.270> there's<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.570> great

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
really do see there's a great

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.840 
really do see there's a great
opportunity<00:01:28.200> for<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.770> type<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:28.950> device<00:01:29.250> so

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
opportunity for this type of device so

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.249 
opportunity for this type of device so
how<00:01:29.970> would<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.150> save<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.630> ipad<00:01:30.960> actually

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
how would you save the ipad actually

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.840 
how would you save the ipad actually

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
out there for example the toughbook

computers on whales and even laptops

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.910 
computers on whales and even laptops
that<00:01:36.780> rewards<00:01:37.380> yeah<00:01:38.009> i<00:01:38.220> mean<00:01:38.250> i<00:01:38.520> think<00:01:38.640> laptops

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
that rewards yeah i mean i think laptops

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.590 
that rewards yeah i mean i think laptops

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
unless you've got somewhere to standard

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.880 
unless you've got somewhere to standard
are<00:01:42.810> quite<00:01:43.079> difficult<00:01:43.290> coming<00:01:43.680> around

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
are quite difficult coming around

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.060 
are quite difficult coming around
they're<00:01:44.250> also<00:01:45.290> areas<00:01:46.290> where<00:01:46.439> bacteria<00:01:46.649> can

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
they're also areas where bacteria can

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.859 
they're also areas where bacteria can
hibernate<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.850> there<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> risk<00:01:48.600> associated

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
hibernate so there is a risk associated

think<00:02:10.229> with<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.410> ipad<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.099> alliance<00:02:11.520> I

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
think with the ipad it is alliance I

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.730 
think with the ipad it is alliance I
think<00:02:12.000> there<00:02:12.090> are<00:02:12.120> number<00:02:12.360> things<00:02:12.540> we

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
think there are number things we

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.270 
think there are number things we
test<00:02:13.040> with<00:02:13.220> it<00:02:13.340> but<00:02:13.850> it's<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:15.620> provides<00:02:16.160> the

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
test with it but it's it provides the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.450 
test with it but it's it provides the
potential<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.880> be<00:02:16.970> relatively<00:02:17.300> easy<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.780> use

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
potential to be relatively easy to use

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.220 
potential to be relatively easy to use
so<00:02:19.460> it's<00:02:19.610> light<00:02:19.850> we'll<00:02:20.420> have<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.750> test<00:02:20.960> how

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
so it's light we'll have to test how

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.830 
so it's light we'll have to test how
safe<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.190> as<00:02:22.340> regards<00:02:22.790> harboring<00:02:23.300> bacteria

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
safe it is as regards harboring bacteria

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.510 
safe it is as regards harboring bacteria
and<00:02:23.900> things<00:02:24.110> like<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.320> and<00:02:24.680> how<00:02:25.100> robust<00:02:25.400> it

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
and things like that and how robust it

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.510 
and things like that and how robust it
is<00:02:25.640> will<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:25.940> be<00:02:26.090> dropped<00:02:27.100> there<00:02:28.100> are<00:02:28.220> device

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
is will it be dropped there are device

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.340 
is will it be dropped there are device
little<00:02:28.850> bit<00:02:28.970> around<00:02:29.180> it<00:02:29.390> but<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:29.600> can<00:02:30.230> protect

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
little bit around it but it can protect

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.220 
little bit around it but it can protect
it<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.680> bit<00:02:30.800> more<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:31.780> think<00:02:32.780> all<00:02:32.870> these<00:02:32.990> things

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
it a bit more I think all these things

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.230 
it a bit more I think all these things
probably<00:02:33.440> need<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.740> be<00:02:33.830> tested<00:02:34.090> one<00:02:35.090> of<00:02:35.180> the

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
probably need to be tested one of the

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.430 
probably need to be tested one of the
key<00:02:35.390> things<00:02:35.660> that<00:02:35.720> people<00:02:36.020> were<00:02:36.080> likely<00:02:36.290> to

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
key things that people were likely to

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.800 
key things that people were likely to
ask<00:02:36.710> is<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.520> we've<00:02:38.270> obviously<00:02:38.510> had

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
ask is that we've obviously had

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.660 
ask is that we've obviously had
computers<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.650> laptops<00:02:39.770> on<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.250> wards<00:02:40.520> but

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
computers and laptops on the wards but

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.190 
computers and laptops on the wards but
some<00:02:40.820> people<00:02:41.030> only<00:02:41.180> just<00:02:41.570> getting<00:02:41.720> used<00:02:42.050> to

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
some people only just getting used to

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.050 
some people only just getting used to
them<00:02:42.350> how<00:02:43.010> do<00:02:43.070> you<00:02:43.220> think<00:02:43.490> people<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:43.820> aren't

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
them how do you think people that aren't

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.730 
them how do you think people that aren't
necessarily<00:02:44.230> tech-savvy<00:02:45.230> you're<00:02:45.560> going<00:02:45.680> to

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
necessarily tech-savvy you're going to

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.710 
necessarily tech-savvy you're going to
get<00:02:45.830> on<00:02:45.950> with<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.190> iPad<00:02:46.520> well<00:02:47.270> I<00:02:47.300> think<00:02:47.390> the

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
get on with the iPad well I think the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.440 
get on with the iPad well I think the
iPads<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.410> its<00:02:48.500> technology<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:49.310> using<00:02:50.150> some

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
iPads and its technology and using some

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.510 
iPads and its technology and using some
of<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.630> frames<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.140> formats<00:02:51.590> in<00:02:51.740> which<00:02:51.770> you

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
of the frames and formats in which you

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.160 
of the frames and formats in which you
can<00:02:52.700> build<00:02:52.910> software<00:02:53.180> can<00:02:53.630> actually<00:02:53.900> make<00:02:54.020> it

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
can build software can actually make it

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.750 
can build software can actually make it
very<00:02:54.260> easy<00:02:54.380> I<00:02:54.860> think<00:02:55.280> we're<00:02:55.370> going<00:02:55.460> to<00:02:55.610> make

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
very easy I think we're going to make

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.400 
very easy I think we're going to make
software<00:02:56.120> easier<00:02:56.600> than<00:02:56.750> than<00:02:57.020> some<00:02:57.230> of<00:02:57.320> that

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
software easier than than some of that

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.810 
software easier than than some of that
that's<00:02:57.590> available<00:02:57.800> today<00:02:58.250> and<00:02:58.490> we've<00:02:58.640> done

the<00:03:07.640> operations<00:03:08.090> that<00:03:08.150> are<00:03:08.240> going<00:03:08.390> to<00:03:08.450> be

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
the operations that are going to be

the operations that are going to be
there<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:08.900> actually<00:03:09.050> presenting<00:03:09.620> quite<00:03:09.890> a

there and actually presenting quite a

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
simple format and to be honest I think

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.110 
simple format and to be honest I think
it<00:03:12.080> is<00:03:12.290> relatively<00:03:12.890> easy<00:03:13.190> to<00:03:13.460> move<00:03:13.640> from<00:03:13.880> paper

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
it is relatively easy to move from paper

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.360 
it is relatively easy to move from paper
into<00:03:14.510> this<00:03:14.600> type<00:03:14.840> of<00:03:14.870> technology<00:03:15.280> people<00:03:16.280> of

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
into this type of technology people of

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.980 
into this type of technology people of
something<00:03:17.240> like<00:03:17.300> seventy<00:03:17.660> percent<00:03:17.750> the

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
something like seventy percent the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.350 
something like seventy percent the
country<00:03:18.350> now<00:03:18.470> is<00:03:18.500> using<00:03:18.830> iPhones<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.670> they're

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
country now is using iPhones and they're

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.580 
country now is using iPhones and they're
fairly<00:03:20.600> familiar<00:03:20.810> with<00:03:21.110> some<00:03:21.200> of<00:03:21.260> those<00:03:21.350> types

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
fairly familiar with some of those types

fairly familiar with some of those types
of<00:03:21.710> applications<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:23.030> this<00:03:23.240> is<00:03:23.270> it's<00:03:23.990> a

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
of applications so this is it's a

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.260 
of applications so this is it's a
broader<00:03:24.290> screen<00:03:24.650> it's<00:03:24.980> it's<00:03:25.550> quite<00:03:25.910> easy<00:03:25.940> to

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
broader screen it's it's quite easy to

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.810 
broader screen it's it's quite easy to
design<00:03:26.500> that<00:03:27.500> easy<00:03:27.770> to<00:03:28.010> use<00:03:28.220> screens<00:03:28.580> and

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
design that easy to use screens and

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.000 
design that easy to use screens and
functionality<00:03:29.390> so<00:03:30.110> I<00:03:30.140> think<00:03:30.380> it's<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:30.680> game<00:03:30.800> got

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
functionality so I think it's a game got

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.380 
functionality so I think it's a game got
great<00:03:31.190> potential<00:03:31.550> to<00:03:31.790> actually<00:03:31.940> make<00:03:32.270> it

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
great potential to actually make it

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.880 
great potential to actually make it
easier<00:03:32.450> to<00:03:32.690> use<00:03:32.900> electronic<00:03:33.290> patient<00:03:33.440> records

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
easier to use electronic patient records

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.250 
easier to use electronic patient records
for<00:03:34.010> people<00:03:34.280> who<00:03:34.370> are<00:03:34.460> new<00:03:34.670> to<00:03:34.700> technology<00:03:35.510> so

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
for people who are new to technology so

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.300 
for people who are new to technology so
you've<00:03:36.380> just<00:03:36.410> mentioned<00:03:36.740> the<00:03:37.010> app<00:03:37.280> that

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
you've just mentioned the app that

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.830 
you've just mentioned the app that
you've<00:03:37.610> developed<00:03:37.910> tell<00:03:38.480> me<00:03:38.570> a<00:03:38.600> little<00:03:38.630> bit

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
you've developed tell me a little bit

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.870 
you've developed tell me a little bit
more<00:03:38.960> about<00:03:39.020> the<00:03:39.290> app<00:03:39.350> itself<00:03:39.520> well<00:03:40.520> we've

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
more about the app itself well we've

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.400 
more about the app itself well we've
started<00:03:41.060> with<00:03:41.270> Maxim's<00:03:41.600> bedside<00:03:42.020> to<00:03:42.170> try<00:03:42.320> and

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
started with Maxim's bedside to try and

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.000 
started with Maxim's bedside to try and
get<00:03:42.470> some<00:03:42.620> of<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.740> most<00:03:42.830> critical

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
get some of the most critical

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.580 
get some of the most critical
information<00:03:43.630> for<00:03:44.630> people<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:44.930> start<00:03:45.020> to<00:03:45.290> adopt

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
information for people to start to adopt

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.380 
information for people to start to adopt
him<00:03:45.770> I<00:03:45.980> try<00:03:46.130> to<00:03:46.160> make<00:03:46.310> it<00:03:46.370> easy<00:03:46.580> to<00:03:47.120> use

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
him I try to make it easy to use

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.070 
him I try to make it easy to use
electronic<00:03:47.930> patient<00:03:48.110> record<00:03:49.480> so<00:03:50.480> application

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
electronic patient record so application

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.420 
electronic patient record so application
you<00:03:51.260> can<00:03:51.290> list<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.680> patient's<00:03:52.160> it<00:03:52.250> can<00:03:52.340> be

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
you can list the patient's it can be

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.210 
you can list the patient's it can be
available<00:03:52.610> to<00:03:52.850> clinicians<00:03:53.330> and<00:03:54.100> depending<00:03:55.100> on

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
available to clinicians and depending on

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.280 
available to clinicians and depending on
your<00:03:55.330> access<00:03:56.330> rise<00:03:56.570> depends<00:03:56.930> on<00:03:57.020> the<00:03:57.080> sort<00:03:57.230> of

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
your access rise depends on the sort of

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.230 
your access rise depends on the sort of
information<00:03:57.710> that<00:03:57.740> you<00:03:57.860> can<00:03:57.890> see<00:03:58.190> so<00:03:58.850> we<00:03:59.090> can

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
information that you can see so we can

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.880 
information that you can see so we can
see<00:03:59.420> quite<00:03:59.600> easily<00:03:59.900> that<00:04:00.440> if<00:04:00.560> we<00:04:00.680> pick<00:04:00.860> a

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
see quite easily that if we pick a

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.770 
see quite easily that if we pick a
patient<00:04:01.400> and<00:04:02.000> we<00:04:02.090> can<00:04:02.210> pick<00:04:02.330> up<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:02.570> basic

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
patient and we can pick up the basic

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.750 
patient and we can pick up the basic
demographics<00:04:03.380> we<00:04:03.560> can<00:04:03.710> verify<00:04:04.160> through<00:04:04.610> the

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
demographics we can verify through the

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.730 
demographics we can verify through the
picture<00:04:05.180> with<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:05.750> patient<00:04:06.140> sees<00:04:06.290> we<00:04:06.470> can<00:04:06.620> see

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
picture with the patient sees we can see

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.860 
picture with the patient sees we can see
their<00:04:06.950> information<00:04:07.280> fairly<00:04:07.760> easily<00:04:07.970> and<00:04:08.390> we

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
their information fairly easily and we

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.040 
their information fairly easily and we
can<00:04:08.990> drill<00:04:09.230> down<00:04:09.260> into<00:04:09.740> the<00:04:10.070> clinical<00:04:10.490> details

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
can drill down into the clinical details

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.870 
can drill down into the clinical details
in<00:04:12.050> a<00:04:12.170> fairly<00:04:12.500> rapid<00:04:12.740> it<00:04:13.070> that<00:04:13.220> way<00:04:13.430> we<00:04:13.730> can

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
in a fairly rapid it that way we can

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.370 
in a fairly rapid it that way we can
have<00:04:14.060> a<00:04:14.090> look<00:04:14.270> at<00:04:14.420> the<00:04:14.480> diagnosis<00:04:15.080> in<00:04:15.200> some

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
have a look at the diagnosis in some

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.140 
have a look at the diagnosis in some
detail<00:04:17.200> and<00:04:18.200> we<00:04:18.950> can<00:04:19.100> also<00:04:19.250> then<00:04:19.430> lot<00:04:19.609> be<00:04:19.640> alert

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
detail and we can also then lot be alert

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.270 
detail and we can also then lot be alert
a<00:04:20.510> allergies<00:04:21.140> of<00:04:21.229> the<00:04:21.380> patient<00:04:21.770> house<00:04:21.950> so<00:04:22.190> we

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
a allergies of the patient house so we

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.670 
a allergies of the patient house so we
can<00:04:22.400> see<00:04:22.720> if<00:04:23.720> this<00:04:23.900> put<00:04:24.080> patients<00:04:24.470> going<00:04:24.620> to

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
can see if this put patients going to

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.650 
can see if this put patients going to
react<00:04:24.890> to<00:04:24.919> certain<00:04:25.220> things

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
react to certain things

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.870 
react to certain things
and<00:04:25.900> then<00:04:26.410> we<00:04:26.470> can<00:04:26.500> record<00:04:26.770> vital<00:04:27.010> signs<00:04:27.460> so

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
and then we can record vital signs so

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.850 
and then we can record vital signs so
this<00:04:28.270> is<00:04:28.360> very<00:04:28.510> much<00:04:28.870> the<00:04:29.140> early<00:04:29.440> stage<00:04:29.650> of

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
this is very much the early stage of

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.130 
this is very much the early stage of
rolling<00:04:30.460> out<00:04:30.610> the<00:04:30.760> application<00:04:31.330> that<00:04:32.050> we

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
rolling out the application that we

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.160 
rolling out the application that we
already<00:04:32.320> have<00:04:32.470> in<00:04:32.820> many<00:04:33.820> settings<00:04:34.210> but

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
already have in many settings but

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.710 
already have in many settings but
rolling<00:04:35.470> out<00:04:35.590> in<00:04:35.800> a<00:04:36.070> different<00:04:36.520> view<00:04:36.820> and<00:04:37.120> as<00:04:37.630> I

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
rolling out in a different view and as I

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.120 
rolling out in a different view and as I
said<00:04:37.870> make<00:04:38.200> it<00:04:38.380> easy<00:04:38.530> for<00:04:38.800> people<00:04:38.830> to

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
said make it easy for people to

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.060 
said make it easy for people to
understand<00:04:39.640> using<00:04:40.120> using<00:04:40.480> standard<00:04:41.070> formats

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
understand using using standard formats

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.410 
understand using using standard formats
that<00:04:42.250> people<00:04:42.520> signs<00:04:42.700> get<00:04:42.880> familiar<00:04:43.090> with<00:04:43.180> the

what we need to then to do is validate
and<00:05:00.250> make<00:05:00.430> sure<00:05:00.640> the<00:05:00.880> screens<00:05:01.150> that<00:05:01.330> we're

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
and make sure the screens that we're

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.840 
and make sure the screens that we're
designing<00:05:01.630> are<00:05:02.280> functionally<00:05:03.280> usable<00:05:03.700> and

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
designing are functionally usable and

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.360 
designing are functionally usable and
that's<00:05:04.300> a<00:05:04.420> skill<00:05:04.660> set<00:05:04.870> that<00:05:04.930> the<00:05:05.350> IMS<00:05:05.800> is<00:05:06.070> well

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
that's a skill set that the IMS is well

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.330 
that's a skill set that the IMS is well
known<00:05:06.610> for<00:05:07.350> it's<00:05:08.350> not<00:05:08.590> about<00:05:08.770> being<00:05:08.830> necessary

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
known for it's not about being necessary

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.740 
known for it's not about being necessary
clever<00:05:09.610> with<00:05:09.790> a<00:05:09.820> software<00:05:10.270> it's<00:05:10.420> about<00:05:10.570> making

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
clever with a software it's about making

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.690 
clever with a software it's about making
it<00:05:11.020> really<00:05:11.230> usable<00:05:11.920> so<00:05:12.400> that<00:05:12.580> you're<00:05:12.670> not

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
it really usable so that you're not

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.400 
it really usable so that you're not
adding<00:05:12.970> lots<00:05:13.270> of<00:05:13.480> screens<00:05:13.780> and<00:05:14.080> lots<00:05:14.290> of

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
adding lots of screens and lots of

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.550 
adding lots of screens and lots of
finger<00:05:15.040> strokes<00:05:15.280> or<00:05:15.430> keystrokes<00:05:15.970> and<00:05:16.560> when

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
finger strokes or keystrokes and when

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.020 
finger strokes or keystrokes and when
we've<00:05:17.680> got<00:05:17.710> that<00:05:17.950> more<00:05:18.100> validated<00:05:18.700> we<00:05:18.850> hope

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
we've got that more validated we hope

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.460 
we've got that more validated we hope
that<00:05:19.120> it<00:05:19.210> will<00:05:19.270> generate<00:05:19.510> a<00:05:19.960> lot<00:05:20.320> more

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
that it will generate a lot more

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.190 
that it will generate a lot more
interest<00:05:20.970> and<00:05:21.970> this<00:05:22.120> is<00:05:22.240> just<00:05:22.270> one<00:05:22.450> additional

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
interest and this is just one additional

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.750 
interest and this is just one additional
dimension<00:05:23.710> as<00:05:23.800> to<00:05:23.890> how<00:05:24.010> to<00:05:24.070> use<00:05:24.310> Medtronic

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760

this<00:05:30.790> is<00:05:30.880> just<00:05:30.970> an<00:05:31.120> additional<00:05:31.510> one<00:05:31.690> so<00:05:31.900> once

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
this is just an additional one so once

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.350 
this is just an additional one so once
we<00:05:32.560> start<00:05:32.800> to<00:05:32.950> get<00:05:33.130> people<00:05:33.700> familiar<00:05:33.880> and

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
we start to get people familiar and

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.540 
we start to get people familiar and
