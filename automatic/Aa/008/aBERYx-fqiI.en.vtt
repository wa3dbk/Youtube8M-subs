00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.619
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.420
 second movie today i want you one 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.890
 Introduce a nice beginner project 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.539
 and show me mine 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.490
 made-up bags with a cellar 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.460
 I can take a short side 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.510
 explain how the paper cut 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.189
 is made and then continue 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.969
 with the cutting of the fabric and 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.370
 give them a little note in advance 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.410
 the instructions first completely 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.840
 if you sew the part yourself volt 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.820
 and it is also important that yours 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.129
 fabric before work once was already 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.500
 the shrinkage of the end product too 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.469
 avoid we start with that 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.780
 paper cut you need one for this 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.750
 paper scissors newspapers or wrapping paper 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.680
 a ruler or geodesic a pen 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.079
 as well as a train or a plate with which 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.769
 her then the corners and the bag 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.890
 explore for the bags of prey 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:12.330
 draws a rectangle with the dimensions 50 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.460
 cm x 28 cm the corners of a long knew 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.280
 are then rounded off and in the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.880
 the other side you draw in the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.729
 middle then 25 cm a mark then 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.799
 you go 8 cm to the right or 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.560
 to the left and after two more 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.119
 Markers for the cellar continue 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.100
 then you draw one more right 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.659
 for the cup measuring 35 cm x 9 cm 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:42.840
 and then you need another rectangle 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:44.939
 for the carriers the 60 cm x 12 cm at 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.649
 Best writing the parts with you 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.649
 later can also assign that 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:57.430
 besides, you then need for that too 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.850
 fast stuff a stuffed animal 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.680
 pin a safety pin 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.080
 chalk or a pencil mark 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.870
 an iron two different fabrics 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.990
 and fit that for that 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.480
 bags of loot need about 06 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.580
 meter at normal fabric width is 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.760
 approximately at 1 50 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.880
 or 150 meters and for the 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.300
 Patients and the carrier I need you 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.310
 then we make 05 meters then you catch 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.500
 to cut to the fabric 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.940
 we need the pass four times in 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.550
 simple fabric days 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.010
 For that you put the paper made 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.770
 Part is on the left side of the fabric 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.870
 what about the knitting needles and cuts 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.170
 then with a centimeter of it is even 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.660
 The part of the led carrier procedure 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.550
 We also need these two times 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.360
 easy fabric location 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.860
 and think please here to tina admittance 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.680
 then we need the bags 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.780
 four times a simple fabric here too 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.300
 Do not give her the paper part on the left 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.590
 fabric side is the stuck and 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.350
 cut the bags of prey with one 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.990
 centimeters after adding to the 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.850
 Cloth bag should you the marks 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.100
 Do not forget for the holders too 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.200
 also mark that makes the please of 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.570
 left first right fabric side would like 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.310
 we have no unsightly nations at 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.120
 some substances can also stop it from 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.460
 be beneficial 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.910
 instead of chalk with a pencil 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.460
 to draw on and then control 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.910
 Let's go if we can thus together 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.950
 so four times the pass four times the 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.840
 bags bags and twice the carriers 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.650
 then we start with the right one 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.670
 So work which we reject prepare 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.710
 the cellars are folding 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.360
 For this we lie with the help of 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.280
 mark doubted 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.620
 how exactly is this you see on the 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.380
 picture the folds are busy and busy 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.670
 then staple it makes you 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.380
 actually by hand but that 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.060
 also works with the sewing machine 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.640
 Here then had to stop later now 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.680
 be careful that you are just below the 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.450
 Half not that one stop again 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.060
 that you can not stop it from the right 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:10.709
 side looks even a little here 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:13.560
 take note with elastic materials 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.300
 we with a krad sting and a stich 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.109
 length of 2 but you can also 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.359
 vary 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.030
 So make God bigger if you do that 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.010
 we would like to have one more here 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.160
 picture with the stapled cellar celebrated 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:30.150
 the fold smells ironed and so on 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:33.060
 bag with all bags if 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.669
 you are so far then you are the 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.820
 fit right to right on the pockets 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:41.550
 wanted and never the whole afterwards 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.890
 tina went encore ironed into the passe 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.040
 and if you are the part right now 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.840
 it almost draws my bag where 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.030
 We'll do it when ironing 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.160
 Let's take the carriers 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.390
 before we halve the strips of length 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.510
 after and iron on 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.930
 redesigned along and take 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.340
 the whole then with the help of the same 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.260
 safety pin we now turn the 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.300
 carrier to be right afterwards 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.390
 her again she ironed by the 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.650
 For most of climbing and now 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.170
 we come back to the 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.240
 bags people there we take two 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.020
 Share and put this right on the right 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.340
 then join each other and then join 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.020
 Of course he had to pay attention to that 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.900
 that he has the upper edge 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.300
 that does not fit together as not 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.620
 She took care of the chains 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.350
 Do not forget them now 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.120
 I have mine for example at sixx he 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.850
 here you can choose from different 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.340
 sizes and warm and also different 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.110
 motive as you like it 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.420
 In addition, there are also still the 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.540
 to pass different possibility 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.100
 if you can not decide 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.690
 and you can continue the labels 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.170
 even Iron-stories 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.750
 to let 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.690
 There you have wonderful when you have them 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.430
 but forget to take but how 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.530
 you said look at the whole thing 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.290
 best even to the website 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.550
 is redxgroup.de 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.160
 but with our bag we are still 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.940
 No further and I finished so go 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.700
 Now back to that you have 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.550
 two bags sewn on each other 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.610
 and now you have to go to the rounded one 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.200
 corner a bit at the seam 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.830
 cut it into a simple one 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.660
 when doing better and how he gets up 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.120
 I saw the pictures with the pictures 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.850
 umpteen strokes bypasses to calculate easily 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.680
 that the substance from when with the others 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.740
 two bags wanted the left 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.470
 you will stay as well afterwards 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:40.620
 Do you have one of the prey on the right 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.300
 Turn and then the two bags on the right 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.460
 on the right together 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.980
 and before you see the top edge 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.920
 put together we put the carrier on 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:53.430
 the bag the distance to sides seam 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:56.430
 here is about six inches and 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.980
 then we take the the 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.430
 upper ranks that fits together and 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.110
 but must be careful that 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.540
 Opening is left as we the 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.190
 still have to turn around 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:09.820
 you simply pull the fabric through 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:12.160
 the opening animal has left the must 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:15.340
 then of course be closed 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.020
 you can do that by hand or too 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.720
 with the sewing machine 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.400
 I have a staggered one now 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.110
 katschnig taken when again peter 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.140
 Stinglings of two remained 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.450
 if you open the walls 

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:32.440
 you have connected after about 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:34.960
 three hours work a bag and the 

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.190
 Did you do it yourself? I hope 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.320
 I have the video a bit again 

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.320
 time and see you next time
