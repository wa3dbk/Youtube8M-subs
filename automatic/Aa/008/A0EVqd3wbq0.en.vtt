00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
and then someone figured out very

and then someone figured out very
quickly<00:01:11.890> that<00:01:12.100> a<00:01:12.130> double<00:01:12.430> chair<00:01:12.640> was<00:01:12.790> just<00:01:13.120> as

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
quickly that a double chair was just as

quickly that a double chair was just as
easy<00:01:13.420> to<00:01:13.510> build<00:01:13.690> as<00:01:13.870> a<00:01:13.900> single<00:01:14.260> chair<00:01:14.500> the

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
easy to build as a single chair the

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.950 
easy to build as a single chair the
single<00:01:15.460> chairs<00:01:15.670> went<00:01:15.910> away<00:01:15.970> very<00:01:16.300> quickly<00:01:16.630> and

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
single chairs went away very quickly and

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.290
