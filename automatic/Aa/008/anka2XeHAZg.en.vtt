spoon this is oil-based modeling clay it
doesn't<00:01:00.059> dry<00:01:00.270> out<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.170> stays<00:01:01.440> pretty

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
doesn't dry out so it stays pretty

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.240 
doesn't dry out so it stays pretty
greasy<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:03.270> awhile<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.949> recycled<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.040> from<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
greasy for awhile I recycled it from the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.000 
greasy for awhile I recycled it from the
old<00:01:05.339> sculptors<00:01:05.850> from<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.090> last<00:01:06.299> video<00:01:07.010> it's

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
old sculptors from the last video it's

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.350 
old sculptors from the last video it's
usually<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.369> means<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.850> an<00:01:08.970> end

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
usually a means to an end

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.649 
usually a means to an end
so<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:11.100> know<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.640> pretty<00:01:11.820> much<00:01:11.939> use<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.150> to

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
so you know I just pretty much use it to

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.649 
so you know I just pretty much use it to
do<00:01:12.780> like<00:01:12.930> figure<00:01:13.260> sculpting<00:01:13.710> or<00:01:14.270> if<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.450> want<00:01:15.600> to

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
do like figure sculpting or if I want to

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.060 
do like figure sculpting or if I want to
you<00:01:15.960> know<00:01:16.049> sculpt<00:01:16.350> something<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.920> can

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
you know sculpt something just so I can

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.719 
you know sculpt something just so I can
paint<00:01:17.280> from<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:19.590> from<00:01:19.830> looking<00:01:19.950> at<00:01:20.130> Peter<00:01:20.430> I

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
paint from it so from looking at Peter I

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.730 
paint from it so from looking at Peter I
noticed<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.900> divide<00:01:22.140> into<00:01:22.229> thirds

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
noticed that you can divide into thirds

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.590 
noticed that you can divide into thirds
so<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.460> get<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> bottom<00:01:23.939> where<00:01:24.090> his<00:01:24.180> belt<00:01:24.390> is

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
so you get the bottom where his belt is

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.749 
so you get the bottom where his belt is
and<00:01:25.020> then<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.290> his<00:01:25.409> neckline<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.520> it's

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
and then you have his neckline so it's

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.870 
and then you have his neckline so it's
even<00:01:27.180> thirds<00:01:27.509> now<00:01:28.430> I'm<00:01:29.430> gonna<00:01:29.549> throw<00:01:29.729> some

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
even thirds now I'm gonna throw some

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.510 
even thirds now I'm gonna throw some
arms<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.329> them<00:01:30.470> I'm<00:01:31.470> gonna<00:01:31.650> fix<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.950> up<00:01:32.040> later<00:01:32.310> I
