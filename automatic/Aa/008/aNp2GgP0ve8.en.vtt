00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
the trouble to open the boxes to see

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.720 
the trouble to open the boxes to see
what<00:03:23.989> was<00:03:24.140> inside<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.980> I<00:03:25.070> think<00:03:25.310> most<00:03:25.430> people

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
what was inside and I think most people
