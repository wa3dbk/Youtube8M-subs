00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.840
 to the video that ere mondraker sends you a 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.700
 I greet one despite never being 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.830
 confirmed there is a rumor that the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.540
 iron forge air station was supposed to 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.750
 that would be the starting area of the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.000
 gnomes all the prisoners had speis 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.070
 racial but some were added to 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.560
 the basic ones of pressure other removed 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.960
 humans with awaken prayer trolls 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.640
 connected was just a day with the burning 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.030
 plain and so on 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.399
 3 there was a period in tvc where the orcs 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.500
 they had their shoulders searched twice 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.149
 smaller and worst of all is that a 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.660
 blizzard took two to three months 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.610
 repair it 4 21 days they had shoulders 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.940
 slightly larger than they have 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.460
 now 5 recently in the patch of 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.190
 woodward a gm accidentally sent by 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.050
 mail the martf fury a shirt the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.719
 which is an artifact that when used 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.699
 ones or tea all he used for that 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.190
 will make bad figs and a couple of voices in a 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.260
 place people realized in their afternoon 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.060
 statistics that had a abysmal and 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.080
 street ever and was the victim of a 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.770
 permanent 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.870
 long time 6 the women talen had 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.240
 a lot of doors and obstacles that do not 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.600
 they can still have it but in lesser 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.850
 measure 7 bullfighters could not enter 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.940
 by the molt encore door next to the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.830
 house was one that is 8 one of the 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.600
 best trolls was that when the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.060
 servers of the instances were 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.340
 full and there was a group of 40 people 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.560
 entering molt encore inevitably 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.660
 fell in the lava and to top it all 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.540
 threw the message the instance is 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.340
 full please try later 9 the 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.500
 trolls used to have a joke for 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.630
 rachid and the mote that said there is a world 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.580
 war best in the morning and kate war best 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.920
 and night with war the best in the 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.170
 afternoon on eiffel to hit point and 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.000
 that had guardes in time operation had 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.300
 in time of war is it to nowhere before 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.280
 it to war best in technique by which 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.610
 was removed from the game because it was a 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.740
 reference to smoking marijuana 10 there is a 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.840
 super gloomy crypt behind caraz and 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.610
 which is inaccessible except for the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.220
 shooters and shamans with their skills 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.200
 of far vision is very well made and 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.740
 It was probably going to be something but 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.960
 blizzard decided to abandon it 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.970
 in the high version of wow all the 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.700
 instances had a model like the dark 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.890
 portal there was even one under the water 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.260
 in doing what was supposed to be a 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.330
 instance there surely only 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.300
 they decided to put it there because if who 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.340
 know and look at the photo 12 the meetings 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.620
 stone is not designed to do 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.360
 they add other people but they were 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.660
 used to know who they were in 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.940
 queue for that instance 13 retaliation 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.160
 I did not have animation before and 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.110
 you could see the bugs of your enemies like this 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.150
 that the warriors used to use against 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.330
 the roques making it unlikely 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.130
 that they would notice 14 after a 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.990
 vanilla patch something is diving 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.060
 making the warriors have 1 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.000
 extra point in talents doing that 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.480
 they had a spec of 31 21 but 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.490
 making them very over power 15 people 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.990
 I used to pay a lot of money for people 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.420
 I had the au pair black key 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.120
 what spears 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.520
 the unstoppable forcÃ© aphex alter weapon 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.010
 I used to make novak to the players instead 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.180
 to study them thank you for watching this 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.180
