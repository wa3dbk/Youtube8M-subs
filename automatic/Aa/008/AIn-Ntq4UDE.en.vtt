00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.320
 Hello everyone guys with you and today 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.300
 we have a patchout review for patch 096 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.310
 today we will learn what changes us 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.740
 waiting for the next patch and what it costs 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.660
 rejoice why not and the first 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.550
 Information I want to be happy for sure 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.039
 with us because my 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.170
 predictions and assumptions come true 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.449
 Developers will still get a review 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.570
 for many, many under and he follows 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.059
 patch yourself look at this list here 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.480
 and top sent and low level to the 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.030
 sole 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.460
 and sent the average level in general very 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.620
 very many especially i like of course 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.390
 draw your attention to the nerve of the review 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.629
 such a potter as an object to 68 object 704 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.059
 isu-152 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.559
 level 10 waffle and ninth waffle 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.809
 Yaga e100 level 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.870
 borsig waffentrager who is already everybody 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:07.970
 just from the bushes zadolbal hocho 9 and 10 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:10.970
 level and also t67 t-40 t29 t110 e3 and 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.380
 t110 e4 words Serb finally 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.360
 developers have paid attention to 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.520
 problem by tassauf randami because 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.740
 really lately this 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.110
 technology has become a lot 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.420
 in some battles just over 50 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.180
 percent in each of the teams and this 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.160
 made my problems imbalance not 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.650
 opportunity to play tactically well 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.290
 and just the guys are standing bush hope 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.030
 that here after the nerf life review sau 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.710
 will become more dependent on the team 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.930
 they will cease to be so much 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.460
 brands and just guys will be easier 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.800
 play because when you check out 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.420
 of some eighth-level borscht which 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.010
 not only that he does not shine as well 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.940
 It can afford to shine and shoot and 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.370
 its light 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.560
 I think it's just a bust should 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.960
 there may be some minuses near the tank but 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.790
 of course the lack of armor in general guys 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.100
 do not know what you think but I personally 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.140
 I think the nerve review on tasavuf by rank 2 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.920
 part quite correct decision 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.640
 still for sa it is really 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.920
 anti-tank guns 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.110
 but they should not shine themselves 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.340
 break in or just go without 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.450
 support team 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.090
 they must act as 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.020
 support of this very command is mine 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.700
 such an opinion 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.070
 what do you think about this 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.800
 global rebalance will make un random 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.150
 write better or worse in the comments 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.520
 now let's move on to another 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.130
 information for testing super 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.810
 testers added the following blah tanks 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.640
 blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.190
 in general guys about them I just yesterday 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.940
 did a video so if you want you can 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.330
 look 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.800
 plenum thanked initiative 096 recycled into 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.700
 new visual quality tanks 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.940
 lion ferdinand e100 tiger p t95 object 704 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.070
 amx 50b it guys well and soon 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.960
 time you will see these changes in me 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.100
 some bugs fixed on the channel 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.980
 visual models 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.200
 well rebalance review 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.440
 some tanks but we’re talking about it already 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.670
 talked but this is more interesting 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.160
 light tank rebalance produced 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.430
 weakening characteristics for a bulldog and 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.130
 t37 that's what I guys don't understand why 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.990
 nerd bulldog no it's certainly strong 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.170
 car but it is as strong as 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.360
 For example, t71, why is it nerfing? 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.010
 Tanchik bends anchik shoot . is shining 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.050
 but at the same time tanchik size of Pershing 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.690
 Yes, and as if a little overgrown 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.990
 firefly well, and t37 I would not say that this 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.209
 straight such imba good vigorous car to 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.220
 can stoop well why should i not drink no 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:35.270
 clear but let's see what were 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.060
 improved performance d 2159 16v and for 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.250
 131 to 132 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.490
 mt-25 t-54 lightened 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.680
 t71 ious panther 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.560
 I don’t understand why apat was 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.260
 t71 he and so on them and so he rides 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.330
 breaks in shoots fucking principle a 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.920
 after entering new light tanks nothing 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.810
 didn't change he was like he was cool 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.150
 remained the same as in 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.440
 art studio 131 and vst 32 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:06.140
 excellent light tanks Well why T21 916 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.750
 mt-25 cost apnut t-54 clothed 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.580
 also about the panther's anus 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.700
 do not speak and sometimes very well apat 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:17.930
 No need t71 is not clear as well guys 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.880
 the question remains where about amx 12t mx 1375 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.650
 because im from trance x5 to the jury 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.780
 which the bulldog 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.030
 or one pessimist but he them completely 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.389
 inferior where about these light tanks 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.150
 lord shorter some about and of course 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.490
 good but here are the Murphy and up to 7 st1 i 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.350
 guys don't fully understand the cards and 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.479
 objects fixed some bumps 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.240
 relief on the maps of the steppe prokhorovka and 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.680
 roger well made good gameplay 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.900
 improvements to the map mines 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.300
 damn one of my favorite cards in the game 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.310
 what could there have been a change of the range map 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.729
 dragon completely removed from the client 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.830
 games 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.419
 and here is this guys sadness you know we're in 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.910
 training rooms very often 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.160
 screamed at various stream shows on this 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.260
 map it was fun enough why 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.300
 remove her client why are you 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.490
 lying to you, Lord pity that Lee 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.380
 I do not understand the developers in the mode 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.880
 team battles added lasville cards 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.400
 mines sandy river 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.440
 finalized kb mode on the map Himmelsdorf 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.270
 changed some barricade types to 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.669
 map stalingrad here guys card 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.289
 Stalingrad I like very much but 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.840
 what I don't like is that there sometimes 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:23.150
 you go somewhere you sit ipad sit deadlock 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.500
 those. it takes a very long time to study 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.449
 to tooth 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.099
 know maybe the developers next 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.470
 patch it will correct and some 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:33.289
 logical departures such will make departures 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.240
 they are stumped improved effects on maps 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:38.240
 steppe pass and sandy river 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.490
 this is also good the rest is added 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.539
 the possibility of logging the client through social networks 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.340
 here is interest as but honestly 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.360
 retraining ability added 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:51.590
 specialty crew members 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.840
 glory to the eggs finally 38 my radio operators 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.970
 barracks who were lying around with 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.620
 two or three perks finally I 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.930
 I can transplant them somewhere to some 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.539
 more important specialty loaders 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.300
 or perhaps a gunner thank you potatoes 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:07.250
 not passed as they say, and four years 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.889
 improved interface and conversion 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.050
 credits and experience fixed twitching 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:12.949
 tank when playing a record battle well 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.840
 i.e. freeplay 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.120
 for this, too, special thanks because 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.220
 these twitches just pissed off for now 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.510
 write video 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.240
 optimized memory consumption in combat 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.430
 also good especially for probably 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.300
 weak computers 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.310
 optimized mapping of some 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.659
 special effects fixed some 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.260
 hangs and crashes 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:35.230
 game client well, again. 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.340
 although I'm in patch 095 with any departures 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.440
 or hang 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.690
 well, never encountered any that I certainly our 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.370
 extreme shows that are watched by 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.800
 twenty to thirty thousand people and because 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.140
 which client I have 2 site in general 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.700
 guys are such changes 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:51.940
 We are waiting for the next patch 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:54.340
 something else may change something else 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.820
 maybe add or maybe get out 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.710
 let's take a closer look at the general exit 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.300
 test i think he will 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.640
 or at the end of this month or already in 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.380
 Begin the next write in the comments 

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.940
 what do you think about nerve reviews 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.200
 this is an owl again and write in 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.870

 opa and nerf light tanks next 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.540
 patch 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.550
 that he seems right and what not 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.050
 I personally do not understand why nerfit was 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.930
 bulldog and t37 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.290
 and why was apat t71 which is and 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.660
 ngo 

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.850

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.960
 discuss on this I have all wait varnish and 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.760
