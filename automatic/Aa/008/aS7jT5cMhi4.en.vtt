becomes<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.369> little<00:01:29.909> bit<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.240> tougher<00:01:30.630> play

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
becomes a little bit of a tougher play

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.539

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
because he has to change the direction

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
okay so first is countering with an

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.630 
okay so first is countering with an
angle<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.950> our<00:01:38.070> own<00:01:38.450> second<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:40.130> lot<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.340> times

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
reset in the rally so hitting a float

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.459 
reset in the rally so hitting a float
slice<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:59.340> takes<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.090> while<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.450> travel<00:02:01.229> over

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
slice that takes a while to travel over

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.920 
slice that takes a while to travel over
to<00:02:01.500> Mark's<00:02:01.829> half<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.280> court<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:03.390> really

to Mark's half of the court is a really

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.590 
to Mark's half of the court is a really
good<00:02:04.079> option<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.710> for<00:02:05.670> all<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.969> players<00:02:06.270> that

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
good option and for all you players that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.210 
good option and for all you players that
don't<00:02:06.840> necessarily<00:02:07.049> have<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.829> really

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
don't necessarily have a really

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.800 
don't necessarily have a really
developed<00:02:08.789> slice<00:02:09.209> yet<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:10.200> know<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.530> LOB<00:02:10.800> is

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
developed slice yet you know the LOB is

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.860 
developed slice yet you know the LOB is
kind<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.050> step

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
kind of the step

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.350 
kind of the step
of<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.890> floated<00:02:15.310> slice<00:02:15.640> you<00:02:15.879> guys<00:02:16.060> could

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
of the floated slice you guys could

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.750 
of the floated slice you guys could
throw<00:02:16.629> up<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.900> lob<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.560> buy<00:02:17.739> yourself<00:02:17.950> some<00:02:18.489> time

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
throw up a lob to buy yourself some time

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.210 
throw up a lob to buy yourself some time
to<00:02:19.060> get<00:02:19.239> back<00:02:19.300> into<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.959> court<00:02:20.230> for<00:02:20.920> all<00:02:21.010> you

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
to get back into the court for all you

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.089 
to get back into the court for all you
more<00:02:21.489> advanced<00:02:21.879> players<00:02:22.379> use<00:02:23.379> that<00:02:23.620> float

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
more advanced players use that float

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.250 
more advanced players use that float
slice<00:02:24.550> just<00:02:25.239> so<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.629> the<00:02:25.780> bounce<00:02:25.989> of<00:02:26.230> the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
slice just so that the bounce of the

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.070 
slice just so that the bounce of the
ball<00:02:26.530> tends<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.640> be<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:27.760> little<00:02:28.150> trickier<00:02:28.720> for

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
ball tends to be a little trickier for

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.949 
ball tends to be a little trickier for
the<00:02:29.920> opponent<00:02:30.489> than<00:02:30.670> just<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.269> law<00:02:31.450> bounce

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
the opponent than just the law bounce

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.740 
the opponent than just the law bounce
would<00:02:32.319> be<00:02:32.470> okay<00:02:33.069> and<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.849> third<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.330> final

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
would be okay and the third and final

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.589 
would be okay and the third and final
option<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:36.370> really<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.060> one<00:02:37.239> we're<00:02:37.420> going<00:02:37.540> to

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
option and really the one we're going to

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.780 
option and really the one we're going to
use<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:38.290> just<00:02:38.769> make<00:02:38.950> sure<00:02:39.160> we're<00:02:39.370> keeping<00:02:39.519> our

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
use to just make sure we're keeping our

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.539 
use to just make sure we're keeping our
opponent<00:02:40.390> honest<00:02:40.840> over<00:02:41.140> there<00:02:41.349> is<00:02:41.560> getting

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
opponent honest over there is getting

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.330 
opponent honest over there is getting
way<00:02:42.790> out<00:02:43.000> wide<00:02:43.360> and<00:02:43.870> ripping<00:02:44.799> it<00:02:44.890> down<00:02:45.129> the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
way out wide and ripping it down the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.490 
way out wide and ripping it down the
line<00:02:45.549> ball<00:02:45.910> of<00:02:46.120> our<00:02:46.239> own<00:02:46.420> okay<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.200> I'm<00:02:47.290> gonna

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
line ball of our own okay and I'm gonna

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.930 
line ball of our own okay and I'm gonna
have<00:02:47.650> kind<00:02:48.459> of<00:02:48.720> emphasized<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:50.849> it's<00:02:51.849> a

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
have kind of emphasized that it's a

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.620 
have kind of emphasized that it's a
relatively<00:02:52.569> risky<00:02:53.230> play<00:02:54.150> simply<00:02:55.150> because

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
relatively risky play simply because

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.420 
relatively risky play simply because
when<00:02:55.870> I'm<00:02:55.989> outside<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.650> alley<00:02:56.829> the<00:02:57.190> Nets

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
when I'm outside the alley the Nets

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.789 
when I'm outside the alley the Nets
higher<00:02:57.730> out<00:02:58.060> here<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.720> I'm<00:02:59.379> hitting<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.769> a

higher out here and I'm hitting to a

higher out here and I'm hitting to a
much<00:03:00.069> smaller<00:03:00.180> target<00:03:01.180> than<00:03:01.209> I<00:03:01.420> would<00:03:01.660> be<00:03:01.810> if<00:03:01.959> I

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
much smaller target than I would be if I

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.860 
much smaller target than I would be if I
rolled<00:03:02.410> that<00:03:02.500> angle<00:03:02.980> cross-court<00:03:03.599> not<00:03:04.599> to

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
rolled that angle cross-court not to

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.140 
rolled that angle cross-court not to
mention<00:03:05.110> most<00:03:05.530> players<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.430> were<00:03:06.670> we're

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
mention most players that were we're

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.509 
mention most players that were we're
seeing<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.599> right-hander<00:03:08.260> so<00:03:08.500> Marx<00:03:08.829> forehand

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
seeing a right-hander so Marx forehand

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.880 
seeing a right-hander so Marx forehand
is<00:03:09.790> what's<00:03:10.599> going<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.840> go<00:03:10.989> try<00:03:11.260> to<00:03:11.290> track<00:03:11.650> this

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
is what's going to go try to track this

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.309 
is what's going to go try to track this
ball<00:03:12.160> down<00:03:12.220> if<00:03:12.610> I<00:03:12.730> hit<00:03:12.970> down<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.299> line<00:03:13.480> but

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
ball down if I hit down the line but

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.780 
ball down if I hit down the line but
with<00:03:14.440> that<00:03:14.590> being<00:03:14.829> said<00:03:14.920> we<00:03:15.370> don't<00:03:15.489> want<00:03:15.610> our

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
with that being said we don't want our

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.229 
with that being said we don't want our
opponent<00:03:16.390> to<00:03:16.569> feel<00:03:17.230> like<00:03:17.379> they<00:03:17.530> have<00:03:17.799> a<00:03:18.280> really

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
opponent to feel like they have a really

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.699 
opponent to feel like they have a really
good<00:03:19.389> idea<00:03:19.720> of<00:03:19.780> where<00:03:19.989> we're<00:03:20.139> hitting<00:03:20.440> all<00:03:20.590> the

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
good idea of where we're hitting all the

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.650 
good idea of where we're hitting all the
time<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.489> we<00:03:21.910> don't<00:03:22.090> always<00:03:22.269> want<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.540> be

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
time and we don't always want to be

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.629 
time and we don't always want to be
afraid<00:03:22.989> of<00:03:23.139> hitting<00:03:23.470> down<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:23.950> line<00:03:24.130> so<00:03:24.430> for

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
afraid of hitting down the line so for

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.870 
afraid of hitting down the line so for
those<00:03:24.790> two<00:03:24.850> reasons<00:03:25.859> once<00:03:26.859> in<00:03:27.069> awhile<00:03:27.190> to

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
those two reasons once in awhile to

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.970 
those two reasons once in awhile to
counter<00:03:28.450> that<00:03:28.600> that<00:03:29.019> backhand<00:03:29.530> angle<00:03:29.829> from

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
counter that that backhand angle from

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.460 
counter that that backhand angle from
the<00:03:30.069> opponent<00:03:30.579> go<00:03:31.150> ahead<00:03:31.420> and<00:03:31.599> rip<00:03:31.840> a<00:03:31.870> backhand

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
the opponent go ahead and rip a backhand

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.890 
the opponent go ahead and rip a backhand
of<00:03:32.590> your<00:03:32.739> own<00:03:32.889> up<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.940> line<00:03:34.150> okay

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
of your own up the line okay

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.020 
of your own up the line okay
so<00:03:35.440> let's<00:03:35.829> take<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:36.069> look<00:03:36.280> at<00:03:36.430> those<00:03:36.579> couple
