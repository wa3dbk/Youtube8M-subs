to<00:02:27.480> headphones<00:02:27.930> you'll<00:02:28.470> see<00:02:28.650> 3<00:02:28.980> &amp;<00:02:29.100> 4<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.370> less

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
to headphones you'll see 3 &amp; 4 is less

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.930 
to headphones you'll see 3 &amp; 4 is less
as<00:02:29.700> well<00:02:29.940> more<00:02:30.900> on<00:02:31.020> what<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.200> means<00:02:31.590> later

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
as well more on what that means later

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.210 
as well more on what that means later
then<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:32.970> have<00:02:33.270> inputs<00:02:33.690> 1<00:02:33.900> &amp;<00:02:34.050> 2<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.470> inputs<00:02:35.010> 3

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
then you have inputs 1 &amp; 2 and inputs 3

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.470 
then you have inputs 1 &amp; 2 and inputs 3
&amp;<00:02:35.340> 4<00:02:37.370> finally<00:02:38.370> there's<00:02:38.670> an<00:02:38.790> LED<00:02:39.000> for<00:02:39.420> the

we can again control the gain you can

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.130 
we can again control the gain you can
also<00:03:32.430> control<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:33.060> gain<00:03:33.269> for<00:03:33.510> each<00:03:33.660> channel

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
also control the gain for each channel

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.020 
also control the gain for each channel
individually<00:03:34.320> for<00:03:35.220> example<00:03:35.609> if<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:35.760> want<00:03:35.940> to

individually for example if you want to

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.210 
individually for example if you want to
use<00:03:36.239> two<00:03:36.510> microphones<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.709> want<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:38.010> set

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
use two microphones that you want to set
