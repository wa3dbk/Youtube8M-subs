00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.270
 good youtube galley and forum members 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.239
 bush craft brazil has been presenting for 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.400
 you here this trap for fish to 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.520
 we call JequiÃ© 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.860
 it is used by the Indians only 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.170
 she is made in the case as they 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.760
 have fewer resources than we do with a 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:18.570
 product if materials but handcrafted in the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.780
 case and they make totally bamboo and 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.450
 the strings are made with vine or with the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.770
 bark well come here as it was made by 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.720
 local fishermen 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.880
 in some more modern products the day 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.869
 thus, in the case of the entry of the 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.590
 bicycle rim and some moorings were 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.229
 made with wire that the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.990
 procedure is used 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.750
 in rapids where the current 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.610
 really strong but not strong. 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.740
 need to put it all together 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.959
 in the water until he does not die 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.630
 the current does not go away can be 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:57.000
 even by the water half of the entrance 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.899
 and the circumference of the entrance 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.840
 we put rocks in the background so that 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.539
 current does not drag and there what the 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.140
 procedure that should make us 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:13.410
 we made walls on the diagonal of stones 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.450
 tall seats that get off the level 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.569
 above the water level so that the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.030
 fish do not come jump over made 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.500
 one on each side diagonally 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.430
 directing the fish in the rapids to 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.630
 enter here within the jec in case 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.190
 This one is different from the ones 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.170
 People who boot up and reverse 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.940
 Forget it, it's just to keep you stuck in the 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.700
 own force of the current 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.630
 it will come in here and will 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.370
 I tap in the bottom and once I went 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.310
 where it is smaller as I already showed in the 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.090
 beginning of the video there the first scenes of the 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.400
 jec 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.110
 he'll be stuck inside 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.680
 flow of water by the force of 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.910
 and he will not be able to escape. 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.100
 this here in the clear case was 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.770
 made to catch fish 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.260
 you can see even the 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.549
 spacing that exists between the 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.890
 small fish it stands to reason that it will 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.750
 get out another big fish not 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.209
 will achieve also will not leave behind 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.549
 and will not be able to turn inside gives 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.579
 half turn and force out of the stream 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.560
 is holding him trapped in the front and 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.720
 there you can leave the hours there 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.640
 staff leaves places early in the evening 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.560
 and checks at dawn as it happens in 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.840
 two three times at night if you are 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.709
 camping next to where she is 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:32.609
 armed and stay, then it's just this 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.629
 craft trap in another 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.750
 opportunity 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:39.780
 We are going to try and install it. 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.730
 in the river on a rapids for you 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:46.680
 see how the procedure itself is 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:49.889
 we did not have the luck to capture some 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.730
 fish there we are showing 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.299
 you 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:58.079
 so this trick tip is trapped 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:04:00.359
 craftsmanship used for many years by 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:03.180
 Indians there by the fishermen and 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:07.280
 Tapeworms tap this tip for 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.280
 you leave 100% operational
