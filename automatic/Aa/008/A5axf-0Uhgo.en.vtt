00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:04.100
 what we have here is called the mixed number and it's called a mixed number 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.460
 because it has a whole part 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.019
 and then it has a fraction 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.860
 things when we're talking about a number that has a whole part with a 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.909
 fraction 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:16.019
 is called 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:17.550
 mixed number 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.759
 but that can also be written as something called improper fraction 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.109
 we are explaining why it is an improper fraction 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.089
 how do I change this 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.089
 mixed number afr improper action 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.080
 let's take this number 3 according to whole part 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.740
 let's multiply by this number below that is the denominator 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.810
 we have followed indication 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.720
 and then what comes out we add the above that is the numerator 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.720
 now here 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.620
 you have to be this operation first 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.710
 Then 3 times 5 that gives us 15 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.420
 then we add a 2 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.370
 and that gives us a 17 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.540
 good for what it serves that 17 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.540
 it turns out that 17 is the numerator 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.990
 a mediator 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.420
 and the denominator is still psychic that will not change 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.670
 now look carefully 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.060
 that this part of above 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.610
 it's bigger 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.960
 that this part of below 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.820
 when that happens we are talking about a 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.930
 fraction 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.930
 improper 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.620
 That's what it's called 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.620
 that the one above is bigger than the one below 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.600
 we can also write this look well this one 3 whole and two fifths 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.190
 We can not write what we can represent to inform 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.860
 graph 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.440
 today to tomatoes the sun before 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.530
 and is divided into fifths 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.130
 I want to be this is a fifth 2 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.440
 3 4 five fifths 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.640
 five fifths is the whole world 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.630
 I will bring another entity 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.180
 equally or have weights 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.790
 3 integers 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.150
 and then I'm going to bring a fifth 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.680
 notice that this box west rectangle fits perfectly that 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.470
 then this is a fifth 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.879
 and this is another fifth 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.879
 so if the musical numbers that would be 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:14.919
 this would be 2 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.589
 this man 3 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:19.039
 and then you're a fifth 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.909
 and this other fifth 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.059
 then 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.099
 if we count all the fifths we have 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.320
 1 2 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.680
 3 4 5 kilos another five is ten 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.749
 and the other five sub 15 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:33.979
 16 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.479
 17 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:39.599
 Well, that's 17 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.279
 fifth 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:44.279
 and its 17th fifth sun 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:47.929
 3 integers 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:50.799
 three whole parts 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.239
 and two fifths 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.889
 and two fifths 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.570
 So that's the idea of ​​changing numbers 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.259
 my wife improper fractions 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:01.199
 let's do 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:04.199
 one more problem co2 problems 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.429
 here we have 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:09.009
 the next 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:12.189
 we will issue 72 and 4 nov - 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.359
 how are we going to make it good we take the 7 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.619
 we multiply it by 9 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:21.719
 and what comes out if we add a pact 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:22.999
 So we do 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:26.289
 seven times 9 seven times it's not a 63 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:29.279
 we add the 4 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:31.059
 it's up 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:34.709
 12 63 +4 your bumpers on 67 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.940
 that 67 is the new number 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.429
 we put it 67 

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:43.449
 and the denominator is still 9 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.449
 and then and write this mixed number 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.729
 improper fraction 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:52.729
 we have one more problem 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.459
 that we have here we have 4 integers of a set 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.679
 let's take the 4 

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:03.139
 we multiply it by 7 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.989
 and we add the above that is a 1 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.989
 then four times seven this number is a 28 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:11.699
 we add this 1 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:14.729
 the result is 29 this 29 serves 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.209
 to put it as a numerator 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.340
 but the denominated one is still 7 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.669
 and then we change that 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.749
 mixed number ar 

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:28.749
 exact improper fraction 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.309
 if you have doubts 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:33.229
 if they want to delay something else 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.960
 there in the page there we have all the videos sorted in 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.629
 Alphabetical and by themes 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:42.580
 I hope you visit us there is also a space to leave 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.490
 comments and questions 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.720
 some at the next fair serve it well
