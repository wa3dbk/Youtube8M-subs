00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.539 
live events now the reason I like these
so<00:01:36.840> much<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.439> they<00:01:37.590> are<00:01:37.710> quite<00:01:38.040> compact

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
so much is that they are quite compact

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.370 
so much is that they are quite compact
now<00:01:38.970> if<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.119> take<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.299> look<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:39.960> see<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
now if you take a look you can see the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.109 
now if you take a look you can see the
difference<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.040> an<00:01:41.189> older<00:01:41.579> style<00:01:41.850> ear

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
difference this is an older style ear

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.999 
difference this is an older style ear
plug<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.509> I've<00:01:42.600> used<00:01:42.869> before<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.890> know

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
plug that I've used before you know

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.679 
plug that I've used before you know
they've<00:01:44.369> been<00:01:44.520> quite<00:01:44.759> common<00:01:45.119> design<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
they've been quite common design for the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.350 
they've been quite common design for the
past<00:01:45.930> couple<00:01:46.110> years<00:01:46.290> now<00:01:46.950> these<00:01:47.159> earpieces<00:01:47.670> as

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
past couple years now these earpieces as

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.639 
past couple years now these earpieces as
you<00:01:48.509> can<00:01:48.600> see<00:01:48.689> they're<00:01:48.810> noticeably<00:01:49.409> shorter

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
you can see they're noticeably shorter

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.410 
you can see they're noticeably shorter
however<00:01:50.520> another<00:01:50.729> thing<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.060> notice<00:01:51.329> on

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
however another thing you notice on

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.179 
however another thing you notice on
these<00:01:51.570> old<00:01:51.750> ones<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.140> there's<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.649> huge

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
these old ones is that there's this huge

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.639 
these old ones is that there's this huge
plastic<00:01:54.000> piece<00:01:54.240> here<00:01:54.270> now<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.380> the

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
plastic piece here now this is the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.550 
plastic piece here now this is the
filter<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:57.030> built<00:01:57.390> into<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> ear<00:01:58.110> plugs

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
filter and it's built into the ear plugs

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.820 
filter and it's built into the ear plugs
the<00:01:58.920> EPS<00:01:59.250> HDS<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.880> read

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
the EPS HDS have read

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.760 
the EPS HDS have read
usable<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:01.460> removable<00:02:01.970> filters<00:02:02.540> in<00:02:03.080> there

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
usable and removable filters in there

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.410 
usable and removable filters in there
and<00:02:04.190> basically<00:02:04.490> what<00:02:04.700> they<00:02:04.880> do<00:02:04.940> is<00:02:05.360> that

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
and basically what they do is that

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.240 
and basically what they do is that
they'll<00:02:05.900> help<00:02:06.260> filled<00:02:06.500> out<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.770> sound<00:02:07.010> so

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
they'll help filled out the sound so

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.520 
they'll help filled out the sound so
they<00:02:07.370> make<00:02:07.550> it<00:02:07.760> bit<00:02:08.300> quieter<00:02:08.720> they<00:02:09.170> also<00:02:09.350> give

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
they make it bit quieter they also give

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.440 
they make it bit quieter they also give
you<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.649> pack<00:02:09.680> in<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.399> box<00:02:10.640> which<00:02:10.910> are<00:02:11.150> even

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
you a pack in the box which are even

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.450 
you a pack in the box which are even
more<00:02:11.960> stronger<00:02:12.530> filters<00:02:12.980> so<00:02:13.130> if<00:02:13.220> you<00:02:13.310> need

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
more stronger filters so if you need

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.310 
more stronger filters so if you need
even<00:02:13.640> more<00:02:13.820> sound<00:02:14.510> reduction<00:02:14.960> you<00:02:15.050> can<00:02:15.080> use

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
even more sound reduction you can use

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.800 
even more sound reduction you can use
those<00:02:15.500> instead<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:16.220> another<00:02:17.120> another<00:02:17.510> thing

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
those instead and another another thing

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.200 
those instead and another another thing
about<00:02:17.960> it<00:02:18.380> being<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:18.950> long<00:02:19.370> is<00:02:19.610> that<00:02:19.850> if<00:02:20.000> you're

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
about it being so long is that if you're

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.510 
about it being so long is that if you're
a<00:02:20.240> DJ<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:20.990> you're<00:02:21.710> putting<00:02:21.950> these<00:02:22.070> in<00:02:22.370> and
