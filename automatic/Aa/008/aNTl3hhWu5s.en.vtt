00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
you a nice new surface and I just wanted

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.369 
you a nice new surface and I just wanted
to<00:00:47.280> show<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.460> how<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.940> was<00:00:48.090> used<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:48.899> if

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
to show you how it was used so that if

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.959 
to show you how it was used so that if
it's<00:00:49.559> something<00:00:49.920> you're<00:00:50.010> not<00:00:50.219> familiar<00:00:50.489> with

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
it's something you're not familiar with

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.490 
it's something you're not familiar with
it<00:00:51.390> might<00:00:51.780> be<00:00:51.899> something<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.350> would<00:00:52.469> consider

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
it might be something you would consider

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.299 
it might be something you would consider
picking<00:00:53.280> up<00:00:53.840> on<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.379> tool<00:00:55.620> there's<00:00:55.949> actually

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
picking up on the tool there's actually

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.590 
picking up on the tool there's actually
an<00:00:56.370> arrow<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:57.090> will<00:00:57.210> tell<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.480> which

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
an arrow that will tell you which

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.510 
an arrow that will tell you which
direction<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.199> go<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.590> it's<00:00:58.710> just<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.280> easy

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
direction to go and it's just it's easy

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.520 
direction to go and it's just it's easy
to<00:00:59.730> tell<00:00:59.969> because<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.600> orientation<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
to tell because the orientation of the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.529 
to tell because the orientation of the
blade<00:01:01.800> but<00:01:02.460> essentially<00:01:03.030> I'm<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.210> going<00:01:03.480> to

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
blade but essentially I'm just going to

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.960 
blade but essentially I'm just going to
show<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> Teflon<00:01:04.559> card<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.790> can

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
show you with a Teflon card but this can

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.630 
show you with a Teflon card but this can
also<00:01:06.030> be<00:01:06.240> used<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.810> bondo<00:01:07.290> cards<00:01:07.680> 3m<00:01:08.159> Witco

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
also be used with bondo cards 3m Witco

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.700 
also be used with bondo cards 3m Witco
bondo<00:01:09.150> cards<00:01:09.540> as<00:01:09.659> well<00:01:09.869> as<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.350> know<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> lot<00:01:10.530> of

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
bondo cards as well as you know a lot of

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.640 
bondo cards as well as you know a lot of
other<00:01:11.180> shapes<00:01:12.180> like<00:01:12.510> easy<00:01:12.869> reach<00:01:13.290> tools

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
other shapes like easy reach tools

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.679 
other shapes like easy reach tools
things<00:01:14.100> like<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.580> but<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.119> basic<00:01:15.270> concept

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
things like that but the basic concept

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.020 
things like that but the basic concept
remains<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.590> same<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.070> direction<00:01:17.640> goes<00:01:17.790> like

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
remains the same the direction goes like

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.570 
remains the same the direction goes like
this<00:01:18.270> against<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.900> blade<00:01:19.310> you<00:01:20.310> know<00:01:20.369> we're

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
this against the blade you know we're

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.609 
this against the blade you know we're
gonna<00:01:20.670> we're<00:01:21.150> gonna<00:01:21.270> clean<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.750> edge<00:01:21.990> up<00:01:22.320> we

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
gonna we're gonna clean this edge up we

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.070 
gonna we're gonna clean this edge up we
essentially<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.159> hold<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.640> tool<00:01:23.850> down<00:01:24.150> run

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
essentially just hold the tool down run

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.530 
essentially just hold the tool down run
it<00:01:25.200> through<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.759> might<00:01:26.970> be<00:01:27.119> tough<00:01:27.330> for

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
it through and this might be tough for

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.330 
it through and this might be tough for
you<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.689> see<00:01:28.020> but<00:01:28.320> there's<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.590> little<00:01:28.979> sliver

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
you to see but there's a little sliver

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.929 
you to see but there's a little sliver
just<00:01:30.380> very<00:01:31.380> very<00:01:31.710> small<00:01:32.070> probably<00:01:32.670> less<00:01:32.909> than

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
just very very small probably less than

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.300 
just very very small probably less than
maybe<00:01:33.420> about<00:01:33.689> half<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.259> mil<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.890> had<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.100> guess

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
maybe about half a mil if I had to guess

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.460 
maybe about half a mil if I had to guess
but<00:01:35.640> I'm<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:35.909> guessing<00:01:36.180> but<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.079> very<00:01:37.350> small

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
but I'm just guessing but a very small

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.530 
but I'm just guessing but a very small
sliver<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.220> for<00:01:38.490> every<00:01:38.790> time<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.210> run<00:01:39.360> it

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
sliver and for every time you run it

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.590 
sliver and for every time you run it
through<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.740> takes<00:01:41.040> off<00:01:41.280> another<00:01:41.640> sliver<00:01:42.329> so

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
through that couple times this edge is a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.660 
through that couple times this edge is a
lot<00:01:48.720> smoother<00:01:49.320> than<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.590> was<00:01:49.770> even<00:01:50.159> as<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> brand

this tool is the blade
changed<00:02:00.860> right<00:02:01.100> here<00:02:01.460> in<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.670> back<00:02:01.909> and<00:02:02.390> what

changed right here in the back and what

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.890 
changed right here in the back and what
it<00:02:02.750> uses<00:02:03.290> which<00:02:03.530> was<00:02:03.770> actually<00:02:03.950> pretty<00:02:04.340> smart

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900

it uses which was actually pretty smart
as<00:02:05.900> it<00:02:06.110> uses<00:02:06.440> two<00:02:06.740> pieces<00:02:07.280> of<00:02:07.310> an<00:02:07.550> Olfa<00:02:07.880> snap

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
as it uses two pieces of an Olfa snap

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.790 
as it uses two pieces of an Olfa snap
off<00:02:08.450> plate<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:08.990> instead<00:02:09.289> of<00:02:09.350> you<00:02:09.500> having<00:02:09.649> to

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.280 
off plate so instead of you having to
worry<00:02:10.009> about<00:02:10.190> when<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.490> blade<00:02:10.729> gets<00:02:10.970> dull

for this would be the carbon blades that
come<00:02:25.370> in<00:02:25.550> some<00:02:25.760> of<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:25.940> knives<00:02:26.320> that<00:02:27.320> you

come in some of the knives that you

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.990 
come in some of the knives that you
wouldn't<00:02:27.709> want<00:02:27.740> to<00:02:27.890> use<00:02:27.980> on<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.310> glass<00:02:28.610> they'd

wouldn't want to use on the glass they'd

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.730 
wouldn't want to use on the glass they'd
be<00:02:29.150> perfect<00:02:29.360> for<00:02:29.780> using<00:02:30.170> in<00:02:30.320> this<00:02:30.530> because

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
be perfect for using in this because

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.710 
be perfect for using in this because
they<00:02:30.890> would<00:02:31.010> stay<00:02:31.220> sharp<00:02:31.550> for<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.880> long<00:02:32.090> time<00:02:32.390> so

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
they would stay sharp for a long time so

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.260 
they would stay sharp for a long time so
