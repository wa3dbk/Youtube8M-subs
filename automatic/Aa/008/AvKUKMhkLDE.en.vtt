00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.090
 all models dear friends with you i am yuri 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.009
 axenov this day half and overview 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.649
 other media infiniti 2.0 new measures one and a half 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.150
 years ago this game was played on pc and 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.429
 consoles and so much later 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.370
 amount of time the developers decided 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.260
 release it on androyd but as far as 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.179
 this message is rosy we will know at the end of the review 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:21.159
 what is happening here like you already 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:23.079
 probably guessed we will play ourselves 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.300
 in the universe of disna and here we will still 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.809
 be in the box session pear 

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:31.399
 they have here no more than five storylines 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:32.989
 missions are also 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.159
 constructor mode which you can 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:37.589
 create whatever you want yourself 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:39.599
 we can create our race tracks 

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:42.210
 and so on 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.580
 in the basement poppy glasses mobile port on 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.430
 My view of graphs mobile versions 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.460
 stripped down here are missing 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.550
 smoothing yes and textures like this 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.510
 does not look as well in the game at all 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.710
 there are no whatsoever no what 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.090
 regards management 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.140
 men joystick and using 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.010
 second stick that allows you to rotate 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.300
 camera but how is it done in my opinion 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.380
 Krivenko and therefore management will have to 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.320
 attract a little bit because 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.210
 well will not quite obey your 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.710
 fingers in a corner of play hail 100 pages 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.500
 absolutely free do you ask at 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.259
 what is the catch the supply is included in that 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.229
 you will need to buy either 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.460
 figurines from specially to their 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.380
 unlock inside the game either 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.330
 acquire their own gate itself 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.780
 the game but don't be afraid the game can be played not 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.000
 making a penny bank every day will 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.550
 introduce three characters for whom 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.430
 you can play but the problem is 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.970
 that these characters will accordingly 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.130
 change if you want to play for 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.270
 some definite 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.430
 browse tons 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.470
 will come himself to shell out and 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.850
 acquire his mb 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.860
 why comes down mission mission in 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.860
 principle monotonous that is 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.080
 and will beat slaves 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.790
 save someone bring something and 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.750
 so on but if this game is to offer children 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.670
 then I thought not of her basically delighted 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.390
 because 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.010
 everything is here and the hero is both small and 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.960
 local and pixara 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.840
 here even more max and town hall 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.150
 heroes who came out 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.319
 not so long ago that is 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.840
 the project is clear have not yet abandoned constantly 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.810
 adding there 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.630
 new heroes well here if you think fitch 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.569
 This column of Korean families convening steel 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:22.550
 of the board 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.020
 it's atom now, but the game is bad 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.400
 optimized android it 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.690
 the biggest negative of me personally is the game 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.340
 I flew twice and for this I had to 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.500
 pass her opponent how many times because 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.299
 that I didn't even have time 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:36.859
 make the preservation of what 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:37.670
 there will be games 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.670
 was happening right at the moment when I 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.390
 I would end up taking me terribly from the village 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.859
 drove out of yourself and 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.589
 for this reason, probably the game even 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:49.139
 I don't want to go back why games 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.539
 gains that language shook more than two 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:54.089
 gigabytes on your device in order 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:56.339
 to see smear textures permanent 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:59.339
 no departures yet considering msi media 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:01.269
 big enough hope all of them 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.900
 quick fix and surplus all 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.330
 but still miss such a raw product 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.049
 on the market in my opinion 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.680
 it is something below their dignity therefore 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.519
 disks handle but at the moment I 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.790
 mobile port games on android 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.379
 extremely dissatisfied
