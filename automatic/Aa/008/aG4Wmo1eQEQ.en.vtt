do bring down SVS settings and there'll

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.609 
do bring down SVS settings and there'll
be<00:01:11.340> an<00:01:11.490> SSH<00:01:12.119> button<00:01:12.630> if<00:01:13.439> not<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.659> icons

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
be an SSH button if not in the icons

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.010 
be an SSH button if not in the icons
you'll<00:01:17.490> find<00:01:17.850> what<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> single<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.689> says

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
you'll find what a single one that says

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.160 
you'll find what a single one that says
open<00:01:19.229> SSH<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.909> tap<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.330> once<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.930> it'll

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
open SSH you just tap it once and it'll

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.950 
open SSH you just tap it once and it'll
turn<00:01:22.320> on<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.680> won't<00:01:22.860> say<00:01:23.159> anything<00:01:23.630> it'll<00:01:24.630> just

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
turn on it won't say anything it'll just

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.890 
turn on it won't say anything it'll just
bring<00:01:25.170> up<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.439> window<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.009> it'll<00:01:26.250> turn<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.580> on

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
bring up a window and it'll turn it on

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.980 
bring up a window and it'll turn it on
so<00:01:27.900> once<00:01:28.320> SSH<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.369> activated<00:01:30.119> you'll<00:01:30.720> need<00:01:30.869> to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
so once SSH is activated you'll need to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.069 
so once SSH is activated you'll need to
go<00:01:31.110> into<00:01:31.229> settings<00:01:31.850> then<00:01:32.850> Wi-Fi<00:01:33.710> and<00:01:36.079> once

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
go into settings then Wi-Fi and once

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.649 
go into settings then Wi-Fi and once
your<00:01:37.619> Wi-Fi<00:01:38.100> network<00:01:38.159> comes<00:01:38.880> down<00:01:39.119> click<00:01:39.540> on

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
your Wi-Fi network comes down click on

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.969 
your Wi-Fi network comes down click on
the<00:01:39.810> blue<00:01:39.990> arrow<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:41.040> find<00:01:41.280> your<00:01:41.460> IP<00:01:41.610> address

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
the blue arrow and find your IP address

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.920 
the blue arrow and find your IP address
from<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.610> type<00:01:44.850> your<00:01:44.970> IP<00:01:45.270> address<00:01:45.479> into

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
from that you type your IP address into

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.039 
from that you type your IP address into
hostname<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.970> my<00:01:48.270> case<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:51.049> 192.168.1.0

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
hostname so in my case it's 192.168.1.0

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.250

dot your tear your TMP folder or
temporary<00:02:52.220> is<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:53.270> simply<00:02:53.510> drag<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.530> drop

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
temporary is you simply drag and drop

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.270 
temporary is you simply drag and drop
the<00:02:55.310> Debian<00:02:55.820> file<00:02:56.090> in<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:56.750> in<00:02:56.870> this<00:02:57.020> case<00:02:57.290> this

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
the Debian file in so in this case this

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.949 
the Debian file in so in this case this
UK<00:02:58.820> dot<00:02:59.060> DB<00:02:59.360> was<00:03:00.140> Cydia<00:03:00.760> so<00:03:01.760> I<00:03:02.090> simply<00:03:02.300> dragged

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
UK dot DB was Cydia so I simply dragged

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.910 
UK dot DB was Cydia so I simply dragged
it<00:03:03.140> in<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:03.620> dropped<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:04.450> now<00:03:05.450> from<00:03:05.810> that<00:03:06.110> you

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.550 
it in and dropped it now from that you
go<00:03:07.580> up<00:03:07.850> here<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:08.360> you<00:03:08.450> click<00:03:09.140> on<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.410> little

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
square black box and this will bring up

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.020

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
terminal and with the terminal you will

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.280 
terminal and with the terminal you will
install<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.959> file<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:19.900> hopefully<00:03:20.900> your<00:03:21.110> file

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
install the file so hopefully your file

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.229 
install the file so hopefully your file
should<00:03:21.500> have<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.680> short<00:03:22.040> name<00:03:22.250> if<00:03:22.489> it<00:03:22.700> doesn't<00:03:23.090> I

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
should have a short name if it doesn't I

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.910 
should have a short name if it doesn't I
would<00:03:23.390> advise<00:03:23.660> you<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:23.900> shorten<00:03:24.380> it<00:03:24.530> otherwise

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
would advise you to shorten it otherwise

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.949 
would advise you to shorten it otherwise
this<00:03:25.130> will<00:03:25.310> just<00:03:25.670> be<00:03:25.880> a<00:03:25.910> bit<00:03:26.120> annoying<00:03:26.390> but

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
this will just be a bit annoying but

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.530 
this will just be a bit annoying but

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
basically you type into the command box

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:44.170 
basically you type into the command box
