it<00:01:52.300> doesn't<00:01:52.570> need<00:01:52.720> to<00:01:52.870> be<00:01:52.900> and<00:01:53.230> this<00:01:53.470> is

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
it doesn't need to be and this is

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.990 
it doesn't need to be and this is
something<00:01:53.740> you<00:01:53.890> could<00:01:54.010> easily<00:01:54.160> get<00:01:54.520> started

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
something you could easily get started

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.950 
something you could easily get started
on<00:01:55.150> but<00:01:55.540> it<00:01:55.630> still<00:01:55.840> looks<00:01:55.960> amazing

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
on but it still looks amazing

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.029 
on but it still looks amazing
so<00:01:58.960> this<00:01:59.110> is<00:01:59.229> something<00:01:59.409> that<00:01:59.590> you<00:01:59.680> can<00:01:59.829> do<00:01:59.950> at

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
so this is something that you can do at

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.340 
so this is something that you can do at
home<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:00.520> anna-marie<00:02:01.479> is<00:02:01.719> just<00:02:01.960> starting<00:02:02.229> off

it's hot water jam like an apricot jam

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.430 
it's hot water jam like an apricot jam
and<00:02:16.030> you<00:02:16.390> can<00:02:16.599> put<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.810> bit<00:02:16.959> of<00:02:17.050> alcohol<00:02:17.200> in

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
and you can put a bit of alcohol in

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.990 
and you can put a bit of alcohol in
there<00:02:17.739> as<00:02:17.830> well<00:02:18.010> so<00:02:18.040> this<00:02:18.340> one<00:02:18.550> has<00:02:18.760> Grand

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
there as well so this one has Grand

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.220 
there as well so this one has Grand
Marnier<00:02:19.209> in<00:02:19.510> there<00:02:19.690> but<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:19.959> can<00:02:20.080> put

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230

whatever you'd like

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.080 
whatever you'd like
so<00:02:21.099> you're<00:02:21.220> setting<00:02:21.489> up<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.700> cakes<00:02:21.910> with

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
so you're setting up the cakes with

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.759 
so you're setting up the cakes with
ganache<00:02:22.360> which<00:02:22.959> is<00:02:23.140> chocolate<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.560> cream

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
ganache which is chocolate and cream

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.740 
ganache which is chocolate and cream
which<00:02:24.430> has<00:02:24.550> been<00:02:24.730> boiled<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.390> then<00:02:25.450> whipped

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
which has been boiled and then whipped

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.960 
which has been boiled and then whipped
together<00:02:25.959> and<00:02:26.410> one<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.400> biggest<00:02:27.670> problems

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
together and one of the biggest problems

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.300 
together and one of the biggest problems
with<00:02:28.060> ganache<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.660> over<00:02:29.500> mixing<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.040> so

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
with ganache is over mixing it so

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.520 
with ganache is over mixing it so
aerating<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.120> too<00:02:31.330> much<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:31.810> this<00:02:32.110> makes<00:02:32.410> it

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
aerating it too much so this makes it

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.960 
aerating it too much so this makes it
actually<00:02:32.890> has<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.040> timer<00:02:33.400> on<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:33.790> which<00:02:33.940> is

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
actually has a timer on it which is

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.690 
actually has a timer on it which is
perfect<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.690> we<00:02:35.470> layer<00:02:35.709> it<00:02:35.739> quite<00:02:36.370> thickly

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
perfect and we layer it quite thickly

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.490 
perfect and we layer it quite thickly
actually<00:02:37.150> probably<00:02:37.390> just<00:02:37.989> underneath<00:02:38.260> the

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
actually probably just underneath the

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.750 
actually probably just underneath the
centimeter<00:02:38.950> it's<00:02:39.130> just<00:02:39.280> going<00:02:39.430> on<00:02:39.580> like

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
centimeter it's just going on like

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.600 
centimeter it's just going on like
peanut<00:02:40.090> butter<00:02:41.099> probably<00:02:42.099> should<00:02:42.310> take<00:02:42.459> you

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
peanut butter probably should take you

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.309 
peanut butter probably should take you
about<00:02:42.640> 45<00:02:43.150> minutes<00:02:43.599> to<00:02:43.750> set<00:02:43.930> up<00:02:44.019> your<00:02:44.140> cake

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
about 45 minutes to set up your cake

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.850 
about 45 minutes to set up your cake
like<00:02:44.530> this<00:02:44.769> so<00:02:45.250> lastly<00:02:45.910> our<00:02:46.030> art<00:02:46.330> I<00:02:46.599> cut<00:02:47.049> my

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
like this so lastly our art I cut my

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.470 
like this so lastly our art I cut my
cake<00:02:48.099> in<00:02:48.280> half<00:02:50.340> as<00:02:51.340> we<00:02:51.549> can<00:02:51.730> see<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.209> needs<00:02:52.390> a

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
cake in half as we can see it needs a

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.870 
cake in half as we can see it needs a
little<00:02:52.720> bit<00:02:52.870> more<00:02:53.110> length<00:02:53.769> one<00:02:54.549> of<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.700> most

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
little bit more length one of the most

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.000 
little bit more length one of the most
important<00:02:55.299> things<00:02:55.510> is<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.750> always<00:02:56.200> use<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.560> firm

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
important things is to always use a firm

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.009 
important things is to always use a firm
cake<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.400> lot<00:02:57.670> of<00:02:57.760> people<00:02:58.030> ask<00:02:58.239> us<00:02:58.510> can<00:02:58.750> we<00:02:58.840> use<00:02:58.989> a

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
cake a lot of people ask us can we use a

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.620 
cake a lot of people ask us can we use a
sponge<00:02:59.410> cake<00:02:59.739> or<00:03:00.010> a<00:03:00.069> tiramisu<00:03:00.489> it's<00:03:00.940> just<00:03:01.450> not

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
sponge cake or a tiramisu it's just not

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.190 
sponge cake or a tiramisu it's just not
possible

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
possible

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.319 
possible
so<00:03:02.319> this<00:03:02.470> is<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.650> chocolate<00:03:03.069> mud<00:03:03.430> cake<00:03:03.459> but<00:03:04.299> you

something like that but something that's

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.780 
something like that but something that's
got<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.510> firm<00:03:07.810> density<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.530> it<00:03:08.760> it's<00:03:09.760> perfect

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
got a firm density to it it's perfect

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.150 
got a firm density to it it's perfect

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.620 
slices again ganache just like a brick
layer<00:03:31.319> so<00:03:32.319> the<00:03:32.530> little<00:03:32.739> off<00:03:32.859> cuts<00:03:33.190> as<00:03:33.370> well

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
layer so the little off cuts as well

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.199 
layer so the little off cuts as well
it's<00:03:34.630> all<00:03:34.780> going<00:03:34.989> to<00:03:35.049> be<00:03:35.139> utilized<00:03:35.850> so<00:03:36.850> here<00:03:37.060> we

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
it's all going to be utilized so here we

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.220 
it's all going to be utilized so here we
just<00:03:37.239> cut<00:03:37.660> off<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:38.769> peaks<00:03:39.010> of<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.489> cakes<00:03:40.230> more

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
just cut off the peaks of the cakes more

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.500 
just cut off the peaks of the cakes more
ganache<00:03:41.579> so<00:03:42.579> the<00:03:42.700> cake<00:03:42.880> at<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.120> moment<00:03:43.420> is

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
ganache so the cake at the moment is

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.020 
ganache so the cake at the moment is
upside<00:03:43.870> down<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.500> anna-marie<00:03:44.980> is<00:03:45.370> actually

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
upside down and anna-marie is actually

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.690 
upside down and anna-marie is actually
finishing<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.900> bottom<00:03:47.350> mm-hmm<00:03:48.160> before<00:03:48.519> I<00:03:48.549> put

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
finishing the bottom mm-hmm before I put

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.610 
finishing the bottom mm-hmm before I put
the<00:03:48.790> template<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.329> also<00:03:49.540> need<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:49.840> put<00:03:50.079> a<00:03:50.319> tiny

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
the template I also need to put a tiny

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.309 
the template I also need to put a tiny
amount<00:03:50.859> of<00:03:51.010> ganache<00:03:51.720> stick<00:03:52.720> my<00:03:52.870> template

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
amount of ganache stick my template

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.640 
amount of ganache stick my template
making<00:03:53.709> sure<00:03:53.920> that<00:03:54.099> it's<00:03:54.280> actually<00:03:55.030> centered

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
making sure that it's actually centered

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.610 
making sure that it's actually centered
and<00:03:56.650> now<00:03:56.799> I'm<00:03:57.069> going<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.400> taper<00:03:58.230> it's<00:03:59.230> ready<00:03:59.410> to

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
and now I'm going to taper it's ready to

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.520 
and now I'm going to taper it's ready to
become<00:03:59.709> a<00:03:59.859> handbag

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
become a handbag

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.560 
become a handbag
yeah<00:04:01.650> I<00:04:01.710> won't<00:04:01.920> be<00:04:02.040> long<00:04:02.310> so<00:04:03.000> you're<00:04:03.120> using<00:04:03.330> the

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
yeah I won't be long so you're using the

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.210 
yeah I won't be long so you're using the
templates<00:04:04.020> as<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.260> guideline<00:04:04.560> for<00:04:04.800> how<00:04:05.010> much

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
templates as a guideline for how much

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.430 
templates as a guideline for how much
cash<00:04:05.580> you<00:04:05.610> are<00:04:05.760> going<00:04:05.910> to<00:04:06.000> put<00:04:06.150> on<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:07.140> you<00:04:07.260> use

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
cash you are going to put on and you use

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.260 
cash you are going to put on and you use
a<00:04:07.470> hotknife<00:04:07.740> for<00:04:08.190> that<00:04:08.340> yes<00:04:08.760> it<00:04:09.000> will

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
a hotknife for that yes it will

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.150 
a hotknife for that yes it will
and<00:04:09.360> then<00:04:10.020> she'll<00:04:10.260> scrape<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:10.710> round<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:11.040> make

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
and then she'll scrape it round to make

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.790 
and then she'll scrape it round to make
sure<00:04:11.340> it's<00:04:11.490> absolutely<00:04:11.640> smooth<00:04:12.380> so<00:04:13.380> it's<00:04:13.530> good

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
sure it's absolutely smooth so it's good

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.360 
sure it's absolutely smooth so it's good
to<00:04:13.950> work<00:04:14.100> on<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.280> turntable<00:04:14.760> as<00:04:14.970> well<00:04:16.190> okay<00:04:17.190> back

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
to work on a turntable as well okay back

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.789 
to work on a turntable as well okay back
go<00:04:17.489> to<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.700> pitch<00:04:17.880> before<00:04:18.570> I<00:04:18.810> start<00:04:19.200> rolling<00:04:19.440> I

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
go to the pitch before I start rolling I

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.580 
go to the pitch before I start rolling I
have<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.130> brush<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.579> cake<00:04:20.930> because<00:04:21.930> if<00:04:22.320> there

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
have to brush the cake because if there

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.000 
have to brush the cake because if there
is<00:04:22.620> no<00:04:22.710> cereal<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:24.300> Azzam<00:04:24.630> will<00:04:24.780> fall<00:04:24.990> off<00:04:25.200> but

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
is no cereal the Azzam will fall off but

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.590 
is no cereal the Azzam will fall off but
not<00:04:26.250> to<00:04:26.520> wit's<00:04:26.760> because<00:04:27.060> you'll<00:04:27.210> end<00:04:27.330> up<00:04:27.480> with

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
not to wit's because you'll end up with

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.330 
not to wit's because you'll end up with
it's<00:04:27.780> so<00:04:28.020> sticky<00:04:28.380> that<00:04:28.800> it's<00:04:29.160> almost

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
it's so sticky that it's almost

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.120 
it's so sticky that it's almost
impossible<00:04:29.610> to<00:04:30.300> cover<00:04:30.480> properly<00:04:31.020> so<00:04:31.800> this<00:04:31.920> is

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
impossible to cover properly so this is

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.430 
impossible to cover properly so this is
just<00:04:32.280> cornflour<00:04:32.790> we<00:04:33.420> don't<00:04:33.660> use<00:04:33.810> icing<00:04:34.260> sugar

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
just cornflour we don't use icing sugar

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.980 
just cornflour we don't use icing sugar
because<00:04:35.040> icing<00:04:35.580> is<00:04:35.669> actually<00:04:35.970> hydroscopic<00:04:36.450> so

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
because icing is actually hydroscopic so

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.330 
because icing is actually hydroscopic so
what<00:04:37.169> you'll<00:04:37.290> find<00:04:37.500> is<00:04:37.770> that<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:38.160> rolled

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
what you'll find is that the rolled

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.920 
what you'll find is that the rolled
fondant<00:04:38.550> icing<00:04:38.880> will<00:04:39.240> stick<00:04:39.419> to<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.600> icing

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
fondant icing will stick to the icing

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.020 
fondant icing will stick to the icing
sugar<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.530> stick<00:04:40.860> to<00:04:41.040> the<00:04:41.130> bench<00:04:41.310> we<00:04:41.850> like

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
sugar and the stick to the bench we like

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.790 
sugar and the stick to the bench we like
to<00:04:42.180> use<00:04:42.300> quite<00:04:42.540> a<00:04:42.570> big<00:04:42.750> heavy<00:04:42.960> rolling<00:04:43.440> pin<00:04:43.650> but

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
to use quite a big heavy rolling pin but

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.050 
to use quite a big heavy rolling pin but
it<00:04:43.890> doesn't<00:04:44.160> matter<00:04:44.310> which<00:04:44.430> type<00:04:44.640> of<00:04:44.700> rolling

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
it doesn't matter which type of rolling

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.180 
it doesn't matter which type of rolling
pin<00:04:45.210> you<00:04:45.360> use<00:04:45.570> so<00:04:46.440> you<00:04:46.560> only<00:04:46.740> want<00:04:47.010> the

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
pin you use so you only want the

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.100 
pin you use so you only want the
cornflour<00:04:47.790> underneath<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.630> eye<00:04:48.660> see<00:04:48.930> you're

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
cornflour underneath the eye see you're

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.450 
cornflour underneath the eye see you're
not<00:04:49.230> going<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.500> sprinkle<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:49.919> cauliflower<00:04:50.160> on

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
not going to sprinkle the cauliflower on

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.370 
not going to sprinkle the cauliflower on
top<00:04:50.640> of<00:04:50.790> it<00:04:50.910> because<00:04:51.060> obviously<00:04:51.330> this<00:04:51.780> icing

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
top of it because obviously this icing

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.750 
top of it because obviously this icing
part<00:04:52.620> is<00:04:52.800> going<00:04:52.950> to<00:04:53.010> be<00:04:53.100> on<00:04:53.190> top<00:04:53.370> of<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.550> cake

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
part is going to be on top of the cake

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.150 
part is going to be on top of the cake
and<00:04:53.970> you<00:04:54.030> don't<00:04:54.240> want<00:04:54.360> it<00:04:54.450> marked<00:04:54.900> and<00:04:55.200> it's

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
and you don't want it marked and it's

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.830 
and you don't want it marked and it's
not<00:04:56.370> really<00:04:56.730> as<00:04:56.880> unmanageable<00:04:57.510> that's<00:04:57.690> what

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
not really as unmanageable that's what

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.300 
not really as unmanageable that's what
you<00:04:57.930> think<00:04:58.140> it<00:04:58.230> would<00:04:58.380> be<00:04:58.590> Annamarie<00:04:59.190> is

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
you think it would be Annamarie is

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.040 
you think it would be Annamarie is
basically<00:04:59.700> just<00:04:59.820> using<00:05:00.330> an<00:05:00.419> action<00:05:00.690> like<00:05:00.900> you

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
basically just using an action like you

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.470 
basically just using an action like you
would<00:05:01.230> flying<00:05:01.860> pizza<00:05:02.340> dough<00:05:02.520> here<00:05:03.150> comes<00:05:03.360> the

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
would flying pizza dough here comes the

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.630 
would flying pizza dough here comes the
exciting<00:05:03.960> part<00:05:04.200> so<00:05:04.740> this<00:05:04.950> action<00:05:05.280> is<00:05:05.430> really

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
exciting part so this action is really

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.790 
exciting part so this action is really
important<00:05:06.270> it's<00:05:06.660> not<00:05:06.930> as<00:05:07.169> difficult<00:05:07.290> as<00:05:07.590> it

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
important it's not as difficult as it

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.469 
important it's not as difficult as it
looks<00:05:08.010> to<00:05:08.340> roll<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.640> icing<00:05:08.970> onto<00:05:09.180> the<00:05:09.270> rolling

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
looks to roll the icing onto the rolling
