00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.989
 Y 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.210
 hello how about friends in today's video 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.250
 I come to share a little in 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.109
 boxing and revised of this power band that 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.449
 I bought myself a few days ago as 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.190
 we see in what has a very design but 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.750
 very peculiar which simulates what 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.150
 it's a liter of milk but well 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.980
 quickly we spent with him a box in the 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.710
 which is very, very simple since its 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.160
 packed just comes in a box 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.380
 of plastic 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.200
 which if it does not contain here the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.380
 power band let's take it out and also we 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.820
 includes this other box and as we see in 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.620
 The outside part shows us 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.200
 some specifications for example the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.910
 capacity of 2 thousand 600 thousand amperes in 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.920
 the back gives us some 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.110
 indications for the use of said power 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.989
 band but from now on I'm telling you that it's very 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.180
 but very simple the use of said curve 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.180
 and as we see inside the box then only 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.790
 include us is your usb connector to micro 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.949
 usb to charge the power band and load 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.720
 our devices as for the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.970
 specifications in this way not as 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.970
 he had commented to them then his ability is 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.160
 of 2 thousand 600 thousand amps has therefore a 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.250
 microusb input to charge the power 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.750
 band and a USB output at 5 volts per 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.130
 1000 milliamps to charge any 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.720
 Android device ios mp3 / mp4 or other 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.119
 Well device that is compatible 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.860
 by charging usb regarding the 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.960
 design as I had commented them then 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.869
 here we have it simulates what is a 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.119
 liter of milk is how you see here brings us 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.930
 what is a small a small relief 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.060
 where 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.360
 says a liter of milk around here too 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.820
 a small image on the back 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.820
 Well, some engraving 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.470
 of security for example and in the part 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.380
 inferior because it already brings us what are the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.030
 two usb and micro usb connectors and how 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.740
 you observe because you do not possess what is 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.259
 no 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.149
 no physical button since it's the 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.619
 functioning well in this way is 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.869
 super simple we just have to 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.640
 connect it in terms of colors like 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.110
 We are watching, so I bought the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.450
 white unit but it's also 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.390
 available in the colors of pink 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.120
 green blue and white size the forgiveness 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.120
 the material with which it is built 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.980
 said by van it is plastic and so 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.360
 that I quickly show you the 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.880
 working as I tell you very 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.690
 simple we just have to connect 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.060
 our usb cable either the one that gives us 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.030
 or who see the product or who 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.160
 we prepare 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.560
 and we have to connect then 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.150
 the microusb connector to our terminal 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.800
 android in this case and as you see 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.650
 it automatically starts loading 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.870
 our devices at this time 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.970
 Well, I do not know, it's not appreciated very much, but here 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.240
 in the back when we load a 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.090
 terminal a device it shows us 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.819
 what is a 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.610
 a blue led while we are doing the 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.200
 load our terminals so no 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.030
 I had told them the price because it is 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.310
 power pods very, very cheap just 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.920
 It cost me four dollars with shipping 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.840
 international international totally 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.519
 free as always because in the 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.650
 description I will be leaving the link 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.650
 for the page where I bought it for itself 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.530
 they are interested now because I am going 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.360
 to show what is the operation for 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.810
 load it to which it is very, very, very 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.579
 simple here I already have what is a 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.069
 prepared cable we just have to 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.680
 connect it and this time if you 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.170
 appreciates in the back in the part 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.120
 lower when we are loading the 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.760
 power band shows us a red led 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.799
 now as for the ones regarding the 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.260
 charging time either from the power band 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.629
 or to charge your device for 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.790
 this will vary as seen in the 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.230
 unpacked because we do not come what 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.819
 which is a charger but there is no 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.569
 problem at the moment I'm using 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.310
 the minute loader 7 2013 and then the 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.870
 charging times itself from the power band 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.000
 They are going to walk for about two to three 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.710
 hours and as for the load 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.660
 This will depend on our terminals 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.240
 well, from the battery of our 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.700
 devices on if any smartphone 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:11.050
 because the mid-range will be loaded 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.750
 completely 100% time and maybe 25% 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.760
 of more since as we see then the battery 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.829
 It has a capacity of 2 thousand 600 thousand 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.720
 amps so friends hope I have them 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.000
 liked this little one and a boxing 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.710
 reviewed of this power go to gomes know 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.900
 Any doubt any comment is 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.770
 welcome to keep improving you 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.870
 You know, I do all this for 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.310
 bring more content to the channel so 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.690
 I hope you liked friends and we 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.690
 we see until the next
