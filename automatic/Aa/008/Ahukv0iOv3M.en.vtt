some information about it on the back

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.719 
some information about it on the back
tell<00:01:19.380> us<00:01:19.470> about<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.890> texture<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
tell us about the texture and the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.510 
tell us about the texture and the
thickness<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.630> measures<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.259> at<00:01:22.500> point<00:01:23.220> two

thickness it measures in at point two
millimeters<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.390> thickness<00:01:24.979> it's<00:01:25.979> thirty

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
millimeters in thickness it's thirty

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.300 
millimeters in thickness it's thirty
percent<00:01:26.700> harder<00:01:27.270> than<00:01:27.600> st<00:01:28.350> p's<00:01:28.560> existing

percent harder than st p's existing

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.100 
percent harder than st p's existing
products<00:01:29.820> which<00:01:29.939> means<00:01:30.180> it's<00:01:30.659> going<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.930> be

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
products which means it's going to be

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.410 
products which means it's going to be
more<00:01:31.320> scratch<00:01:31.829> resistant<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.610> therefore

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
more scratch resistant and therefore

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.499 
more scratch resistant and therefore
last<00:01:33.689> longer<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.619> allows<00:01:35.189> up<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.460> ninety<00:01:36.000> three

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
last longer it allows up to ninety three

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.870 
last longer it allows up to ninety three
percent<00:01:36.650> light<00:01:37.650> transmission<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.700> should

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
percent light transmission so it should

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.179 
percent light transmission so it should
be<00:01:38.909> pretty<00:01:39.000> clear<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.590> doesn't<00:01:40.920> affect

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
be pretty clear and it doesn't affect

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.399 
be pretty clear and it doesn't affect
the<00:01:41.369> overall<00:01:41.400> touch<00:01:42.210> sensitivity<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.110> the

the overall touch sensitivity of the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.230 
the overall touch sensitivity of the
device<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.430> see<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.640> give<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.000> some

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
it seems to be about like I said two or

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.839 
it seems to be about like I said two or
three<00:02:27.530> times<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:28.220> size<00:02:28.250> of<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.790> standard

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
on top of each other it feels very rigid

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.210 
on top of each other it feels very rigid
almost<00:02:35.270> plasticky<00:02:36.110> which<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.709> think<00:02:36.950> will<00:02:37.069> make

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
almost plasticky which I think will make

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.000

it<00:02:37.370> install<00:02:37.850> on<00:02:38.120> all<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.720> easier<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:39.860> let<00:02:39.980> me

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
it install on all that easier so let me

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.710 
it install on all that easier so let me
just<00:02:40.160> make<00:02:40.340> sure<00:02:40.400> my<00:02:40.730> phone<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:41.120> absolutely

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
I proceed with the installation I will

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.250 
I proceed with the installation I will
try<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.430> do<00:02:46.700> this<00:02:46.880> on<00:02:47.060> camera<00:02:47.450> I'm<00:02:48.050> going<00:02:48.200> to

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260

remove the backing piece first and then

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.130 
remove the backing piece first and then
stick<00:02:52.250> it<00:02:52.280> on<00:02:52.519> so<00:02:53.150> let's<00:02:53.450> see<00:02:53.630> what<00:02:53.750> happens

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
because it's so rigid I'm able to

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.340 
because it's so rigid I'm able to
actually<00:03:01.209> line<00:03:02.209> it<00:03:02.390> up<00:03:02.480> quite<00:03:02.720> easily<00:03:02.780> even

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
actually line it up quite easily even

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.050 
actually line it up quite easily even
though<00:03:03.530> I'm<00:03:03.620> not<00:03:03.769> even<00:03:04.069> looking<00:03:04.250> you<00:03:04.970> know

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
right at it so I'm just going to lay it

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.160 
right at it so I'm just going to lay it
down<00:03:07.010> kind<00:03:07.400> of<00:03:07.459> on<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.700> screen<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.390> then<00:03:08.900> move

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
down kind of on the screen and then move

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.479 
down kind of on the screen and then move
it<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.500> side<00:03:09.650> just<00:03:09.709> to<00:03:09.980> make<00:03:10.190> sure<00:03:10.220> I'm

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489

peel this off and I'll probably have to

developed what I think is a really good
technique<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.329> you<00:03:29.329> know<00:03:29.450> once<00:03:29.660> I<00:03:29.780> get<00:03:29.959> it<00:03:30.049> on

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
technique and you know once I get it on

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.140 
technique and you know once I get it on
perfect<00:03:30.590> it's<00:03:30.680> almost<00:03:31.100> hard<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:31.760> tell<00:03:32.030> it's

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
perfect it's almost hard to tell it's

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.300 
product my only fear about it is it's
probably<00:04:34.139> not<00:04:34.289> going<00:04:34.409> to<00:04:34.469> work<00:04:34.650> with<00:04:34.889> slider

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310

probably not going to work with slider
style<00:04:35.610> cases<00:04:36.090> because<00:04:36.449> it's<00:04:36.840> so<00:04:37.340> thick<00:04:38.340> you

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
style cases because it's so thick you

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.730 
style cases because it's so thick you

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:44.570 
normal screen shows maybe even three so
it's<00:04:43.500> probably<00:04:43.740> going<00:04:43.919> to<00:04:43.979> bubble<00:04:44.189> up<00:04:44.370> with

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:56.899 
good it looks when you're on camera but
I<00:04:55.110> mean<00:04:55.560> it's<00:04:55.949> probably<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:56.699> clearest

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:56.909
