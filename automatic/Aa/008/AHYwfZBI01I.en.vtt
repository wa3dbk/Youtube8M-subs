00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
to actually playing on the server you

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.609 
to actually playing on the server you
know<00:01:06.080> so<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.350> fun<00:01:07.380> I've<00:01:07.979> got<00:01:08.430> two<00:01:08.790> days<00:01:09.090> of

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.600 
know so have fun I've got two days of
work

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
work

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.260 
work
for<00:01:13.610> a<00:01:13.640> number<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:15.950> I<00:01:15.980> think<00:01:16.340> that<00:01:16.820> may

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
for a number and so I think that may

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.260 
for a number and so I think that may
well<00:01:17.510> be<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:17.770> CMD<00:01:18.770> building<00:01:19.310> lap<00:01:19.610> and<00:01:22.060> and<00:01:23.060> if

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
well be the CMD building lap and and if

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.390 
well be the CMD building lap and and if
there's<00:01:23.480> no<00:01:23.570> one<00:01:23.720> else<00:01:23.870> to<00:01:24.050> kill<00:01:24.290> why<00:01:25.100> not

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
there's no one else to kill why not

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.730 
there's no one else to kill why not
brutally<00:01:26.030> murder<00:01:26.240> a<00:01:26.390> bunch<00:01:26.630> of<00:01:26.810> CPS<00:01:27.320> and<00:01:27.590> let
