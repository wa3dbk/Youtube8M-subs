00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
it with the very or not the variable

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.979 
it with the very or not the variable
zoom<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.500> low<00:00:34.950> power<00:00:35.280> scope<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.570> was<00:00:36.719> just

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
zoom the low power scope and it was just

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.590 
zoom the low power scope and it was just
and<00:00:37.290> it's<00:00:38.280> kind<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.760> wobbly<00:00:39.239> with<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> low

and it's kind of wobbly with the low
power<00:00:39.840> scope<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.379> wouldn't<00:00:40.680> recommend<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.160> I

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
power scope so I wouldn't recommend it I

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.819 
power scope so I wouldn't recommend it I
recommend<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.510> no<00:00:42.780> iron<00:00:43.170> sights<00:00:43.559> but

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
recommend it with no iron sights but

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.830 
recommend it with no iron sights but
with<00:00:43.980> side<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.399> hand<00:00:44.640> because<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.360> reloads

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
with side of hand because the reloads

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.930 
with side of hand because the reloads
kind<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.289> slow<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:47.340> gives<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.579> some<00:00:47.760> good

flags<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.799> be<00:03:24.829> easier

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
flags to be easier

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.180 
flags to be easier
it<00:03:25.430> um<00:03:25.670> maintain<00:03:26.540> both<00:03:26.780> of<00:03:26.930> our<00:03:27.049> flags<00:03:27.290> but<00:03:27.950> you

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
it um maintain both of our flags but you

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.470 
it um maintain both of our flags but you
know<00:03:28.310> we<00:03:28.430> might<00:03:28.580> as<00:03:28.700> well<00:03:28.760> as<00:03:28.940> rack<00:03:29.209> up<00:03:29.360> the

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
know we might as well as rack up the

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.979 
know we might as well as rack up the
points<00:03:29.510> we<00:03:30.260> dominate<00:03:30.650> them<00:03:30.860> for<00:03:31.280> a<00:03:31.489> lot<00:03:32.330> a<00:03:32.599> long

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
points we dominate them for a lot a long

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.160 
points we dominate them for a lot a long

only<00:03:48.200> 30<00:03:48.440> ml<00:03:48.829> left<00:03:49.010> so<00:03:49.190> um<00:03:49.519> i<00:03:50.209> think<00:03:50.329> i<00:03:50.659> switched

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
only 30 ml left so um i think i switched

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.680 
only 30 ml left so um i think i switched
the<00:03:51.049> odd<00:03:51.170> a<00:03:51.409> little<00:03:51.590> bit<00:03:51.739> but<00:03:52.400> i<00:03:52.730> recommend

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
the odd a little bit but i recommend

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.080 
the odd a little bit but i recommend
using<00:03:54.290> g11<00:03:54.920> if<00:03:55.099> you<00:03:55.250> guys<00:03:55.430> are<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:55.670> high<00:03:55.940> enough

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
using g11 if you guys are a high enough

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.069 
using g11 if you guys are a high enough
level<00:03:56.209> because<00:03:56.569> you<00:03:56.659> do<00:03:56.750> have<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:56.930> buy<00:03:57.019> the

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
level because you do have to buy the

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.900 
level because you do have to buy the
commando<00:03:57.620> and<00:03:57.859> all<00:03:57.980> the<00:03:58.099> other<00:03:58.190> guns<00:03:58.430> first<00:03:58.640> so

commando and all the other guns first so

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.240 
commando and all the other guns first so
it<00:03:59.359> has<00:03:59.569> a<00:03:59.599> price<00:04:00.109> tag<00:04:00.140> on<00:04:00.590> it<00:04:00.650> pretty<00:04:00.920> much<00:04:01.099> of

um so i want to compare this gun to some

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.740 
um so i want to compare this gun to some
of<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.400> burst<00:04:10.609> guns<00:04:10.849> that<00:04:11.269> we've<00:04:11.450> seen<00:04:11.629> in<00:04:11.659> the

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
of the burst guns that we've seen in the

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.280 
of the burst guns that we've seen in the
past<00:04:12.010> so<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.099> famas<00:04:13.430> amana<00:04:13.819> far<00:04:14.060> too<00:04:14.209> it<00:04:14.930> was

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
past so the famas amana far too it was

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.349 
past so the famas amana far too it was
um<00:04:15.500> considered<00:04:16.190> a<00:04:16.250> pretty<00:04:16.639> cheap<00:04:17.090> gun

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
um considered a pretty cheap gun

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.050 
um considered a pretty cheap gun
sometimes<00:04:18.049> like<00:04:18.350> um<00:04:18.799> I<00:04:18.859> saw<00:04:19.609> a<00:04:19.639> lot<00:04:19.699> of<00:04:19.820> people

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
sometimes like um I saw a lot of people

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.490 
sometimes like um I saw a lot of people
side<00:04:20.209> was<00:04:20.329> pretty<00:04:20.539> cheap<00:04:20.690> because<00:04:20.840> it<00:04:20.989> I<00:04:21.289> think

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
side was pretty cheap because it I think

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.980 
side was pretty cheap because it I think
it<00:04:21.590> I<00:04:21.739> think<00:04:21.769> it<00:04:22.130> fired<00:04:22.370> faster<00:04:22.850> than<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.090> m16

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
it I think it fired faster than the m16

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.270 
it I think it fired faster than the m16
but<00:04:24.139> there's<00:04:24.289> a<00:04:24.320> lot<00:04:24.440> of<00:04:24.470> controversy<00:04:25.070> over

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
but there's a lot of controversy over

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.330 
but there's a lot of controversy over
that<00:04:25.430> um<00:04:25.789> I<00:04:26.740> also<00:04:27.740> want<00:04:27.889> to<00:04:27.949> compare<00:04:28.160> to<00:04:28.280> the

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
that um I also want to compare to the

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.270 
that um I also want to compare to the
m16<00:04:28.820> of<00:04:29.030> mono<00:04:29.180> refer<00:04:29.419> to<00:04:29.599> which<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:31.130> was

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
m16 of mono refer to which it was

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.490 
m16 of mono refer to which it was
powerful<00:04:31.490> if<00:04:32.120> you<00:04:32.630> if<00:04:32.810> you<00:04:32.930> got<00:04:33.200> like<00:04:33.380> it

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
powerful if you if you got like it

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.810 
powerful if you if you got like it
didn't<00:04:33.740> fire<00:04:34.010> as<00:04:34.190> fast<00:04:34.400> i<00:04:34.550> think<00:04:34.729> as<00:04:34.789> a

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
didn't fire as fast i think as a

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.629 
didn't fire as fast i think as a
philosopher<00:04:35.300> was<00:04:35.389> in<00:04:35.479> a<00:04:35.510> span<00:04:35.840> well<00:04:36.110> um<00:04:36.610> so<00:04:37.610> I

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
philosopher was in a span well um so I

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.540 
philosopher was in a span well um so I
think<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:38.030> g11<00:04:38.210> beats<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.169> m16<00:04:39.740> of<00:04:39.979> mono<00:04:40.160> 42

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
think the g11 beats the m16 of mono 42

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.680 
think the g11 beats the m16 of mono 42
and<00:04:40.820> I<00:04:40.910> don't<00:04:41.060> know<00:04:41.120> about<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:41.389> famas

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
and I don't know about the famas

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.050 
and I don't know about the famas
tomorrow<00:04:42.050> for<00:04:42.229> to<00:04:42.380> uh<00:04:42.410> I<00:04:42.950> probably<00:04:43.940> say<00:04:44.030> the

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
tomorrow for to uh I probably say the

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.230 
tomorrow for to uh I probably say the
same<00:04:44.300> if<00:04:44.840> you<00:04:45.620> compare<00:04:46.010> them<00:04:46.070> nice<00:04:47.000> and<00:04:47.030> like

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
same if you compare them nice and like

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.080 
same if you compare them nice and like
to<00:04:47.330> compare<00:04:47.720> the<00:04:47.900> g11<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.500> the<00:04:48.590> m16<00:04:49.250> of<00:04:49.520> this

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
to compare the g11 to the m16 of this

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.520 
to compare the g11 to the m16 of this
game<00:04:50.330> of<00:04:50.599> black<00:04:50.840> ops<00:04:51.020> um<00:04:51.789> easily<00:04:52.789> easily<00:04:53.750> g11

game of black ops um easily easily g11

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.390 
game of black ops um easily easily g11
is<00:04:54.620> a<00:04:54.650> better<00:04:55.039> first<00:04:55.310> gun<00:04:57.010> alright<00:04:58.010> sorry<00:04:58.220> I'm

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
is a better first gun alright sorry I'm

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.600 
is a better first gun alright sorry I'm
the<00:04:58.940> g11<00:04:59.090> is<00:04:59.510> easily<00:05:00.080> much<00:05:00.919> better<00:05:01.190> than<00:05:01.460> the

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
the g11 is easily much better than the

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.939 
the g11 is easily much better than the
m16<00:05:02.030> just<00:05:02.240> because<00:05:02.479> it<00:05:02.599> much<00:05:03.229> more<00:05:03.440> accurate

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
m16 just because it much more accurate

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.129 
m16 just because it much more accurate
fires<00:05:04.220> quicker<00:05:04.880> it<00:05:05.120> does<00:05:05.539> i<00:05:05.720> think<00:05:05.960> more

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
fires quicker it does i think more

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.110
