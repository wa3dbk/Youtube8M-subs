 there is not to get confused about anything and also 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.680

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.210
 there are teenage girls here such 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.070
 get set is the most because 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.350

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.600

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.060
 no one knows how to please 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.740
 like a man and buy here such 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.229
 Here is a set, I think it will remain 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.360
 girl pretty next set this here 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.579
 such a smaller strip 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.700
 massive money and he of course 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.549
 significantly less than this 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.310
 box i'm blush now actually 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.320
 I don't use this color because of it 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.920
 I only use this package 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.380
 highlighter glitter well so far general that 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.869
 all exactly the same in each box there 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.049
 all description is also written as 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.840
 generally use what for what what 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.770
 also on the new year the pit did not say that 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.229
 to me 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.720
 In general from these sets I on me 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.730
 donated more such tools 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.709
 there is this here base under makeup 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.110
 This tool I think is not for every day 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:20.550
 because she she very much scores 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:24.420
 pores therefore I use it not everyone 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.720
 day but the thing is just awesome infusion 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.910
 my two and a half thousand such garbage 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.030
 and also my mother gave me such water 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.280
 something goes for cheeks and for lips i think then 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.430
 already everyone knows how it is impossible to note 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.190
 new story in general my impressions 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.069
 not only very good positive and 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.349
 positive i have a prize and 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.810
 full size version less version and i 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.610
 often now in winter the favor is strong 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.739
 such a light also from the same company 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.739
 I got such an eyeliner 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:59.519
 she is very very persistent and if you 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:02.000
 will cause your eyes to drink 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.959
 how or should it be washed off some new 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.180
 eyeliner from benefit 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:12.930
 and honestly I tried to put it on 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.760
 on hand, I thought that I had never 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.799
 does not wash and since I have now on 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.260
 I generally have a very tame lashes 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.709
 scary uses u bullshit because 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.720
 if now something smear miss u 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.590
 I can't make it I don't know her at all 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.109
 how will I wash off 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.319
 I also bought myself such a tube 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:35.220
 for washing and here are two things about were 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:37.590
 more than 159 rubles, in principle, I am very 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.349
 really like the result is exactly the same 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.680
 like later after using this 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.720
 scrub with apricot pits and 2 all 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.470
 he is remembered me 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:52.139
 wipes and kindness makeup remover 5 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.510
 I still have them 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:57.510
 I used the following I took myself 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.329
 such a powder from bourgeois is generally 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.060
 unique that powder which makes here 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.950
 So that's 360 degrees, that is, you can 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.129
 turn differently 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.830
 where from my face for me so what 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:13.080
 powder you know with a smell who are 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.910
 loves smells like he might be 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.340
 I can not tolerate such 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.169
 smells tolerate so now it's powder 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.340
 I just have lying around I have it is 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:25.710
 idle but give back but this is the most important 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.860
 for me the minus in this powder is I think 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:32.040
 the smell also he wanted to show a little 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.979
 things from faberlic the first is this 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.200
 eyeliner is considered waterproof for 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.660
 me on not waterproof i every 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:43.260
 She uses me, I really like it 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.810

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.139

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.870
 dark pencil so shades of ours i eat 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:54.270
 every day just like eyeliner 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.300
 I really like to turn myself away 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.130
 Choice of lik ordered here such 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.229
 tassels that is this here is a comb for y 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.650
 shadow brush driver 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:07.260
 and here's one i use for lips sometimes 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.750
 for drawing something small there on 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.550
 eyes in general, here are the brush 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.370
 very chastised good quality 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.979
 budget small comfortable them easy 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.860
 Generally take everywhere with you and the last 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.620
 what I ordered myself faberlik this shadow in 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.930
 this palette are so bright right 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.000
 brilliant shades meaning it is either on 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.100
 some way out because every day i 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.380
 such places of course I do not use 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.360
 I just wanted to say just wonderful 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.450
 shadow quality i'm not a fan of 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.450
 actually shadows but in principle according 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:42.090
 quality is generally not inferior to good 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.190

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.830
