Hi! There is only one FINA Championships sport remaining that we’ve not yet told you about. So lets fill this gap today with open water swimming.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:36.320
Open water swimming is one of the newest sports in the sports programme of the championships, giving place to highdiving as the newest chanpionships sport.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:45.320
In 1991, open water swimming was included in the FINA World Championships programme with 25 km event only.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:56.360
and since 2000, stand-alone world open water swimming championships are held in even-numbered years: 5km (since 1998), 10km (since 2000), 25km (since 1991). In 2008 in China, the 10km event was added to the Olympic schedule.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.400
By the way, Larisa Ilchenko from Russia has become the first historic gold winner in this distance.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:28.780
7 medal events will be held at Kazan championships. 7th event is 5 km team race.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:40.580
It has been announced by FINA recently, that the total prize fund of kazan chanpionships is going to set up a new record.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:51.520
In Barcelona it was around 3 mln dollars, but this year it will be around 5.5 mln. 420 000 dollars is the prize fund of open water swimming.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:28.180
First 8 swimmers will get money prizes, in each sport. Every new record will bring its holder additional 30 000 dollars bonus. Lets get back to open water swimming and talk to the DMITRY MIKHAILOV

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:46.720
* All the steel constructions have been finished, so all the big work is done. So when the machinery leaves the place, the venue is ready. All the surrounding water has been cleaned and prepared according to international requirements.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.160
* There are 24 cameras on this venue. The highest points are Riviers hotel and 25 meters platform, Kazan marriage registry office. Special boards have been added into the platforms for camera men

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:01.960
Special High-scaler camera men will be covering the dives from the top of the platform, that’s quite risky.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:15.760
Finally, lets talk about our national team. AnastasiyA Krapivina and Anastasiya Azarova will take part in 5 and 10 km race among females.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.760
Champion of Russia, Olga Kozedub, will be swimming marathon distance.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:29.560
As for male swimmers, Roman Karyakin, Kirill Abrosimov, Daniil Serebrennikov, Sergey Bolshakov and Evgeny Dratsev will represent our country in the competitions.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.100
Evgeniy Dratsev has already won 3 silver and 4 bronze medals at World Championships.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:49.380
Competition will take place at kazanka river, from July 25th till august 1st. 2.5 km distance will stretch from here to Kazan Marriage Registry Palace and back.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:04:04.980
Throughout the history of FINA Championships, Russia has won the biggest number of medals in open water swimming: 12 golden, 9 silver and 8 bronze medals.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:18.920
The next closest team is team Germany. Other countries can hardly compete with us in this sport. However, the golden time of Russian open water swimming took place in early and middle 2000.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:27.640
During the last championships in Barcelona, our swimmers only won 1 bronze medal. That was Evgeniy Dratsev, in 25 km distance.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:42.420
Well, its only god who may know the outcome of these championships for our swimmers, and all we have to do is to support them with all our energy and strength. Make sure you bought your tickets and see you at the championships!
