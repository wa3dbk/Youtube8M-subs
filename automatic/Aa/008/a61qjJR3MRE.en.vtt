builds we're on a map that was created

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.279 
builds we're on a map that was created
by<00:00:17.279> my<00:00:17.520> 9<00:00:17.880> quite<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> bit<00:00:18.420> ago<00:00:18.600> first<00:00:19.170> thing

by my 9 quite a bit ago first thing
we're<00:00:19.410> gonna<00:00:19.500> take<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.800> look<00:00:19.949> at<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.369> our

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
we're gonna take a look at is our

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.509 
we're gonna take a look at is our
Gateway<00:00:21.330> Arch<00:00:22.070> this<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.189> our<00:00:23.310> first

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
Gateway Arch this is our first

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.160 
Gateway Arch this is our first
multiplayer<00:00:24.000> server<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:24.570> ever<00:00:24.720> started

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
multiplayer server that we ever started

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.980 
multiplayer server that we ever started
and<00:00:26.099> one<00:00:26.760> rule<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.090> my<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.570> always

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
and one rule that my is and I always

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.660 
and one rule that my is and I always
kind<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.320> try<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.529> observe<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.279> whenever

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
kind of try and observe is that whenever

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.299 
kind of try and observe is that whenever
we're<00:00:29.970> building<00:00:30.390> we<00:00:31.080> never<00:00:31.320> use<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.949> creative

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
we're building we never use the creative

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.130 
we're building we never use the creative
mode<00:00:32.489> we<00:00:33.149> always<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.570> get<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.780> material

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
mode we always have to get the material

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.000 
mode we always have to get the material
ourself<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:35.420> we<00:00:36.420> always<00:00:36.570> have<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.899> use

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
ourself and we always have to use

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.850 
ourself and we always have to use
scaffolding<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.160> build<00:00:38.340> large<00:00:38.550> items<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.860> this

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
scaffolding to build large items so this

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.010 
scaffolding to build large items so this
is<00:00:41.010> our<00:00:41.129> gateway<00:00:41.460> arch<00:00:44.390> this<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.690> entrance

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
is our gateway arch this is the entrance

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.479 
is our gateway arch this is the entrance
and<00:00:46.110> demises<00:00:46.559> castle<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.960> pretty<00:00:48.960> good<00:00:49.140> build

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
and demises castle a pretty good build

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.000 
and demises castle a pretty good build
not<00:00:50.489> terribly<00:00:51.030> technical<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:52.410> kind<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.770> cool

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
not terribly technical but kind of cool

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.150 
not terribly technical but kind of cool
arch<00:00:54.170> definitely<00:00:55.170> pretty<00:00:55.320> epic<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.710> size<00:00:55.920> took

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
arch definitely pretty epic in size took

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.340 
arch definitely pretty epic in size took
a<00:00:56.250> lot<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.460> material<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.059> lot<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.020> time<00:00:58.170> and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
a lot of material a lot of time and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.800 
a lot of material a lot of time and
effort<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.590> build

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.479 

let<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.410> the<00:01:04.470> world<00:01:04.710> load<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> little<00:01:05.220> bit<00:01:05.309> here

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
let in the world load a little bit here

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.510 
let in the world load a little bit here
now<00:01:06.200> I<00:01:07.200> am<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.590> creative<00:01:07.920> mode<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.250> fly

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
now I am in creative mode so I can fly

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.800 
now I am in creative mode so I can fly

first<00:01:18.600> bass<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.990> ever<00:01:19.140> build<00:01:19.380> built<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.610> should

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
first bass I ever build built I should

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.710 
first bass I ever build built I should
say<00:01:25.490> but<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.640> went<00:01:26.790> through<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.940> period<00:01:27.150> in

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
say but I went through a period in

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.810 
say but I went through a period in
Minecraft<00:01:28.410> about<00:01:28.890> three<00:01:29.340> or<00:01:29.430> four<00:01:29.580> years<00:01:29.760> ago

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
Minecraft about three or four years ago

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.969 
Minecraft about three or four years ago
now<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.330> I<00:01:30.750> think<00:01:30.810> about<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.140> won't<00:01:31.619> time<00:01:31.800> ago

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
now that I think about I won't time ago

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.310 
now that I think about I won't time ago
that<00:01:32.330> I<00:01:33.330> I<00:01:34.320> was<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:34.950> law<00:01:35.100> school<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:37.080> all<00:01:37.290> I

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
that I I was in law school and I all I

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.900 
that I I was in law school and I all I
wanted<00:01:37.649> to<00:01:37.740> do<00:01:37.890> when<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.310> got<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.670> server

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
wanted to do when I got on the server

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.120 
wanted to do when I got on the server
was<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.390> kill<00:01:39.630> blocks<00:01:39.899> kill<00:01:40.680> kill<00:01:40.920> kill

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
was just kill blocks kill kill kill

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.430 
was just kill blocks kill kill kill
blocks<00:01:41.430> like<00:01:41.700> non-stop<00:01:41.940> I<00:01:42.570> didn't<00:01:43.229> want<00:01:43.380> to

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
blocks like non-stop I didn't want to

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.080 
blocks like non-stop I didn't want to
think<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.740> don't<00:01:43.800> have<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.070> be<00:01:44.160> creative<00:01:44.580> so<00:01:44.910> I

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
think I don't have to be creative so I

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.070 
think I don't have to be creative so I
started<00:01:45.810> at<00:01:46.080> bedrock<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:47.430> started

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
started at bedrock and just started

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.050 
started at bedrock and just started
strip<00:01:49.080> mining<00:01:49.440> up<00:01:50.509> up<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.780> up<00:01:52.080> up<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.850> did

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
strip mining up up and up up and I did

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.660 
strip mining up up and up up and I did
this<00:01:54.710> back<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.890> forth<00:01:56.190> for<00:01:56.820> about<00:01:57.259> six<00:01:58.259> months

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
this back and forth for about six months

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.810 
this back and forth for about six months
so<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.880> was<00:02:00.119> an<00:02:00.930> epic<00:02:02.479> dig<00:02:04.130> look<00:02:05.130> at<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.460> size

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
so this was an epic dig look at the size

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.289 
so this was an epic dig look at the size
of<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.180> thing<00:02:06.920> every<00:02:07.920> single<00:02:08.310> block<00:02:08.580> broken

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.299 
of this thing every single block broken

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.509 
of this thing every single block broken
by<00:02:09.450> hand<00:02:09.750> every<00:02:10.140> single<00:02:10.530> torch<00:02:10.979> placed<00:02:11.310> by

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
by hand every single torch placed by

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.039 
by hand every single torch placed by
hand<00:02:11.850> I<00:02:14.090> can't<00:02:15.090> tell<00:02:15.209> you<00:02:15.330> how<00:02:15.420> many<00:02:15.480> pickaxes

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
hand I can't tell you how many pickaxes

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:23.180 
hand I can't tell you how many pickaxes
I<00:02:16.200> went<00:02:16.410> through<00:02:18.290> digging<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.410> thing<00:02:19.470> out<00:02:22.190> so

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
I went through digging this thing out so

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.600 
I went through digging this thing out so
yeah<00:02:24.019> that<00:02:25.019> is<00:02:26.120> what<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.150> call<00:02:27.390> an<00:02:27.510> epic<00:02:27.810> build

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
yeah that is what I call an epic build

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.030 
yeah that is what I call an epic build
yeah<00:02:30.270> probably<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.140> zero<00:02:31.380> on<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.590> creativity

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
yeah probably a zero on the creativity

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.390 
yeah probably a zero on the creativity
end<00:02:32.340> but<00:02:33.270> uh<00:02:33.830> very<00:02:34.830> time-consuming<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.640> was<00:02:35.880> uh

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
end but uh very time-consuming it was uh

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.430 
end but uh very time-consuming it was uh
it<00:02:38.400> was<00:02:38.460> fun<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:39.570> thing<00:02:39.780> here<00:02:39.960> in<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.140> center

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
it was fun this thing here in the center

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.710 
it was fun this thing here in the center
is<00:02:40.530> an<00:02:40.650> elevator<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:41.130> we<00:02:41.340> built<00:02:41.580> built<00:02:42.540> by

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
is an elevator that we built built by

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.540 
is an elevator that we built built by
hand<00:02:43.050> placed<00:02:43.830> every<00:02:44.100> single<00:02:44.340> one<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.460> these

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
hand placed every single one of these

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.310 
hand placed every single one of these
blocks<00:02:45.920> really<00:02:46.920> kind<00:02:47.130> of<00:02:47.190> crazy<00:02:48.110> I'll<00:02:49.110> show

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
blocks really kind of crazy I'll show

00:02:49.320 --> 00:03:09.830 
blocks really kind of crazy I'll show
you<00:02:49.410> how<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:49.650> works<00:02:49.800> your<00:02:50.340> ATAR<00:02:50.580> this

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.580 

yes

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.420 

yeah<00:03:13.390> we<00:03:14.390> have<00:03:14.510> at<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:18.620> was<00:03:18.739> so<00:03:18.920> glitchy<00:03:19.190> when

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
yeah we have at it was so glitchy when

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.740 
yeah we have at it was so glitchy when
we<00:03:19.520> put<00:03:19.670> it<00:03:19.730> together<00:03:19.849> that<00:03:20.060> we<00:03:20.300> had<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.569> have

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
we put it together that we had to have

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.059 
we put it together that we had to have
it<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.260> that<00:03:21.380> when<00:03:21.470> you<00:03:21.530> push<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.800> button<00:03:22.040> it

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
it so that when you push the button it

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.120 
it so that when you push the button it
would<00:03:22.220> send<00:03:22.459> multiple<00:03:23.230> elevator<00:03:24.230> runs<00:03:24.530> up<00:03:24.800> so

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
would send multiple elevator runs up so

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.320 
would send multiple elevator runs up so
if<00:03:25.220> you<00:03:25.280> fell<00:03:25.459> off<00:03:25.610> one<00:03:25.790> it<00:03:25.970> would<00:03:26.060> catch<00:03:26.209> you

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
if you fell off one it would catch you

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.570 
if you fell off one it would catch you
on<00:03:26.420> one<00:03:26.569> below<00:03:27.010> never<00:03:28.010> really<00:03:28.250> worked<00:03:28.430> all

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
on one below never really worked all

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.970 
on one below never really worked all
that<00:03:28.730> well<00:03:28.940> now<00:03:29.120> it<00:03:29.660> was<00:03:30.080> a<00:03:30.110> pretty<00:03:30.440> epic<00:03:30.650> build

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
that well now it was a pretty epic build

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.729 
that well now it was a pretty epic build
and<00:03:31.430> there's<00:03:32.090> so<00:03:32.480> much<00:03:32.810> wiring<00:03:33.290> behind<00:03:33.410> this

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
and there's so much wiring behind this

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.540 
and there's so much wiring behind this
just<00:03:34.480> ridiculous<00:03:35.480> each<00:03:35.690> layer<00:03:36.050> has<00:03:36.380> a<00:03:36.980> number

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
just ridiculous each layer has a number

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.509 
just ridiculous each layer has a number
of<00:03:37.790> relays<00:03:38.569> and<00:03:38.989> pistons<00:03:39.890> redstone<00:03:41.080> and<00:03:42.519> we

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
of relays and pistons redstone and we

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.440 
of relays and pistons redstone and we
just<00:03:43.700> built<00:03:43.940> it<00:03:45.489> layer<00:03:46.489> by<00:03:46.760> layer<00:03:46.790> all<00:03:47.239> the<00:03:47.390> way

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
just built it layer by layer all the way

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.559 
just built it layer by layer all the way
up<00:03:47.630> four<00:03:47.959> by<00:03:48.140> floor<00:03:48.910> so<00:03:49.910> as<00:03:50.239> you<00:03:51.200> can<00:03:51.290> see<00:03:51.530> a<00:03:52.569> lot

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
up four by floor so as you can see a lot

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.660 
up four by floor so as you can see a lot
of<00:03:53.750> time<00:03:53.959> and<00:03:54.140> effort<00:03:54.410> went<00:03:54.739> into<00:03:54.799> this<00:03:55.069> but

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
of time and effort went into this but

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.500 
of time and effort went into this but
