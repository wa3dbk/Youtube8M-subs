00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
because it's hard to be anything because

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.770 
because it's hard to be anything because
you<00:01:04.890> don't<00:01:05.070> plan<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.729> bit<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.270> plan<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.630> get

you don't plan that bit you plan to get
there<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.110> then<00:01:07.229> once<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.590> actually<00:01:07.710> do<00:01:08.039> it

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
there but then once you actually do it

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.480 
there but then once you actually do it
like<00:01:08.460> whoa<00:01:08.640> what<00:01:09.090> do<00:01:09.149> I<00:01:09.210> do<00:01:09.270> now<00:01:09.950> you<00:01:10.950> know<00:01:11.100> if

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
like whoa what do I do now you know if

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.349

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
mean I think there is still room for

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.069 
mean I think there is still room for
improvement<00:01:16.890> i<00:01:17.429> mean<00:01:17.609> the<00:01:17.999> results<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.479> saw<00:01:18.659> on

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
improvement i mean the results we saw on

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.719 
improvement i mean the results we saw on
the<00:01:19.229> back<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.889> know<00:01:20.009> years<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.520> being

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
the back of you know years of being

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.279 
the back of you know years of being
supported<00:01:21.210> by<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.389> lottery<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.869> takes<00:01:22.049> time

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
supported by the lottery it takes time

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:24.800 
supported by the lottery it takes time
to<00:01:22.319> get<00:01:22.770> into<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.069> standard<00:01:23.579> I<00:01:23.759> think<00:01:24.719> I

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
to get into that standard I think I

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.569 
to get into that standard I think I
personally<00:01:25.350> believe<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.829> there<00:01:26.130> are<00:01:26.159> still

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
personally believe that there are still

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.459 
personally believe that there are still
gains<00:01:26.819> to<00:01:26.999> be<00:01:27.030> made<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.600> informative<00:01:28.200> will

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
gains to be made and informative will

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:29.749 
gains to be made and informative will
still<00:01:28.649> be<00:01:28.770> improving<00:01:29.100> over<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.429> next<00:01:29.639> few

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
still be improving over the next few

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.870 
still be improving over the next few
years<00:01:29.819> I<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.450> think<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:31.289> can't<00:01:32.189> imagine<00:01:32.280> in

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
years I I think I can't imagine in

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.309 
years I I think I can't imagine in
tracks<00:01:33.209> like<00:01:33.420> from<00:01:33.569> particular<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.049> can't

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
tracks like from particular I can't

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:35.480 
tracks like from particular I can't
measure<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.590> we'll<00:01:34.679> have<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> margin<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.459> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
measure and we'll have the margin on the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.879 
measure and we'll have the margin on the
rest<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.819> the<00:01:35.909> world<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.149> we<00:01:36.329> had<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.630> time

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:36.889 
rest of the world that we had this time

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:39.230 
rest of the world that we had this time
but<00:01:37.889> I<00:01:37.920> don't<00:01:38.189> think<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:38.490> think<00:01:38.880> we've<00:01:38.999> still

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
but I don't think we think we've still

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.320 
but I don't think we think we've still
got<00:01:39.420> some<00:01:39.689> room<00:01:40.139> for<00:01:40.380> improvements

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
got some room for improvements

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.060 
got some room for improvements
I<00:01:41.390> think<00:01:42.110> we<00:01:42.170> can't<00:01:42.350> foreclose<00:01:42.590> but<00:01:42.920> will

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
I think we can't foreclose but will

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.620 
I think we can't foreclose but will
still<00:01:43.250> be<00:01:43.400> there<00:01:43.640> I<00:01:43.850> hope<00:01:44.120> to<00:01:44.240> still<00:01:44.360> be<00:01:44.510> at<00:01:44.570> the

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
still be there I hope to still be at the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.380 
still be there I hope to still be at the
top<00:01:45.370> you<00:01:46.370> know<00:01:46.490> just<00:01:46.700> spend<00:01:46.790> obviously<00:01:47.210> four

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
top you know just spend obviously four

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.550 
top you know just spend obviously four
years<00:01:47.630> for<00:01:47.780> that<00:01:47.840> one<00:01:48.050> day<00:01:48.200> and<00:01:48.320> then<00:01:48.410> it's

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
years for that one day and then it's

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.010 
years for that one day and then it's
over<00:01:48.680> but<00:01:49.400> I<00:01:49.430> think<00:01:49.520> because<00:01:50.030> 2012<00:01:50.630> is<00:01:50.810> do<00:01:50.960> you

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
over but I think because 2012 is do you

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.690 
over but I think because 2012 is do you
