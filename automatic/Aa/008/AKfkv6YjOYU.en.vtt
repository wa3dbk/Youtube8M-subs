00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.560
 looks like a regular 11 6 inch 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.400
 the laptop is the real transformer 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.590

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.730
 evenly rounded 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.550
 and the lateral faces opposite are made even 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.710
 the cover of the transformer is absolutely flat on 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.980
 the center is located a mirror logo Affairs and 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.200

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.130
 open with both hands as the hinge 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.320
 made pretty tight because 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.840
 needing to keep the back angle in 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.729
 modes of stand and easel matrix 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.500

 screen to make room for 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.230
 truly large touchpad and here 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.670
 keyboard block is the opposite relatively 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.319
 compact developers didn't 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.329
 use the full width of the working panel 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.370
 nevertheless the layout cannot be called 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.989

 dell companies 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.700
 Exactly the same solution we saw year

 lenovo ideapad yoga 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.800
 the hinge of the hero of our review is also exactly 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.780
 allows you to drop the display unit 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.240
 first 180 degrees to touch 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.920
 lid became and then crank it still 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.959
 further down to the unreal for 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.360
 a regular laptop lid touch 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.560
 and the bottom of the laptop, respectively 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.750
 transformers can take shape 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.130
 laptop and tablet as well as go to 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.410
 anti media stand for 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.030
 easel in terms of the hinge two 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.340
 last mode is the same 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.820
 state in which its angle of rotation 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.920
 is in the range between 270 and 360 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.780
 degrees the only difference is what 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.459
 part of the transformer rests on the table 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.040

 tablet both parts of a transformer dell 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.370
 inspirion 11 is fixed by 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.870
 tight hinge and 4 magnets are not worth it 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.340
 worry about what you accidentally type 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.200
 extra text using the keyboard and 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.670

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.670
 like a separate slider on the case

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.010
 block the exhaust of the cooling system but 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.630
 if you move your palms a little lower 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.640
 then you have to grab your hand for 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.290
