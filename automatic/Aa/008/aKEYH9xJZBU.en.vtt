okay<00:00:04.290> good<00:00:04.560> morning<00:00:05.420> after<00:00:06.420> tinkering<00:00:06.870> around

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
okay good morning after tinkering around

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.589 
okay good morning after tinkering around
for<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.410> little<00:00:07.649> while<00:00:07.799> I<00:00:08.510> determined<00:00:09.510> that

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
for a little while I determined that

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.379 
for a little while I determined that
maybe<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.320> best<00:00:10.670> way<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.700> do<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.210> was<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:14.389> do

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
maybe the best way to do this was to do

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.200 
maybe the best way to do this was to do
a<00:00:15.420> point<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.990> view<00:00:16.460> from<00:00:17.460> what<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.090> be

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
a point of view from what it is to be

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.640 
a point of view from what it is to be
the<00:00:18.359> driver

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.230 

I'm<00:00:24.650> just<00:00:24.860> gonna<00:00:24.980> do<00:00:25.250> a<00:00:25.280> test<00:00:25.670> and<00:00:26.060> then<00:00:26.120> a

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
I'm just gonna do a test and then a

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.830 
I'm just gonna do a test and then a
parking<00:00:26.660> lot<00:00:26.690> right<00:00:26.960> now<00:00:27.430> we're<00:00:28.430> to<00:00:28.520> test<00:00:28.840> the

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
parking lot right now we're to test the

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.700

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
make sure that you can see the revs you

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:46.090 
make sure that you can see the revs you
can<00:00:38.210> see<00:00:38.390> the<00:00:38.570> view<00:00:38.840> outside<00:00:44.680> so<00:00:45.680> let's<00:00:45.860> just

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.770

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
well you could really feel that engine

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.499 
well you could really feel that engine
kick<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.659> at<00:01:34.020> 3,500<00:01:35.009> rpm<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.880> when<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.149> let
