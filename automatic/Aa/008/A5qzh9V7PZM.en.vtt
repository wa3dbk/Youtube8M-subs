00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.800 
polyurethane and the two part
polyurethane<00:01:49.709> one<00:01:50.459> parts<00:01:50.909> are<00:01:51.209> easier<00:01:51.630> to

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
polyurethane one parts are easier to

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.219 
polyurethane one parts are easier to
apply<00:01:51.990> they're<00:01:52.709> less<00:01:53.069> money<00:01:53.399> okay<00:01:54.090> two<00:01:54.689> parts

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
apply they're less money okay two parts

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.739 
apply they're less money okay two parts
are<00:01:55.469> more<00:01:56.429> durable<00:01:56.639> they<00:01:57.090> cost<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.479> little<00:01:57.599> bit

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:57.749 
are more durable they cost a little bit

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:59.479 
are more durable they cost a little bit
more<00:01:57.869> but<00:01:58.319> they<00:01:58.469> don't<00:01:58.709> make<00:01:58.889> them<00:01:59.099> where<00:01:59.369> the

00:01:59.479 --> 00:01:59.489 
more but they don't make them where the

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:01.159 
more but they don't make them where the
non-skid<00:01:59.849> is<00:02:00.060> mixed<00:02:00.329> up<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.599> them<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:00.869> we<00:02:01.020> have

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:01.169 
non-skid is mixed up in them so we have

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:03.800 
non-skid is mixed up in them so we have
to<00:02:01.289> do<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.560> ourselves<00:02:01.739> okay<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.849> this<00:02:03.569> is

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
to do that ourselves okay and this is

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.139 
to do that ourselves okay and this is
some<00:02:04.739> non-skid<00:02:05.310> okay

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
some non-skid okay

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.280 
some non-skid okay
this<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> white<00:02:07.229> BD<00:02:08.300> type<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.479> material<00:02:10.170> and

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
this is a white BD type of material and

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.200 
this is a white BD type of material and
this<00:02:10.380> is<00:02:10.440> what<00:02:10.680> gives<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:11.009> attraction<00:02:11.730> okay

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
this is what gives you attraction okay

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.240 
this is what gives you attraction okay
but<00:02:12.510> but<00:02:13.080> why<00:02:13.470> don't<00:02:13.530> we

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
but but why don't we

sand that doesn't cost anything and mix
it<00:02:19.320> into<00:02:19.440> our<00:02:19.650> paint<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.160> we<00:02:20.310> have<00:02:20.490> traction

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
it into our paint and we have traction

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.490 
it into our paint and we have traction
what<00:02:21.240> why<00:02:21.420> do<00:02:21.480> we<00:02:21.690> need<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.990> spend<00:02:22.080> money<00:02:22.380> for

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
what why do we need to spend money for

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.250 
what why do we need to spend money for
