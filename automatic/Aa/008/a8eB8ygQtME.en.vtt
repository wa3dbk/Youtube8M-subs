out<00:03:15.350> towards<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.709> side<00:03:15.920> because<00:03:16.610> it's<00:03:16.880> a

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
out towards the side because it's a

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.400 
out towards the side because it's a
swing-through<00:03:17.480> move<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:17.989> don't<00:03:18.170> want<00:03:18.350> to

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
swing-through move you don't want to

kick out towards the side like that

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.640 
kick out towards the side like that
because<00:03:20.870> then<00:03:21.050> you're<00:03:21.170> just<00:03:21.260> going<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.500> win

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
because then you're just going to win

sideways you want to get your body over
you<00:03:24.200> that<00:03:24.350> way<00:03:24.500> you<00:03:24.530> can<00:03:24.800> swing<00:03:25.100> through<00:03:25.430> and

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
you that way you can swing through and

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.660 
you that way you can swing through and
go<00:03:26.150> straight<00:03:26.510> up<00:03:26.810> or<00:03:27.050> you<00:03:27.380> can<00:03:27.560> pop<00:03:27.770> up<00:03:27.830> and<00:03:28.310> go

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
go straight up or you can pop up and go

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.550 
go straight up or you can pop up and go
straight<00:03:28.910> up<00:03:29.180> rather<00:03:29.750> than<00:03:29.900> just<00:03:30.080> swinging

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
straight up rather than just swinging

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.920 
straight up rather than just swinging
this<00:03:30.770> leg<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.580> side<00:03:31.820> and<00:03:32.150> then<00:03:32.840> you're

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
this leg to the side and then you're

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.150 
this leg to the side and then you're
just<00:03:32.989> going<00:03:33.140> to<00:03:33.200> be<00:03:33.290> kicking<00:03:33.530> out<00:03:33.709> to<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:33.950> side

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
just going to be kicking out to the side

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.500 
just going to be kicking out to the side
and<00:03:34.430> then<00:03:34.550> all<00:03:34.730> your<00:03:34.880> tricks<00:03:35.060> are<00:03:35.180> going<00:03:35.300> to<00:03:35.360> be
