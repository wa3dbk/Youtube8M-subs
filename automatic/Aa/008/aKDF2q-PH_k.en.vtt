whatever the hell company makes this
game<00:02:48.910> nowadays<00:02:49.209> do<00:02:50.020> you<00:02:50.080> think<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.350> they

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
game nowadays do you think that they

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.530 
game nowadays do you think that they
would<00:02:50.530> do<00:02:50.650> anything<00:02:50.830> about<00:02:51.040> it<00:02:51.360> probably<00:02:52.360> not

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
would do anything about it probably not

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.199 
would do anything about it probably not
it<00:02:53.470> might<00:02:53.709> but<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.220> don't<00:02:54.340> think<00:02:54.549> so<00:02:54.640> because<00:02:54.940> if

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
it might but I don't think so because if

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.670 
it might but I don't think so because if
you<00:02:55.930> know<00:02:56.019> they're<00:02:56.170> not<00:02:56.320> going<00:02:56.410> to<00:02:56.470> patch

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
you know they're not going to patch

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.500 
you know they're not going to patch
their<00:02:56.950> game<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.730> prevent<00:02:58.030> stuff<00:02:58.239> like<00:02:58.390> this

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
their game to prevent stuff like this

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.580 
their game to prevent stuff like this
from<00:02:58.690> happening<00:02:58.840> then<00:03:00.420> no<00:03:01.420> does<00:03:02.110> somebody
