00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
exploits we have still work so they're

7 now of course is going to be a bit of
time<00:01:01.710> here<00:01:02.160> probably<00:01:02.730> quite<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> few<00:01:03.390> months

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719

until they actually get you know if this

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.700 
until they actually get you know if this
is<00:01:05.880> even<00:01:06.119> possible<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:07.020> completely<00:01:07.500> up<00:01:07.619> in

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
is even possible it's completely up in

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.980 
is even possible it's completely up in
the<00:01:07.770> air<00:01:07.860> right<00:01:07.979> now<00:01:08.159> it's<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.299> nice<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.570> know

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
the air right now it's just nice to know

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.410 
the air right now it's just nice to know
that<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:11.280> know<00:01:11.310> they're<00:01:11.729> going<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.909> attempt

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
to get this jailbreak out of the way and

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.490 
to get this jailbreak out of the way and
in<00:01:14.790> no<00:01:15.060> way<00:01:15.090> will<00:01:15.450> i<00:01:15.509> ever<00:01:15.750> doubt<00:01:16.110> them<00:01:16.320> but

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
in no way will i ever doubt them but

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.100 
in no way will i ever doubt them but
anyways<00:01:16.939> it's<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.240> nice<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.450> know<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.780> they

anyways it's just nice to know that they

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.440 
anyways it's just nice to know that they
are<00:01:19.320> already<00:01:19.890> looking<00:01:20.520> into<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:21.090> jailbreak

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
are already looking into this jailbreak

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.929 
are already looking into this jailbreak
to<00:01:21.960> see<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.740> exploits<00:01:23.130> they<00:01:23.280> have<00:01:23.460> will

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
to see if the exploits they have will

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.120 
to see if the exploits they have will
work<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:24.900> not<00:01:25.049> I'm<00:01:25.470> sure<00:01:25.590> they'll<00:01:25.950> begin

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
work and if not I'm sure they'll begin

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.700 
work and if not I'm sure they'll begin
to<00:01:26.369> start<00:01:26.610> looking<00:01:26.729> for<00:01:27.060> new<00:01:27.180> ones<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:28.350> for

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
to start looking for new ones but for

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.770 
to start looking for new ones but for
say<00:01:28.950> if<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.610> exploits<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.119> they<00:01:30.329> have<00:01:30.479> from

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
say if the exploits that they have from

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.830 
say if the exploits that they have from
iOS<00:01:31.079> 6<00:01:31.320> will<00:01:32.070> work<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:33.210> should<00:01:33.450> make<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
iOS 6 will work this should make the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.710 
iOS 6 will work this should make the
jailbreak<00:01:34.170> process<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.799> bit<00:01:35.189> quicker<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:36.570> like

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
jailbreak process a bit quicker but like

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.880 
jailbreak process a bit quicker but like
I<00:01:36.810> said<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.170> could<00:01:37.380> take<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.560> couple<00:01:37.650> of

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
I said this could take a couple of

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.490 
I said this could take a couple of
months<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.579> stay<00:01:38.880> patient<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.350> will

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
months so stay patient but this will

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.109 
months so stay patient but this will
just<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.189> quick<00:01:41.460> update<00:01:41.640> video
