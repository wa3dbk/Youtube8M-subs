battling<00:00:40.770> everywhere<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.879> really

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
battling everywhere this is really

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.420 
battling everywhere this is really
really<00:00:42.329> good<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.780> see<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.410> game<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
really good to see for the game it's the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.889 
really good to see for the game it's the
fact<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.000> cars<00:00:45.239> are<00:00:45.450> actually<00:00:45.690> fighting

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
fact that the cars are actually fighting

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.139 
fact that the cars are actually fighting
among<00:00:46.260> themselves<00:00:46.410> just<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.129> AI<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.700> it's

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
among themselves just the AI and it's

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.970 
among themselves just the AI and it's
not<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.989> know<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.440> people<00:00:49.710> playing

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
not that you know the people playing

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.010 
not that you know the people playing
that<00:00:50.280> are<00:00:50.399> causing<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.969> crashes<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.899> know

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
that are causing the crashes you know

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.540 
that are causing the crashes you know
there's<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.410> little<00:00:52.559> bit<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.829> crash<00:00:53.070> there<00:00:53.370> but

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
there's a little bit of crash there but

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.970 
there's a little bit of crash there but
we<00:00:54.090> can<00:00:54.239> see<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.750> AI<00:00:54.930> were<00:00:55.410> actually

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
we can see that the AI were actually

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.470 
we can see that the AI were actually
thinking<00:00:56.160> about<00:00:56.550> whether<00:00:56.699> going<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.329> this

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
thinking about whether going in this

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.450 
thinking about whether going in this
game<00:00:57.690> they<00:00:58.320> weren't<00:00:58.500> just<00:00:58.770> like<00:00:58.920> following<00:00:59.309> a

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
game they weren't just like following a

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.160 
game they weren't just like following a
racing<00:00:59.820> line<00:01:00.000> which<00:01:00.210> they<00:01:00.329> seem<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.840> twenty

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
racing line which they seem to in twenty

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.410 
racing line which they seem to in twenty
ten<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.469> eleven<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.789> see<00:01:02.969> here<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
ten and eleven and you can see here the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.509 
ten and eleven and you can see here the
Mercedes<00:01:03.870> spins<00:01:04.170> off<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.680> I'd<00:01:05.129> say<00:01:05.339> lies<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
Mercedes spins off and I'd say lies a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.700 
Mercedes spins off and I'd say lies a
bit<00:01:05.700> more<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.060> realistic<00:01:06.600> speed<00:01:06.990> than<00:01:07.560> we

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
bit more of a realistic speed than we

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.420 
bit more of a realistic speed than we
saw<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.270> 2011<00:01:09.270> s<00:01:09.689> game<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:10.619> i<00:01:10.860> think<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.280> know

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
saw in 2011 s game but i think you know

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.219 
saw in 2011 s game but i think you know
overall<00:01:11.939> dunno<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.390> can<00:01:12.510> see<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> gravel<00:01:13.020> pick

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
overall dunno we can see the gravel pick

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.590 
overall dunno we can see the gravel pick
up<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.619> tires<00:01:13.860> once<00:01:14.130> again<00:01:14.430> here<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.509> know

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
up the tires once again here is you know

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.539 
up the tires once again here is you know
that<00:01:16.049> gravel<00:01:16.470> staying<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:16.830> there<00:01:16.979> for<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.159> huge

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
that gravel staying on there for a huge

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.070 
that gravel staying on there for a huge
right<00:01:17.700> time<00:01:17.939> which<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.689> bit<00:01:18.840> more<00:01:18.930> realistic

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
right time which is a bit more realistic

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.780 
right time which is a bit more realistic
maybe<00:01:19.619> not<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> huge<00:01:20.100> amount<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.369> time<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.549> we

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
maybe not a huge amount of time that we

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.280 
maybe not a huge amount of time that we
saw<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:20.939> one<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> videos<00:01:21.390> where<00:01:21.780> it

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
saw in one of the videos where it

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.749 
saw in one of the videos where it
literally<00:01:22.619> stayed<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.189> for<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.310> half<00:01:23.580> a

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
literally stayed on it for like half a

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.490 
literally stayed on it for like half a
lap<00:01:23.909> which<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> bit<00:01:24.509> unrealistic<00:01:24.960> well<00:01:25.380> now

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
lap which is a bit unrealistic well now

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.469 
lap which is a bit unrealistic well now

back<00:01:36.000> down<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.450> straight<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.049> they<00:01:37.470> are

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
back down the straight so they are

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.690 
back down the straight so they are
putting<00:01:37.829> up<00:01:37.860> will<00:01:37.979> be<00:01:38.070> able<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.310> fight<00:01:38.520> you

and<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.189> know<00:01:41.220> defend<00:01:41.610> its<00:01:41.729> position<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.450> can

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
and you know defend its position you can

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
a bit of video which is from gameplay

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.220 
a bit of video which is from gameplay
from<00:02:15.430> in<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.030> rain<00:02:16.270> which<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:16.660> exciting<00:02:17.020> to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
from in the rain which is exciting to

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.620 
from in the rain which is exciting to
watch<00:02:17.440> as<00:02:17.710> well<00:02:18.430> now<00:02:18.910> let's<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.210> look<00:02:19.240> at<00:02:19.540> the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
watch as well now let's a look at the

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.360 
watch as well now let's a look at the
bottom<00:02:19.900> screen<00:02:20.110> as<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.410> comes<00:02:20.590> into<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.070> pits

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
bottom screen as it comes into the pits

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.280 
bottom screen as it comes into the pits
now<00:02:21.970> wonder<00:02:22.300> if<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.480> animation<00:02:22.870> is<00:02:22.960> different

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
now wonder if the animation is different

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.770 
now wonder if the animation is different
than<00:02:23.620> in<00:02:23.890> just<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.400> single<00:02:24.580> player<00:02:24.850> yeah<00:02:25.660> it

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
than in just the single player yeah it

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.030 
than in just the single player yeah it
does<00:02:25.990> look<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.290> little<00:02:26.410> bit<00:02:26.620> different<00:02:26.920> you

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
does look a little bit different you

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.340 
does look a little bit different you
were<00:02:27.130> staying<00:02:27.400> in<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.940> in<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.390> car<00:02:28.720> this<00:02:29.290> time

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
were staying in the in the car this time

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.340 
were staying in the in the car this time
in<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:30.100> in<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.760> single<00:02:31.120> player<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.870> actually

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
in the in the single player you actually

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.720 
in the in the single player you actually
just<00:02:32.620> go<00:02:32.860> out<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.100> car<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.310> have<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.580> little

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
just go out the car and have a little

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.810 
just go out the car and have a little
look<00:02:33.880> around<00:02:34.000> I<00:02:34.360> think<00:02:34.570> a<00:02:35.040> gameplay<00:02:36.040> looks<00:02:36.700> a

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
look around I think a gameplay looks a

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.040 
look around I think a gameplay looks a
bit<00:02:36.880> different<00:02:36.940> what's<00:02:37.390> coming<00:02:37.690> in<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.780> pits

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
bit different what's coming in the pits

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.290 
bit different what's coming in the pits
that<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:38.410> can<00:02:38.560> saw<00:02:38.770> safety<00:02:39.250> car<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:39.760> they<00:02:40.180> got

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
that you can saw safety car and they got

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.570 
that you can saw safety car and they got
the<00:02:40.390> top<00:02:40.540> of<00:02:40.630> screen<00:02:40.780> pretty<00:02:41.530> fast<00:02:42.040> in<00:02:42.370> the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
the top of screen pretty fast in the

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.130 
the top of screen pretty fast in the
Lotus<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.030> that's<00:02:43.450> quite<00:02:43.540> realistic<00:02:43.870> because

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
Lotus and that's quite realistic because

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.500 
Lotus and that's quite realistic because
let's<00:02:44.650> think<00:02:44.890> back<00:02:45.040> in<00:02:45.100> Bahrain<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:46.150> Lotus

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
let's think back in Bahrain the Lotus

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.750 
let's think back in Bahrain the Lotus
was<00:02:46.750> fast<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.380> which<00:02:48.040> is<00:02:48.220> always<00:02:48.520> a<00:02:48.610> good

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
was fast and which is always a good

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.760 
was fast and which is always a good
thing<00:02:48.820> but<00:02:49.600> here<00:02:50.050> we<00:02:50.140> go<00:02:50.230> we're<00:02:50.350> going<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.590> move

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
thing but here we go we're going to move

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.270 
thing but here we go we're going to move
on<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.300> rain<00:02:52.870> gameplay<00:02:53.350> in<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.680> second<00:02:54.070> here

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
on to the rain gameplay in a second here

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.550 
on to the rain gameplay in a second here
but<00:02:54.940> no<00:02:55.510> good<00:02:55.750> thoughts<00:02:56.020> about<00:02:56.260> this<00:02:56.380> game

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
but no good thoughts about this game

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.290 
but no good thoughts about this game
player<00:02:56.770> you<00:02:56.860> can<00:02:56.980> see<00:02:57.130> here<00:02:57.340> very<00:02:57.700> very<00:02:57.970> good

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
player you can see here very very good

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.510 
player you can see here very very good
looks<00:02:58.900> more<00:02:59.080> realistic<00:02:59.320> than<00:02:59.560> 2011<00:03:00.190> which<00:03:00.370> is

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
looks more realistic than 2011 which is

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.610 
looks more realistic than 2011 which is
what<00:03:00.760> we<00:03:00.910> all<00:03:01.030> wanted<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.390> see<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:01.900> it's

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
what we all wanted to see and it's

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.620 
what we all wanted to see and it's
definitely<00:03:02.890> good<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.489> see<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:03.970> improvements

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
definitely good to see the improvements

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.460 
definitely good to see the improvements
in<00:03:04.810> split<00:03:05.500> screen<00:03:05.970> so<00:03:06.970> that's<00:03:07.209> here<00:03:07.450> move<00:03:08.110> on

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
in split screen so that's here move on

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.340 
in split screen so that's here move on
to<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.520> rain<00:03:09.700> gameplay<00:03:10.150> it's<00:03:10.480> at<00:03:10.750> the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
to the rain gameplay it's at the

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.140 
to the rain gameplay it's at the
American<00:03:11.980> circuit<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.640> circuit<00:03:12.670> of<00:03:13.090> Americas

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
American circuit the circuit of Americas

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.380 
American circuit the circuit of Americas
and<00:03:14.070> you<00:03:15.070> can<00:03:15.190> see<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.370> starting<00:03:16.000> up<00:03:16.120> ray

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
and you can see the starting up ray

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.140 
and you can see the starting up ray
shots<00:03:16.720> here<00:03:17.140> look<00:03:17.680> a<00:03:17.709> bit<00:03:17.890> nicer<00:03:18.130> than<00:03:18.519> last

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
shots here look a bit nicer than last

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.759 
shots here look a bit nicer than last
year's<00:03:19.450> so<00:03:20.170> it<00:03:20.230> doesn't<00:03:20.440> look<00:03:20.500> like<00:03:20.560> they've

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
year's so it doesn't look like they've

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.380 
year's so it doesn't look like they've
try<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.070> improve<00:03:21.430> some<00:03:21.640> of<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.820> cinematics

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
try to improve some of the cinematics

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.180 
try to improve some of the cinematics
from<00:03:22.720> twenty<00:03:23.080> eleven<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:23.410> twenty<00:03:23.590> twelve<00:03:23.890> and

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
from twenty eleven to twenty twelve and

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.310 
from twenty eleven to twenty twelve and
you<00:03:24.670> can<00:03:24.820> see<00:03:25.060> here<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.450> rain<00:03:25.660> you<00:03:26.200> know

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
you can see here the rain you know

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.170 
you can see here the rain you know
doesn't<00:03:26.620> look<00:03:26.799> really<00:03:27.250> realistic<00:03:27.760> but<00:03:27.910> no<00:03:28.150> I

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
doesn't look really realistic but no I

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.539 
doesn't look really realistic but no I
don't<00:03:28.450> think<00:03:28.510> it's<00:03:28.840> really<00:03:29.170> easy<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.190> make<00:03:30.370> a

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
don't think it's really easy to make a

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.710 
don't think it's really easy to make a
realistic-looking<00:03:31.180> rain<00:03:31.959> in<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:32.350> game<00:03:32.680> but

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
realistic-looking rain in the game but

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.449 
realistic-looking rain in the game but
here<00:03:34.720> we<00:03:34.750> go<00:03:34.900> up<00:03:34.989> to<00:03:35.110> turn<00:03:35.320> one<00:03:35.590> I<00:03:35.620> expect<00:03:36.220> some

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
here we go up to turn one I expect some

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.850 
here we go up to turn one I expect some
more<00:03:36.880> drama<00:03:37.390> here<00:03:37.720> because<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:38.440> cars<00:03:38.709> are

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
more drama here because the cars are

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.289 
more drama here because the cars are
everywhere<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.610> turn<00:03:39.790> when<00:03:40.000> there<00:03:40.120> were<00:03:40.180> like

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
everywhere to turn when there were like

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.630 
everywhere to turn when there were like
five<00:03:40.570> wide<00:03:40.930> huge<00:03:41.590> crash<00:03:41.950> in<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.370> bottom

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
five wide huge crash in the bottom

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.580 
five wide huge crash in the bottom
screen<00:03:42.910> there<00:03:43.180> or<00:03:43.660> huge<00:03:43.900> crash<00:03:44.140> buried<00:03:44.530> a

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
screen there or huge crash buried a

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.800 
screen there or huge crash buried a
side-by-side<00:03:44.799> action<00:03:45.400> which<00:03:45.549> lost<00:03:45.850> Perez's

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
side-by-side action which lost Perez's

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.600 
side-by-side action which lost Perez's
front<00:03:47.049> when<00:03:47.200> I<00:03:47.290> think<00:03:47.470> that<00:03:47.560> was<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:47.950> you<00:03:48.489> can

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
front when I think that was and you can

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.130 
front when I think that was and you can
see<00:03:48.730> their<00:03:48.970> top<00:03:49.239> of<00:03:49.360> the<00:03:49.420> screen<00:03:49.600> a<00:03:49.750> little<00:03:49.900> bit

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
see their top of the screen a little bit

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.930 
see their top of the screen a little bit
of<00:03:50.200> contacting<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.739> rain<00:03:51.040> taking<00:03:51.549> out<00:03:51.640> both

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
of contacting the rain taking out both

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.870 
of contacting the rain taking out both
the<00:03:51.970> lotuses<00:03:52.690> and<00:03:52.860> there<00:03:53.860> is<00:03:54.130> a<00:03:54.160> penalty

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
the lotuses and there is a penalty

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.390 
the lotuses and there is a penalty
penalty<00:03:55.420> x<00:03:55.840> 1<00:03:56.110> can't<00:03:56.440> cause<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:56.950> collision

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
penalty x 1 can't cause the collision

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.009 
penalty x 1 can't cause the collision
than<00:03:58.000> over<00:03:58.150> there<00:03:58.269> anybody<00:03:58.510> asks<00:03:58.780> actually

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
than over there anybody asks actually

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.810 
than over there anybody asks actually
notice<00:03:59.260> that<00:03:59.380> that's<00:03:59.530> 10<00:03:59.829> seconds<00:04:00.310> worth<00:04:00.640> of

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
notice that that's 10 seconds worth of

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.060 
notice that that's 10 seconds worth of
penalties<00:04:01.329> that<00:04:01.510> he<00:04:01.959> got<00:04:02.110> for<00:04:02.470> taking<00:04:02.890> out

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
penalties that he got for taking out

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.270 
penalties that he got for taking out
grows<00:04:03.610> on<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:04.799> that's<00:04:05.799> something<00:04:06.070> a<00:04:06.190> little

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
grows on and that's something a little

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.490 
grows on and that's something a little
bit<00:04:06.430> different<00:04:06.790> I<00:04:06.880> think<00:04:07.000> because<00:04:07.900> it<00:04:08.110> said

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
bit different I think because it said

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.350 
bit different I think because it said
penalty<00:04:08.950> times<00:04:09.190> once<00:04:09.579> it's<00:04:09.820> done<00:04:09.940> at<00:04:10.120> how<00:04:10.209> many

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
penalty times once it's done at how many

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.840 
penalty times once it's done at how many
penrith<00:04:10.660> we<00:04:11.049> get<00:04:11.650> all<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.160> opportunity<00:04:12.670> to

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
penrith we get all the opportunity to

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.090 
penrith we get all the opportunity to
take<00:04:13.239> to<00:04:13.750> be<00:04:13.840> three<00:04:14.170> penalties<00:04:14.620> I<00:04:14.650> think

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
take to be three penalties I think

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.289 
take to be three penalties I think
that's<00:04:15.280> probably<00:04:15.400> what<00:04:15.880> we're<00:04:16.030> going<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.209> see

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
that's probably what we're going to see

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.880 
that's probably what we're going to see
where<00:04:16.450> you<00:04:16.570> look<00:04:16.720> at<00:04:16.810> this<00:04:16.930> I<00:04:17.140> have<00:04:17.650> caused<00:04:17.859> a

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
where you look at this I have caused a

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.830 
where you look at this I have caused a
huge<00:04:18.100> crash<00:04:18.400> Petrov<00:04:18.940> looks<00:04:19.359> like<00:04:19.510> he's<00:04:19.630> gone

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
huge crash Petrov looks like he's gone

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.360 
huge crash Petrov looks like he's gone
off<00:04:19.959> in<00:04:20.079> the<00:04:20.169> rain<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.560> caused<00:04:20.979> a<00:04:21.160> little<00:04:21.250> bit

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
off in the rain and caused a little bit

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.830 
off in the rain and caused a little bit
of<00:04:21.459> a<00:04:21.519> pileup<00:04:21.729> he<00:04:22.000> isn't<00:04:22.150> going<00:04:22.300> to<00:04:22.360> front<00:04:22.599> wing

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
of a pileup he isn't going to front wing

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.020 
of a pileup he isn't going to front wing
and<00:04:23.080> there<00:04:23.560> we<00:04:23.650> go<00:04:23.830> yellow<00:04:24.460> flags<00:04:24.729> no

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
and there we go yellow flags no

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.969 
and there we go yellow flags no
overtaking<00:04:25.479> a<00:04:25.870> little<00:04:26.320> bit<00:04:26.410> of<00:04:26.470> a<00:04:26.530> spin<00:04:26.830> for

yet<00:04:27.690> again<00:04:27.870> but<00:04:28.680> in<00:04:29.250> 2011<00:04:29.940> you<00:04:30.030> could<00:04:30.180> just

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
yet again but in 2011 you could just

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.880 
yet again but in 2011 you could just
overtake<00:04:30.720> under<00:04:30.990> yellows<00:04:31.230> and<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.470> game

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
overtake under yellows and the game

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.100 
overtake under yellows and the game
wouldn't<00:04:32.160> really<00:04:32.310> care<00:04:32.580> so<00:04:33.150> I<00:04:33.180> think<00:04:33.510> in<00:04:33.960> this

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
wouldn't really care so I think in this

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.050 
wouldn't really care so I think in this
game<00:04:34.380> by<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.620> looks<00:04:34.920> of<00:04:35.040> it<00:04:35.160> you<00:04:35.730> can't

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
game by the looks of it you can't

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.460 
game by the looks of it you can't
actually<00:04:36.240> overtake<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:36.960> you<00:04:37.080> probably<00:04:37.290> will

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
actually overtake and you probably will

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.290 
actually overtake and you probably will
get<00:04:37.650> another<00:04:37.800> penalty<00:04:38.130> for<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.580> there's<00:04:39.090> the

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
get another penalty for it there's the

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.100 
get another penalty for it there's the
green<00:04:39.480> flag<00:04:39.540> and<00:04:41.360> overall<00:04:42.360> I<00:04:42.390> think<00:04:42.510> as<00:04:42.960> you

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
green flag and overall I think as you

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.360 
green flag and overall I think as you
can<00:04:43.200> see<00:04:43.350> here<00:04:43.500> in<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.650> breaking<00:04:44.040> of<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.130> top

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
can see here in the breaking of the top

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.370 
can see here in the breaking of the top
of<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.550> screen<00:04:44.640> that<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.210> car<00:04:45.450> is<00:04:45.750> not<00:04:46.170> as

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
of the screen that the car is not as

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.290 
of the screen that the car is not as
easy<00:04:46.500> under<00:04:46.860> braking<00:04:47.070> as<00:04:47.310> you<00:04:47.550> would<00:04:47.670> think<00:04:47.880> in

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
easy under braking as you would think in

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.750 
easy under braking as you would think in
2011<00:04:49.110> and<00:04:49.290> 2011<00:04:49.890> it<00:04:49.950> was<00:04:50.070> just<00:04:50.220> really<00:04:50.370> kind<00:04:50.670> of

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
2011 and 2011 it was just really kind of

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.510 
2011 and 2011 it was just really kind of
easy<00:04:50.940> to<00:04:51.240> break<00:04:51.450> in<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.440> reigning<00:04:52.830> conditions

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
easy to break in the reigning conditions

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.670 
easy to break in the reigning conditions
