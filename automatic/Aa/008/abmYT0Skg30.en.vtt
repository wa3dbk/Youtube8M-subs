about this procedure it is a form of

about this procedure it is a form of
laser<00:00:25.949> resurfacing<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.119> right

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
laser resurfacing is that right

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.689 
laser resurfacing is that right
right<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:27.960> really<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.349> new<00:00:28.710> improved<00:00:29.130> version

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
right it's really a new improved version

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.620 
right it's really a new improved version
of<00:00:29.960> an<00:00:30.960> idea<00:00:31.579> called<00:00:32.579> laser<00:00:32.790> resurfacing<00:00:33.180> and

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
of an idea called laser resurfacing and

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.510 
of an idea called laser resurfacing and
the<00:00:33.690> idea<00:00:33.960> behind<00:00:34.170> laser<00:00:34.530> resurfacing<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.340> to

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
the idea behind laser resurfacing is to

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.840 
the idea behind laser resurfacing is to
try<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.210> create<00:00:36.540> new<00:00:36.989> skin<00:00:37.850> through

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
try to create new skin through

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.700 
try to create new skin through
application<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.690> laser<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.410> had<00:00:40.559> that

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
application of a laser and I had that

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.069 
application of a laser and I had that
standards<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.250> laser<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.610> putting<00:00:42.180> very

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
standards that laser is putting very

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.860 
standards that laser is putting very
zones<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:44.160> controlled<00:00:44.760> laser<00:00:45.000> damage<00:00:45.600> into

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
zones of controlled laser damage into

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.229 
zones of controlled laser damage into
the<00:00:45.989> skin<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:47.010> tricks<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.460> skin<00:00:47.610> or<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the skin and that tricks the skin or the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.260 
the skin and that tricks the skin or the
body<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:49.410> create<00:00:49.680> new<00:00:49.860> skin<00:00:50.219> around<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.120> its

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
body to create new skin around it as its

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.479 
body to create new skin around it as its
repairing<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.050> those<00:00:52.199> zones<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.160> damage

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
repairing that those zones of damage

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.069 
repairing that those zones of damage
that's<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.059> theory<00:00:54.449> behind<00:00:54.570> laser

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
that's the theory behind laser

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.450 
that's the theory behind laser
resurfacing<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.829> doesn't<00:00:56.070> actually<00:00:56.160> create

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
resurfacing it doesn't actually create

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.729 
resurfacing it doesn't actually create
damage<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.719> are<00:00:57.899> controlling<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.410> little<00:00:58.590> tiny

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
damage you are controlling a little tiny

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.709 
damage you are controlling a little tiny
zones<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.219> laser<00:00:59.399> damage<00:00:59.910> right<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
zones of laser damage right and so the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.180 
zones of laser damage right and so the
body<00:01:00.899> repairs<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.590> up<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.920> through<00:01:02.100> this

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
body repairs that up and through this

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.460 
body repairs that up and through this
repair<00:01:02.640> process<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.719> create<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.049> new<00:01:04.170> skin

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
repair process you create a new skin

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.200 
repair process you create a new skin
that's<00:01:04.680> healthier<00:01:05.129> that's<00:01:05.640> less<00:01:05.909> wrink

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
that's healthier that's less wrink

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.850 
that's healthier that's less wrink
that's<00:01:06.450> wrinkle<00:01:06.780> free<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.530> know<00:01:07.650> less

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
that's wrinkle free you know less

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.490 
that's wrinkle free you know less
scarring<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.060> forth<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
scarring and so on and so forth so the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.990 
scarring and so on and so forth so the
traditional<00:01:11.070> idea<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.430> laser<00:01:11.640> resurfacing

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
traditional idea of laser resurfacing

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.090 
traditional idea of laser resurfacing
with<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.450> traditional<00:01:12.900> co2<00:01:13.409> laser<00:01:13.680> which<00:01:13.979> has

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
with the traditional co2 laser which has

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.520 
with the traditional co2 laser which has
been<00:01:14.220> around<00:01:14.430> for<00:01:14.729> 20-25<00:01:15.450> years<00:01:15.509> was<00:01:16.500> that

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
been around for 20-25 years was that

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.289 
been around for 20-25 years was that
let's<00:01:16.890> peel<00:01:17.189> off<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> whole<00:01:17.700> layer<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:17.970> skin

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
let's peel off a whole layer of skin

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.870 
let's peel off a whole layer of skin
altogether<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.100> body<00:01:20.280> creates<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.759> new

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
altogether and so the body creates a new

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.210 
altogether and so the body creates a new
skin<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.170> would<00:01:22.350> involve<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.890> skin

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
skin but that would involve the skin

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.460 
skin but that would involve the skin
being<00:01:23.400> raw<00:01:23.880> for<00:01:24.509> about<00:01:24.689> two<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.049> three<00:01:25.080> weeks

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
being raw for about two to three weeks

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.890 
being raw for about two to three weeks
as<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.799> body<00:01:26.009> creates<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.580> new<00:01:26.790> skin<00:01:27.150> as<00:01:27.360> you

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
as the body creates this new skin as you

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.539 
as the body creates this new skin as you
can<00:01:28.049> imagine<00:01:28.110> if<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:28.770> raw<00:01:29.009> skin<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:29.460> two

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
can imagine if you have raw skin for two

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.740 
can imagine if you have raw skin for two
to<00:01:29.670> three<00:01:29.700> weeks<00:01:29.909> there's<00:01:30.299> risk<00:01:30.509> of

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
to three weeks there's risk of

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.310 
to three weeks there's risk of
potentially<00:01:32.180> in<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.299> bacterial<00:01:33.810> infections

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
potentially in a bacterial infections

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.660 
potentially in a bacterial infections
and<00:01:34.409> as<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.619> result<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> risk<00:01:35.520> of

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
and as a result you can have a risk of

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.910 
and as a result you can have a risk of
scarring<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.479> also<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> healing<00:01:37.530> time<00:01:37.710> would

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
scarring and also the healing time would

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.410 
scarring and also the healing time would
be<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.189> prolonged<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.820> know<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.150> order<00:01:39.240> of

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
be so prolonged you know on the order of

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.539

resurfacing everything at once let us

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.539 
resurfacing everything at once let us
think<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.479> resurfacing<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.560> skin<00:01:52.890> gently<00:01:53.399> and

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
think of resurfacing the skin gently and

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.910 
think of resurfacing the skin gently and
gradually<00:01:53.610> over<00:01:54.240> time<00:01:54.750> by<00:01:55.290> putting<00:01:55.619> tiny

you're<00:02:11.790> just<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.030> little<00:02:12.090> bit<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.360> red<00:02:12.540> and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
you're just a little bit of red and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.960 
you're just a little bit of red and
swollen<00:02:13.050> instead<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.710> being<00:02:13.890> raw<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.580> healing

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.670 
swollen instead of being raw the healing
time<00:02:15.210> is<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.480> fraction<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.320> healing<00:02:16.530> time

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680

order of two or three days of just
redness<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.030> swelling<00:02:21.740> and<00:02:22.740> you<00:02:23.100> get<00:02:23.310> very

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
redness and swelling and you get very

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.100 
redness and swelling and you get very
similar<00:02:24.120> results<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.630> traditionally<00:02:25.050> is

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
similar results that traditionally is

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.890 
similar results that traditionally is

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
resurface so each session lasts how long

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.450 
resurface so each session lasts how long
and<00:02:28.440> how<00:02:28.470> long<00:02:28.740> is<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.950> entire<00:02:29.220> person

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
basically the patient comes in we

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.660 
basically the patient comes in we
usually<00:02:31.320> apply<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.650> numbing<00:02:31.980> cream<00:02:32.400> for<00:02:32.610> about

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
usually apply a numbing cream for about

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.760 
usually apply a numbing cream for about
an<00:02:32.820> hour<00:02:33.000> or<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.170> treatment<00:02:34.590> type

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
an hour or so and the treatment type

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.950 
an hour or so and the treatment type
time<00:02:35.130> takes<00:02:35.370> about<00:02:35.490> 15<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.090> 20<00:02:36.420> minutes<00:02:36.750> after

time takes about 15 to 20 minutes after

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.870 
time takes about 15 to 20 minutes after
which<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.950> look<00:02:38.130> like<00:02:38.310> you've<00:02:38.490> had<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.670> little

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
which you look like you've had a little

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.670 
which you look like you've had a little
sunburn<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.810> know<00:02:40.020> your<00:02:40.170> red<00:02:40.380> looking<00:02:40.650> a

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
sunburn you know your red looking a

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.990 
sunburn you know your red looking a
little<00:02:40.800> sunburn<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.310> can<00:02:41.430> resume<00:02:41.790> really

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
little sunburn and you can resume really

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.970 
little sunburn and you can resume really
your<00:02:42.270> normal<00:02:42.840> activities<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.440> could<00:02:43.650> make<00:02:43.830> up

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
your normal activities you could make up

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.840 
your normal activities you could make up
on<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.340> can<00:02:44.490> wash<00:02:44.730> your<00:02:44.940> face<00:02:45.320> normally

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.070 

it<00:02:50.850> feels<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:51.090> little<00:02:51.330> hot<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.720> know<00:02:51.810> for<00:02:51.960> like

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
it feels a little hot you know for like

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.540 
it feels a little hot you know for like
maybe<00:02:52.260> an<00:02:52.380> hour<00:02:52.560> afterwards<00:02:53.040> but<00:02:53.310> really

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
maybe an hour afterwards but really

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.360 
maybe an hour afterwards but really
nothing<00:02:53.730> else<00:02:54.060> afterwards<00:02:54.890> and<00:02:55.890> so<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.130> know

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
nothing else afterwards and so you know

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.340 
nothing else afterwards and so you know
it's<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.730> very<00:02:56.970> easy<00:02:57.210> kind<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.630> procedure<00:02:57.960> it

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
it's a very easy kind of procedure it

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.020 
it's a very easy kind of procedure it
needs<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.800> be<00:02:58.920> done<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.160> few<00:02:59.490> sessions<00:02:59.730> and

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
needs to be done a few sessions and

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.760 
needs to be done a few sessions and
generally<00:03:00.420> we<00:03:00.540> talk<00:03:00.780> about<00:03:00.960> time<00:03:01.230> in<00:03:01.440> between

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
generally we talk about time in between

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.400 
generally we talk about time in between
the<00:03:01.890> sessions<00:03:02.630> anywhere<00:03:03.630> from<00:03:03.750> 2<00:03:03.990> to<00:03:04.020> 4<00:03:04.380> weeks

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
the sessions anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.230 
the sessions anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks
depending<00:03:04.770> on<00:03:05.070> what<00:03:05.250> treating<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.820> depending

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
depending on what treating and depending

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.290 
depending on what treating and depending
on<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.420> condition<00:03:07.020> that<00:03:07.140> we're<00:03:07.290> treating

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
on the condition that we're treating

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.030 
on the condition that we're treating
patients<00:03:09.300> may<00:03:09.420> require<00:03:09.810> anywhere<00:03:10.260> from<00:03:10.470> 2<00:03:11.010> to

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
patients may require anywhere from 2 to

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.960 
patients may require anywhere from 2 to
5<00:03:11.310> sessions<00:03:11.640> let's<00:03:12.120> say<00:03:13.250> total<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.610> so<00:03:14.910> you

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
5 sessions let's say total and so you

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.520 
5 sessions let's say total and so you
know<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.180> conditions<00:03:15.630> that<00:03:15.690> we<00:03:15.900> can<00:03:16.080> think<00:03:16.290> of

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
know the conditions that we can think of

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.100 
know the conditions that we can think of
of<00:03:16.739> using<00:03:17.280> lasers<00:03:17.910> for<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.300> resurface<00:03:18.660> is

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
of using lasers for to resurface is

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.960 
of using lasers for to resurface is
anything<00:03:19.860> that<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.070> can<00:03:20.280> think<00:03:20.520> of<00:03:20.730> that

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
anything that you can think of that

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.449 
anything that you can think of that
requires<00:03:21.390> new<00:03:21.600> skin<00:03:21.840> formation<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:22.590> wrinkles

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
requires new skin formation so wrinkles

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.040 
requires new skin formation so wrinkles
for<00:03:23.640> example<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:24.150> can<00:03:24.300> tighten<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.690> skin<00:03:24.900> up

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
for example you can tighten the skin up

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.990 
for example you can tighten the skin up
and<00:03:25.170> get<00:03:25.650> rid<00:03:25.770> of<00:03:25.860> wrinkles<00:03:26.100> if<00:03:26.520> you<00:03:26.850> have

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
and get rid of wrinkles if you have

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.780 
and get rid of wrinkles if you have
scars<00:03:27.480> whether<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:28.080> be<00:03:28.230> scars<00:03:28.860> from<00:03:29.100> acne<00:03:29.580> or

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
scars whether it be scars from acne or

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.670 
scars whether it be scars from acne or
whether<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.330> be<00:03:30.420> surgical<00:03:30.989> scars<00:03:31.350> from<00:03:31.560> a

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
whether it be surgical scars from a

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.390 
whether it be surgical scars from a
procedure<00:03:32.160> or<00:03:32.520> from<00:03:32.790> from<00:03:33.239> an<00:03:33.420> accident

whether it be melasma or mask of

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.870 
whether it be melasma or mask of
pregnancy<00:03:37.500> which<00:03:38.040> is<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.310> know<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.550> lot<00:03:38.850> of

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
pregnancy which is you know a lot of

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.699 
pregnancy which is you know a lot of
women<00:03:39.120> develop<00:03:39.660> that<00:03:39.810> after<00:03:40.110> pregnancy<00:03:40.320> or

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
women develop that after pregnancy or

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:41.840 
women develop that after pregnancy or
when<00:03:40.830> they're<00:03:40.950> on<00:03:41.040> birth<00:03:41.190> control<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.700> that's

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
when they're on birth control and that's

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.510 
when they're on birth control and that's
pigmentation<00:03:42.600> or<00:03:43.080> even<00:03:43.440> things<00:03:43.800> like<00:03:44.010> stretch

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
pigmentation or even things like stretch

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.630 
pigmentation or even things like stretch
marks<00:03:45.030> on<00:03:45.270> you<00:03:46.020> know<00:03:46.170> off<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.709> face<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.459> can

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
marks on you know off the face you can

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.610 
marks on you know off the face you can
actually<00:03:47.790> resurface<00:03:48.630> with<00:03:48.870> this<00:03:48.989> laser<00:03:49.230> all

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
actually resurface with this laser all

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.320 
actually resurface with this laser all
over<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.950> body<00:03:50.100> you<00:03:50.370> can<00:03:50.400> use<00:03:50.640> it<00:03:50.760> all<00:03:51.090> over

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
over the body you can use it all over

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.000 
over the body you can use it all over
the<00:03:51.420> body<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.690> that's<00:03:51.930> another<00:03:52.410> advantage<00:03:52.860> to

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
the body and that's another advantage to

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.130 
the body and that's another advantage to
this<00:03:53.280> idea<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:53.730> fractional<00:03:54.540> resurfacing<00:03:55.050> with

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
this idea of fractional resurfacing with

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.360 
this idea of fractional resurfacing with
the<00:03:55.200> Fraxel<00:03:55.530> laser<00:03:55.590> because<00:03:55.950> with<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.160> old

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
the Fraxel laser because with the old

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.090 
the Fraxel laser because with the old
lasers<00:03:57.000> we<00:03:57.690> were<00:03:57.810> not<00:03:57.989> able<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.320> resurface<00:03:58.770> off

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
lasers we were not able to resurface off

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.530 
lasers we were not able to resurface off
the<00:03:59.280> face<00:03:59.430> we're<00:03:59.640> only<00:03:59.910> restricted<00:04:00.330> to<00:04:00.450> the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
the face we're only restricted to the

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.210 
the face we're only restricted to the
face<00:04:00.780> because<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.350> face<00:04:01.380> has<00:04:01.920> a<00:04:01.950> better

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
face because the face has a better

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.940 
face because the face has a better
healing<00:04:02.550> capacity<00:04:02.670> with<00:04:03.630> this<00:04:03.959> we<00:04:04.560> can<00:04:04.709> treat

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
healing capacity with this we can treat

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.070 
healing capacity with this we can treat
any<00:04:05.220> body<00:04:05.519> surface<00:04:06.000> area<00:04:06.150> whether<00:04:06.420> its<00:04:06.630> arms

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
any body surface area whether its arms

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.710 
any body surface area whether its arms
hands<00:04:07.700> whether<00:04:08.700> it's<00:04:08.940> stretch<00:04:09.180> marks<00:04:09.510> on<00:04:09.630> the

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
hands whether it's stretch marks on the

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.900 
hands whether it's stretch marks on the
abdomen<00:04:10.110> and<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:11.070> know<00:04:11.190> another<00:04:11.640> nice

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
abdomen and you know another nice

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.870 
abdomen and you know another nice
application<00:04:12.150> for<00:04:12.810> this<00:04:12.930> is<00:04:13.200> for<00:04:13.739> a<00:04:14.340> lot<00:04:14.820> of

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
application for this is for a lot of

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.030 
application for this is for a lot of
women<00:04:15.360> as<00:04:15.510> they

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
the hands age as well their skin becomes

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.410 
the hands age as well their skin becomes
thin<00:04:18.170> and<00:04:18.440> kind<00:04:18.920> of<00:04:19.040> veiny<00:04:19.340> with<00:04:20.060> like<00:04:20.300> you

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
know brown spots and you know hands is a

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.090 
know brown spots and you know hands is a
nice<00:04:22.670> area<00:04:22.940> for<00:04:23.780> elbows<00:04:24.680> because<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:25.040> know

that you want to improve this skin you

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.630 
that you want to improve this skin you
want<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:33.740> create<00:04:33.920> in<00:04:34.040> your<00:04:34.070> skin<00:04:34.370> you<00:04:34.460> can<00:04:34.490> use

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
want to create in your skin you can use

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.060 
want to create in your skin you can use
this<00:04:34.880> laser<00:04:35.120> safely<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:35.930> how<00:04:36.080> long<00:04:36.440> did<00:04:36.950> the

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
this laser safely and how long did the

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.010 
this laser safely and how long did the
results<00:04:37.220> last<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:38.330> results<00:04:38.660> that's<00:04:38.810> for<00:04:38.960> a

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
results last the results that's for a

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.540 
results last the results that's for a
few<00:04:39.170> years<00:04:39.320> because<00:04:39.530> it's<00:04:39.890> your<00:04:40.070> own<00:04:40.190> skin

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
few years because it's your own skin

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.250 
few years because it's your own skin
that's<00:04:40.730> been<00:04:40.910> created<00:04:41.090> your<00:04:41.480> new<00:04:41.630> skin<00:04:42.080> that's

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
that's been created your new skin that's

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.620 
that's been created your new skin that's
been<00:04:42.440> created<00:04:42.560> so<00:04:42.950> last<00:04:43.430> for<00:04:43.670> a<00:04:43.700> few<00:04:43.850> years<00:04:44.030> one

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
been created so last for a few years one

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.390 
been created so last for a few years one
last<00:04:44.870> thing<00:04:45.020> that<00:04:45.080> I<00:04:45.200> should<00:04:45.290> mention<00:04:45.740> is<00:04:46.190> that

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
last thing that I should mention is that

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.570 
last thing that I should mention is that
for<00:04:47.090> people<00:04:47.330> with<00:04:47.450> skin<00:04:47.690> of<00:04:47.810> color

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
for people with skin of color

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.800 
for people with skin of color
traditionally<00:04:49.580> you<00:04:50.000> know<00:04:50.030> patients<00:04:50.720> were

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
traditionally you know patients were

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.390 
traditionally you know patients were
darker<00:04:51.200> skin<00:04:51.440> with<00:04:51.560> their<00:04:51.650> you<00:04:51.770> know<00:04:51.830> darker

aware<00:04:57.770> of<00:04:57.830> using<00:04:58.220> lasers<00:04:58.760> on<00:04:59.000> them<00:04:59.360> because

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
aware of using lasers on them because

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.630 
aware of using lasers on them because
they<00:05:00.080> can<00:05:00.200> run<00:05:00.320> to<00:05:00.470> pigment<00:05:00.860> Airy<00:05:01.070> problems

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
they can run to pigment Airy problems

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.340 
they can run to pigment Airy problems
however<00:05:02.210> because<00:05:02.720> of<00:05:02.840> the<00:05:02.930> idea<00:05:03.260> of

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
however because of the idea of

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.350 
however because of the idea of
fractional<00:05:03.770> servicing<00:05:04.370> this<00:05:04.910> patient

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
fractional servicing this patient

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.030

population<00:05:05.510> can<00:05:06.080> also<00:05:06.200> be<00:05:06.410> safely<00:05:06.740> treated

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
population can also be safely treated

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.040 
population can also be safely treated
with<00:05:07.160> this<00:05:07.340> laser<00:05:07.640> without<00:05:08.300> any<00:05:08.510> problems

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
with this laser without any problems

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.730 
with this laser without any problems
correct

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
correct

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.100 
correct
now<00:05:09.950> how<00:05:10.430> expensive<00:05:10.970> is<00:05:11.330> it<00:05:11.480> how<00:05:11.600> much<00:05:11.750> would

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
now how expensive is it how much would

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.110 
now how expensive is it how much would
the<00:05:12.230> typical<00:05:12.590> session<00:05:12.920> be<00:05:13.100> a<00:05:13.280> typical<00:05:13.610> session

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
the typical session be a typical session

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.700 
the typical session be a typical session
you<00:05:14.210> know<00:05:14.300> it<00:05:14.420> depends<00:05:14.780> on<00:05:14.840> this<00:05:14.960> the<00:05:15.470> surface

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
you know it depends on this the surface

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.040 
you know it depends on this the surface
area<00:05:16.190> that<00:05:16.220> you're<00:05:16.460> treating<00:05:16.820> if<00:05:17.030> you<00:05:17.810> know<00:05:17.930> if

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
area that you're treating if you know if

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.230 
area that you're treating if you know if
for<00:05:18.260> full-face<00:05:18.770> it<00:05:19.040> costs<00:05:19.820> on<00:05:19.910> the<00:05:19.970> order<00:05:20.030> of

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
for full-face it costs on the order of

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.320 
for full-face it costs on the order of
$1,000<00:05:21.050> or<00:05:21.080> $1200<00:05:21.860> per<00:05:22.040> session<00:05:22.340> yeah<00:05:22.850> so<00:05:23.240> it

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
$1,000 or $1200 per session yeah so it

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.550 
$1,000 or $1200 per session yeah so it
really<00:05:23.480> depends<00:05:23.810> on<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:24.020> surface<00:05:24.320> area

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
really depends on the surface area

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.810 
really depends on the surface area
that's<00:05:24.710> being<00:05:24.920> treated<00:05:25.130> right<00:05:25.400> but<00:05:25.640> if<00:05:25.730> it

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
that's being treated right but if it

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.390 
that's being treated right but if it
lasts<00:05:26.180> for<00:05:26.360> a<00:05:26.390> year<00:05:26.720> or<00:05:26.960> longer<00:05:27.440> a<00:05:27.920> couple<00:05:28.310> of

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
lasts for a year or longer a couple of

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.570 
lasts for a year or longer a couple of
years<00:05:28.640> yeah<00:05:29.540> then<00:05:30.050> and<00:05:30.500> so<00:05:30.710> how<00:05:30.860> long<00:05:31.070> has<00:05:31.280> this

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
years yeah then and so how long has this

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.850 
years yeah then and so how long has this
particular<00:05:32.480> version<00:05:32.990> of<00:05:33.290> laser<00:05:33.470> resurfacing

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
particular version of laser resurfacing

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.790 
particular version of laser resurfacing
been<00:05:34.430> around<00:05:34.670> this<00:05:35.420> idea<00:05:35.660> in<00:05:36.050> my<00:05:36.260> hands<00:05:36.710> has

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
been around this idea in my hands has

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.380 
been around this idea in my hands has
been<00:05:36.950> around<00:05:37.100> since<00:05:37.310> 2003<00:05:37.880> you<00:05:38.060> know<00:05:38.150> I<00:05:38.180> did

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
been around since 2003 you know I did

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.150 
been around since 2003 you know I did
some<00:05:38.510> of<00:05:38.600> the<00:05:38.690> early<00:05:38.990> clinical<00:05:39.200> work<00:05:39.620> on<00:05:39.890> this

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
some of the early clinical work on this

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.820 
some of the early clinical work on this
on<00:05:40.640> this<00:05:40.850> laser<00:05:41.120> system<00:05:41.600> 2003<00:05:42.380> there's<00:05:42.680> been

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
on this laser system 2003 there's been

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.890 
on this laser system 2003 there's been
several<00:05:43.040> updates<00:05:43.610> throughout<00:05:43.910> the<00:05:44.180> years<00:05:44.420> but

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
several updates throughout the years but

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.240 
several updates throughout the years but
you<00:05:45.020> know<00:05:45.110> this<00:05:45.290> idea<00:05:45.530> of<00:05:45.800> fractional

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
you know this idea of fractional

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.670 
you know this idea of fractional
resurfacing<00:05:46.850> has<00:05:47.030> really<00:05:47.360> revolutionized

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
resurfacing has really revolutionized

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.380 
resurfacing has really revolutionized
the<00:05:48.680> field<00:05:48.860> of<00:05:49.070> laser<00:05:49.250> resurfacing<00:05:49.610> and<00:05:50.060> you

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
the field of laser resurfacing and you

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.870 
the field of laser resurfacing and you
don't<00:05:50.600> consider<00:05:51.230> a<00:05:51.380> younger<00:05:52.280> woman<00:05:52.370> or<00:05:52.640> older

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
don't consider a younger woman or older

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.760 
don't consider a younger woman or older
woman<00:05:53.120> a<00:05:53.240> better<00:05:53.390> candidate<00:05:53.870> for<00:05:54.380> this<00:05:54.470> it

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
woman a better candidate for this it

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:55.930 
woman a better candidate for this it
really<00:05:54.890> doesn't<00:05:55.340> matter<00:05:55.400> you<00:05:55.640> know<00:05:55.730> in<00:05:55.850> my

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
really doesn't matter you know in my

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.990 
really doesn't matter you know in my
practice<00:05:56.150> I<00:05:56.480> have<00:05:56.750> you<00:05:57.620> know<00:05:57.740> 18<00:05:58.130> 19<00:05:58.580> year<00:05:58.760> olds

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
practice I have you know 18 19 year olds

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.160 
practice I have you know 18 19 year olds
that<00:05:59.150> may<00:05:59.270> come<00:05:59.510> to<00:05:59.690> me<00:05:59.840> for<00:05:59.960> laser

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.170 
that may come to me for laser

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.020 
that may come to me for laser
resurfacing<00:06:00.530> because<00:06:01.220> they've<00:06:01.370> had<00:06:01.490> bad<00:06:01.760> acne

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
resurfacing because they've had bad acne

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.240 
resurfacing because they've had bad acne
and<00:06:02.810> it's<00:06:02.990> left<00:06:03.230> them<00:06:03.350> you<00:06:03.470> know<00:06:03.590> scars<00:06:04.010> on

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
and it's left them you know scars on

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.180 
and it's left them you know scars on
their<00:06:04.370> face<00:06:04.610> and<00:06:04.910> I<00:06:05.270> know<00:06:05.330> I<00:06:05.420> have<00:06:05.750> 40<00:06:06.500> 50<00:06:06.800> 60

their face and I know I have 40 50 60
year-olds<00:06:07.580> who<00:06:07.610> may<00:06:07.790> come<00:06:08.000> to<00:06:08.180> me<00:06:08.300> because<00:06:08.660> you

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
year-olds who may come to me because you

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.130 
year-olds who may come to me because you
know<00:06:09.680> they<00:06:10.010> have<00:06:10.130> sun<00:06:10.400> damage<00:06:10.430> and<00:06:11.140> wrinkles

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.140 
know they have sun damage and wrinkles

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.750 
know they have sun damage and wrinkles
and<00:06:12.290> brown<00:06:12.470> spots<00:06:12.770> and<00:06:12.890> so<00:06:12.980> on<00:06:13.070> and<00:06:13.190> so<00:06:13.310> forth<00:06:13.580> I

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
and brown spots and so on and so forth I

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.300 
and brown spots and so on and so forth I
should<00:06:14.180> also<00:06:14.330> mention<00:06:14.690> that<00:06:15.320> several<00:06:16.010> studies

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
should also mention that several studies

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.730 
should also mention that several studies
in<00:06:16.700> the<00:06:16.760> past<00:06:17.000> year<00:06:17.330> or<00:06:17.360> two<00:06:17.480> have<00:06:18.350> established

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
in the past year or two have established

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.040 
in the past year or two have established
that<00:06:19.310> the<00:06:19.520> use<00:06:19.700> of<00:06:19.910> this<00:06:20.090> laser<00:06:20.450> actually

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
that the use of this laser actually

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.960 
that the use of this laser actually
decreases<00:06:21.740> the<00:06:21.860> incidence<00:06:22.040> of<00:06:22.490> precancerous

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:22.970 
decreases the incidence of precancerous

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.409 
decreases the incidence of precancerous
lesions<00:06:23.660> really<00:06:23.990> as<00:06:24.169> well<00:06:24.560> as<00:06:24.650> skin<00:06:24.890> cancer

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
lesions really as well as skin cancer

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.119 
lesions really as well as skin cancer
it<00:06:26.509> removes<00:06:26.869> precancerous<00:06:27.259> lesions<00:06:27.860> and<00:06:28.039> it

00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:28.129 
it removes precancerous lesions and it

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:30.369 
it removes precancerous lesions and it
decreases<00:06:28.549> the<00:06:28.759> incidence<00:06:28.969> and<00:06:29.479> and<00:06:29.749> that

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:30.379 
decreases the incidence and and that

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:31.869 
decreases the incidence and and that
really<00:06:30.649> makes<00:06:31.039> a<00:06:31.189> lot<00:06:31.309> of<00:06:31.339> sense<00:06:31.639> because

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:31.879 
really makes a lot of sense because

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:34.929 
really makes a lot of sense because
you're<00:06:32.659> getting<00:06:33.019> rid<00:06:33.199> of<00:06:33.319> old<00:06:33.669> damaged<00:06:34.669> skin

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:34.939 
you're getting rid of old damaged skin

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:36.669 
you're getting rid of old damaged skin
and<00:06:35.629> you're<00:06:35.749> creating<00:06:36.049> new<00:06:36.169> skin<00:06:36.439> which<00:06:36.559> is

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:36.679 
and you're creating new skin which is

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:38.379 
and you're creating new skin which is
healthier<00:06:37.129> fascinating<00:06:37.729> by<00:06:37.849> creating<00:06:38.360> a

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:38.389 
healthier fascinating by creating a
