00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:10.139
 but so was that does not mean all 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.240
 Richter scale I think you 're right 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:18.020
 synonymous but there is wind so synonymous 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.020
 between two and four 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:30.349
 So - 1 and 1 to 4 is four to 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:35.190
 five and half small and then comes 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:42.239
 Moderator major and seems or knows 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:53.789
 What men's name is now me 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:57.809
 plaintiff unsolved therapy had the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.309
 floor and the house next to slipping 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.280
 You can not do this minimum now 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:09.450
 To move more means to be low 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.340
 insignificant great but that's it 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.170
 I felt like I would be real 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.270
 shaken up and the sofa and all 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.970
 no idea about this table 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.970
 that is insignificant interesting 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:44.850
 You have the woods to note we 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.800
 or one - which we or nuno who is there 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.450
 winning 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.460
 somehow I wanted to I wanted 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.020
 for me no idea series can stop 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.360
 I think better clean then only leads 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.130
 about this violent system with his 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:05.370
 eat as well as after louis statement has the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.340
 rink of only just less cd than 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.910
 the ship of seal by good 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.770
 I think he has his football 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.480
 see if only here the upper hand 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:24.090
 wins the world look like us 76 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.980
 53 percent only 67 46 percent yes I know 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.500
 not who will win the upper ones now 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.780
 is no idea we need time 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:37.280
 but look so often she could there 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.280
 I don't think German 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.370
 first again on free camera here 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.460
 put 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.540
 Now, think about it, if you can 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.780
 That's probably what I do 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.780
 same 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:03:02.060
 but not exactly and hip hop is 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.060
 it was perhaps a wise 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:10.310
 just here, very aggressive with three 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:11.299
 there in the first bush he now has 72 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.859
 Section 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.859
 this nuremberg 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.079
 you can already see that here 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.310
 first iqnite is also directly out 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.829
 maybe not so stupid am 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.769
 Start directly from the steering wheel 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.310
 bit from berlin or content down 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.900
 hold 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.640
 only for three minutes and ten seconds 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:41.549
 are indeed these these heels because what he as 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.680
 maybe all this harm from dubais 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:47.220
 palm if he stays on the ball can the 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.170
 ice rink stay on the ball there can really there 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.700
 are you me your cards are evil 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.129
 bad if this continues with 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.129
 the special heisenberg what is going on there 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.959
 now comes back on there will be too 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.120
 already here it is on both sides 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.769
 Immediately comes out and that could now 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.400
 its already been the word 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:10.579
 the first blood went faster than that 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.579
 expects it is over now 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:16.940
 Do you want to be more expensive than you ? 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.940
 give him equal distribution
