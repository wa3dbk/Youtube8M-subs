minds it's a very very simple design
although<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.300> deluxe<00:00:42.300> version

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
because it has frets you get one pick up

the neck a volume knob and a simple set
of<00:00:51.420> switches<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:59.899> the<00:01:00.899> three<00:01:01.260> string<00:01:01.530> neck

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
of switches and the three string neck

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.369 
of switches and the three string neck
and<00:01:02.460> as<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.059> might<00:01:03.239> guess<00:01:03.420> with<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.930> pickups

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
and as you might guess with the pickups

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.060 
and as you might guess with the pickups
being<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.920> close<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.430> bridges<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:07.650> sounds

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
being so close to the bridges the sounds

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.310 
being so close to the bridges the sounds
running<00:01:08.460> through<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> very<00:01:09.060> very<00:01:10.760> neutral

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
running through a very very neutral

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.469 
running through a very very neutral
sounding<00:01:13.320> happens<00:01:13.740> basically<00:01:13.950> an<00:01:14.340> amp<00:01:15.150> for

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
sounding happens basically an amp for

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.109 
sounding happens basically an amp for
acoustic<00:01:15.930> instruments<00:01:16.439> plugged<00:01:16.710> into<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.119> PA

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
acoustic instruments plugged into a PA

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:48.090

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.270 

turn<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.280> low<00:01:49.430> end<00:01:49.640> up<00:01:49.790> on<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.090> end<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:52.040> trip

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
turn the low end up on the end the trip

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.710 
turn the low end up on the end the trip
one<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.610> midst<00:01:52.880> down<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:53.270> then<00:01:53.420> you<00:01:53.540> get<00:01:53.660> a

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
one the midst down and then you get a

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:15.430
