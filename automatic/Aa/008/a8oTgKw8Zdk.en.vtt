00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:14.809
 which is where everything still resides with 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.730
 we owe you a novelty of the site the assembler of menu tomatito dor 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.570
 do not take but it is once he answered me with captain lapa remains 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.069
 in the calculator part you already know 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:32.599
 are there cds at the end we pass all your incredible searches and 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.730
 magnificent 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.820
 does not exist here 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.690
 do not change your menu easily and is in the proportion of carbohydrate 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.300
 protein 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.080
 according to the action document 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.520
 so a lot of people come to me to say that they have difficulty setting the menu 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.770
 first time 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.180
 and really want to understand that the first time is difficult to do 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.320
 even or a bit challenging 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.000
 you need to contact the brook who check you wagered killed a customer 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.340
 every year the minister in the case to boycott the community intends to fat 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.700
 already no taboos taken possession a little annoyed 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.250
 but the first time it is done through the menu things go naturally 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.380
 then it gets easier 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.540
 nor to facilitate 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.970
 the crime that I know of the antonic throughout the site 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.230
 Paulo 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.840
 the assembler of every whole remain in a manner facilitated in life 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.810
 the people in that first part so you wanted no one want 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.510
 and goes directly to the page 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.770
 today a new play in which I had a problem in my then here's a 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.679
 hour 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.100
 fixing the problem in the business code 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.460
 but now pressed 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.799
 so the leader itself is very simplistic so I'm going to make it mount a world the 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.200
 Breakfast 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.279
 healthy protein-rich and pathetic shoe that 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.720
 so let's talk here 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.380
 madonna or boiled 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.420
 I have been saying ultra quality 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.250
 has to receive of T-shirt he knows trying more than 70 thousand spaces more 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.620
 important 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.330
 and healthy eating 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.530
 as the sessions of lies like big mac this raised the fleet team finish 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.560
 shipments 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.890
 then with political support baked 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.209
 I'll put me here two games with the virus 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.170
 I'm sure the minister 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.330
 the field of carbohydrate 2t twelve by 6-2 has and since the year 2000 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.550
 I really loved it, it's a slice of bread. 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:26.529
 a franchise 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:28.579
 protection does not 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.109
 who woo 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.429
 that if you know that the recount 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:35.429
 I highly recommend every quality protein 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:38.369
 very low fat 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:42.199
 it's a scene that 50 grams can brake because few are cleaning then 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.879
 you 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.579
 deciding if you are going to have a pregnancy 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.389
 so much coffee that now has 17 5 thousand islands 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.469
 Fourteen is a carbohydrate 22 protein which is very good breakfast 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:53.499
 a game of fat 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:54.789
 the grandma 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:58.249
 I think your executive breakfast is incredibly good 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:02.279
 will be very fierce and has studies that say that the overcoming of being 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:03.969
 enrolled have at breakfast 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:05.100
 tell me 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.410
 Do you like to waste time? 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.499
 only with this operation 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:10.469
 it's worth having a top 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:14.859
 so let's continue tense with pf a make-believe the conditional order 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:17.299
 the inter here 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.000
 for breakfast and late 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.050
 highlighted by the risk policies so this is fabulous that you can 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.790
 veto also the line then you montali you click here it arrives here 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.049
 courteous back 30/10 is a very simple tool 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.199
 but I think it will help you the action of the proportions of the accident each 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.979
 element 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:40.839
 the automaker added its meals in formal terms without understanding why 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.619
 which greatly facilitates the first phase 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:48.729
 then of the same paulo good health puts in saite today guilty of menu 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.669
 without being taken advantage of 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.989
 and create with more moisture so the website eight and on facebook in a taste of 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.379
 Facebook Page Mirim Fame 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.549
 that can be cool 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:01.560
 for more
