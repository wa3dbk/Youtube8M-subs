00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:21.409 
buildings are over here they never

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:25.529 
buildings are over here they never
cleaned<00:00:21.800> up<00:00:21.949> the<00:00:22.039> river<00:00:22.599> all<00:00:23.599> the<00:00:23.659> rebar<00:00:24.259> and

ridiculous
this<00:01:15.100> was<00:01:15.430> my<00:01:15.700> office

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.240 

well<00:01:28.260> so<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.500> really<00:01:28.740> haven't<00:01:28.980> touched

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
well so you really haven't touched

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.820 
well so you really haven't touched
anything<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:30.120> know<00:01:30.270> we<00:01:30.900> were<00:01:30.960> advised<00:01:31.350> not<00:01:31.380> to

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:46.399 

you

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.739 

they<00:01:46.799> poured<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.310> right<00:01:47.579> angle<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.149> smen<00:01:48.539> out

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:48.749 
they poured that right angle of smen out

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:50.719 
they poured that right angle of smen out
there<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.350> corner<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.859> dam<00:01:50.039> we're<00:01:50.490> still

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
there in a corner of the dam we're still

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.700 
there in a corner of the dam we're still
Larry<00:01:50.969> from<00:01:51.179> that<00:01:51.390> day<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.630> that's<00:01:52.140> where

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
Larry from that day that that's where

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.139 
Larry from that day that that's where
the<00:01:52.829> extra<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.490> know<00:01:53.609> heights<00:01:53.819> of<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
the extra you know heights of the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.209 
the extra you know heights of the
reservoir<00:01:54.929> well<00:01:55.289> the<00:01:55.439> reason<00:01:55.679> they<00:01:55.770> raised<00:01:56.039> it

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
reservoir well the reason they raised it

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.770 
reservoir well the reason they raised it
two<00:01:56.369> feet<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.759> because<00:01:57.000> they<00:01:57.359> will<00:01:57.569> put<00:01:57.750> a

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
two feet is because they will put a

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.020 
two feet is because they will put a
hydro<00:01:58.140> plan<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:59.039> there<00:01:59.219> with<00:01:59.369> three<00:01:59.490> turbines

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
hydro plan in there with three turbines

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.730 
hydro plan in there with three turbines
and<00:02:00.179> they<00:02:00.299> needed<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.780> they<00:02:01.229> had<00:02:01.439> pressure

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
and they needed that they had pressure

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.289 
and they needed that they had pressure
on<00:02:02.039> the<00:02:02.130> top<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.490> those<00:02:02.609> turbines<00:02:03.030> but<00:02:03.179> whose

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
on the top of those turbines but whose

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.449 
on the top of those turbines but whose
power<00:02:03.539> to<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.049> know<00:02:04.140> make<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.409> feasible<00:02:05.069> for

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
power to you know make it feasible for

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:06.980 
power to you know make it feasible for
them<00:02:05.609> to<00:02:05.729> run<00:02:05.880> those<00:02:06.090> turbines<00:02:06.569> that's<00:02:06.810> why

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
them to run those turbines that's why

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.719 
them to run those turbines that's why
the<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.439> reservoir<00:02:07.950> was<00:02:08.069> brought<00:02:08.310> up<00:02:08.489> that

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
the the reservoir was brought up that

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.220 
the the reservoir was brought up that
the<00:02:09.030> extra<00:02:09.420> two<00:02:09.569> feet<00:02:11.510> my<00:02:12.510> memories<00:02:12.989> of<00:02:13.019> the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
the extra two feet my memories of the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.869 
the extra two feet my memories of the
mill<00:02:13.500> emotionally<00:02:14.840> when<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:15.870> was<00:02:16.170> young<00:02:16.470> that
