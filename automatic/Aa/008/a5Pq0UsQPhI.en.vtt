00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
decided I would hold off on that because

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.490 
decided I would hold off on that because
he<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.300> orthopedic<00:01:38.300> surgeon<00:01:38.780> even<00:01:39.050> told<00:01:39.290> me

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
he the orthopedic surgeon even told me

he the orthopedic surgeon even told me
that<00:01:40.030> you<00:01:41.030> know<00:01:41.150> there<00:01:41.270> was<00:01:41.390> a<00:01:41.450> chance<00:01:41.810> for<00:01:41.990> a

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
that you know there was a chance for a

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
that you know there was a chance for a
better<00:01:43.280> chance<00:01:43.640> for<00:01:43.790> arthritis<00:01:44.480> later<00:01:45.490> so<00:01:46.490> I

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
better chance for arthritis later so I

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.540 
better chance for arthritis later so I
started<00:01:47.240> checking<00:01:47.300> into<00:01:47.990> some<00:01:48.620> things<00:01:48.860> on<00:01:49.400> the

I found out about PRP and came here to

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.570 
I found out about PRP and came here to
advanced<00:01:55.490> wellness<00:01:55.850> and<00:01:57.190> overall<00:01:58.190> I'm<00:01:58.370> pretty

you<00:02:35.240> know<00:02:35.330> I<00:02:35.360> for<00:02:36.350> a<00:02:36.380> couple<00:02:36.710> days<00:02:36.890> after<00:02:37.400> there

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
you know I for a couple days after there

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.940 
you know I for a couple days after there
was<00:02:37.760> some<00:02:38.000> minor<00:02:38.270> discomfort<00:02:38.690> but<00:02:39.380> nothing

was some minor discomfort but nothing
really<00:02:40.130> bad<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.860> I<00:02:42.860> really<00:02:43.040> noticed<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.060> most

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
really bad and I really noticed the most

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.350 
really bad and I really noticed the most
improvement<00:02:44.840> after<00:02:45.350> that<00:02:45.740> first<00:02:46.360> treatment

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
improvement after that first treatment

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.860 
improvement after that first treatment
is<00:02:48.140> there<00:02:48.380> is<00:02:48.590> probably<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.130> 60<00:02:49.670> 70<00:02:50.060> percent<00:02:50.750> of

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
is there is probably a 60 70 percent of
