gonna build this Santa alarm well it's
pretty<00:00:27.269> easy<00:00:27.390> over<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.050> parts<00:00:28.260> from<00:00:28.349> digit

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
pretty easy over the parts from digit

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.900 
pretty easy over the parts from digit
you<00:00:28.800> yesterday<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.369> they<00:00:29.429> showed<00:00:29.640> up<00:00:29.789> this

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
you yesterday and they showed up this

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.299 
you yesterday and they showed up this
morning<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.900> main<00:00:31.320> component<00:00:31.830> I'm<00:00:31.890> using<00:00:32.070> is

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
morning the main component I'm using is

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.000 
morning the main component I'm using is
gonna<00:00:32.489> be<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.730> AMS<00:00:33.149> color<00:00:33.420> sensitive<00:00:34.010> okay

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
gonna be this AMS color sensitive okay

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.130 
gonna be this AMS color sensitive okay
that's<00:00:35.430> gonna<00:00:35.550> sense<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> color<00:00:36.180> red<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
that's gonna sense the color red so the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.639 
that's gonna sense the color red so the
Santa<00:00:37.350> Claus<00:00:37.500> wears<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.890> red<00:00:38.640> if<00:00:38.969> he<00:00:39.210> existed

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
Santa Claus wears a red if he existed

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.590 
Santa Claus wears a red if he existed
yes<00:00:42.200> we're<00:00:43.200> gonna<00:00:43.290> programmer<00:00:43.680> with<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> ad<00:00:44.370> no

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
yes we're gonna programmer with a ad no

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.180 
yes we're gonna programmer with a ad no
atmega328<00:00:45.600> microcontroller<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:46.710> then<00:00:47.039> we're

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
atmega328 microcontroller and then we're

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.439 
atmega328 microcontroller and then we're
gonna<00:00:47.280> run<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.789> into<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.200> py<00:00:49.200> buzzer<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.739> think<00:00:50.449> I

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
gonna run it into a py buzzer I think I

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.660 
gonna run it into a py buzzer I think I
haven't<00:00:51.960> seen<00:00:52.140> those<00:00:52.230> before<00:00:52.489> this<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
haven't seen those before this is a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.840 
haven't seen those before this is a
programmable<00:00:54.149> one<00:00:54.770> special<00:00:55.770> program<00:00:56.070> you'll

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
programmable one special program you'll

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.720 
programmable one special program you'll
see<00:00:57.030> what<00:00:57.210> goes<00:00:57.360> up<00:00:57.510> actually<00:00:58.230> okay<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.949> then

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
see what goes up actually okay and then

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.700 
see what goes up actually okay and then
we're<00:01:00.329> gonna<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> create<00:01:00.899> X<00:01:01.079> 2<00:01:01.199> e<00:01:01.260> LED

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
we're gonna have a create X 2 e LED

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.290 
we're gonna have a create X 2 e LED
which<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.070> going<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.250> shine<00:01:02.460> red<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:03.149> gonna

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
which is going to shine red it's gonna

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.179 
which is going to shine red it's gonna
look<00:01:03.420> like<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.629> bright<00:01:04.379> flash<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:04.949> gonna<00:01:05.040> be

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
look like a bright flash it's gonna be

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.130 
look like a bright flash it's gonna be
loud<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.430> bright<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:06.750> gonna<00:01:06.900> wake<00:01:07.020> up

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
loud and bright and it's gonna wake up

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.950 
loud and bright and it's gonna wake up
long<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:08.070> trouble<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:09.060> then<00:01:09.630> we're<00:01:09.780> gonna<00:01:09.869> use

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
long in trouble and then we're gonna use

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.410 
long in trouble and then we're gonna use
AC<00:01:10.830> Y<00:01:10.979> switching<00:01:11.400> regulator<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.970> regulate<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
AC Y switching regulator to regulate the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.330 
AC Y switching regulator to regulate the
voltage<00:01:12.540> from<00:01:12.930> 9<00:01:13.229> volts<00:01:13.530> down<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.799> 5<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.189> we<00:01:14.250> can

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
voltage from 9 volts down to 5 so we can

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.190 
voltage from 9 volts down to 5 so we can
run<00:01:14.490> our<00:01:14.610> microcontroller<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.689> we're<00:01:16.110> gonna

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
run our microcontroller and we're gonna

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200 
run our microcontroller and we're gonna
put<00:01:16.500> all<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.890> inside<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.490> bud<00:01:17.729> enclosure

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
put all of it inside of a bud enclosure

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.570 
put all of it inside of a bud enclosure
and<00:01:19.200> that's<00:01:19.350> all<00:01:19.530> great<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.280> still<00:01:20.400> not

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
and that's all great but it's still not

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.149 
and that's all great but it's still not
gonna<00:01:20.670> go<00:01:20.850> off<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.570> gonna<00:01:21.750> cooperate<00:01:22.229> oh<00:01:22.560> not

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
gonna go off it's gonna cooperate oh not

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:23.870 
gonna go off it's gonna cooperate oh not
a<00:01:23.189> chance

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
a chance

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.249 
a chance
it's<00:01:24.090> gonna<00:01:24.270> wake<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.750> up<00:01:24.780> you're<00:01:25.020> gonna<00:01:25.110> wake

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
it's gonna wake you up you're gonna wake

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.260 
it's gonna wake you up you're gonna wake
mom<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.619> dad<00:01:25.799> up<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.580> we're<00:01:26.909> gonna<00:01:27.030> catch

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
mom and dad up and we're gonna catch

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.969 
mom and dad up and we're gonna catch
Santa<00:01:27.570> Claus<00:01:27.869> all<00:01:28.320> right<00:01:28.470> we'll<00:01:28.650> see<00:01:28.770> who's
