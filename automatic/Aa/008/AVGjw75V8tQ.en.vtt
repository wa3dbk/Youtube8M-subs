thwarted<00:00:03.750> by<00:00:04.279> VLT<00:00:05.960> transcoding<00:00:06.960> problems<00:00:07.620> I

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
thwarted by VLT transcoding problems I

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.940 
thwarted by VLT transcoding problems I
have<00:00:09.139> eliminated<00:00:10.139> some<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.469> variables

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
have eliminated some of the variables

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.009 
have eliminated some of the variables
namely<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:12.059> was<00:00:12.300> trying<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.660> transcode

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
namely I was trying to transcode

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.690 
namely I was trying to transcode
directly<00:00:13.469> from<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.679> DVD<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.370> might<00:00:14.549> have

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
directly from the DVD that might have

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.560 
directly from the DVD that might have
been<00:00:15.059> slowing<00:00:15.360> down<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.719> CPU<00:00:16.170> as<00:00:17.060> well

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.820 

uploads<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.779> was<00:00:21.900> busy<00:00:22.170> uploading<00:00:22.619> something

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
uploads it was busy uploading something

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.800 
uploads it was busy uploading something
so<00:00:23.070> like<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.730> video<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.180> did<00:00:24.480> manage<00:00:24.779> to

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
so like the video I did manage to

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.650 
so like the video I did manage to
transcribe<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.500> video<00:00:25.740> but<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.099> has<00:00:26.310> some

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
transcribe the video but it has some

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.300 
transcribe the video but it has some
spot<00:00:27.660> enos<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.199> didn't<00:00:28.439> like<00:00:28.619> I'm<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.279> a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
spot enos that I didn't like I'm on a

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.560 
spot enos that I didn't like I'm on a
fast<00:00:29.699> computer

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
fast computer

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.330 
fast computer
it's<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.489> dual-core<00:00:32.899> 2.8<00:00:33.899> gigahertz<00:00:34.380> four<00:00:35.130> gigs

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
it's a dual-core 2.8 gigahertz four gigs

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.240 
it's a dual-core 2.8 gigahertz four gigs
of<00:00:35.520> RAM<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.850> should<00:00:36.030> be<00:00:36.120> more<00:00:36.360> than<00:00:36.600> enough<00:00:36.719> for

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
of RAM it should be more than enough for

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.170 
of RAM it should be more than enough for
transcoding<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.399> let's<00:00:38.550> go<00:00:38.640> ahead<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:38.879> try<00:00:39.059> it

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
transcoding so let's go ahead and try it

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.510 
transcoding so let's go ahead and try it
again<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:40.590> new<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.250> VLC<00:00:41.760> player<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:43.520> 1.1

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
again the new of the VLC player is 1.1

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.150 
again the new of the VLC player is 1.1
and<00:00:44.910> they<00:00:45.360> have<00:00:45.510> not<00:00:45.809> updated<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.620> document

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
and they have not updated the document

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.779 
and they have not updated the document
so<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:48.000> have<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.660> kind<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.870> play<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.670> figure<00:00:50.670> it

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
so you have to kind of play it figure it

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:51.200 
so you have to kind of play it figure it
out

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
out

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.279 
out
or<00:00:51.660> watch<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.260> video<00:00:53.300> convert<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.539> save<00:00:54.840> is

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
or watch this video convert and save is

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.979 
or watch this video convert and save is
