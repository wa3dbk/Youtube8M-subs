Universal<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.400> doing<00:01:44.610> with<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> few<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.119> their

Universal is doing with a few of their

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.160 
films I think they did it was Riddick as
well<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.270> seems<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.540> be<00:01:48.630> sort<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.960> like<00:01:49.020> a

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
colorful red spine there compared to the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.999 
colorful red spine there compared to the

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
different layout to how we're used to

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.180 
different layout to how we're used to
same<00:02:09.390> bonus<00:02:10.079> features<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.679> we've<00:02:10.860> had<00:02:11.040> on

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
same bonus features that we've had on

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.789 
same bonus features that we've had on
all<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.519> the<00:02:11.610> other<00:02:11.730> previous<00:02:12.000> releases<00:02:12.799> but

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
all of the other previous releases but

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.259 
all of the other previous releases but
just<00:02:14.040> really<00:02:14.400> cool<00:02:14.549> and<00:02:14.610> that's<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:14.940> standard

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
just really cool and that's the standard

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.140 
just really cool and that's the standard
blu-ray<00:02:15.840> release<00:02:16.110> that's<00:02:16.350> not<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.650> 3d

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
blu-ray release that's not the 3d

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.180 
blu-ray release that's not the 3d
version<00:02:18.410> so<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.440> just<00:02:19.650> thought<00:02:19.769> that<00:02:19.829> was<00:02:19.980> cool

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190

cover<00:02:26.480> art<00:02:26.780> on<00:02:26.900> these<00:02:27.080> opening<00:02:27.440> a<00:02:27.530> bit<00:02:27.650> closer

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
cover art on these opening a bit closer

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.080 
cover art on these opening a bit closer

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
so you can see and it's a nice of

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.030

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
collage of stuff going on in Jurassic

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.910 
collage of stuff going on in Jurassic
Park<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.580> again<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.720> back<00:02:35.930> looks<00:02:36.410> similar<00:02:36.650> to

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
Park and again the back looks similar to

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.190 
Park and again the back looks similar to
what<00:02:37.040> we<00:02:37.130> had<00:02:37.280> on<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.490> German<00:02:37.880> edition<00:02:38.200> these

what we had on the German edition these

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.840 
what we had on the German edition these
are<00:02:39.350> Japanese<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:40.100> also<00:02:40.340> they're<00:02:40.610> available

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
are Japanese and also they're available

are Japanese and also they're available
in<00:02:41.150> European<00:02:42.020> places<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:42.350> think<00:02:42.440> I<00:02:42.830> got<00:02:43.040> this

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
in European places I think I got this

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.300 
in European places I think I got this
from<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:43.520> Netherlands<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:45.950> is<00:02:46.100> really

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
from the Netherlands so this is really

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.290
