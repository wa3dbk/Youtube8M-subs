00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:05.660 
left is to hook up our actions and

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.700 
left is to hook up our actions and
correspond<00:00:06.660> those<00:00:06.779> with<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.049> outlets<00:00:07.589> that

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
correspond those with the outlets that

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.190 
correspond those with the outlets that
we've<00:00:07.890> already<00:00:08.069> hooked<00:00:08.370> up<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.870> shibam<00:00:09.870> will

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
we've already hooked up and shibam will

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.770 
we've already hooked up and shibam will
have<00:00:10.320> that<00:00:10.500> switch<00:00:10.980> in<00:00:11.250> place<00:00:11.309> in<00:00:11.759> no<00:00:11.940> time<00:00:12.179> so

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
have that switch in place in no time so

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.030 
have that switch in place in no time so
you've<00:00:12.929> already<00:00:13.200> hooked<00:00:13.440> up<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.740> outlets

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
you've already hooked up the outlets

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.250 
you've already hooked up the outlets
actions<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.820> within<00:00:14.940> your<00:00:15.150> header<00:00:15.330> file<00:00:15.630> now

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
actions and within your header file now

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.330 
actions and within your header file now
what<00:00:16.500> we're<00:00:16.619> going<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.800> do<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.039> we're<00:00:17.160> going<00:00:17.250> to

what we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.760 
what we're going to do is we're going to
flip<00:00:17.580> over<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.000> our<00:00:18.410> implementation<00:00:19.410> file

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
flip over to our implementation file

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.820 
flip over to our implementation file
within<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.430> same<00:00:20.699> class<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.449> as<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.619> can<00:00:22.800> see

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
within the same class and as you can see

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.640 
within the same class and as you can see
we've<00:00:23.369> already<00:00:23.460> get<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> IV<00:00:24.000> action<00:00:24.689> settled

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
we've already get the IV action settled

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.179 
we've already get the IV action settled
on<00:00:25.859> screen<00:00:26.519> ready<00:00:26.970> Drock<00:00:27.570> here<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.980> what<00:00:29.099> we're

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
position which is going to be our else

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.600 
position which is going to be our else
statement<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:49.500> these<00:00:49.739> set<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.100> statements

here so right if hit tab you'll see the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.990 
here so right if hit tab you'll see the
condition<00:00:55.680> come<00:00:55.920> over<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.850> where

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
condition come over and this is where

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.470 
condition come over and this is where
we're<00:00:57.090> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.270> ask<00:00:57.480> our<00:00:57.930> switch<00:00:58.850> or<00:00:59.850> we're

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
we're going to ask our switch or we're

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.750 
we're going to ask our switch or we're
going<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.660> basically<00:01:01.559> say<00:01:01.829> if<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.370> which<00:01:02.609> is

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
going to basically say if this which is

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.000 
going to basically say if this which is
in<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.270> position<00:01:03.860> my<00:01:04.860> switch<00:01:05.309> dot<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:07.010> and

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
in the on position my switch dot on and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.830 
in the on position my switch dot on and
we're<00:01:08.520> going<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.670> execute<00:01:09.030> these<00:01:09.390> statements

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
we're going to execute these statements

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.060 
we're going to execute these statements
here<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.350> we're<00:01:10.500> not<00:01:10.590> going<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.799> be<00:01:10.890> too

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
here so we're not going to be too

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.800 
here so we're not going to be too
concerned<00:01:11.460> about<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.000> state<00:01:12.420> at<00:01:12.630> this

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
concerned about the on state at this

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.200 
concerned about the on state at this
point<00:01:13.080> I'll<00:01:13.290> show<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.560> what<00:01:13.799> we<00:01:13.950> gotta

point I'll show you what we gotta

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.190 
point I'll show you what we gotta
manipulate<00:01:15.210> some<00:01:15.390> stuff<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.020> make<00:01:16.170> sure

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
manipulate some stuff just to make sure

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.530 
manipulate some stuff just to make sure
it<00:01:16.439> actually<00:01:16.500> works<00:01:17.040> but<00:01:17.729> we're<00:01:17.909> more

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
it actually works but we're more

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.359 
it actually works but we're more

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
going to write is we're gonna tell our

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.580 
going to write is we're gonna tell our
segmented<00:01:47.670> controller<00:01:48.149> which<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.509> my<00:01:48.840> sag<00:01:49.320> is

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
segmented controller which is my sag is

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.260 
segmented controller which is my sag is
the<00:01:49.710> outlet<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.189> we<00:01:50.310> establish<00:01:50.729> earlier<00:01:51.060> if

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
the outlet that we establish earlier if

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.359 
the outlet that we establish earlier if
you<00:01:51.450> remember<00:01:51.780> right<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.320> we're<00:01:53.220> going<00:01:53.250> to

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
you remember right and we're going to

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.999 
you remember right and we're going to
write<00:01:53.579> son<00:01:54.110> abled<00:01:55.250> equals<00:01:56.840> not<00:01:57.840> two<00:01:58.140> spaces<00:01:58.469> my

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
write son abled equals not two spaces my

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.240 
write son abled equals not two spaces my
sag<00:01:59.640> dot<00:02:00.509> enabled<00:02:01.140> again<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.829> then<00:02:02.130> we're

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
sag dot enabled again and then we're

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.089 
sag dot enabled again and then we're
going<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.399> set<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.759> equal<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.540> no<00:02:04.939> no<00:02:05.939> ha<00:02:06.420> no

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
going to set that equal to no no ha no

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.800 
going to set that equal to no no ha no
quotations<00:02:08.099> there<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:09.179> we're<00:02:09.300> going<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.479> set

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
quotations there so we're going to set

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.979 
quotations there so we're going to set
it<00:02:09.840> equal<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.410> know<00:02:11.150> so<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.180> this<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.870> that

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
it equal to know so that this is that

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.300 
it equal to know so that this is that
makes

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
makes

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.190 
makes
basically<00:02:13.760> we're<00:02:13.910> saying<00:02:14.030> if<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.900> switch<00:02:15.140> is

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
basically we're saying if the switch is

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.390 
basically we're saying if the switch is
off<00:02:15.650> we're<00:02:16.610> gonna<00:02:16.700> disable<00:02:17.270> our<00:02:18.280> we're<00:02:19.280> gonna

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
off we're gonna disable our we're gonna

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.880 
off we're gonna disable our we're gonna
the<00:02:19.910> enable<00:02:20.330> status<00:02:20.750> is<00:02:20.900> going<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.140> be<00:02:21.230> no<00:02:21.530> or

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
the enable status is going to be no or

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.910 
the enable status is going to be no or
off<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.870> next<00:02:24.290> thing<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:24.620> we're<00:02:24.860> gonna

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
off and the next thing that we're gonna

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.580 
off and the next thing that we're gonna
do<00:02:25.190> is<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.880> Alpha<00:02:26.450> that<00:02:26.870> we<00:02:26.989> spoke<00:02:27.230> about<00:02:27.349> so

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
do is the Alpha that we spoke about so

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.280 
do is the Alpha that we spoke about so
it's<00:02:27.709> gonna<00:02:27.800> be<00:02:27.980> my<00:02:28.190> sig<00:02:29.349> Dodds<00:02:30.370> alpha<00:02:32.290> equals

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
it's gonna be my sig Dodds alpha equals

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.229 
it's gonna be my sig Dodds alpha equals
again<00:02:33.739> my<00:02:34.010> sag<00:02:34.489> o<00:02:35.110> dot<00:02:36.110> alpha<00:02:36.890> again<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.640> then

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
again my sag o dot alpha again and then

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.330 
again my sag o dot alpha again and then
we're<00:02:38.330> going<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.510> set<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:38.959> equal<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:39.709> let's

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
we're going to set that equal to let's

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.970 
we're going to set that equal to let's
just<00:02:40.430> put<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:40.819> down<00:02:41.019> 2.5<00:02:42.019> I<00:02:42.530> mean<00:02:42.739> that<00:02:42.860> could

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
just put it down 2.5 I mean that could

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.190 
just put it down 2.5 I mean that could
be<00:02:43.069> anything<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:44.030> remember<00:02:44.360> one<00:02:44.660> is<00:02:44.900> full

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
be anything you remember one is full

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.900 
be anything you remember one is full
alpha<00:02:45.709> which<00:02:45.860> is<00:02:46.010> going<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.190> be<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:46.819> know

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
alpha which is going to be you know

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.460 
alpha which is going to be you know
whatever<00:02:47.390> shows<00:02:47.630> on<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.870> screen<00:02:48.140> is<00:02:48.290> going<00:02:48.410> to

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
whatever shows on the screen is going to

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.800 
whatever shows on the screen is going to
be<00:02:48.590> one<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.190> then<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:49.850> can<00:02:50.030> bring<00:02:50.390> that<00:02:50.630> all

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
be one and then you can bring that all

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.420 
be one and then you can bring that all
the<00:02:50.840> way<00:02:50.959> down<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.230> like<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.500> point<00:02:51.769> 1<00:02:52.100> or<00:02:52.400> 0

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
the way down to like a point 1 or 0

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.880 
the way down to like a point 1 or 0
point<00:02:52.580> 0<00:02:52.670> 1<00:02:53.060> which<00:02:53.330> is<00:02:53.480> almost<00:02:53.720> invisible<00:02:54.230> and

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
point 0 1 which is almost invisible and

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.680 
point 0 1 which is almost invisible and
so<00:02:55.430> we're<00:02:55.580> going<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.760> go<00:02:55.850> halfway<00:02:56.239> in<00:02:56.600> between

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
so we're going to go halfway in between

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.320 
so we're going to go halfway in between
with<00:02:57.290> 0<00:02:57.319> point<00:02:57.590> 5<00:02:57.980> so<00:02:58.790> what<00:02:58.940> we're<00:02:59.030> going<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.209> do

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
with 0 point 5 so what we're going to do

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.160 
with 0 point 5 so what we're going to do
is<00:02:59.420> we're<00:02:59.540> going<00:02:59.630> to<00:02:59.690> run<00:02:59.930> our<00:03:00.140> application

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
is we're going to run our application

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.140 
is we're going to run our application
now<00:03:00.830> we're<00:03:01.069> going<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.250> see<00:03:01.489> what<00:03:01.730> we've<00:03:01.910> got<00:03:01.940> so

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
now we're going to see what we've got so

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.479 
now we're going to see what we've got so
far<00:03:02.360> because<00:03:03.260> you'll<00:03:03.530> see<00:03:03.709> there's<00:03:03.920> a<00:03:03.980> glaring

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
far because you'll see there's a glaring

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.670 
far because you'll see there's a glaring
issue<00:03:04.730> that<00:03:05.120> you<00:03:05.239> gotta<00:03:05.630> watch<00:03:06.019> for<00:03:06.049> you<00:03:06.560> know

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
issue that you gotta watch for you know

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.170 
issue that you gotta watch for you know
that's<00:03:06.890> where<00:03:07.040> we<00:03:07.160> test<00:03:07.400> these<00:03:07.640> things<00:03:07.880> you

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
that's where we test these things you

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.449 
that's where we test these things you
figured<00:03:08.930> how<00:03:09.110> you're<00:03:09.349> like<00:03:09.530> oh<00:03:09.709> man<00:03:10.099> this<00:03:10.280> is

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
figured how you're like oh man this is

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.490 
figured how you're like oh man this is
awesome<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:11.780> know<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.049> then<00:03:12.170> you<00:03:12.260> figure<00:03:12.410> out

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
awesome you know and then you figure out

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.500 
awesome you know and then you figure out
the<00:03:12.650> problems<00:03:13.069> so<00:03:13.760> again<00:03:14.000> we're<00:03:14.180> going<00:03:14.360> into

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
the problems so again we're going into

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.900 
the problems so again we're going into
the<00:03:14.569> projects<00:03:15.140> we've<00:03:15.319> got<00:03:15.530> our<00:03:15.709> switch<00:03:16.459> here

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
the projects we've got our switch here

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.979 
the projects we've got our switch here
and<00:03:17.090> as<00:03:17.750> we<00:03:17.930> flip<00:03:18.260> it<00:03:18.380> off<00:03:19.120> bingo<00:03:20.120> you<00:03:20.750> can<00:03:20.870> see

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
and as we flip it off bingo you can see

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.050 
and as we flip it off bingo you can see
we<00:03:21.109> can't<00:03:21.350> click<00:03:21.590> it<00:03:21.620> it's<00:03:21.859> disabled<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.640> then

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
we can't click it it's disabled and then

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.330 
we can't click it it's disabled and then
it<00:03:23.150> also<00:03:23.299> is<00:03:23.810> trend<00:03:24.320> the<00:03:24.500> transparency<00:03:25.250> is

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
it also is trend the transparency is

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.090 
it also is trend the transparency is
down<00:03:25.519> 2.5<00:03:26.150> like<00:03:26.450> we<00:03:26.600> told<00:03:26.810> it<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:27.440> so<00:03:27.980> now

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
down 2.5 like we told it to and so now

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.349 
down 2.5 like we told it to and so now
we're<00:03:28.220> gonna<00:03:28.280> flip<00:03:28.579> it<00:03:28.670> on<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:29.000> were<00:03:29.060> like<00:03:29.209> oh

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
we're gonna flip it on and were like oh

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.170 
we're gonna flip it on and were like oh
what<00:03:30.200> in<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.500> world<00:03:30.560> man<00:03:31.400> it's<00:03:31.609> still<00:03:31.940> off

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
what in the world man it's still off

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.300 
what in the world man it's still off
like<00:03:32.569> what<00:03:32.750> would<00:03:33.049> happen<00:03:33.470> what<00:03:33.980> do<00:03:34.069> we<00:03:34.160> do

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
like what would happen what do we do

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.460 
like what would happen what do we do
wrong<00:03:34.549> and<00:03:34.880> that's<00:03:35.780> where<00:03:36.049> we<00:03:36.170> have<00:03:36.319> to<00:03:36.350> go

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
wrong and that's where we have to go

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.819 
wrong and that's where we have to go
back<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:36.739> we<00:03:37.010> have<00:03:37.100> to<00:03:37.220> say<00:03:37.400> okay<00:03:37.760> if<00:03:38.769> again<00:03:39.769> if

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
back and we have to say okay if again if

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.860 
back and we have to say okay if again if
it's<00:03:40.220> on<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.459> on<00:03:40.579> position<00:03:40.790> if<00:03:41.209> we<00:03:41.359> flip<00:03:41.690> it

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
it's on the on position if we flip it

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.900 
it's on the on position if we flip it
back<00:03:42.049> to<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.410> on<00:03:42.560> what<00:03:43.040> do<00:03:43.250> we<00:03:43.400> want<00:03:43.609> our

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
back to the on what do we want our

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.270 
back to the on what do we want our
statements<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:44.900> be<00:03:45.049> and<00:03:45.319> so<00:03:45.980> we're<00:03:46.100> going<00:03:46.190> to

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
statements to be and so we're going to

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.099 
statements to be and so we're going to
tell<00:03:46.489> our<00:03:46.519> said<00:03:47.239> controller<00:03:47.750> again<00:03:48.310> my<00:03:49.310> seg

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
tell our said controller again my seg

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:56.470 
tell our said controller again my seg
enabled<00:03:51.109> again<00:03:51.829> my<00:03:52.430> sag<00:03:52.670> enabled<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:55.480> instead

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
enabled again my sag enabled and instead

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.449 
enabled again my sag enabled and instead
of<00:03:56.630> no<00:03:56.959> we're<00:03:57.230> going<00:03:57.350> to<00:03:57.440> set<00:03:57.769> our<00:03:57.799> segment<00:03:58.370> of

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
of no we're going to set our segment of

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.430 
of no we're going to set our segment of
controller<00:03:58.790> back<00:03:59.120> to<00:03:59.389> yes<00:03:59.750> which<00:04:00.049> is<00:04:00.230> going<00:04:00.380> to

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
controller back to yes which is going to

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.400 
controller back to yes which is going to
enable<00:04:00.769> it<00:04:01.040> back<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:02.109> controller<00:04:03.109> that's

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
enable it back to controller that's

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.039 
enable it back to controller that's
going<00:04:03.560> to<00:04:03.620> work<00:04:03.769> and<00:04:04.040> then<00:04:04.609> also<00:04:04.910> alongside<00:04:05.720> of

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
going to work and then also alongside of

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.599 
going to work and then also alongside of
that<00:04:06.170> we've<00:04:06.350> got<00:04:06.470> to<00:04:06.560> change<00:04:06.590> our<00:04:06.920> alpha<00:04:07.250> back

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
that we've got to change our alpha back

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:15.629 
that we've got to change our alpha back
to<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:09.290> one<00:04:10.389> so<00:04:11.389> my<00:04:11.870> sec<00:04:12.290> dots<00:04:12.680> alpha<00:04:13.310> again

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:19.170 

and<00:04:16.639> we're<00:04:17.000> going<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.180> set<00:04:17.389> that<00:04:17.539> equal<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:18.079> 1

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
and we're going to set that equal to 1

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.909 
and we're going to set that equal to 1
so<00:04:19.780> in<00:04:19.930> this<00:04:20.019> case<00:04:20.229> we're<00:04:20.470> going<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.620> flip<00:04:20.829> it

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
so in this case we're going to flip it

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.830 
so in this case we're going to flip it
off<00:04:21.070> it's<00:04:21.310> going<00:04:21.459> to<00:04:21.549> go<00:04:21.639> to<00:04:21.699> know<00:04:22.030> it's<00:04:22.720> going

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
off it's going to go to know it's going

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.830 
off it's going to go to know it's going
to<00:04:22.930> change<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.259> Alpha<00:04:23.530> back<00:04:23.680> 2.5<00:04:24.280> and<00:04:24.580> then<00:04:25.120> by

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
to change the Alpha back 2.5 and then by

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.290 
to change the Alpha back 2.5 and then by
us<00:04:26.020> flipping<00:04:26.380> it<00:04:26.470> back<00:04:26.500> on<00:04:26.979> it<00:04:27.610> should<00:04:27.940> go<00:04:28.120> back

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
us flipping it back on it should go back

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.659 
us flipping it back on it should go back
to<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.720> enabled<00:04:29.380> stage<00:04:29.650> which<00:04:29.979> it's<00:04:30.400> going<00:04:30.520> to

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
to the enabled stage which it's going to

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.810 
to the enabled stage which it's going to
enlighten<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.270> segmented<00:04:32.020> controller<00:04:32.380> and

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
enlighten the segmented controller and

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.610 
enlighten the segmented controller and
also<00:04:33.820> bring<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.389> transparency<00:04:35.050> back<00:04:35.289> to<00:04:35.500> its

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
also bring the transparency back to its

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.890 
also bring the transparency back to its
full<00:04:35.860> state<00:04:36.280> so<00:04:37.030> go<00:04:37.150> ahead<00:04:37.210> and<00:04:37.300> run<00:04:37.449> that<00:04:37.509> for

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
full state so go ahead and run that for

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.390 
full state so go ahead and run that for
the<00:04:37.960> last<00:04:38.139> time<00:04:38.440> here<00:04:38.800> and<00:04:38.949> hopefully<00:04:39.100> we've

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
the last time here and hopefully we've

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.450 
the last time here and hopefully we've
got<00:04:39.669> a<00:04:39.699> killer<00:04:40.360> app<00:04:40.780> going<00:04:41.259> here<00:04:41.500> go<00:04:42.400> to

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
got a killer app going here go to
