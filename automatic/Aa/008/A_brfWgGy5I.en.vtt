I'd<00:04:16.359> recommend<00:04:16.810> probably<00:04:17.489> an<00:04:18.489> intermediate

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
I'd recommend probably an intermediate

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.819 
I'd recommend probably an intermediate
woman<00:04:19.389> rider<00:04:19.570> because<00:04:19.810> it<00:04:20.079> is<00:04:20.229> a<00:04:20.260> bigger<00:04:20.590> bike

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
woman rider because it is a bigger bike

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.700 
woman rider because it is a bigger bike
being<00:04:21.160> at<00:04:21.310> 6:50<00:04:21.880> and<00:04:22.120> it<00:04:22.419> is<00:04:22.539> heavy<00:04:22.750> at<00:04:22.930> 475

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
being at 6:50 and it is heavy at 475

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.140 
being at 6:50 and it is heavy at 475
pounds<00:04:24.130> that's<00:04:24.310> a<00:04:24.400> lot<00:04:24.550> of<00:04:24.580> weight<00:04:24.820> for<00:04:24.850> a

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
pounds that's a lot of weight for a

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.230 
pounds that's a lot of weight for a
female<00:04:25.510> to<00:04:25.720> manage<00:04:26.460> beginner<00:04:27.460> guys<00:04:27.700> for<00:04:28.060> sure

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
female to manage beginner guys for sure

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.390 
female to manage beginner guys for sure
absolutely<00:04:28.510> because<00:04:29.470> most<00:04:29.740> guys<00:04:29.950> are<00:04:30.250> in<00:04:30.370> it

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
absolutely because most guys are in it

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.159 
absolutely because most guys are in it
for<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:30.789> speed<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.450> they<00:04:31.570> really<00:04:31.870> want<00:04:32.080> to

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
for the speed and they really want to

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.440 
for the speed and they really want to
get<00:04:32.590> into<00:04:32.800> a<00:04:32.830> sport<00:04:33.220> bike<00:04:33.430> that<00:04:33.700> can<00:04:33.880> give<00:04:34.240> them

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
get into a sport bike that can give them

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.240 
get into a sport bike that can give them
and<00:04:34.690> I<00:04:34.780> think<00:04:34.840> this<00:04:35.200> bike<00:04:35.440> can<00:04:35.740> really<00:04:35.979> give

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
and I think this bike can really give

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.400 
and I think this bike can really give
them<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:37.120> growth<00:04:37.389> potential<00:04:37.840> of<00:04:38.200> getting

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
them the growth potential of getting

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.529 
them the growth potential of getting
comfortable<00:04:38.919> on<00:04:39.160> a<00:04:39.190> sport<00:04:39.610> bike<00:04:39.669> getting<00:04:40.300> used

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
comfortable on a sport bike getting used

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:42.150 
comfortable on a sport bike getting used
to<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:40.750> speed<00:04:40.960> and<00:04:41.200> gaining<00:04:41.680> something<00:04:42.010> from

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
to the speed and gaining something from

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.710 
to the speed and gaining something from
the<00:04:42.280> speed<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.700> knowledge<00:04:43.060> and<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.330> ability

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
the speed the knowledge and the ability

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.690 
the speed the knowledge and the ability
to<00:04:43.750> gain<00:04:44.020> something<00:04:44.380> in<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.650> cornering<00:04:45.130> so<00:04:45.669> I

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
to gain something in the cornering so I

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.550 
to gain something in the cornering so I
think<00:04:45.820> it's<00:04:46.120> very<00:04:46.389> adaptable<00:04:47.050> in<00:04:47.229> that<00:04:47.410> way

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
think it's very adaptable in that way

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.290 
think it's very adaptable in that way
it's<00:04:47.740> kind<00:04:48.010> of<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:48.550> thing<00:04:48.669> I<00:04:48.820> see<00:04:49.060> a<00:04:49.090> guy

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
it's kind of the thing I see a guy

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.270 
it's kind of the thing I see a guy
buying<00:04:49.660> when<00:04:49.930> he<00:04:50.050> first<00:04:50.289> starts<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:50.949> a<00:04:51.070> couple

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
buying when he first starts and a couple

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.520 
buying when he first starts and a couple
years<00:04:51.520> after<00:04:51.880> riding<00:04:52.120> he<00:04:52.930> gives<00:04:53.139> it<00:04:53.260> to<00:04:53.289> his

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
years after riding he gives it to his

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.589 
years after riding he gives it to his
girlfriend<00:04:53.710> who's<00:04:54.310> getting<00:04:55.240> ready<00:04:55.419> and

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
girlfriend who's getting ready and

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.089 
girlfriend who's getting ready and
getting<00:04:55.660> ready<00:04:56.020> to<00:04:56.110> start<00:04:56.470> and<00:04:56.650> he<00:04:56.740> jumps<00:04:57.070> to

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:57.099 
getting ready to start and he jumps to

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:58.620 
getting ready to start and he jumps to
something<00:04:57.550> new<00:04:57.699> so<00:04:57.970> I<00:04:58.000> think<00:04:58.120> it's<00:04:58.389> a<00:04:58.449> bike

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
something new so I think it's a bike

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.120 
something new so I think it's a bike
that<00:04:58.780> would<00:04:58.900> probably<00:04:59.080> last<00:04:59.500> somebody<00:04:59.770> at

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
that would probably last somebody at

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.570 
that would probably last somebody at
least<00:05:00.430> 3<00:05:00.669> to<00:05:00.760> 5<00:05:00.970> years<00:05:01.270> really<00:05:01.900> comfortable

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
least 3 to 5 years really comfortable

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.420 
least 3 to 5 years really comfortable
