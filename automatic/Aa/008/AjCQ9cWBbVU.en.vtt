00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
the way if I was microsoft that's the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.609 
the way if I was microsoft that's the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
way I would have worded it and I was

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.590 
way I would have worded it and I was
pretty<00:01:49.829> damn<00:01:49.979> sure<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:51.210> was<00:01:51.329> going<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.509> be

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
pretty damn sure that was going to be

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.690 
pretty damn sure that was going to be
upheld<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.740> talked<00:01:52.979> about<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.460> said<00:01:53.670> I

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
upheld and I talked about like I said I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.730 
upheld and I talked about like I said I
talked<00:01:53.970> about<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.390> video<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.659> said<00:01:54.960> it's

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
talked about in that video I said it's

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.709 
talked about in that video I said it's
probably<00:01:56.219> more<00:01:56.729> than<00:01:56.880> likely<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.479> that's<00:01:57.600> why

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
probably more than likely and that's why

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.090 
probably more than likely and that's why
they<00:01:57.869> had<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.020> work<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.409> out<00:01:58.500> through<00:01:58.770> legal

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
they had to work it out through legal

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.590 
they had to work it out through legal
they<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.579> know<00:01:59.610> I'm<00:01:59.790> sure<00:02:00.030> they<00:02:00.210> were<00:02:00.270> trying

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
they you know I'm sure they were trying

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.420 
they you know I'm sure they were trying
I'm<00:02:01.049> sure<00:02:01.530> they<00:02:01.680> were<00:02:01.770> trying<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.070> get<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.340> out

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
I'm sure they were trying to get it out

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.730 
I'm sure they were trying to get it out
for<00:02:02.610> everybody<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.270> that's<00:02:03.810> why<00:02:04.020> maybe<00:02:04.380> it

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
for everybody and that's why maybe it

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.190 
for everybody and that's why maybe it
took<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.340> long<00:02:05.369> for<00:02:05.579> him<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.850> get<00:02:06.000> back<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:06.780> a

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
took so long for him to get back for a

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.100 
took so long for him to get back for a
actually<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.190> via<00:02:08.670> Mark<00:02:08.970> Rubin<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.929> get

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
actually this is via Mark Rubin to get

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.589 
actually this is via Mark Rubin to get
back<00:02:10.349> because<00:02:10.950> they<00:02:11.250> were<00:02:11.310> probably<00:02:12.090> trying

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
back because they were probably trying

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.880 
back because they were probably trying
to<00:02:12.720> see<00:02:12.989> if<00:02:13.140> they<00:02:13.290> could<00:02:13.349> get<00:02:13.590> it

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
to see if they could get it

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.830 
to see if they could get it
everybody<00:02:14.250> that's<00:02:14.970> my<00:02:15.240> that's<00:02:15.660> the
