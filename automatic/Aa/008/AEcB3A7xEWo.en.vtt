he wants to stay in for some stupid

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.200 
he wants to stay in for some stupid
reason<00:00:54.710> but<00:00:55.710> he<00:00:55.920> goes<00:00:56.070> out<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.309> politoed<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.000> see

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
reason but he goes out to politoed I see

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.869 
reason but he goes out to politoed I see
no<00:00:57.360> leftovers<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.920> kind<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.520> would<00:00:59.760> have

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
no leftovers and that kind of would have

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.580 
no leftovers and that kind of would have
done<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> little<00:01:00.420> bit<00:01:00.629> more<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:00.989> he<00:01:01.079> was<00:01:01.260> scarf

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
done a little bit more if he was scarf

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.619

sport<00:01:41.880> since<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:43.110> don't<00:01:43.409> think<00:01:43.560> he's<00:01:43.649> gonna

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
sport since I don't think he's gonna

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.190 
sport since I don't think he's gonna
want<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.159> go<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.399> focus<00:01:44.790> punch<00:01:45.030> or<00:01:45.390> substitute

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
want to go for focus punch or substitute

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.190 
want to go for focus punch or substitute
since<00:01:46.860> it's<00:01:47.040> pretty<00:01:47.250> much<00:01:47.430> pointless<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.200> yet

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
since it's pretty much pointless and yet

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.590 
since it's pretty much pointless and yet
to<00:01:49.920> run<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.100> target<00:01:50.520> gets<00:01:51.030> rid<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.360> rain

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
to run a target gets rid of the rain

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.690 
to run a target gets rid of the rain
brings<00:01:51.899> up<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.200> sand<00:01:52.500> now<00:01:53.159> I'm<00:01:53.250> gonna<00:01:53.340> go<00:01:53.520> into

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
brings up the sand now I'm gonna go into

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.539 
brings up the sand now I'm gonna go into
reuniclus<00:01:54.030> again<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:55.100> Bullet<00:01:56.100> Seed<00:01:56.280> does<00:01:56.520> a

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
reuniclus again and Bullet Seed does a

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.730 
reuniclus again and Bullet Seed does a
 shitload<00:01:57.299> after<00:01:57.869> five<00:01:58.079> hits<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.590> does

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
 shitload after five hits it does

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.310 
 shitload after five hits it does
like<00:01:59.240> forty-nine<00:02:00.240> percent<00:02:00.630> or<00:02:01.020> something

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
like forty-nine percent or something

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.709 
like forty-nine percent or something
like<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.860> I'm<00:02:02.790> sitting<00:02:03.149> here<00:02:03.180> at<00:02:03.509> like

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
like that and I'm sitting here at like

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.600 
like that and I'm sitting here at like
30<00:02:04.020> something<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.680> thought<00:02:04.920> reuniclus<00:02:05.340> is

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
30 something so I thought reuniclus is

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.370 
30 something so I thought reuniclus is
we're<00:02:05.700> gonna<00:02:05.820> be<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> guy

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
we're gonna be a guy

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.800 
we're gonna be a guy
her<00:02:06.439> but<00:02:07.189> he<00:02:07.340> makes<00:02:07.549> a<00:02:07.729> pretty<00:02:07.939> weird<00:02:08.209> move<00:02:08.509> and

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
her but he makes a pretty weird move and

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.170 
her but he makes a pretty weird move and
switches<00:02:09.319> out<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:09.800> guess<00:02:10.429> maybe<00:02:10.700> he<00:02:10.910> didn't

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
switches out I guess maybe he didn't

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.970 
switches out I guess maybe he didn't

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.099 
a bad move here and I go into I go into
terrakion<00:03:22.480> think<00:03:23.480> you<00:03:23.569> got<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:23.810> be<00:03:23.870> able<00:03:23.959> to

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
terrakion think you got to be able to

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.890 
terrakion think you got to be able to
win<00:03:24.200> it<00:03:24.380> KO<00:03:24.739> with<00:03:25.010> close<00:03:25.220> combat<00:03:25.870> but<00:03:26.870> I

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
win it KO with close combat but I

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.500 
win it KO with close combat but I
probably<00:03:27.290> wasn't<00:03:27.620> cuz<00:03:28.010> I'm<00:03:28.190> not<00:03:28.340> banded<00:03:28.790> so<00:03:29.420> he

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
probably wasn't cuz I'm not banded so he

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.789 
probably wasn't cuz I'm not banded so he
goes<00:03:29.720> to<00:03:29.780> star<00:03:30.109> me<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.319> take<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.680> obvious

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
goes to star me to take the obvious

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.160 
goes to star me to take the obvious
close<00:03:31.250> combat<00:03:31.519> I'm<00:03:32.389> gonna<00:03:32.540> get<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.989> out

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
close combat I'm gonna get the out

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.539 
close combat I'm gonna get the out
of<00:03:33.200> there<00:03:33.410> cuz<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:33.650> don't<00:03:33.709> want<00:03:33.950> to<00:03:34.010> take<00:03:34.160> a<00:03:34.190> surf

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
of there cuz I don't want to take a surf

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.009 
of there cuz I don't want to take a surf
and<00:03:34.959> am<00:03:35.959> I<00:03:36.079> going<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.380> reuniclus<00:03:36.889> now<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:38.180> take

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
and am I going to reuniclus now and take

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.309 
and am I going to reuniclus now and take
a<00:03:39.049> surf<00:03:39.380> rather<00:03:40.190> well<00:03:40.670> so<00:03:41.209> at<00:03:41.510> this<00:03:41.569> point<00:03:41.989> I

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
a surf rather well so at this point I

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.080 
a surf rather well so at this point I
thought<00:03:42.920> I<00:03:42.950> could<00:03:43.220> just<00:03:43.400> set<00:03:43.549> up<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:43.850> sweep

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
thought I could just set up and sweep

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.449 
thought I could just set up and sweep
cuz<00:03:44.780> reuniclus<00:03:45.170> is<00:03:45.440> kind<00:03:45.680> of<00:03:45.769> being<00:03:45.859> a<00:03:46.069> problem

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
cuz reuniclus is kind of being a problem

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.090 
cuz reuniclus is kind of being a problem
to<00:03:46.730> him<00:03:46.910> but<00:03:47.720> I<00:03:48.019> forgot<00:03:48.440> that<00:03:48.500> he<00:03:48.739> still<00:03:48.950> had

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
to him but I forgot that he still had

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.220 
to him but I forgot that he still had
volcarona<00:03:49.459> so<00:03:50.450> that's<00:03:50.690> not<00:03:50.870> gonna<00:03:51.019> be<00:03:51.200> very

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
volcarona so that's not gonna be very

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.890 
volcarona so that's not gonna be very
good<00:03:51.500> at<00:03:51.799> all<00:03:51.829> since<00:03:52.730> he<00:03:52.910> could<00:03:53.030> just<00:03:53.269> beat<00:03:53.870> me

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
good at all since he could just beat me

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.940 
good at all since he could just beat me
eventually<00:03:54.440> with<00:03:54.889> quiver<00:03:55.130> dance<00:03:55.400> but<00:03:56.329> I<00:03:56.950> go

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
eventually with quiver dance but I go

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.590 
eventually with quiver dance but I go
over<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.220> psychic<00:03:58.639> just<00:03:58.910> to<00:03:59.060> see<00:03:59.239> how<00:03:59.389> much

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
over the psychic just to see how much

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.479 
over the psychic just to see how much
it'll<00:03:59.780> do<00:04:00.019> kind<00:04:00.709> of<00:04:00.799> wish<00:04:00.889> I<00:04:01.069> would<00:04:01.220> have<00:04:01.250> got<00:04:01.459> a
