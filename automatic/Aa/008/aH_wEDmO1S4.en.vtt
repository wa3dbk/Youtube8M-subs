keeps you long enough that the only way

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.889 
keeps you long enough that the only way
to<00:00:32.579> get<00:00:32.759> out<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.210> have<00:00:33.420> at<00:00:33.570> least<00:00:33.600> two

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
to get out of it is to have at least two

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.720 
to get out of it is to have at least two
bars<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.290> key<00:00:34.440> stamina<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.460> vanish

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
bars of key stamina so you can vanish

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.380 
bars of key stamina so you can vanish
but<00:00:36.600> um<00:00:36.780> when<00:00:37.290> they're<00:00:37.440> flying<00:00:37.680> around<00:00:37.860> and

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
but um when they're flying around and

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.010 
but um when they're flying around and
playing<00:00:39.390> keep-away

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
playing keep-away

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.990 
playing keep-away
all<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.860> got<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.010> do<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.340> just<00:00:41.489> jump<00:00:41.640> vanish

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
all you got to do is just jump vanish

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.610 
all you got to do is just jump vanish
through<00:00:42.180> them<00:00:43.489> and<00:00:44.960> then<00:00:45.960> if<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.289> get<00:00:46.440> caught

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
through them and then if you get caught

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.139 
through them and then if you get caught
just<00:00:46.829> escape<00:00:47.399> run<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:52.350> that's<00:00:52.530> basically<00:00:52.920> it

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
just escape run so that's basically it

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.100 
just escape run so that's basically it
you<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.300> want<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.510> make<00:00:54.660> sure<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.899> jump

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
you just want to make sure you jump

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.529 
you just want to make sure you jump
vanish<00:00:55.410> through<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.180> it<00:00:57.180> will<00:00:57.270> deflect

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
vanish through the and it will deflect

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.670 
vanish through the and it will deflect
them<00:00:57.719> it'll<00:00:57.899> deflect<00:00:58.260> them<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.530> they'll

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
them it'll deflect them and they'll

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.049 
them it'll deflect them and they'll
pretty<00:00:59.039> much<00:00:59.129> lose<00:00:59.430> their<00:00:59.609> tracking<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.059> you

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
pretty much lose their tracking on you

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.960 
pretty much lose their tracking on you
and<00:01:03.920> then<00:01:04.920> if<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.129> get<00:01:05.250> caught<00:01:05.430> if<00:01:05.640> they<00:01:05.760> rush

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
and then if you get caught if they rush

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.429 
and then if you get caught if they rush
in<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.420> make<00:01:06.540> sure<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.750> press<00:01:06.930> X<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.290> you'll

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
in just make sure you press X and you'll

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.359 
in just make sure you press X and you'll
vanish<00:01:07.560> out<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:10.010> alright<00:01:11.010> shoot<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> few

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
also indiscriminately jump vanishing

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.539 
also indiscriminately jump vanishing
will<00:01:53.240> not<00:01:53.570> get<00:01:53.899> you<00:01:54.140> into<00:01:54.470> where<00:01:55.220> you<00:01:55.310> need<00:01:55.460> to

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.610 

although<00:02:16.060> it's<00:02:16.990> working<00:02:17.260> out<00:02:17.320> pretty<00:02:17.500> well

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
although it's working out pretty well

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.810 
although it's working out pretty well
for<00:02:17.740> me<00:02:17.890> right<00:02:18.100> now<00:02:18.130> maybe<00:02:18.430> I<00:02:18.520> was<00:02:18.640> wrong<00:02:18.760> about

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
for me right now maybe I was wrong about
