 Before, I already had a little bit of 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.610
 practice the first thing you have 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.530
 to do before you even buy paper 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.260
 the media wall the size of your 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.379
 wall this wall which plays a role 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.239
 It's four meters wide and 60 meters wide 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.370

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.170
 corridor then the total paper size 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.710
 I put that wall up and 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.049

 40 in total 166 rosso to fill 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.549
 all that wall there on the site already has all 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.170
 the explanations for you to measure 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.240
 your wall know how many goals you 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.040
 need to buy and after you 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.990
 bought the wallpaper on the day of the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.180
 application is interesting you first 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.009
 step at most across the wall to 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.200
 take any little thing into the role of 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.119
 example paste more easily the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.100
 interesting on these wallpapers is 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.259
 that they are stickers then it's as if 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.119
 If you were a contact paper then you 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.180
 dirt other than those of 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.759
 start wall you need to stick glue and 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.950
 make sure you do not need super practical without 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.439
 dirt is fast if the appliance 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.810
 very regular surface 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.180
 polka dots on the wall is cool the first 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.369
 You suck like those garbage sheets. 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.470
 stationery and first garbage dump 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.960
 wall to leave it in resin as 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.360
 The more you look, the better you look. 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.340
 the wallpaper, and then the 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.890
 applying area as wallpaper 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.840
 the super easy application level is super 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.360
 quick also you do not have to wait 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.640
 Nothing to dry at the same time, it's ready. 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.830
 here in my downstairs room he has a 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.930
 gypsum structure then in a 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.940
 structure and the wall has 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.010
 where I started to put the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.620
 wallpaper then I first released 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.870
 15 10 centimeters of wallpaper and 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.879
 I picked up a very good grip and then 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.459
 super easy is only you solved the role 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.500
 sticker coconuts and necklace is interesting 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.930
 Do you work with several small ones then? 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.970
 You turn on the snow, it's fine. 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.280
 will prevent you from speaking wrong then 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.500
 You in bubbles in your wallpaper 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.720
 another interesting thing you work 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.640
 is with a spatula or while a 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.860
 ruler even those rule of 30 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.170
 centimeters because it will make 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.170
 application is interesting if you use the 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.510
 ruler or space you have people had a 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.579
 wallpaper so it does not 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.860
 to rip if you accidentally put 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.049
 wall and see what became a bubble then 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.879
 half a pie is only you to enjoy well 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.280
 slowly will not rip the paper 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.440
 It's only for you to study with enough 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.359
 be careful if you put the wallpaper 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.970
 over some regular surface 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.280
 some inkball that has been left 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.859
 on the wall does not make any pressure with 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.560
 easy rules because it can rip your 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.959
 the ideal wallpaper even if you sanding 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.329
 so that the wall is all neighbors if 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.410
 there is a switch or plug in the 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.480
 your wall 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.280
 you talk normally and with the help of 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.560
 stylus that strips the edges of the 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.200
 switch that gets a finish 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.819
 perfect very cute for you 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.799
 you have to do this carefully and with 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.690
 calm not to rip wallpaper 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.880
 is the same thing when you just 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.069
 the full wallpaper on the wheel and 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.739
 apply the flower on the wall and with 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.959
 stiletto quotas works neither to stay 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.580
 another sheet of wallpaper is 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.890
 interesting you try to get married 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.900
 so first you have people to glue 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.030
 ceiling and then with the help of some 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.910
 person then yourself to see if that 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.980
 wallpaper will go down right 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.470
 There are not going to be any missing rooms. 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.230
 apartments or houses have 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.790
 well-regular well-bred relatives 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.890
 so this can give a little more 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.110
 work but nothing that makes it impossible to 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.420
 application to the submissions the 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.910
 wallpaper the stylus you have 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.980
 that using that you have kind does not 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.990
 force in this letti without pressure because 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.910
 otherwise you can remove the plaster from the wall 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.640
 and after about a couple of 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.010
 hours I completed the whole wall was not 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.750
 a difficult process I had not so much 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.940
 Like I said, I already had the role 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.860
 wall in other rooms here at home 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.080
 and looking at the walls themselves is that he 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.910
 is not a child of more thickens May 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.590
 so there's no danger of ripping if you 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.090
 you can take away without any 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.880
 problem of course you will be 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.070
 careful and still to paste 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.020
 new if you want and do not see the role of 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.360
 The whole wall is also super easy and 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.760
