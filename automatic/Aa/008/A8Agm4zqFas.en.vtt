foundation<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:15.360> general<00:00:15.750> because<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.080> just

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
foundation in general because of just

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.349 
foundation in general because of just
how<00:00:16.920> easy<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.670> use<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.119> think<00:00:18.150> the

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
how easy it is to use I think the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.029 
how easy it is to use I think the
foundation<00:00:18.600> like<00:00:19.439> once<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.710> find<00:00:19.920> your

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
foundation like once you find your

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.400 
foundation like once you find your
number<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:21.119> can<00:00:21.300> use<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.570> foundation<00:00:21.930> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
number you can use the foundation the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.990 
number you can use the foundation the
powder<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.100> even<00:00:23.340> think<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.580> can<00:00:23.760> see

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
powder and even think this can see

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.730 
powder and even think this can see
lifting<00:00:24.390> it's<00:00:24.539> pretty<00:00:24.750> good<00:00:24.930> for<00:00:25.170> summer<00:00:25.470> if

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
lifting it's pretty good for summer if

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.920 
lifting it's pretty good for summer if
it's<00:00:25.890> supposed<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.400> be<00:00:26.550> shine<00:00:26.849> free<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.810> that's

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
it's supposed to be shine free so that's

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.230 
it's supposed to be shine free so that's
why<00:00:28.170> I'm<00:00:28.230> giving<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.650> try<00:00:29.060> trying<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.119> take

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
why I'm giving it a try trying to take

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.150 
why I'm giving it a try trying to take
the<00:00:30.359> sticker<00:00:30.660> off<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.650> how<00:00:31.800> much<00:00:31.980> it

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the sticker off this is how much it

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.799 
the sticker off this is how much it
rolls<00:00:32.369> up<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.850> do<00:00:33.030> get<00:00:33.239> quite<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.540> bit<00:00:33.719> of

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
rolls up so you do get quite a bit of

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.420 
rolls up so you do get quite a bit of
product<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.350> there<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.829> comes<00:00:35.010> with<00:00:35.219> a

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
product in there and it comes with a

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.990 
product in there and it comes with a
little<00:00:35.880> gel<00:00:37.160> inside<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> middle<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.969> a

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
little gel inside like the middle is a

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.040 
little gel inside like the middle is a
gel<00:00:39.829> anti-shine<00:00:41.270> cream<00:00:42.270> I'm<00:00:42.480> guessing<00:00:42.870> that's

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
gel anti-shine cream I'm guessing that's

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.229 
gel anti-shine cream I'm guessing that's
what<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.800> far<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.309> says<00:00:44.520> anti-shine

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
what it is so far it says anti-shine

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.690 
what it is so far it says anti-shine
core<00:00:45.690> I'm<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.530> gonna<00:00:46.620> go<00:00:46.829> ahead<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.399> apply

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
core I'm just gonna go ahead and apply

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.119 
core I'm just gonna go ahead and apply
it<00:00:48.059> right<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:49.020> skin<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:50.030> then<00:00:51.320> it<00:00:52.320> says<00:00:52.890> to

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
it right on the skin and then it says to

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.660 
it right on the skin and then it says to
use<00:00:53.280> your<00:00:53.460> fingers<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:55.190> might<00:00:56.190> use<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> brush

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
use your fingers but I might use a brush

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.939 
use your fingers but I might use a brush
just<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> little<00:00:58.109> bit<00:00:58.230> more<00:00:58.760> cleanly<00:01:00.949> it

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
just to be a little bit more cleanly it

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.289 
just to be a little bit more cleanly it
actually<00:01:02.340> glides<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.300> really<00:01:03.329> smooth<00:01:05.299> I'm

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
actually glides on really smooth I'm

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.580 
actually glides on really smooth I'm
gonna<00:01:06.570> use<00:01:06.900> my<00:01:07.320> cover<00:01:08.010> FX<00:01:08.900> 160<00:01:09.900> brush<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.380> just

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
gonna use my cover FX 160 brush to just

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.230 
gonna use my cover FX 160 brush to just
blend<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.010> out<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:16.520> for<00:01:17.520> when<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.670> first<00:01:17.939> put<00:01:18.150> it

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
blend it out so for when I first put it

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.780 
blend it out so for when I first put it
on<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:18.600> really<00:01:18.900> quite<00:01:19.380> creamy<00:01:19.890> but<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.369> does

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
on it's really quite creamy but it does

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.820 
on it's really quite creamy but it does
I<00:01:21.150> guess<00:01:21.600> that's<00:01:21.810> what<00:01:21.960> makes<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.290> blend<00:01:22.590> out

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
I guess that's what makes it blend out

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.030 
I guess that's what makes it blend out
really<00:01:23.100> well<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.820> kind<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.900> feels<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.650> little

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
really well it kind of feels a little

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.160 
really well it kind of feels a little
like<00:01:26.580> if<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.850> guys<00:01:26.970> were<00:01:27.150> might<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.630> put<00:01:27.810> where

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
like if you guys were might to put where

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.840 
like if you guys were might to put where
to<00:01:28.259> put<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.009> might<00:01:29.310> find<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.700> it

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
to put this on you might find that it

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.359 
to put this on you might find that it
feels<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.090> little<00:01:30.360> bit<00:01:30.479> oily<00:01:30.840> or<00:01:31.020> greasy<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
feels a little bit oily or greasy on the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.469 
feels a little bit oily or greasy on the
skin<00:01:32.700> at<00:01:32.939> first<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.840> really<00:01:34.409> sheer<00:01:35.479> a

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
skin at first it is a really sheer a

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.660 
skin at first it is a really sheer a
really<00:01:37.200> sheer<00:01:37.439> coverage<00:01:37.890> which<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.369> actually

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
really sheer coverage which I actually

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.310 
really sheer coverage which I actually
wasn't<00:01:39.030> surprising<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.720> thought<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.020> might<00:01:40.140> be

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
wasn't surprising I thought it might be

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.810 
wasn't surprising I thought it might be
a<00:01:40.350> little<00:01:40.770> bit<00:01:40.920> more<00:01:41.130> coverage<00:01:42.030> but<00:01:42.799> I'm<00:01:43.820> going

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
a little bit more coverage but I'm going

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.340 
a little bit more coverage but I'm going
to<00:01:45.140> do<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.350> side<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.710> my<00:01:46.799> face<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:48.290> I<00:01:49.290> think

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
to do this side of my face and I think

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.679 
to do this side of my face and I think
the<00:01:49.710> color<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.369> pretty<00:01:50.850> good<00:01:51.060> match<00:01:51.240> for<00:01:51.509> my

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
the color is a pretty good match for my

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.469 
the color is a pretty good match for my
skin<00:01:51.750> right<00:01:52.500> now<00:01:52.860> but<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.579> was<00:01:53.850> kind<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.360> a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
skin right now but that was kind of a

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.399 
skin right now but that was kind of a
hard<00:01:54.689> thing<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.930> decide<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.649> stores<00:01:56.100> because

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
hard thing to decide in stores because

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.749 
hard thing to decide in stores because
you<00:01:58.409> know<00:01:58.530> it's<00:01:58.740> drugstores<00:01:59.219> there's<00:01:59.399> not<00:01:59.549> too

you know it's drugstores there's not too

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.490

don't feel it as greasy as before oily I

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.760 
don't feel it as greasy as before oily I

going<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.979> put<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.160> little

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
going to put a little

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.050 
going to put a little
more<00:02:11.790> on<00:02:12.030> my<00:02:12.180> cheeks<00:02:12.510> just<00:02:12.930> because<00:02:14.060> that's

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
more on my cheeks just because that's

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.550 
more on my cheeks just because that's
where<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.330> find<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:15.990> always<00:02:16.200> need<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.500> little

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
where I find that I always need a little

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.080 
where I find that I always need a little
bit<00:02:16.800> more<00:02:16.980> coverage<00:02:17.220> just<00:02:17.580> because<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:17.880> have

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
bit more coverage just because I have

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.300 
bit more coverage just because I have
freckles<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.780> then<00:02:19.320> when<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.740> foundation

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
freckles and then when the foundation

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.580 
freckles and then when the foundation
and<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.550> blush<00:02:20.790> wears<00:02:21.210> away<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.900> gets<00:02:22.020> blotchy

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
and the blush wears away it gets blotchy

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.970 
and the blush wears away it gets blotchy
I<00:02:22.740> definitely<00:02:23.310> like<00:02:23.850> how<00:02:24.090> much<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:25.800> got

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980

rid of my redness it kind of took that
all<00:02:27.750> down<00:02:27.990> but<00:02:28.710> that's<00:02:28.830> kind<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.190> just<00:02:29.370> like

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
all down but that's kind of just like

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.730 
all down but that's kind of just like
any<00:02:29.760> foundation<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:30.900> we're<00:02:31.230> gonna<00:02:31.320> see<00:02:31.560> how

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
any foundation so we're gonna see how

any foundation so we're gonna see how
well<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.130> where<00:02:32.310> nice<00:02:32.640> feel<00:02:33.080> really<00:02:34.080> kind<00:02:34.440> of

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
well it where nice feel really kind of

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.070 
well it where nice feel really kind of
slippery<00:02:35.190> almost<00:02:35.550> right<00:02:35.730> now<00:02:35.910> so<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:36.840> don't

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
slippery almost right now so I don't

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.210 
slippery almost right now so I don't
know<00:02:37.290> if<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.530> needs<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.770> couple<00:02:37.950> more<00:02:38.070> minutes

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
know if it needs a couple more minutes

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.330 
know if it needs a couple more minutes
to<00:02:38.460> sink<00:02:38.760> into<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.180> skin<00:02:39.480> or<00:02:39.810> if<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.590> really

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
to sink into the skin or if I really

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.240 
to sink into the skin or if I really
should<00:02:41.610> powder<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.150> but<00:02:42.860> I'm<00:02:43.860> gonna<00:02:43.950> do<00:02:44.160> the

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
should powder it but I'm gonna do the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.370 
should powder it but I'm gonna do the
rest<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.520> makeup<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.840> will<00:02:46.110> keep<00:02:46.260> you

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
posted so I just finished my hair and

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.040 
posted so I just finished my hair and
makeup<00:02:49.040> I<00:02:50.040> do<00:02:51.030> feel<00:02:51.330> like<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.600> makeup<00:02:51.780> has

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
makeup I do feel like the makeup has

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.080 
makeup I do feel like the makeup has
definitely<00:02:52.530> set<00:02:52.740> in<00:02:52.890> it's<00:02:53.070> not<00:02:53.220> as<00:02:53.460> creamy<00:02:53.820> so

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
definitely set in it's not as creamy so

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.520 
definitely set in it's not as creamy so
maybe<00:02:54.270> it<00:02:54.420> just<00:02:54.450> does<00:02:54.750> take<00:02:54.990> a<00:02:55.020> couple<00:02:55.320> minutes

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
maybe it just does take a couple minutes

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.850 
maybe it just does take a couple minutes
and<00:02:56.150> naturally<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.180> did<00:02:57.630> set<00:02:57.990> my<00:02:58.170> cheeks<00:02:58.590> with

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
and naturally I did set my cheeks with

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.680 
and naturally I did set my cheeks with
my<00:02:59.130> bronzer<00:02:59.760> and<00:02:59.910> my<00:03:00.030> blush<00:03:00.300> because<00:03:00.570> that

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
my bronzer and my blush because that

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.210 
my bronzer and my blush because that
happens<00:03:01.080> when<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.350> put<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.590> on<00:03:01.680> but

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
happens when you put it on but

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.280

actually<00:03:47.970> just<00:03:48.450> see<00:03:48.780> exactly<00:03:49.140> where<00:03:50.130> it<00:03:50.520> is

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
actually just see exactly where it is

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.210 
actually just see exactly where it is
and<00:03:51.360> I<00:03:51.780> didn't<00:03:52.200> touch<00:03:52.320> up<00:03:52.530> my<00:03:52.590> face<00:03:52.920> throughout

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
and I didn't touch up my face throughout

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.960 
and I didn't touch up my face throughout
the<00:03:53.400> day<00:03:53.580> I<00:03:53.880> wanted<00:03:54.510> this<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.840> be<00:03:54.870> like<00:03:55.970> pretty

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
the day I wanted this to be like pretty

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.449 
the day I wanted this to be like pretty
true<00:03:57.330> to<00:03:57.450> how<00:03:57.570> it<00:03:57.750> actually<00:03:58.230> was<00:03:58.470> if<00:03:58.860> I<00:03:59.010> were<00:03:59.160> to

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
true to how it actually was if I were to

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.370 
true to how it actually was if I were to
just<00:03:59.670> you<00:04:00.150> know<00:04:00.180> try<00:04:00.630> foundation<00:04:01.140> for<00:04:01.320> the

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
just you know try foundation for the

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.120 
just you know try foundation for the
first<00:04:01.560> time<00:04:01.770> which<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.100> did<00:04:02.310> so<00:04:02.840> maybe<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:04.290> should

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
first time which I did so maybe I should

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.460 
first time which I did so maybe I should
have<00:04:05.250> set<00:04:05.610> it<00:04:05.760> with<00:04:06.090> a<00:04:06.120> powder<00:04:06.240> after<00:04:07.050> I<00:04:07.080> did

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
have set it with a powder after I did

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.949 
have set it with a powder after I did
the<00:04:07.620> application<00:04:08.390> like<00:04:09.390> I<00:04:09.540> normally<00:04:09.600> would

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
the application like I normally would

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.470 
the application like I normally would
but<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.440> be<00:04:10.560> honest<00:04:13.070> even<00:04:14.070> if<00:04:14.220> I<00:04:14.370> were<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:14.730> upset

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
but to be honest even if I were to upset

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.120 
but to be honest even if I were to upset
it<00:04:15.510> I<00:04:15.780> just<00:04:16.169> don't<00:04:16.470> think<00:04:16.770> that<00:04:16.830> this<00:04:17.070> is

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
it I just don't think that this is

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.349 
it I just don't think that this is
normal<00:04:17.669> like<00:04:18.150> foundation<00:04:18.750> normally<00:04:19.140> do

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
normal like foundation normally do

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.719
