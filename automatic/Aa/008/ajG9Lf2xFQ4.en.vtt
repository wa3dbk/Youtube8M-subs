welcome<00:00:01.319> to<00:00:01.469> a<00:00:01.500> lesson<00:00:01.680> on<00:00:01.949> place<00:00:02.250> value<00:00:02.700> and

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
welcome to a lesson on place value and

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.579 
welcome to a lesson on place value and
whole<00:00:03.090> numbers<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.659> goals<00:00:04.200> of<00:00:04.319> this<00:00:04.440> video

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
whole numbers the goals of this video

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.769 
whole numbers the goals of this video
are<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:04.890> define<00:00:05.250> counting<00:00:06.000> numbers<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.569> whole

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
are to define counting numbers and whole

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.110 
are to define counting numbers and whole
numbers<00:00:07.099> determine<00:00:08.099> place<00:00:08.400> value<00:00:08.790> of<00:00:08.849> whole

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
numbers determine place value of whole

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.270 
numbers determine place value of whole
numbers<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.690> then<00:00:10.230> write<00:00:10.469> whole<00:00:10.740> numbers<00:00:11.070> in

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
numbers and then write whole numbers in

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.959 
numbers and then write whole numbers in
expanded<00:00:11.550> form<00:00:12.500> in<00:00:13.759> mathematics<00:00:14.759> there<00:00:14.940> are

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
expanded form in mathematics there are

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.500 
expanded form in mathematics there are
different<00:00:15.360> types<00:00:15.630> or<00:00:15.929> sets<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.500> numbers<00:00:17.510> the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
different types or sets of numbers the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.120 
different types or sets of numbers the
counting<00:00:18.930> numbers<00:00:19.230> sometimes<00:00:19.590> called

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
counting numbers sometimes called

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.220 
counting numbers sometimes called
natural<00:00:20.550> numbers<00:00:20.850> are<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.810> set<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.020> numbers

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
natural numbers are the set of numbers

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.529 
natural numbers are the set of numbers
as<00:00:22.560> we<00:00:22.710> see<00:00:22.949> here<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:24.090> can<00:00:24.240> see<00:00:24.390> why

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
as we see here and you can see why

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.700 
as we see here and you can see why
they're<00:00:24.720> often<00:00:25.019> called<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.350> counting

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
they're often called the counting

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.710 
they're often called the counting
numbers<00:00:26.010> 1<00:00:26.939> 2<00:00:27.480> 3<00:00:28.019> 4<00:00:28.619> 5<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.760> would<00:00:30.480> be<00:00:30.599> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
numbers 1 2 3 4 5 and so on would be the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.920 
numbers 1 2 3 4 5 and so on would be the
numbers<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.199> use<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.590> count<00:00:31.800> items<00:00:32.690> now<00:00:33.690> whole

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
numbers we use to count items now whole

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.229 
numbers we use to count items now whole
numbers<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:35.460> set<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.760> counting<00:00:36.090> numbers

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
numbers of the set of counting numbers

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.200 
numbers of the set of counting numbers
and<00:00:36.630> 0<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:38.190> whole<00:00:38.399> numbers<00:00:38.760> are<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.180> numbers

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
and 0 so whole numbers are the numbers

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.750 
and 0 so whole numbers are the numbers
in<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.230> set<00:00:40.440> as<00:00:40.590> we<00:00:40.710> see<00:00:40.950> here<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.489> again<00:00:41.640> the

in the set as we see here and again the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.180 
in the set as we see here and again the
only<00:00:41.879> difference<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.510> whole<00:00:43.230> numbers<00:00:43.620> include

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
only difference is whole numbers include

consider larger and larger counting or
whole<00:00:53.039> numbers<00:00:53.399> we<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.270> introduce<00:00:54.420> place

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
whole numbers we have to introduce place

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.049 
whole numbers we have to introduce place
value<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:56.010> distinguish<00:00:56.489> between<00:00:56.640> different

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
value to distinguish between different

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.360 
value to distinguish between different
quantities<00:00:57.750> for<00:00:58.739> example<00:00:59.100> if<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.250> were

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
quantities for example if we were

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.430 
quantities for example if we were
counting<00:00:59.850> these<00:01:00.000> items<00:01:00.510> or<00:01:00.719> each<00:01:00.870> square<00:01:01.230> was

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
counting these items or each square was

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.759 
counting these items or each square was
1<00:01:01.770> we'd<00:01:02.699> have<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.879> total<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.239> 5<00:01:03.600> or<00:01:03.960> 5<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
1 we'd have a total of 5 or 5 in the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.160 
1 we'd have a total of 5 or 5 in the
ones<00:01:04.979> place<00:01:05.250> value<00:01:05.600> which<00:01:06.600> gives<00:01:06.869> us<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
ones place value which gives us the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.500 
ones place value which gives us the
number<00:01:07.290> 5<00:01:07.880> however<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.030> want<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.180> count<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
number 5 however if we want to count the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.899 
number 5 however if we want to count the
total<00:01:09.600> number<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.900> items<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.610> we<00:01:11.610> actually

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
total number of items here we actually

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.690 
total number of items here we actually
start<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.240> group<00:01:12.420> them<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.930> tens<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:14.520> we'd<00:01:14.670> have

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
start to group them in tens so we'd have

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.070 
start to group them in tens so we'd have
a<00:01:15.119> total<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.810> 3<00:01:16.680> groups<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.189> 10<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:18.780> we'd<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.049> a

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
a total of 3 groups of 10 so we'd have a

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.530 
a total of 3 groups of 10 so we'd have a
3<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.830> tens<00:01:20.220> column<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.759> represent<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> 30

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
3 in the tens column to represent the 30

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.840 
3 in the tens column to represent the 30
and<00:01:21.869> then<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> 2<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.100> ones<00:01:23.340> column<00:01:23.490> to

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
and then a 2 in the ones column to

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.090 
and then a 2 in the ones column to
represent<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.630> remaining<00:01:25.020> 2<00:01:25.170> items<00:01:25.530> to

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
represent the remaining 2 items to

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.640 
represent the remaining 2 items to
represent<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> number<00:01:26.729> 32<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.630> 3<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.380> tens

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
represent the number 32 a 3 in the tens

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.789 
represent the number 32 a 3 in the tens
column<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.549> 2<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> ones<00:01:30.240> column<00:01:30.710> now<00:01:31.710> if

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
column and a 2 in the ones column now if

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.200 
column and a 2 in the ones column now if
we<00:01:31.860> want<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.159> count<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.549> number<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.820> items<00:01:32.909> we

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
we want to count the number of items we

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.260 
we want to count the number of items we
see<00:01:33.479> here<00:01:34.020> once<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.680> counted<00:01:35.070> 10<00:01:35.400> groups<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.880> 10

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
see here once we counted 10 groups of 10

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.609 
see here once we counted 10 groups of 10
that<00:01:37.170> would<00:01:37.320> represent<00:01:38.180> 100<00:01:39.180> items<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:40.470> here

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
that would represent 100 items so here

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.090 
that would represent 100 items so here
we<00:01:40.740> see<00:01:40.950> 10<00:01:41.250> groups<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.640> 10<00:01:41.939> or<00:01:41.970> 100<00:01:42.869> items<00:01:43.799> and

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
we see 10 groups of 10 or 100 items and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.899 
we see 10 groups of 10 or 100 items and
then<00:01:44.939> we<00:01:45.060> have<00:01:45.210> 5<00:01:45.600> groups<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.140> 10<00:01:46.500> or<00:01:46.530> 50<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.880> we

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
then we have 5 groups of 10 or 50 so we

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.420 
then we have 5 groups of 10 or 50 so we
have<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> 5<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.869> tens<00:01:49.110> column<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.770> then<00:01:50.340> we

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
have a 5 in the tens column and then we

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.639 
have a 5 in the tens column and then we
have<00:01:50.579> 3<00:01:50.939> left<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.479> ones<00:01:51.720> column<00:01:52.020> to

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
have 3 left in the ones column to

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.030 
have 3 left in the ones column to
represent<00:01:53.479> 153<00:01:54.479> now<00:01:55.350> let's<00:01:55.560> take<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> look<00:01:55.860> at<00:01:55.979> a

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
more comprehensive place value chart so

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.499 
more comprehensive place value chart so

we separate the millions and the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
place value chart I did include the

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.100 
place value chart I did include the
decimal<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.790> far<00:02:25.030> right<00:02:25.330> because<00:02:25.780> we're

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
decimal to the far right because we're

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.300 
decimal to the far right because we're
not<00:02:26.200> going<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.440> have<00:02:26.650> any<00:02:26.800> digits<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.250> the

right of the decimal for whole numbers

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.380 
right of the decimal for whole numbers
we<00:02:29.950> normally<00:02:30.250> do<00:02:30.340> not<00:02:30.370> include<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:30.970> decimal

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
we normally do not include the decimal

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.120 
we normally do not include the decimal
point<00:02:31.660> but<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.290> reason<00:02:32.530> I<00:02:32.590> wanted<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:32.890> include

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
point but the reason I wanted to include

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.280 
point but the reason I wanted to include
it<00:02:33.340> is<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:33.970> word<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.390> is<00:02:34.810> used<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:35.110> represent

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
it is the word and is used to represent

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.830 
it is the word and is used to represent
the<00:02:35.680> decimal<00:02:36.100> point<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:36.550> we<00:02:37.150> shouldn't<00:02:37.480> use

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
the decimal point so we shouldn't use

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.500 
the decimal point so we shouldn't use
and<00:02:38.230> when<00:02:38.710> we<00:02:38.830> say<00:02:39.100> whole<00:02:39.430> numbers<00:02:39.790> so<00:02:40.030> this

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
and when we say whole numbers so this

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.900 
and when we say whole numbers so this
would<00:02:40.690> be<00:02:40.840> eight<00:02:41.080> million<00:02:41.530> three<00:02:41.770> hundred<00:02:42.340> two

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
would be eight million three hundred two

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.780 
would be eight million three hundred two
thousand<00:02:43.770> seven<00:02:44.770> hundred<00:02:44.920> ninety<00:02:45.580> five

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
thousand seven hundred ninety five

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.090 
thousand seven hundred ninety five
sometimes<00:02:46.720> you'll<00:02:47.110> hear<00:02:47.230> people<00:02:47.290> say<00:02:47.650> and

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
sometimes you'll hear people say and

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.130 
sometimes you'll hear people say and
like<00:02:48.430> seven<00:02:48.790> hundred<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.210> ninety<00:02:49.600> five<00:02:49.780> but

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
like seven hundred and ninety five but

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.880 
like seven hundred and ninety five but
technically<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.280> would<00:02:51.400> not<00:02:51.580> be<00:02:51.730> correct<00:02:52.890> so

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
technically that would not be correct so

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.170 
technically that would not be correct so
if<00:02:53.950> we<00:02:54.010> wanted<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.340> practice<00:02:54.490> identifying

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
if we wanted to practice identifying

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.050 
if we wanted to practice identifying
place<00:02:55.570> values<00:02:56.080> this<00:02:57.010> three<00:02:57.400> would<00:02:57.610> be<00:02:57.640> in<00:02:57.910> the

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
place values this three would be in the

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.790 
place values this three would be in the
hundred<00:02:58.720> thousands<00:02:59.290> place<00:02:59.500> value<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:05.500> two

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
hundred thousands place value the two

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.330 
hundred thousands place value the two
would<00:03:06.100> be<00:03:06.280> in<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:07.350> 1000s<00:03:08.350> or<00:03:08.470> thousands<00:03:09.130> place

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
would be in the 1000s or thousands place

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.470 
would be in the 1000s or thousands place
value<00:03:09.570> and<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:12.340> nine<00:03:12.550> would<00:03:12.790> be<00:03:12.910> in<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.150> tens

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
value and the nine would be in the tens

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.120 
value and the nine would be in the tens
place<00:03:13.900> value<00:03:16.590> let's<00:03:17.590> take<00:03:17.740> a<00:03:17.770> look<00:03:17.920> at<00:03:18.010> one

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
place value let's take a look at one

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.670 
place value let's take a look at one
more<00:03:18.160> example<00:03:18.580> of<00:03:18.790> this<00:03:19.260> let's<00:03:20.260> go<00:03:20.440> ahead<00:03:20.560> and

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
more example of this let's go ahead and

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.890 
more example of this let's go ahead and
put<00:03:20.770> the<00:03:20.860> commas<00:03:21.250> in<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:22.180> separate<00:03:22.540> our<00:03:22.660> place

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
put the commas in to separate our place

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.960 
put the commas in to separate our place
values<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:23.680> starting<00:03:24.400> from<00:03:24.520> the<00:03:24.640> right<00:03:24.820> we

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
values and starting from the right we

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.850 
values and starting from the right we
put<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.180> comma<00:03:25.420> between<00:03:25.720> every<00:03:26.260> three<00:03:26.500> digits

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
put a comma between every three digits

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.900 
put a comma between every three digits
here<00:03:27.460> and<00:03:27.720> here<00:03:29.280> so<00:03:30.280> this<00:03:30.400> would<00:03:30.520> be<00:03:30.700> eight

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
here and here so this would be eight

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.390 
here and here so this would be eight
hundred<00:03:31.180> forty-five<00:03:31.840> million<00:03:32.340> three<00:03:33.340> hundred

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
hundred forty-five million three hundred

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.790 
hundred forty-five million three hundred
six<00:03:34.060> thousand<00:03:34.990> nine<00:03:35.980> hundred<00:03:36.360> seventeen<00:03:37.800> so

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
six thousand nine hundred seventeen so

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.620 
six thousand nine hundred seventeen so
this<00:03:39.010> four<00:03:39.370> would<00:03:39.520> be<00:03:39.550> in<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.880> ten<00:03:40.180> millions

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
this four would be in the ten millions

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:48.900 
this four would be in the ten millions
place<00:03:40.960> value<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:47.470> five<00:03:47.770> would<00:03:48.010> be<00:03:48.040> in<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.460> one

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
place value the five would be in the one

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.210 
place value the five would be in the one
millions<00:03:49.360> or<00:03:49.570> millions<00:03:50.080> place<00:03:50.350> value<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:53.220> the

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
millions or millions place value and the

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.370 
millions or millions place value and the
seven<00:03:54.730> would<00:03:55.450> be<00:03:55.510> in<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.990> ones<00:03:56.440> place<00:03:56.680> value

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
seven would be in the ones place value

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.570 
seven would be in the ones place value
now<00:03:59.380> sometimes<00:03:59.800> you'll<00:04:00.010> be<00:04:00.130> asked<00:04:00.400> to<00:04:00.460> write

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
now sometimes you'll be asked to write

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.090 
now sometimes you'll be asked to write
numbers<00:04:00.850> in<00:04:01.090> expanded<00:04:01.690> form<00:04:01.720> and<00:04:02.320> writing<00:04:03.040> a

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
numbers in expanded form and writing a

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.100 
numbers in expanded form and writing a
number<00:04:03.340> in<00:04:03.430> expanded<00:04:03.940> form<00:04:03.970> is<00:04:04.510> a<00:04:04.840> way<00:04:05.050> to

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
number in expanded form is a way to

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.270 
number in expanded form is a way to
emphasize<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.950> place<00:04:06.280> value<00:04:06.730> of<00:04:06.850> each<00:04:06.970> digit

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
emphasize the place value of each digit

eight hundred plus this nine represents

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.200 
eight hundred plus this nine represents
90<00:04:44.920> and<00:04:45.420> the<00:04:46.420> three<00:04:46.690> represents<00:04:47.290> three<00:04:48.210> for

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
90 and the three represents three for

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.540 
90 and the three represents three for
this<00:04:49.330> eight<00:04:49.600> we<00:04:50.170> have<00:04:50.350> the<00:04:50.590> thousands

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
this eight we have the thousands

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.750 
this eight we have the thousands
millions<00:04:52.390> and<00:04:52.690> billions<00:04:53.440> so<00:04:53.740> this<00:04:53.860> would<00:04:54.010> be<00:04:54.160> 8

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
millions and billions so this would be 8

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.200 
millions and billions so this would be 8
billion<00:04:55.620> plus<00:04:56.620> now<00:04:57.430> because<00:04:57.700> there's<00:04:57.850> a<00:04:57.940> zero

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
billion plus now because there's a zero

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.080 
billion plus now because there's a zero
in<00:04:58.450> the<00:04:58.570> 100<00:04:58.960> millions<00:04:59.350> place<00:04:59.860> value<00:05:00.310> we<00:05:00.970> do

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
in the 100 millions place value we do

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.000 
in the 100 millions place value we do
not<00:05:01.210> need<00:05:01.390> to<00:05:01.450> include<00:05:01.630> that<00:05:02.110> so<00:05:02.770> we'll<00:05:02.890> have

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
not need to include that so we'll have

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:13.200 
not need to include that so we'll have
plus<00:05:03.430> 90<00:05:04.420> million<00:05:06.810> plus<00:05:07.810> 1<00:05:08.590> million<00:05:11.460> plus<00:05:12.460> this

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
plus 90 million plus 1 million plus this

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.420 
plus 90 million plus 1 million plus this
would<00:05:13.390> be<00:05:13.740> 100,000<00:05:16.500> and<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:17.530> next<00:05:17.860> non-zero

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
would be 100,000 and the next non-zero

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.270 
would be 100,000 and the next non-zero
digit<00:05:18.550> is<00:05:18.820> this<00:05:19.000> 3<00:05:19.510> which<00:05:20.200> represents<00:05:20.710> 30<00:05:21.010> and

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
digit is this 3 which represents 30 and

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.020 
digit is this 3 which represents 30 and
then<00:05:21.760> plus<00:05:22.090> 2<00:05:23.370> ok<00:05:24.370> the<00:05:24.460> last<00:05:24.490> thing<00:05:24.700> we'll<00:05:24.910> do

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
then plus 2 ok the last thing we'll do

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.730 
then plus 2 ok the last thing we'll do
is<00:05:25.060> take<00:05:25.300> a<00:05:25.360> look<00:05:25.570> at<00:05:25.660> how<00:05:25.780> we<00:05:25.840> write<00:05:26.230> whole

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
is take a look at how we write whole

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.770 
is take a look at how we write whole
numbers<00:05:27.130> in<00:05:27.310> English<00:05:27.730> we<00:05:28.360> write<00:05:28.540> a<00:05:28.570> whole

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
numbers in English we write a whole

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.570 
numbers in English we write a whole
number<00:05:28.960> in<00:05:29.260> the<00:05:29.380> same<00:05:29.620> way<00:05:29.800> that<00:05:29.919> we<00:05:30.070> say<00:05:30.340> them

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
number in the same way that we say them

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.970 
number in the same way that we say them
using<00:05:30.970> correct<00:05:31.180> place<00:05:31.480> value<00:05:31.870> we<00:05:32.590> separate

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
using correct place value we separate

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.820 
using correct place value we separate
the<00:05:33.100> number<00:05:33.430> in<00:05:33.610> words<00:05:34.240> by<00:05:35.050> commas<00:05:35.530> the<00:05:35.620> same

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
the number in words by commas the same

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.500 
the number in words by commas the same
way<00:05:35.950> we<00:05:36.100> do<00:05:36.280> when<00:05:36.940> we<00:05:37.060> write<00:05:37.240> the<00:05:37.419> number<00:05:39.510> so

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
way we do when we write the number so

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:46.380 
way we do when we write the number so
for<00:05:40.630> example<00:05:40.990> here<00:05:41.140> we<00:05:41.169> have<00:05:42.000> 3000<00:05:43.000> comma<00:05:45.390> 581

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
for example here we have 3000 comma 581

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.340 
for example here we have 3000 comma 581
here<00:05:47.290> we<00:05:47.410> have<00:05:47.560> 10,000<00:05:48.520> 25<00:05:49.120> notice<00:05:50.020> the<00:05:50.140> comma

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
here we have 10,000 25 notice the comma

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.190 
here we have 10,000 25 notice the comma
between<00:05:50.560> the<00:05:50.890> 10,000<00:05:51.640> and<00:05:51.729> the<00:05:51.790> 25<00:05:52.270> and<00:05:52.570> then

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
between the 10,000 and the 25 and then

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.090 
between the 10,000 and the 25 and then
here<00:05:53.380> we<00:05:53.470> have<00:05:53.500> 12<00:05:54.010> million<00:05:54.340> comma<00:05:55.979> 81,000

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
here we have 12 million comma 81,000

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.620 
here we have 12 million comma 81,000
comma<00:05:58.740> 972<00:05:59.760> let's<00:06:00.760> go<00:06:00.910> and<00:06:01.090> try<00:06:01.180> a<00:06:01.240> couple<00:06:01.510> of

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
comma 972 let's go and try a couple of

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:15.370 
comma 972 let's go and try a couple of
our<00:06:01.780> own<00:06:01.890> so<00:06:02.890> we<00:06:02.979> have<00:06:03.870> 150,000

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:25.180 

,<00:06:16.930> 112<00:06:23.320> remember<00:06:24.320> we<00:06:24.440> should<00:06:24.620> not<00:06:24.740> include<00:06:25.040> the

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
, 112 remember we should not include the

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.070 
, 112 remember we should not include the
word<00:06:25.370> and<00:06:25.760> because<00:06:26.180> the<00:06:26.300> end<00:06:26.480> represents<00:06:27.020> a

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
word and because the end represents a

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.650 
word and because the end represents a
decimal<00:06:27.470> point<00:06:27.530> in<00:06:28.490> our<00:06:28.700> last<00:06:28.850> example<00:06:29.060> here

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:29.660 
decimal point in our last example here

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.680 
decimal point in our last example here
we<00:06:30.140> have<00:06:30.170> the<00:06:30.410> thousands<00:06:31.330> millions<00:06:32.330> and

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
we have the thousands millions and

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:44.620 
we have the thousands millions and
billions<00:06:34.030> so<00:06:35.030> we<00:06:35.150> have<00:06:35.270> 15<00:06:35.870> billion<00:06:43.630> 85

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630 
billions so we have 15 billion 85

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:54.900 
billions so we have 15 billion 85
million

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:54.910
