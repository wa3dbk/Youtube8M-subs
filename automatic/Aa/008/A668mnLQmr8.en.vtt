 Mexico Telcel the network in your hands 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.220
 the truth if this year if we check a 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.400
 table here in las vegas' I am Luis who 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.130
 We are already checking the 20 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.840
 inches of panasonic a pretty name 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.329
 that in Mexico I do not know how they are going 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.270
 put because you have a little strange 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.680
 because while some do the 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.399
 smaller products people 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.230
 panasonic shows this tablet of 20 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.710
 inches that have also preferred 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.860
 call him tablet table is almost a table 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.339
 20 inches this is working on the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.739
 platform windows 8 and it looks really good 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.199
 the images look excellent and the 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.659
 truth is that we see that is a product 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.940
 that can be very useful here 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:00.510
 issue is where you could put something 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.370
 so in the kitchen in the room I think that 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.830
 This type of products could work 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.409
 I do not know maybe in the showroom of a hotel or 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.380
 something like that finally the issue is that 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.540
 It is the 20 - inch screen so 4k 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.190
 is that the image looks amazing 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.410
 battery lasts 2 hours so they will be 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.520
 having to connect it a long time 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.429
 so you can work 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.079
 and the other important point let's say to 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:24.359
 work with the transform as windows 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.100
 the topic of interaction write in 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:28.289
 she could be a reality like that 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.509
 that here we are seeing the gadgets 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.189

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.189
