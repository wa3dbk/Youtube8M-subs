you know anywhere from 10 to 20 range

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.620 
you know anywhere from 10 to 20 range
and<00:02:19.430> they<00:02:19.550> need<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.850> address<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.240> offensive

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630

they're<00:02:29.570> going<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.720> go<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:30.020> I<00:02:30.170> think<00:02:30.470> this

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
they're going to go this I think this

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.010 
they're going to go this I think this
would<00:02:30.710> be<00:02:30.740> a<00:02:30.860> huge<00:02:31.100> reach<00:02:31.430> but<00:02:32.300> they<00:02:32.420> knew<00:02:32.600> they

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
would be a huge reach but they knew they

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.410 
would be a huge reach but they knew they
do<00:02:33.080> need<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.590> address<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:34.280> middle<00:02:35.090> of<00:02:35.240> their

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
do need to address the middle of their

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.140 
do need to address the middle of their
3-4<00:02:35.870> defense<00:02:36.410> with<00:02:37.220> somebody<00:02:37.610> big<00:02:37.880> but<00:02:38.120> I

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
3-4 defense with somebody big but I

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.790 
3-4 defense with somebody big but I
think<00:02:38.390> they<00:02:38.570> could<00:02:38.810> find<00:02:38.990> a<00:02:39.110> few<00:02:39.260> guys<00:02:39.440> in

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
think they could find a few guys in

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.150 
think they could find a few guys in
Ron's<00:02:40.580> two<00:02:40.820> three<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.150> four<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:41.690> think<00:02:42.650> Jenkins

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
Ron's two three and four I think Jenkins

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.280 
Ron's two three and four I think Jenkins
and<00:02:43.430> Hankins<00:02:43.910> would<00:02:44.450> be<00:02:44.600> too<00:02:44.810> high<00:02:44.990> at<00:02:45.140> this

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
and Hankins would be too high at this

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.050 
and Hankins would be too high at this
point<00:02:45.650> cornerback<00:02:46.160> Desmond<00:02:46.670> Trufant

cornerback<00:02:47.660> Xavier<00:02:48.290> Rhodes<00:02:48.590> I<00:02:48.950> think<00:02:49.070> one<00:02:49.550> of

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
cornerback Xavier Rhodes I think one of

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.640 
cornerback Xavier Rhodes I think one of
one<00:02:50.030> of<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.240> two<00:02:50.450> guys<00:02:50.660> could<00:02:51.080> go<00:02:51.320> anywhere

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
one of the two guys could go anywhere

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.180 
one of the two guys could go anywhere
from<00:02:51.980> 10<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.280> 15<00:02:53.770> it's<00:02:54.770> a<00:02:54.890> matter<00:02:55.070> of

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
from 10 to 15 it's a matter of

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.520 
from 10 to 15 it's a matter of
preference<00:02:55.580> I<00:02:55.910> believe<00:02:56.209> but<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:57.200> think<00:02:57.440> they

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
preference I believe but I think they

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.870 
preference I believe but I think they
could<00:02:57.709> address<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.070> cornerback<00:02:58.670> position

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
could address the cornerback position

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.240 
could address the cornerback position
with<00:02:59.360> quintard<00:02:59.780> Quentin<00:03:00.410> Jammer<00:03:00.620> still<00:03:01.010> being

a free agent Antoine Cason making his
departure<00:03:04.070> I<00:03:04.220> know<00:03:04.310> they<00:03:04.520> just<00:03:04.670> brought<00:03:04.910> in

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.520 
departure I know they just brought in
Derek<00:03:05.390> Cox<00:03:05.600> but<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:05.900> think<00:03:06.140> they're<00:03:06.290> going<00:03:06.470> to

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
Derek Cox but I think they're going to

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.900 
Derek Cox but I think they're going to
have<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.830> address<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.220> cornerback<00:03:07.700> position

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
have to address the cornerback position

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.770 
have to address the cornerback position
day<00:03:08.390> to<00:03:08.590> wide<00:03:09.590> receiver<00:03:09.910> running<00:03:10.910> back<00:03:11.269> like<00:03:11.630> I

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
day to wide receiver running back like I

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.270 
day to wide receiver running back like I
mentioned<00:03:11.989> earlier<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.620> off<00:03:12.769> season<00:03:12.980> goal

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
mentioned earlier the off season goal

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.130 
mentioned earlier the off season goal
they<00:03:13.400> need<00:03:13.580> to<00:03:13.730> address<00:03:13.910> receiver<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:14.750> think

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
they need to address receiver I think

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.650 
they need to address receiver I think
