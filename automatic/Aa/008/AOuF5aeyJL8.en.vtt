00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.700
 yop hello to all this band PÃ©joine nc 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.530
 xenon and today we end up in 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.660
 confirmed eliminations on the trunk of the 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.010
 indes to scorpion fast charger and 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.570
 silent so it's a gameplay that 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.519
 date of a long time ago I will not you 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.929
 hide that's why I 'm trying to 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.640
 liquidate now because that's it 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:30.039
 will make a different nickname in less than 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.929
 you want in the videos and will avoid 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.310
 that new subscribers be lost 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:36.250
 sending to different nicks at each 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.780
 buy that gameplay so as I say this 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.160
 gameplay it date I realize them to 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.920
 the time when I only played solo 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.809
 and so I did not know all the 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.640
 people of my current team so of the future 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.780
 and rage it was even before the 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.610
 creation of the future maybe it was 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.989
 two weeks before so you see 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.750
 it's still a gameplay that is a 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.820
 little bit old so on this gameplay 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.079
 eliminates to confirm so a lot of 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.250
 strict score pounds that's right it's 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.719
 not in fashion we can do really 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.640
 a lot of thil alarm 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.840
 I still have a big gameplay in them 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.129
 it's on this account so I have that 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.809
 I will try to liquidate you in 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.310
 two weeks to come like that it will do 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.530
 Well, that's how I tell him - two 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.700
 different accounts on the gameplay for 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.380
 that newcomers are not 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.570
 lost and there is also avoid the 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.830
 insinuations a little weak on the part of 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.350
 some people but finally good I 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.820
 will not talk about that again since I promised 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.350
 I promised you that I will talk more 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.580
 never boost there is over I have 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.150
 tired of having to justify myself 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.860
 permanence 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.420
 so instead I'm going to attack 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.590
 today with a new concept 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.720
 something I talked about when 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.310
 I had only 2000 subscribers and that 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.720
 I decided to start now because 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.700
 that this is already a lease and then 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.530
 there at the moment I really wanted 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.540
 to start her so basically this concept 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.160
 it's going to be that on a gameplay like this 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.190
 of call of duty a pretty gameplay 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.480
 final output I would not take by 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.100
 example of specific gameplay for 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.570
 talk about topics there it will be a bit on 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.700
 any type of gameplay so it can very 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.320
 well be on a more than 200 it opens 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.480
 on a part like that maybe a little 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.000
 less huge so 1,104 3 years old does not know in 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.380
 solo so this concept basically is that 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.330
 I will tell you a little about youtuber 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.890
 So obviously that youtuber 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.170
 general will have nothing to do with call 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.210
 of duty or even the pure video game in 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.860
 general wholesale i will not come to you 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.050
 talk about divx 9 videos on league of 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.520
 legends I will not talk to you about 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.860
 youtuber gamer so that's for the 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.690
 youtube part and another part so 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.040
 that finally two other parties will be 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.870
 also decided to make you discover a 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.099
 few movies 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.049
 the series I do not appreciate what I 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.159
 will tell you so still has series 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.720
 that's true, I have not seen any 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.069
 billion there are some series I'm 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.549
 really a fan and I have the opportunity 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.989
 anyway to talk to you again but 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.340
 this is especially at the level of movies in 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.690
 I've seen masses and 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.569
 masses and masses honestly I saw 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.010
 an incalculable number of films one I myself 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.269
 watch almost every night in 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.010
 anyway as soon as I can I look at myself 1 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.060
 so I'm starting to have 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.650
 a good little culture 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.099
 cinematographic good obviously I 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.930
 not necessarily seen stuff a little bit 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.250
 bottom of ascq that it makes styles and all 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.980
 wish in class where I saw that the movie 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.269
 such film and it's a little bit in e mode 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.060
 group is them who has seen everything 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.750
 it's more entertainment movies so 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.000
 actions etc 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.500
 in general after I do not say that I saw 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.790
 that movies like that I saw 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.530
 frankly movies that have not hurt me 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.840
 also marked and have nothing to do 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.129
 with Hollywood style blockbusters a 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.379
 little stupid that can be found at each 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.780
 street corner zijp so there is today 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.799
 I will attack this series finally I 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.890
 do not know if I can call it like a 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.930
 series we'll say that it's a concept in 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.640
 general anyway you understood 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.409
 the trick I do not know yet how 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.880
 I would call it so in my opinion you 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.139
 will you see in the title me that at 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.569
 right now I do not know exactly 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.560
 again how will I call this stuff 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.660
 so in any case today I'm going 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.120
 attack with what the funk what the cut 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.650
 it's a youtube show so I know 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.540
 that yeah that's a little weird said 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.040
 like that big year it's something 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.109
 on youtube so the small shows 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.310
 of 10 minutes which is presented between 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.010
 quotation marks again if I can 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.480
 to say his part mr antoine daniel from where 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.319
 maybe some people know about 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.849
 anyway I know that some 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.480
 know because I saw that 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.340
 in the comments 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.230
 so in fact what is watts worried 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.690
 it's a show where for ten 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.970
 minutes we have a guy so antoine daniel 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.260
 who is taking us three videos that have made 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.609
 the buzz lately on the net 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.560
 so it's still pretty videos 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.609
 recent 1 usually they try to 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.989
 take videos that are going well 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.870
 together with some progression 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.730
 for example the first video it will be a 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.989
 trick with a cat and then the second 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.129
 with another animal etc 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.440
 and in the end he will be able to make a 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.639
 funny conclusion especially that on the 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.470
 pets theme by 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.730
 example where obviously I say there I say 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.680
 big bullshit I do not even know 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.479
 if he has already done his one 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.470
 just to give you an example and that 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.699
 you can understand the trick 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.860
 so in fact what he does he takes 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.450
 three videos buzz like that and he 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.010
 orders so with these reactions a little 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.960
 live it's a bit of essence of 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.340
 sketches who wrote it himself and that's 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.260
 really super funny game 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.910
 tell you frankly I'm kiffe 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.169
 thousand is even better than the clg 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.370
 so sng who is a bit in the same 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.050
 kind and of which I also see the opportunity 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.520
 to talk to you 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.440
 perso I really love it is a small 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.240
 little more trash than sng but that's 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.800
 really exceptional and I invite you 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.540
 really to go see that because here 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.310
 I find it really ultramar years 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.930
 and I will put you the link of his 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.120
 string in the description and I you

 invite if you will see his videos and 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.120
 you find it really good to come back 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.550
