00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.310
 What if there are more than two screens? 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:15.449
 This form 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.650
 It is outside of black for everyone process 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.720
 Tell me not to see it outside the castle 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.009
 Uchidame is 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.640
 Because it is two each, this is 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.640
 Same conditions as each other 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.310
 For example, let's try what happens if we pack from a castle 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.300
 I will always pack from outside batting 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.870
 It is the same thing from any stage outside 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.900
 Sa here 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.570
 I'm Ukano 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.360

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.420

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.440
 Inaccessible form 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.040
 Cumulus and 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.040
 It will be called 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.150
 Kantori 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.200
 Therefore it is commonly used 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.510
 Seki city is the correct formal way of speaking 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.770
 It does not matter if it is Beijing West Station 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.720
 In short, the form which is sent regardless of which one sells each other 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.790
 Because 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.900
 It will be left as it is in pc 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.830

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.730
 What happens if you sell from a bag 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.360
 I write here when I was a Honda 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.509
 This is a car 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.959
 Will win
