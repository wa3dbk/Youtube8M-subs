running and show you an analysis of one

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.850 
running and show you an analysis of one
of<00:00:09.920> our<00:00:10.040> runners<00:00:10.250> on<00:00:10.520> day<00:00:10.670> one<00:00:10.880> and<00:00:11.030> day<00:00:11.090> four

of our runners on day one and day four
so<00:00:12.860> our<00:00:13.190> four<00:00:13.730> points<00:00:14.059> are<00:00:14.270> mid-foot<00:00:15.230> cadence

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
so our four points are mid-foot cadence

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.420 
so our four points are mid-foot cadence

shock absorption so one thing we can

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.109 
shock absorption so one thing we can
work<00:00:29.420> on<00:00:29.570> here<00:00:29.810> bent<00:00:30.050> knee<00:00:30.430> we're<00:00:31.430> looking<00:00:31.789> for

relaxed shoulders and a 90 degree bend

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.160 
relaxed shoulders and a 90 degree bend
in<00:00:34.610> the<00:00:34.730> arm<00:00:34.910> could<00:00:35.360> relax<00:00:35.690> his<00:00:35.870> shoulder<00:00:36.140> a

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
in the arm could relax his shoulder a

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.020 
in the arm could relax his shoulder a
little<00:00:36.289> bit<00:00:36.440> more<00:00:36.739> we<00:00:37.249> almost<00:00:37.399> see<00:00:37.609> this<00:00:37.789> left

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
little bit more we almost see this left

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.910 
little bit more we almost see this left
shoulder<00:00:38.149> coming<00:00:38.600> forward<00:00:39.109> torquing<00:00:39.649> across

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
shoulder coming forward torquing across

shoulder coming forward torquing across
the<00:00:40.070> body<00:00:40.249> so<00:00:40.519> this<00:00:40.609> is<00:00:40.789> what<00:00:40.940> we<00:00:41.059> don't<00:00:41.210> want

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
the body so this is what we don't want

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.509 
the body so this is what we don't want
is<00:00:41.600> when<00:00:41.809> our<00:00:41.839> arms<00:00:42.170> cross<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:42.679> midline<00:00:42.859> it's

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
is when our arms cross the midline it's

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:45.790 
is when our arms cross the midline it's
gonna<00:00:43.640> cause<00:00:43.909> for<00:00:44.300> an<00:00:44.749> overcompensation<00:00:45.170> in

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
gonna cause for an overcompensation in

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.290 
gonna cause for an overcompensation in
the<00:00:45.859> lower<00:00:46.039> body<00:00:46.309> which<00:00:46.579> is<00:00:46.730> just<00:00:47.179> an

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
the lower body which is just an

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.599 
the lower body which is just an
inefficiency<00:00:47.920> we<00:00:48.920> are<00:00:49.039> looking<00:00:49.339> straight

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
inefficiency we are looking straight

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:51.040 
inefficiency we are looking straight
ahead<00:00:49.729> we<00:00:49.999> want<00:00:50.149> to<00:00:50.210> be<00:00:50.269> looking<00:00:50.390> about<00:00:50.690> twenty

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
ahead we want to be looking about twenty

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.660 
ahead we want to be looking about twenty
to<00:00:51.289> thirty<00:00:51.499> feet<00:00:51.710> ahead<00:00:51.859> of<00:00:52.010> us<00:00:52.219> so<00:00:52.429> that<00:00:52.550> we're

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
to thirty feet ahead of us so that we're

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.540 
to thirty feet ahead of us so that we're
not<00:00:52.760> driving<00:00:52.969> our<00:00:53.269> energy<00:00:53.719> into<00:00:53.839> the<00:00:54.050> ground

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
not driving our energy into the ground

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.509 
not driving our energy into the ground
we<00:00:55.550> want<00:00:55.729> to<00:00:55.789> be<00:00:55.879> on<00:00:55.999> our<00:00:56.030> mid<00:00:56.359> foot<00:00:56.569> which

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
we want to be on our mid foot which

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.250 
we want to be on our mid foot which
close<00:00:58.519> here<00:00:58.909> but<00:00:59.149> we've<00:00:59.269> got<00:00:59.420> a<00:00:59.449> little<00:00:59.780> bit<00:01:00.139> of

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
close here but we've got a little bit of

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.110 
close here but we've got a little bit of
a<00:01:00.319> check<00:01:00.559> mark<00:01:00.739> going<00:01:01.010> on<00:01:01.219> we<00:01:01.609> could<00:01:01.760> work<00:01:01.969> on

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
a check mark going on we could work on

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.630 
a check mark going on we could work on
that<00:01:02.299> as<00:01:02.479> well

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
that as well

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.149 
that as well
and<00:01:04.640> we<00:01:05.239> need<00:01:05.750> a<00:01:05.780> little<00:01:06.350> bit<00:01:06.500> more<00:01:06.710> of<00:01:06.860> a<00:01:06.950> lean

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
and we need a little bit more of a lean

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.260 
and we need a little bit more of a lean
so<00:01:07.549> the<00:01:07.790> lean<00:01:07.970> we<00:01:08.120> want<00:01:08.360> is<00:01:08.540> about<00:01:08.840> here<00:01:09.260> and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
so the lean we want is about here and

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.090 
so the lean we want is about here and
Hector<00:01:11.270> is<00:01:11.450> a<00:01:11.480> little<00:01:11.930> bit<00:01:12.050> behind<00:01:12.200> that<00:01:12.560> so<00:01:12.860> a

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
Hector is a little bit behind that so a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.180 
Hector is a little bit behind that so a
couple<00:01:13.700> things<00:01:13.820> that<00:01:13.970> we<00:01:14.060> can<00:01:14.300> work<00:01:14.450> on<00:01:15.190> mid

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
couple things that we can work on mid

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.290 
couple things that we can work on mid
foot<00:01:16.520> so<00:01:17.030> no<00:01:17.180> more<00:01:17.330> checkmark<00:01:17.890> bent<00:01:18.890> knee<00:01:19.300> no

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
foot so no more checkmark bent knee no

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.160 
foot so no more checkmark bent knee no
crossing<00:01:20.870> the<00:01:20.990> midline<00:01:21.290> and<00:01:21.890> Arlene<00:01:23.170> let's

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
crossing the midline and Arlene let's

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.810 
crossing the midline and Arlene let's
take<00:01:24.350> a<00:01:24.380> look<00:01:24.590> at<00:01:24.680> day<00:01:24.830> four<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:25.130> see<00:01:25.490> Hector's

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
take a look at day four and see Hector's

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.790 
take a look at day four and see Hector's
improvements<00:01:26.540> so<00:01:27.200> again<00:01:27.380> we'll<00:01:27.500> start<00:01:27.710> with

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
improvements so again we'll start with

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.140 
improvements so again we'll start with
the<00:01:27.920> feet<00:01:28.130> feet<00:01:28.670> are<00:01:28.790> pointing<00:01:29.120> straight
