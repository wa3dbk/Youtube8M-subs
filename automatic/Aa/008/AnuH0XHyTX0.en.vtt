quarter tank of gas my gauge is broken

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.550 
quarter tank of gas my gauge is broken
don't<00:02:54.140> go<00:02:54.319> by<00:02:54.440> that<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:55.090> I<00:02:56.349> drove<00:02:57.349> the<00:02:57.530> car

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
don't go by that and I drove the car

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:05.670 
don't go by that and I drove the car
let's<00:02:58.310> turn<00:02:58.519> it<00:02:58.640> on<00:02:58.760> here<00:02:59.060> I<00:03:00.220> drove<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.459> car

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.770 

253<00:03:06.680> kilometers<00:03:07.220> until<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.120> gas<00:03:08.269> light<00:03:08.569> came

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
253 kilometers until the gas light came

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.300 
253 kilometers until the gas light came
on<00:03:08.930> with<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.470> cow<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:09.680> clean<00:03:09.920> in<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.160> car

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
on with the cow to clean in the car

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.819 
on with the cow to clean in the car
right<00:03:11.090> now<00:03:11.329> the<00:03:12.049> reason<00:03:12.319> I<00:03:12.379> did<00:03:12.500> this<00:03:12.620> is

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
right now the reason I did this is

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.250 
right now the reason I did this is
because<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:13.129> had<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.489> PIO<00:03:13.940> 420<00:03:14.750> catalytic

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
because I had the PIO 420 catalytic

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.309 
because I had the PIO 420 catalytic
converter<00:03:15.590> failure<00:03:16.120> right<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.900> came<00:03:18.079> back<00:03:18.260> a

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
converter failure right it came back a

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:19.960 
converter failure right it came back a
whole<00:03:18.590> bunch<00:03:18.739> times<00:03:19.040> after<00:03:19.370> I<00:03:19.400> cleared<00:03:19.730> it<00:03:19.849> so

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
whole bunch times after I cleared it so

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.300

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
get a conditional pass well the results

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.200 
get a conditional pass well the results
are<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:04.500> code<00:04:04.680> has<00:04:04.800> not<00:04:04.950> come<00:04:05.100> back<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.970> car

colors<00:04:08.730> with<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.570> Catalan<00:04:10.110> if<00:04:11.100> you<00:04:11.250> guys<00:04:11.400> want

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
colors with the Catalan if you guys want

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.780 
colors with the Catalan if you guys want
proof<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:12.180> will<00:04:12.510> show<00:04:12.750> you<00:04:12.810> that<00:04:13.020> report<00:04:13.380> um

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.100 
proof I will show you that report um
yeah<00:04:14.790> it<00:04:14.910> does<00:04:15.120> kind<00:04:15.330> of<00:04:15.480> clean<00:04:15.660> work<00:04:15.900> I

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
yeah it does kind of clean work I

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.330 
yeah it does kind of clean work I
believe<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:16.739> does<00:04:16.980> um<00:04:17.390> I<00:04:18.440> did<00:04:19.440> find<00:04:19.770> out<00:04:19.980> that

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
believe it does um I did find out that

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.280 
believe it does um I did find out that
the<00:04:20.850> kind<00:04:21.030> of<00:04:21.120> clean<00:04:21.270> works<00:04:21.510> on<00:04:21.810> all<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.049> dirty

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
the kind of clean works on all the dirty

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.080 
the kind of clean works on all the dirty
kind<00:04:22.440> of<00:04:22.590> covers<00:04:22.860> like<00:04:23.010> super<00:04:23.310> dirty<00:04:23.460> below

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
kind of covers like super dirty below

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.030 
kind of covers like super dirty below
threshold<00:04:24.480> kind<00:04:24.990> of<00:04:25.050> stuff<00:04:25.200> I<00:04:25.350> don't<00:04:25.410> know<00:04:25.770> if

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
threshold kind of stuff I don't know if

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.620 
threshold kind of stuff I don't know if
it<00:04:26.160> works<00:04:26.370> if<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.700> converter<00:04:27.060> is<00:04:27.210> physically

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
it works if the converter is physically

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.500 
it works if the converter is physically
broken<00:04:28.050> inside<00:04:28.550> but<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.730> honestly<00:04:30.150> think<00:04:30.360> it's

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
broken inside but I honestly think it's

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.730 
broken inside but I honestly think it's
worth<00:04:30.660> a<00:04:30.960> try

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
worth a try

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.940 
worth a try
so<00:04:32.630> go<00:04:33.630> and<00:04:33.840> spend<00:04:34.080> that<00:04:34.260> extra<00:04:34.380> twenty<00:04:34.800> bucks

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
so go and spend that extra twenty bucks

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.500 
so go and spend that extra twenty bucks
and<00:04:35.220> it<00:04:35.280> may<00:04:35.430> save<00:04:35.760> you<00:04:35.880> a<00:04:35.910> couple<00:04:35.970> grills<00:04:36.360> the

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
and it may save you a couple grills the

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.020 
and it may save you a couple grills the
catalytic<00:04:36.930> converter<00:04:36.990> in<00:04:37.320> this<00:04:37.440> car<00:04:37.620> is

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
catalytic converter in this car is

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.350 
catalytic converter in this car is
$1,900<00:04:39.030> I<00:04:39.560> spent<00:04:40.560> twenty<00:04:41.010> two<00:04:41.460> dollars<00:04:41.610> and<00:04:42.090> it
