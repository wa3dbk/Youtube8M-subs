doing Krav concepts because I don't say
this<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.729> technique<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.630> system<00:01:30.840> this

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
this this technique so this system this

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.899 
this this technique so this system this
technique<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.950> system<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.400> teach<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.790> as

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
technique so this system we teach it as

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.450 
technique so this system we teach it as
our<00:01:33.090> system<00:01:33.540> they<00:01:34.140> integrate<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.009> soberly

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
our system they integrate so soberly

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.130 
our system they integrate so soberly
together<00:01:36.000> people<00:01:36.299> don't<00:01:36.600> realize<00:01:36.930> they're

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
together people don't realize they're

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.170 
together people don't realize they're
doing<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.829> know<00:01:37.950> I'm<00:01:38.310> not<00:01:38.460> doing<00:01:38.729> move<00:01:38.939> that

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
doing you know I'm not doing move that

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.700 
doing you know I'm not doing move that
starts<00:01:39.600> off<00:01:40.369> as<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.729> karate<00:01:42.150> move<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.720> then<00:01:43.530> all

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
starts off as a karate move and then all

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.929 
starts off as a karate move and then all
of<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.890> sudden<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.310> got<00:01:44.490> some<00:01:44.640> Filipino

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
of a sudden it's got some Filipino

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.440 
of a sudden it's got some Filipino
stepping<00:01:45.689> with<00:01:45.840> some<00:01:46.020> Thai<00:01:46.290> elbows<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.450> some

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
stepping with some Thai elbows and some

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.440 
stepping with some Thai elbows and some
crab<00:01:48.689> mentality<00:01:49.130> so<00:01:50.130> it's<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.030> might<00:01:51.210> be

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
crab mentality so it's so that might be

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.929 
crab mentality so it's so that might be
that's<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:52.170> thing<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.040> I've<00:01:53.159> done<00:01:53.460> might

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
that's that thing that I've done might

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.840 
that's that thing that I've done might
be<00:01:54.210> actually<00:01:54.840> five<00:01:55.170> systems<00:01:55.740> but<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> called

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
be actually five systems but on a called

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.510 
be actually five systems but on a called
flight<00:01:57.090> system<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.630> first<00:01:57.810> all<00:01:58.020> combat<00:01:58.520> that's

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
flight system is first all combat that's

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.789 
flight system is first all combat that's
the<00:01:59.670> way<00:01:59.820> it's<00:01:59.969> integrated<00:02:00.509> together<00:02:00.840> into

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
the way it's integrated together into

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.780 
the way it's integrated together into
one<00:02:01.979> system<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.659> know<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.890> what<00:02:05.759> I

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
one system so you know that the what I

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.320 
one system so you know that the what I
basically<00:02:06.119> do<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.630> use<00:02:06.990> all<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.259> good<00:02:07.439> stuff

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
basically do I use all the good stuff

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.510 
basically do I use all the good stuff
under<00:02:09.330> my<00:02:09.539> opinion<00:02:09.989> paralyzed<00:02:10.800> systems<00:02:11.250> and
