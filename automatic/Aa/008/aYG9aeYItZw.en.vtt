00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.110
 hey people craddocks here and today 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.640
 again brand new info around gta 5 m 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.380
 instead of this video, it's about new 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.210
 lies missions yes people like 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.550
 said this info is lying means 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.900
 Ministry confirms but it is 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.340
 not just any things we do in the 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.989
 have found source code but it 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.150
 these are audio files called 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.230
 files that we know from gta 5 if 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.790
 for example, a hot mission 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.500
 starts like this at the beginning with lester 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.180
 and something speaks and there are now 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.739
 also the files were found out by 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.780
 just hot missions do not even 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.610
 exist and that is really a very 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.840
 very big hint to us with us 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.700
 highest probability soon new 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.410
 we expect everything from highs mission 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.790
 surely know or who my then 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.900
 is called live stream has the will 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.460
 Definitely know that the 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.810
 have is really celebrated, however, it 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.160
 really really fun 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.630
 and accordingly, I am happy 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.400
 Of course, that too probably us 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.570
 expect new highs missions soon 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.070
 but as already said that is 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.350
 just is info does not mean by 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.060
 However, rockstar games confirms belief 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.350
 anyway that this with us highest 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.360
 Probability at the next dlc 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.890
 yes, people are expecting me before I see you 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.449
 want to play these audio files 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.310
 but still show the smallness 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.810
 and some have already been in the video of 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.280
 I have seen my new shirt designs 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.229
 and this evening my new ones come 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.729
 my new shirts in the shop the new one 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.829
 summer collection definitely sends 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.929
 tonight my time shirt shop from 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:19.640
 because these are then or now 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:20.329
 better this evening, these are 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.469
 in the shop 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:22.969
 it's not just these two new ones 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.380
 shirts but there is still one 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:26.030
 sunglasses with in the shop this on 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.060
 every case really cheeky his race and 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.520
 style and with such blue colored glasses 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.259
 so with blue reflect glasses and on 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.340
 the page is on mx on it as it 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.780
 looks in any case really nice 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.100
 check in any case tonight times 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.240
 the shop may be that 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.069
 the shop again has a few problems 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.659
 then in any case from tomorrow on your job 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:43.009
 and yes people but I would say that 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.649
 start here now 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.819
 these cars files yes what you still 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.889
 should know these audio files 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.240
 a total of 15 minutes I have that 

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:51.859
 completely clear up and cut together 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.479
 because I'm not just 15 minutes away 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:55.009
 Maybe I just wanted to talk 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.420
 I also get a bit bored 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.380
 Personally, I also found that boring 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.459
 15 minutes 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.259
 That's why I'm really just such a 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:01.849
 few sequences cut out who 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.420
 but still the full 15 minutes 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:04.219
 want to see 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.899
 I'll get the video in the video 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.880
 write links where you look at these 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.649
 Sequences complete for 15 minutes 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.090
 can listen, as we said, I will 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.800
 then you put out a lot of fun with 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.450
 The audio files is a horror 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.690
 new war are forgotten on the level 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.690
