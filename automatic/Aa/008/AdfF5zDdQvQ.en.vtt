 Teacher Recently I often try to bite and eat when eating 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:14.150
 It is tough me that bite 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:18.520
 That's right, especially in the elderly, the muscles in the face and mouth are also weakening 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:24.360
 It will be effective if you massage to move smoothly 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.360

 I would like to talk about the theme of massage of the lip face this time 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:50.180
 In the writing area that bites food , including the lips 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:56.430
 Use various muscles of the face 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:59.510
 So you will be able to chew firmly by massaging your lips and face 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.360

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:08.070
 At first it is a massage of the lip 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:12.409
 We divide the upper lip into three parts and massage each 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:17.220
 The end of the upper lip with your thumb and index finger 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:20.290
 I will tighten and stretch the knob with a level of pain 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.180

 We stand behind the user and do it 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:03.110
 At first cover the whole face with both hands 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:07.300
 Massage the muscles of the entire face while gently pressing on the palm 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.300

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:16.150

 It massages around the mouth like a small circle when it comes around with the belly of the finger 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.390

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.390
