00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.250
 welcome to wm yes hello we welcome 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.070
 you 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.900
 martin and st have something for you today 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.429
 We show you today water shooting to 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.289
 this thing has a water surface 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.610
 let's fall for something and photography too 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.590
 in the moment when the water is everything 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.540
 nice splash away for that we are today 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.460
 another studio exactly and have too 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.950
 here before the most important because much 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.870
 is aquarium is constructed so that was 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.910
 That's why we need six more 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.050
 utensils less than you 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.550
 Actually, we think we found it all 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.710
 fascinating is the first time done 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.180
 is not so many things he has 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.510
 needs the camera and tripod that is 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.070
 clear 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.680
 two places we need two more 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.879
 Flashes you need to the fernauslÃ¶ser 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.160
 for the places you with him 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.379
 we get the trigger we got 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.180
 sometimes even presented this course 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.500
 you can still have in others 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.030
 tenant or again look like that in the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.320
 individual exactly works exactly 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.299
 we have already got blackmail 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.340
 made and the women a remote trigger 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.869
 for yourselves so that you the camera 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.130
 fall rule out the right moment 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.570
 we can do that manually 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.909
 there will be no photocells or anything 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.729
 that the camera automatically triggers that 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.509
 works so well then should be on 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.509
 start building tomorrow 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.090
 build it went quite quickly 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.710
 we saw again we go short 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.340
 through what we have built everything up completely 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.200
 important the camera we have 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.399
 together with the fine trigger again 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.829
 then you can still do the pictures 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.240
 while you throw the things in short 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.750
 info we have a 105 here 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.909
 macro lens cd 700 with built on 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.409
 the camera we have the pocket wizard 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.509
 easy to control the flashes of the 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.179
 we have built up 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:04.810
 there we have two pieces led by 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.530
 pure light in the air at the top 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.090
 to create 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.160
 ie the sunlight one in the end 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.720
 bit thoughtful and if you have one 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.670
 second flash the moment just on the 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.319
 background also control very much the 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.580
 white is if want in white 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.630
 background in the beginning we have to do 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.130
 later with some pictures 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.209
 black background because it's easy 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.000
 still looks very dramatic 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.340
 I'll start with the white one 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.010
 camera settings, we have chosen 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.569
 a 6400 seconds have that time 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.390
 you also need to test it with the 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.030
 Water drops are really hot 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.989
 the iso 200 and the aperture are adjusted 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.609
 simple that I will soon we 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.799
 Here we have tried it 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:42.130
 He is being made exposure to power 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.660
 you would know 245 dazzle that comes quite 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:53.170
 well down so that the background is white 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:53.609
 and I would say that was the first one 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:09.250
 attempt 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:03:11.049
 I think that was almost completely too early 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.489
 important in between every now and then 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.489
 clean the windows again 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:33.069
 the pastor already noticed that works 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.500
 actually very fast 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.319
 you've got there within five six 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.580
 seven pictures so far in the turn out 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.590
 if you have to trigger exactly that 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.670
 At least I found really amazing 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.900
 not necessarily with the 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.849
 photocell has to build so that 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.769
 works but moves the phone 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.569
 can really drop you 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.760
 When does the object get caught? 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.080
 The water we are doing now 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.849
 again a dark background to 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.920
 comparison so he sees how that ends 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.150
 looks like and it still a little bit 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:08.110
 but also believe a little something 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:08.670
 hiring is the second time 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.470
 rebuilt 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.930
 laborious today we now have a 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.389
 black background is just like that 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.039
 you still play up even with the colors 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.799
 Black should be a little bit 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.940
 more dramatic but you have to do that too 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.160
 blitze failed provide exactly 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.990
 or sometimes the one here as 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.280
 I've always seen number one 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.570
 still so this natural light again 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.240
 said earlier has sunlight 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.770
 last time two has to leave the background 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.690
 that should be rather dark that is 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.800
 less of it we give background 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.600
 do not make it all the way we have 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.550
 now just put in front of the aquarium 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.440
 around the individual objects one more 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.430
 lightening up came afterwards 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.960
 we can at the later 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.729
 Review again 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.530
 just fine if a bit lighter 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.750
 that means the lightning is here 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.060
 otherwise not much was done 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.599
 otherwise camera settings remain everything 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.039
 the old one 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.960
 exactly we did not change anything 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.060
 were still at the 6400 second 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.590
 So really very short again 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.450
 A flowing pocket knowledge manages to do it 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.729
 actually the lightning synchronization 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.389
 even with these 6400 of the second still 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.220
 follow through 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.220
 we were really surprised 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:28.570
 perfect is now bringing that closer 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.930
 theme water photography you see 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.710
 no big 600 can make a beautiful one 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.630
 maybe the tip we have it 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.800
 towels not made are times 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.380
 very practical and girl the one 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.630
 to dry a bit yes I think 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.410
 we have everything in it again 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.310
 enumerated can tripod two flashes 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.500
 Remote trigger then it would be the lightning 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.050
 of course, of course, the taxes 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.340
 objects that make you rich very important 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.440
 no limits set 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.940
 kicks off if you have to ask again 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.200
 necessarily writes commentary below 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.810
 the answers also as fast as 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.070
 possible in any case promised and 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.500
 See you next time 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.840
 under the station on especially too 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.910
 We look forward to seeing you 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.860
 to deal with the shooting 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.580
 tried time to see what's coming 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.580
 have fun 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:38.669
 sentence with yes today from our time 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.259
 another studio of Styrian I have 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:45.080
 either one starts 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:45.080
 that makes it catch and filmed now
