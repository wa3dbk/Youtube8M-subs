00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
times better I poll I think like a to

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.690 
times better I poll I think like a to
Katie<00:03:49.750> every<00:03:50.079> single<00:03:50.350> game<00:03:50.470> if<00:03:50.680> I<00:03:50.799> camp<00:03:51.069> but

Katie every single game if I camp but
there<00:03:51.880> is<00:03:52.060> a<00:03:52.090> couple<00:03:52.690> of<00:03:52.810> downsides<00:03:53.340> to

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340
