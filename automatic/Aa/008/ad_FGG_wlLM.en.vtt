is<00:00:30.930> filled<00:00:31.380> with<00:00:31.470> soil<00:00:31.970> now<00:00:32.970> we<00:00:33.870> use<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
is filled with soil now we use the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.030 
is filled with soil now we use the
principle<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.820> weighing<00:00:36.059> balance<00:00:36.630> on<00:00:37.040> how

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
principle of a weighing balance on how

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.979 
principle of a weighing balance on how
it<00:00:39.110> measures<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.620> balance<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.700> wait<00:00:41.989> so

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
it measures and balance is wait so

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.619 
it measures and balance is wait so
basically<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.610> connected<00:00:45.150> this

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
basically and you connected this

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.470 
basically and you connected this
container<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.590> dis<00:00:46.830> container<00:00:47.370> with<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> help

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
container to dis container with the help

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.740 
container to dis container with the help
of<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.920> pipe<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.250> normal<00:00:50.760> bike<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.210> used<00:00:51.540> to

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
of a pipe a normal bike you used to

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.799 
of a pipe a normal bike you used to
water<00:00:51.960> your<00:00:52.110> garden<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:53.089> this<00:00:54.089> connects<00:00:54.540> it's

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
water your garden and this connects it's

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.780 
water your garden and this connects it's
connected<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.470> this<00:00:55.650> and<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.129> winds<00:00:56.489> around

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
connected to this and it winds around

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.880 
connected to this and it winds around
the<00:00:57.120> circumference<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.930> spot<00:00:58.290> and<00:00:58.530> you

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
the circumference of this spot and you

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.149 
the circumference of this spot and you
need<00:00:59.159> holes<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.879> pipe<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:01.159> therefore

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
need holes in this pipe and therefore

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.969 
need holes in this pipe and therefore
the<00:01:02.250> work<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.879> container<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:04.019> water<00:01:04.350> always

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
the work this container of water always

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.340 
the work this container of water always
remains<00:01:05.430> up<00:01:05.700> since<00:01:06.450> water<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.110> constantly

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
remains up since water is constantly

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.540 
remains up since water is constantly
flowing<00:01:07.800> downwards<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.000> spot<00:01:10.370> due<00:01:11.370> to

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
flowing downwards to the spot due to

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.870 
flowing downwards to the spot due to
gravity<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:14.090> yeah<00:01:15.090> basically<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:16.290> just

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
gravity and yeah basically you just

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.179 
gravity and yeah basically you just
the<00:01:17.390> water<00:01:17.600> keeps<00:01:17.869> on<00:01:18.110> flowing<00:01:18.469> down<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:19.100> this

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
the water keeps on flowing down and this

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.709 
the water keeps on flowing down and this
big<00:01:19.399> starts<00:01:19.729> becoming<00:01:19.850> heavier<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:20.600> heavier

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
big starts becoming heavier and heavier

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:23.499 
big starts becoming heavier and heavier
because<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.920> water<00:01:22.159> being<00:01:22.490> stored<00:01:23.000> in<00:01:23.149> it<00:01:23.329> and

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
because the water being stored in it and

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.100 
because the water being stored in it and
this<00:01:24.020> is<00:01:24.560> constantly<00:01:25.220> being<00:01:25.490> pulled<00:01:25.820> down<00:01:26.110> now

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
this is constantly being pulled down now

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.469 
this is constantly being pulled down now
once<00:01:27.530> this<00:01:28.450> container<00:01:29.450> gets<00:01:30.340> em<00:01:31.340> gee<00:01:31.700> in<00:01:31.939> about

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
once this container gets em gee in about

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.450 
once this container gets em gee in about
11<00:01:33.259> and<00:01:33.530> a<00:01:33.710> half<00:01:33.740> weeks<00:01:34.450> this<00:01:35.450> is<00:01:36.369> pulled<00:01:37.369> down

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
11 and a half weeks this is pulled down

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.520 
11 and a half weeks this is pulled down
completely<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:38.450> this<00:01:38.780> is<00:01:38.899> attached<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.380> a

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
completely and this is attached to a

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.690 
completely and this is attached to a
string<00:01:40.360> which<00:01:41.360> is<00:01:41.390> connected<00:01:42.049> to<00:01:42.170> this<00:01:42.700> so

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
string which is connected to this so

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.200 
string which is connected to this so
once<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:45.409> water<00:01:45.619> is<00:01:45.770> empty<00:01:46.189> you<00:01:46.759> can<00:01:46.970> pull

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
once the water is empty you can pull

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.580 
once the water is empty you can pull
this<00:01:47.390> down<00:01:47.770> water<00:01:48.770> this<00:01:49.780> will<00:01:50.780> refill<00:01:51.380> it<00:01:51.560> with

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
this down water this will refill it with

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.149 
this down water this will refill it with
water<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.750> pull<00:01:53.750> it<00:01:53.780> back<00:01:54.049> up<00:01:54.080> once<00:01:54.740> this<00:01:54.979> is

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
water and pull it back up once this is

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.620 
water and pull it back up once this is
filled<00:01:55.399> with<00:01:55.459> water<00:01:55.700> this<00:01:56.030> automatically

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
filled with water this automatically

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.530 
filled with water this automatically
good

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.670 

we<00:02:00.370> test<00:02:01.370> this<00:02:01.640> system<00:02:02.570> of<00:02:02.720> you<00:02:02.900> planted<00:02:03.470> some

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
we test this system of you planted some

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.870 
we test this system of you planted some
scattered<00:02:04.130> seeds<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:07.130> let's<00:02:07.460> see<00:02:07.670> how<00:02:07.850> it

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
scattered seeds and let's see how it

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.559 
scattered seeds and let's see how it
goes

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.940 

right<00:02:11.200> now<00:02:11.439> we<00:02:11.790> observe<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:13.030> system<00:02:13.540> after<00:02:14.499> a

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
right now we observe the system after a

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.970 
right now we observe the system after a
week<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.579> we've<00:02:16.299> observed<00:02:16.719> it<00:02:17.049> it's<00:02:17.590> a

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
week and we've observed it it's a

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.140 
week and we've observed it it's a
wedding<00:02:18.700> around<00:02:20.099> it's<00:02:21.099> getting<00:02:21.549> wet<00:02:21.790> around

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
wedding around it's getting wet around

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.479 
wedding around it's getting wet around
the<00:02:22.359> circumference<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:22.980> for<00:02:23.980> this<00:02:24.219> and<00:02:24.430> it's

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
the circumference of for this and it's

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.179 
the circumference of for this and it's
getting<00:02:24.760> wet<00:02:25.560> approximately<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.709> is<00:02:26.859> almost

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
getting wet approximately it is almost

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.780 
getting wet approximately it is almost
the<00:02:27.549> center<00:02:27.969> of<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.329> spot<00:02:29.189> so<00:02:30.189> it<00:02:30.310> is<00:02:30.340> getting

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790
