00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.870
 I had not seen it yet and I was 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.789

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.200
 also the will of ikea is basically the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.270
 that a secret entrance using things 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.450
 very basic here in a nursery a 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.170
 cart on a stone rail and a bow and 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.000
 arrow 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.320
 Only this I'll show you first. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.830
 how it works 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.000
 I'll show you how it 's done later. 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.430
 first place the affection that 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.540
 You jump it and make it place in the stone. 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.600
 google within it that 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.140
 Getting out hard must know that 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.750
 arrow and simply shoot guy you 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.250
 will be teleported comes underneath 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.460
 this place 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.210
 If I break here you'll see that it was 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.040
 here below I fall just underneath 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.159
 So how are they going to do this? 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.020
 do exactly as you have seen face 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.310
 Actually, I'm not going until after 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.110
 do what? 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.440
 you will break 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.450
 Down in the hole of what you want. 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.600
 he here you can by sÃ£o paulo com 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.780
 rewards something like that and beauty 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.690
 and you take the opening does not have 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:19.710
 block constraint or anything like this is 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:21.630
 You close here puts the only rail 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.320
 remembering that you have to put the 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.510
 Where are you going to get the cart? 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.190
 put up the hole for example you 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.470
 I could not put the trail here. 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.030
 make a place that will not come here 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.640
 probably he will not even go 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.100
 then teleport you let it 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.830
 calculate well where you will put it there 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.000
 closed and ready guys are simply 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.630

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.770
 There you go, the event shoots and it's 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.450
 teleported good people 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.520

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.500

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.239
