 there are two main solutions 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.570
 the ultrasound method or the method 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.350
 more radical chemical the method 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:25.670
 chemical is to place plates 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:29.630
 glue along the walls like this so 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.130
 we take the plate schools the film on it 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.989
 place along the walls because the mice and 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.420
 rats never cross diagonally 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.610
 a piece she continually runs along the 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.920
 walls after placing your plates of 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.339
 glue along the walls complete you part of the 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.960
 poison 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:44.390

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.699
 that we place directly in a 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.309
 cardboard tunnel like this always on 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.470
 manipulate with a glove so that the 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.890
 sachet take time water from your 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.129
 hand it is placed along the walls next to it 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.010

 plastic so that will keep 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.109
 much longer and make very 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.700
 be careful if you have children at the 

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:15.950
 house where pets 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.170
 do not use this type of post but 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.350
 rather a post we do not say secure 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.670
 that they lock themselves 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.740
