auto trace and Adobe After Effects them
as<00:00:23.609> I'm<00:00:23.789> using<00:00:24.000> now<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.390> em<00:00:24.630> cs5<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.029> a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
as I'm using now is em cs5 and this is a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.609 
as I'm using now is em cs5 and this is a
little<00:00:27.300> preview<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.779> where<00:00:28.080> I've<00:00:28.230> used<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.529> in

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
little preview of where I've used it in

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:38.780 
little preview of where I've used it in
the<00:00:28.740> previous<00:00:29.250> video<00:00:36.649> right<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.920> get<00:00:38.100> started

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
the previous video right to get started

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.770 
the previous video right to get started
usually<00:00:39.540> you'd<00:00:40.070> use<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.340> say<00:00:41.670> if<00:00:42.000> you've<00:00:42.420> even

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
usually you'd use it say if you've even

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.260 
usually you'd use it say if you've even
got<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> still<00:00:43.440> image<00:00:43.559> or<00:00:44.070> you've<00:00:44.760> used<00:00:45.059> say

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
got a still image or you've used say

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.200 
got a still image or you've used say
twixtor<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.079> you've<00:00:46.500> slowed<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.700> video<00:00:47.940> down

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
twixtor and you've slowed the video down

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.880 
twixtor and you've slowed the video down
alright<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.410> far<00:00:49.620> I've<00:00:49.739> already<00:00:49.980> set<00:00:50.250> up<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.640> a

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
alright so far I've already set up and a

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.260 
alright so far I've already set up and a
frame<00:00:52.890> which<00:00:53.190> I've<00:00:53.340> picked<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.910> I'm<00:00:54.000> frozen

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
frame which I've picked and I'm frozen

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.330 
frame which I've picked and I'm frozen
at<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.660> frames<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.500> I'll<00:00:55.920> show<00:00:56.309> you

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
at that frames just so I'll show you

at that frames just so I'll show you
what<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.610> live<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.149> do<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.649> on<00:00:58.649> videos

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
what to live you can do this on videos

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.060 
what to live you can do this on videos
and<00:00:59.359> such<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.870> slow<00:01:01.260> down<00:01:01.500> twixtor

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
and such that if you slow down twixtor

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.929 
and such that if you slow down twixtor
this<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.329> showing<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.539> how<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:04.760> make<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
this is just showing you how to make the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.660 
this is just showing you how to make the
effect<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:07.140> first<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.590> all<00:01:07.740> if<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.340> just<00:01:08.490> get

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
effect so first of all if you just get

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.050 
effect so first of all if you just get
about<00:01:08.880> one<00:01:09.119> second<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.960> then<00:01:10.200> then<00:01:10.830> go<00:01:11.100> click

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
about one second and then then go click

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.219 
about one second and then then go click
on<00:01:12.090> your<00:01:13.490> video<00:01:14.490> you're<00:01:15.210> gonna<00:01:15.420> layer<00:01:15.630> Auto

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
on your video you're gonna layer Auto

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.499 
on your video you're gonna layer Auto
trace<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:18.290> these<00:01:19.290> settings<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.890> use<00:01:20.299> that<00:01:21.299> come

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
trace and these settings I use that come

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.399 
trace and these settings I use that come
frame<00:01:21.780> luminance<00:01:23.030> times<00:01:24.030> 56<00:01:24.590> threshold<00:01:25.610> 49

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409

minute<00:01:28.409> minimum<00:01:29.280> area<00:01:29.490> 19<00:01:30.090> pixels<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
minute minimum area 19 pixels and the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.660 
minute minimum area 19 pixels and the
corner<00:01:31.170> rounders<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.650> none<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.100> it's<00:01:32.340> applied

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
corner rounders to none and it's applied

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.640 
corner rounders to none and it's applied
to<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.850> new<00:01:33.030> layer<00:01:33.210> with<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> preview<00:01:34.140> selected

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
to a new layer with the preview selected

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.590 
to a new layer with the preview selected
and<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.189> basically<00:01:35.369> brings<00:01:35.939> out<00:01:36.090> these<00:01:36.240> lines

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
and it basically brings out these lines

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.219 
and it basically brings out these lines
and<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.950> tracks<00:01:38.310> send<00:01:39.090> features<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.960> video

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
and it tracks send features on the video

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.039 
and it tracks send features on the video
and<00:01:40.850> this<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.909> sense<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.360> use<00:01:42.540> because<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:42.899> not

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
and this is sense I use because it's not

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.410 
and this is sense I use because it's not
too<00:01:43.200> much<00:01:43.350> not<00:01:43.979> too<00:01:44.159> little<00:01:44.189> but<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.270> also

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
too much not too little but you can also

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.030 
too much not too little but you can also

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
you can go Justin all this stuff just

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.020 
you can go Justin all this stuff just
change<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.390> know<00:01:52.310> so<00:01:53.310> then<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.790> look

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
click OK and then it creates a new solid

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.969 
click OK and then it creates a new solid
layer<00:02:08.599> so<00:02:09.599> far<00:02:09.810> we<00:02:09.929> just<00:02:10.110> got<00:02:10.229> all<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:10.530> stupid

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
layer so far we just got all this stupid

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.160 
layer so far we just got all this stupid
white<00:02:12.020> shapes<00:02:13.020> which<00:02:13.349> is<00:02:13.530> a

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
white shapes which is a

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
I put it in third or quarter resolution

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.810 
I put it in third or quarter resolution
and<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.540> does<00:02:29.470> not<00:02:29.590> show<00:02:29.800> -<00:02:29.860> it's<00:02:30.490> literally

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820

so<00:05:11.090> stuff<00:05:11.420> like<00:05:11.570> this<00:05:11.810> when<00:05:12.250> editing<00:05:13.250> just

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
so stuff like this when editing just

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.040 
so stuff like this when editing just
takes<00:05:13.730> forever<00:05:13.940> and<00:05:14.650> it<00:05:15.650> just<00:05:16.600> editing<00:05:17.600> takes

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
takes forever and it just editing takes

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.170 
takes forever and it just editing takes
time<00:05:18.410> I<00:05:18.740> might<00:05:19.670> be<00:05:19.760> getting<00:05:19.850> a<00:05:19.970> new<00:05:20.090> computer

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
time I might be getting a new computer

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.180 
time I might be getting a new computer
soon<00:05:21.310> so<00:05:22.310> this<00:05:22.850> will<00:05:23.000> be<00:05:23.120> a<00:05:23.150> lot<00:05:23.330> quicker<00:05:24.190> as

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
soon so this will be a lot quicker as

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.310 
soon so this will be a lot quicker as
you<00:05:25.340> can<00:05:25.520> see<00:05:26.740> all<00:05:27.740> the<00:05:27.980> lines<00:05:28.160> are<00:05:28.580> sort<00:05:29.000> of

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
you can see all the lines are sort of

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.890 
you can see all the lines are sort of
moving<00:05:30.320> and<00:05:30.830> then<00:05:31.610> you'll<00:05:31.760> see<00:05:31.970> them<00:05:32.180> moving

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
moving and then you'll see them moving

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.260 
moving and then you'll see them moving
out<00:05:33.110> as<00:05:33.320> well<00:05:33.530> so<00:05:34.190> if<00:05:34.250> you<00:05:34.340> see<00:05:34.460> this<00:05:34.610> one<00:05:34.850> that

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
out as well so if you see this one that

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.810 
out as well so if you see this one that
was<00:05:35.420> coming<00:05:35.780> around<00:05:35.840> here<00:05:36.290> that'll<00:05:37.250> be<00:05:37.460> going

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
was coming around here that'll be going

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.090 
was coming around here that'll be going
soon<00:05:38.090> in<00:05:38.450> the<00:05:38.810> same<00:05:39.050> direction<00:05:39.260> I<00:05:41.980> think<00:05:42.980> it

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
soon in the same direction I think it

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.320 
soon in the same direction I think it
does<00:05:43.280> anyway<00:05:44.500> so<00:05:45.500> it's<00:05:45.830> only<00:05:45.920> half<00:05:46.220> is<00:05:46.790> on<00:05:46.970> full

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
does anyway so it's only half is on full

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.510 
does anyway so it's only half is on full
render<00:05:47.630> but<00:05:48.050> still<00:05:48.740> is<00:05:48.890> pretty<00:05:49.070> shocking

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
render but still is pretty shocking

00:05:49.520 --> 00:06:00.190 
render but still is pretty shocking
computer<00:05:58.690> can't<00:05:59.690> wait<00:05:59.780> to<00:05:59.900> get<00:05:59.990> a<00:06:00.050> new

all right as you can see here these

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.440

think<00:06:56.539> I<00:06:56.599> need<00:06:56.750> to<00:06:56.840> get<00:06:56.900> more<00:06:57.080> RAM<00:06:57.289> to<00:06:57.560> be

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
think I need to get more RAM to be

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.279 
think I need to get more RAM to be
honest<00:06:57.860> look<00:06:58.569> alright<00:06:59.569> if<00:06:59.780> it<00:06:59.870> gets<00:07:00.020> me<00:07:00.169> then

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:02.289 
honest look alright if it gets me then

honest look alright if it gets me then
there<00:07:03.289> you<00:07:03.319> go

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:05.979 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:09.339 

it<00:07:06.979> tracks<00:07:07.280> all<00:07:07.430> movements<00:07:07.940> and<00:07:08.120> a<00:07:08.419> lion<00:07:09.020> sort

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:09.349 
it tracks all movements and a lion sort

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:13.140 
it tracks all movements and a lion sort
of<00:07:09.409> go<00:07:09.530> around<00:07:09.620> it<00:07:09.979> which<00:07:10.310> looks<00:07:10.550> pretty<00:07:10.610> cool

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.150 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.360 

so<00:07:14.150> there<00:07:14.300> it<00:07:14.419> is<00:07:14.449> or<00:07:14.960> trace<00:07:15.380> it's<00:07:16.009> pretty<00:07:16.250> easy

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.370 
so there it is or trace it's pretty easy

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.850 
so there it is or trace it's pretty easy
to<00:07:16.550> all<00:07:16.880> not<00:07:17.180> much<00:07:17.389> to<00:07:17.690> it

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:17.860 
to all not much to it

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.990 
to all not much to it
just<00:07:18.860> remember<00:07:19.280> to<00:07:19.520> go<00:07:19.610> back<00:07:19.789> through

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 
just remember to go back through

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.240 
just remember to go back through
settings<00:07:20.449> you<00:07:21.229> can<00:07:21.319> adjust<00:07:21.380> a<00:07:21.740> sense<00:07:21.949> when<00:07:22.130> you

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:22.250 
settings you can adjust a sense when you

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.459 
settings you can adjust a sense when you
if<00:07:22.460> you're<00:07:22.639> but<00:07:23.060> then<00:07:23.330> once<00:07:23.690> I<00:07:23.840> use<00:07:24.050> it's

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:24.469 
if you're but then once I use it's

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:27.100 
if you're but then once I use it's
pretty<00:07:24.560> nice<00:07:24.889> I<00:07:25.069> think<00:07:25.129> in<00:07:25.759> my<00:07:25.940> opinion<00:07:26.110> but

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.110 
pretty nice I think in my opinion but

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.270 
pretty nice I think in my opinion but
anyway<00:07:27.349> this<00:07:27.469> still<00:07:27.710> is<00:07:27.830> more<00:07:27.979> to<00:07:28.069> come

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:28.280 
anyway this still is more to come

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.820 
anyway this still is more to come
mum<00:07:28.639> I've<00:07:29.000> just<00:07:29.180> I<00:07:29.599> think<00:07:30.050> it's<00:07:30.259> as<00:07:30.349> fast<00:07:30.500> After

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:30.830 
mum I've just I think it's as fast After

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.339 
mum I've just I think it's as fast After
Effects<00:07:31.690> showing<00:07:32.690> on<00:07:32.780> my<00:07:32.810> channel<00:07:33.169> and

00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:33.349 
Effects showing on my channel and

00:07:33.349 --> 00:07:35.260 
Effects showing on my channel and
there'll<00:07:33.560> be<00:07:33.590> loads<00:07:33.860> more<00:07:34.099> I<00:07:34.370> might<00:07:34.909> even<00:07:35.060> do

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:35.270 
there'll be loads more I might even do

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.839 
there'll be loads more I might even do
like<00:07:35.830> montage<00:07:36.830> episodes<00:07:37.310> I<00:07:37.430> had<00:07:37.610> to<00:07:37.729> edit

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:37.849 
like montage episodes I had to edit

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:40.689 
like montage episodes I had to edit
montages<00:07:38.539> and<00:07:39.190> if<00:07:40.190> you<00:07:40.310> cancel<00:07:40.520> good

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:40.699 
montages and if you cancel good

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:43.959 
montages and if you cancel good
