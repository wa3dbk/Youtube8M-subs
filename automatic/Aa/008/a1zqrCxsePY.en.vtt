00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
little bit different depending on how

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.869 
little bit different depending on how
long<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.680> takes<00:00:43.829> my<00:00:43.950> plan<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.489> race<00:00:44.850> through

if<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.579> can<00:00:47.730> really<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.149> because<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.840> way

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
if I can really do that because the way

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.260 
if I can really do that because the way
the<00:00:49.079> story's<00:00:49.350> going<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.590> change<00:00:49.950> I'm<00:00:50.309> gonna

just know what everything says because

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.750 
just know what everything says because
the<00:00:55.590> story<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.129> be<00:00:56.280> completely

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
the story is going to be completely

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.330 
the story is going to be completely
different<00:00:57.230> so<00:00:58.230> what<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.440> think<00:00:58.920> I'm<00:00:59.100> going<00:00:59.219> to

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
different so what I think I'm going to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.790 
different so what I think I'm going to
do<00:00:59.520> is<00:01:00.059> I'm<00:01:00.239> going<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.390> do<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.750> netflix<00:01:01.109> tile

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
do is I'm going to do this netflix tile

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.070 
do is I'm going to do this netflix tile
like<00:01:02.520> Netflix<00:01:03.030> does<00:01:03.180> house<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.539> cards<00:01:03.899> they

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
like Netflix does house of cards they

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.840 
like Netflix does house of cards they
released<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.589> entire<00:01:04.830> season<00:01:05.369> all<00:01:05.519> at<00:01:05.670> one

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
released the entire season all at one

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.700 
released the entire season all at one
time<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.390> people<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.200> take<00:01:07.320> their<00:01:07.530> turns

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
time so people can just take their turns

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.740 
time so people can just take their turns
and<00:01:07.979> go<00:01:08.040> through<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.430> watch<00:01:08.610> them<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.659> i

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
and go through and watch them and i

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.300 
and go through and watch them and i
think<00:01:09.930> i'm<00:01:09.990> going<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.170> do<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.439> depending<00:01:11.100> on

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
think i'm going to do that depending on

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.740 
think i'm going to do that depending on
how<00:01:11.520> long<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.820> takes<00:01:11.970> me<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.119> get<00:01:12.270> through<00:01:12.479> you

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
how long it takes me to get through you

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.660 
how long it takes me to get through you

from now before i get them up but just
really<00:01:19.200> depends<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.590> how<00:01:19.650> quickly<00:01:19.860> i<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.220> get

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
really depends on how quickly i can get

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.030 
really depends on how quickly i can get
through<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.759> playthrough<00:01:21.170> but<00:01:22.170> when<00:01:22.860> i<00:01:22.890> do

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040

start<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.580> post<00:01:23.850> videos<00:01:23.970> you're<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.960> see

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
start to post videos you're going to see

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:25.850 
start to post videos you're going to see
them<00:01:25.140> all<00:01:25.229> at<00:01:25.320> once<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:25.619> you're<00:01:25.740> watching

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
them all at once so if you're watching

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.219 
them all at once so if you're watching
this<00:01:26.070> right<00:01:26.220> now<00:01:26.400> look<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.900> next<00:01:28.110> couple

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
this right now look in the next couple

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.270 
this right now look in the next couple
of<00:01:28.350> minutes<00:01:28.470> you're<00:01:28.710> going<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.009> all<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
of minutes you're going to have all the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.670 
of minutes you're going to have all the
rest<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:30.180> series<00:01:30.450> up<00:01:30.810> there<00:01:31.079> as<00:01:31.259> well

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
rest of the this series up there as well

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.039 
rest of the this series up there as well
so<00:01:32.060> i<00:01:33.060> think<00:01:33.180> that's<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> way<00:01:33.750> I'm<00:01:33.840> going<00:01:33.960> to

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
so i think that's the way I'm going to

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.539 
so i think that's the way I'm going to
do<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.500> see<00:01:34.680> how<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.860> actually<00:01:35.189> turns

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
do this and see how that actually turns

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.819 
do this and see how that actually turns
out<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.540> anyways<00:01:37.079> let's<00:01:37.110> get<00:01:37.409> going<00:01:37.650> I'm<00:01:37.740> going

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
out so anyways let's get going I'm going

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.319 
out so anyways let's get going I'm going
to<00:01:37.950> do<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.280> still<00:01:38.640> with<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:40.189> story<00:01:41.189> mode<00:01:41.579> so

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
to do this still with a on story mode so

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.990 
to do this still with a on story mode so
that<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.659> do<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.530> as<00:01:43.680> quickly<00:01:44.130> as<00:01:44.430> possible

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
that I can do it as quickly as possible

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.340 
that I can do it as quickly as possible
as<00:01:45.299> opposed<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.720> stealth<00:01:45.960> mode<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.229> stay

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
as opposed to the stealth mode and stay

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.929 
as opposed to the stealth mode and stay
out<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.470> their<00:01:46.590> sight<00:01:46.890> since<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.670> think<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.909> lot

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
out of their sight since I think a lot
