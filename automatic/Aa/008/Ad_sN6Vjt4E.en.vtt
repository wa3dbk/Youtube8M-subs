it's rated vo2 obviously a bit of a

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.910 
it's rated vo2 obviously a bit of a
nemesis<00:00:02.760> for<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:02.970> players<00:00:03.210> that<00:00:03.449> one<00:00:03.920> but

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
nemesis for the players that one but

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.349 
nemesis for the players that one but
it's<00:00:05.009> an<00:00:05.069> important<00:00:05.490> it's<00:00:05.700> an<00:00:05.790> important<00:00:06.180> test

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
it's an important it's an important test

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.270 
it's an important it's an important test
for<00:00:06.420> us<00:00:06.629> and<00:00:07.230> that<00:00:07.379> really<00:00:07.410> helps<00:00:07.950> us<00:00:08.069> build

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
for us and that really helps us build

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.120 
for us and that really helps us build
that<00:00:08.490> endurance<00:00:08.940> profile<00:00:09.420> so<00:00:09.840> we<00:00:09.870> can<00:00:10.139> see<00:00:11.420> the

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130 
that endurance profile so we can see the

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.609 
that endurance profile so we can see the
aerobic<00:00:14.130> fitness<00:00:14.309> levels<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.880> player<00:00:15.619> we

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
aerobic fitness levels of the player we

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.680 
aerobic fitness levels of the player we
can<00:00:16.800> look<00:00:16.980> at<00:00:17.190> how<00:00:17.609> efficient<00:00:18.090> they<00:00:18.210> are<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:18.600> we

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
can look at how efficient they are so we

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.160 
can look at how efficient they are so we
measure<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.560> vo2<00:00:19.949> max<00:00:20.220> how<00:00:20.850> much<00:00:21.090> oxygen<00:00:21.720> they

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
measure the vo2 max how much oxygen they

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.310 
measure the vo2 max how much oxygen they
can<00:00:22.320> provide<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.800> working<00:00:23.189> muscles<00:00:24.320> also

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
can provide to the working muscles also

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.759 
can provide to the working muscles also
a<00:00:25.830> nice<00:00:26.580> analogy<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.810> R<00:00:27.900> -<00:00:28.050> max<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.439> kind<00:00:28.680> of

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
a nice analogy is the R - max is kind of

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.320 
a nice analogy is the R - max is kind of
the<00:00:28.890> size<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.400> engine<00:00:29.699> but<00:00:29.910> we<00:00:30.060> want<00:00:30.269> to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
the size of the engine but we want to

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.730 
the size of the engine but we want to
know<00:00:30.420> where<00:00:30.570> interest<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.050> how<00:00:31.199> efficient

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
know where interest in how efficient

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.190 
know where interest in how efficient
engine<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.250> Alexa<00:00:32.969> we<00:00:33.480> measure<00:00:33.690> blood<00:00:33.899> lactate

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
engine is Alexa we measure blood lactate

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.110 
engine is Alexa we measure blood lactate
we<00:00:34.530> measure<00:00:34.680> heart<00:00:34.980> rate<00:00:35.040> for<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.370> t-test<00:00:35.760> and

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
we measure heart rate for a t-test and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.319 
we measure heart rate for a t-test and
what<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:36.930> can<00:00:37.200> give<00:00:37.350> us<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.520> measure<00:00:38.820> as<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> set

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
what I can give us is a measure as a set

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.569 
what I can give us is a measure as a set
of<00:00:39.540> how<00:00:39.750> efficient<00:00:40.320> how<00:00:41.010> efficiently<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
a pitch based on seemed quite grueling

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.779 
a pitch based on seemed quite grueling
for<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.270> players<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.870> they<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.770> even<00:00:50.489> put<00:00:50.760> a

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
for the players and they can even put a

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.880 
for the players and they can even put a
thumbs<00:00:50.969> up<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.360> number<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.500> level<00:00:52.770> of

thumbs up to the number of the level of
a<00:00:52.980> hard<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.520> going<00:00:53.789> isn't<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.090> yes<00:00:54.660> so

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
a hard it's going isn't it yes so

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.180 
a hard it's going isn't it yes so
there's<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.140> subjective<00:00:55.649> element<00:00:55.710> for<00:00:56.100> AB

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
there's a subjective element for AB

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.400 
there's a subjective element for AB
attest<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.730> every<00:00:57.149> minute<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:58.050> every<00:00:58.230> two

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
attest that every minute so every two

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.770 
attest that every minute so every two
minutes<00:00:58.680> will<00:00:58.829> ask<00:00:59.010> will<00:00:59.489> last<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.270> an<00:01:00.359> RPA<00:01:00.660> so

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
minutes will ask will last for an RPA so

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.049 
minutes will ask will last for an RPA so
it's<00:01:01.109> called<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.469> rate<00:01:01.739> perceived<00:01:02.070> exertion<00:01:02.190> so

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
it's called a rate perceived exertion so

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.690 
it's called a rate perceived exertion so
they'll<00:01:03.210> tell<00:01:03.390> us<00:01:03.449> on<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.350> scale<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.739> not<00:01:05.010> 6<00:01:05.549> to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
they'll tell us on a scale of not 6 to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.120 
they'll tell us on a scale of not 6 to
20<00:01:06.090> how<00:01:07.080> they're<00:01:07.260> feeling<00:01:07.409> 20<00:01:07.860> being<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
20 how they're feeling 20 being the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.649 
20 how they're feeling 20 being the
maximal<00:01:08.520> effort<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.060> towards<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.450> end<00:01:09.510> of

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
maximal effort so towards the end of

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.960 
maximal effort so towards the end of
their<00:01:09.780> test<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> way<00:01:10.619> up<00:01:10.740> until<00:01:10.970> 1920

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
their test on the way up until 1920

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.000 
their test on the way up until 1920
throughout<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> test<00:01:13.260> will<00:01:13.409> collect<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.830> gas

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
throughout the test will collect the gas

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.679 
throughout the test will collect the gas
will<00:01:14.310> collect<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.640> air<00:01:14.760> they<00:01:14.880> breathe<00:01:14.909> and

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
will collect the air they breathe and

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.480 
will collect the air they breathe and
that's<00:01:15.840> obviously<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.259> facility<00:01:16.830> as<00:01:17.159> well<00:01:17.369> as

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
that's obviously a facility as well as

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.649 
that's obviously a facility as well as
collecting<00:01:17.909> blood<00:01:18.150> which<00:01:18.360> are<00:01:18.479> not<00:01:18.600> available

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
collecting blood which are not available

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.560 
collecting blood which are not available
to<00:01:19.140> us<00:01:19.700> on<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.850> field<00:01:21.060> at<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.210> training

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
to us on the field at the training

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.910 
to us on the field at the training
ground<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:21.869> that's<00:01:21.960> why<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.470> run<00:01:22.680> during

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
ground so that's why we can run during

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.830 
ground so that's why we can run during
the<00:01:23.130> lab<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.610> gives<00:01:23.820> us<00:01:23.939> some<00:01:24.119> more

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the lab and it gives us some more

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.539 
the lab and it gives us some more
detailed<00:01:25.320> information<00:01:25.560> which<00:01:26.009> as<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.159> said<00:01:26.400> we

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
detailed information which as I said we

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.500 
detailed information which as I said we
can<00:01:26.729> then<00:01:26.850> use<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.810> daily

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
can then use on a daily

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.960 
can then use on a daily
in<00:01:28.630> training<00:01:29.050> but<00:01:29.890> it<00:01:30.010> but<00:01:30.220> it's<00:01:30.430> a<00:01:30.490> maximal

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
in training but it but it's a maximal

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.090 
in training but it but it's a maximal
test<00:01:31.240> so<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.140> end<00:01:32.290> of<00:01:32.410> the<00:01:32.500> test<00:01:32.740> is<00:01:32.890> just

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
test so the end of the test is just

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.140 
test so the end of the test is just
quite<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:35.200> know<00:01:35.260> it's<00:01:35.800> a<00:01:35.860> little<00:01:36.040> bit<00:01:36.160> painful

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
quite you know it's a little bit painful

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.640 
quite you know it's a little bit painful
you<00:01:37.540> know<00:01:37.630> we're<00:01:37.810> asking<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.260> players<00:01:38.470> to

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
you know we're asking the players to

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.900 
you know we're asking the players to
really<00:01:38.830> push<00:01:39.130> themselves<00:01:39.460> as<00:01:39.610> hard<00:01:39.820> as

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
really push themselves as hard as

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.960 
really push themselves as hard as
possible<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:41.050> that<00:01:41.890> gives<00:01:42.130> us<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.490> most

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
possible and that gives us the most
