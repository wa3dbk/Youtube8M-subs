00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.680 
going to talk a little bit later about
that<00:02:35.790> is<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.590> sometimes<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:38.549> can<00:02:38.910> select<00:02:39.329> a

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
that is that sometimes you can select a

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.830 
that is that sometimes you can select a
lower<00:02:39.930> resolution<00:02:40.260> at<00:02:40.860> 480p<00:02:41.430> instead<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.150> 720p

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
lower resolution at 480p instead of 720p

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.720 
lower resolution at 480p instead of 720p
and<00:02:43.049> it<00:02:43.230> will<00:02:43.440> look<00:02:43.620> great<00:02:43.680> anyway<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.610> it

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
and it will look great anyway and it

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.330 
and it will look great anyway and it
will<00:02:45.060> be<00:02:45.150> smaller<00:02:45.450> but<00:02:46.290> what<00:02:46.799> I<00:02:46.829> want<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.160> show

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
under Ubuntu I can do the same thing

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.010 
under Ubuntu I can do the same thing
which<00:05:08.190> would<00:05:08.520> be<00:05:08.729> great<00:05:09.090> but<00:05:09.479> I'm<00:05:09.690> assuming

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020

for now that this is available only on
