00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.260
 we're back now with four lesson 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.960
 that in the remastered version of halo 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.150
 of master chip collection is called blood 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.089
 line and tell me camus I know that this is 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.860
 a much broader map and then how do we 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.110
 you said the sniper are sure to the 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.410
 order of the day then what about the 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.680
 battle rifle still cashless or not 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.450
 account then indeed this map is the 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.039
 wider we have in the 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.470
 remastering and kilo of master 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.080
 collection then if the person is 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.090
 the most useful weapon of this map we have a 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.160
 sniper force base here at the bottom we have 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.019
 the blue base that has its slider and the 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.400
 red base that you also have sniper each 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.620
 team is going to start with a sprinter 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.180
 own and well and everyone knows 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.850
 who saluting depending on who is 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.559
 the best in the tec then restore your 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.210
 Battle Rifle question three times 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.309
 of battery is still very useful because 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.920
 because despite being an average weapon 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.629
 We also have another function distance 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.539
 What can we do to you? 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.590
 battle matrix as we can see 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.059
 then the bcv 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.890
 of battle even though they are very 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.780
 away components you can shoot 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.780
 perfectly fine and you will give it 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.450
 simply the preferences blog will 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.430
 you must use the zoom so we can be 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.840
 better control of the weapon but it is seen 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.760
 debated is still very good 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.590
 distance loses practically nothing 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.180
 of effectiveness today we are going to see but 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.880
 talk better than me here I see about 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.740
 vehicles that are different in the line 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.750
 with the fabulist and what is the difference 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.580
 with the difference is that in coagulation 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.190
 Most of the vehicles we have 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.290
 there were the youngsters now in the 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.380
 remastered we have the vehicles of 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.760
 the nfc then now instead of the bar 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.340
 if we have in the back are 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.369
 FornÃ©s instead of the excursion we have 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.729
 what is already a warhol and 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.900
 we also have a gong that is 9 is 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.540
 the new vehicle that will add the 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.070
 remastering that is a mongoose but 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.920
 with the ability to shoot today that 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.540
 it is incredible 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.009
 and of course also on this map 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.420
 we find another weapon of power that 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.780
 is the block to which we can find 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.030
 in the center of the map and then to download 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.610
 of fiber all the gifts that can 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.920
 get to bother quite 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.440
 excellent and what is another of the 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.670
 differences that your introduction tells 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.800
 well the difference is that in the 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.110
 remastering we have a structure 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.760
 in the center that allows a bit of 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.850
 vehicular combat and also has 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.380
 some ramps to go down but also 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.510
 one of the main issues is that in 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.560
 the bases here we have 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.390
 teletransporters and now in the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:36.459
 remastering we have more canon and that 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.380
 they take us to the center of the map then 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.150
 are mainly those of the change of 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.070
 vehicles the banks structure us in 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.810
 the center and the changes in some 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.670
 stones so that the game or the line of 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.980
 shot are more direct and the bases 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.290
 they have some differentiator like that is the 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.120
 bases in this remastering have a 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.530
 order above them that the 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.910
 value of each one for example in the base 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.830
 that we have a background in blue has a 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.570
 blue orb and at the red base has a 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.010
 red orb that tells us what color it is 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.190
 each base to make it easier 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.960
 identify images and move 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.960
 people like me
