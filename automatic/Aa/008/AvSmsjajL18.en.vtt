 week number 26 already beast a week 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.900
 speak to other app farmers 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.059
 discuss samsung discuss symbolism 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.589
 providers and we address the oneplus 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.089
 but we start with the apple watch the 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:19.409
 avalanche is apple has come her 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:21.779
 that you namely come to the Netherlands 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:23.039
 apple watch will be you in one from July 17 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.359
 land available 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.329
 it lives and I do device one 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.079
 starting price of 349 euros and for 349 euros 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.479
 got in the 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.430
 very nice watch dionne baby is smart 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:33.960
 but although the battery is around 18 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.699
 so it's about the will 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.140
 especially check out our has a wiki 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:37.680
 He is coming and I am going to the Netherlands 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.329
 and 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.460
 can bring home again you can go to 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.140
 apparently belsimpel.nl because 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.640
 that is in bright mag and not import 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.539
 so buy one the spread and the sea 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.699
 so good 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.320
 very neighborhood by the way the negative 100 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.359
 more expensive than in Germany 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.280
 is yours or that we can do that 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.749
 even though we continue to 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.640
 galaxy s6 all my previous theory 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:58.829
 of course, the necessary to grumble about 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.199
 when i like to see we very much very 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.820
 many discussions arose through travel 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.230
 youtube with us the city ​​of the whole 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.390
 therefore like to thank find really like him 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.190
 with a galaxy 6 it just hurts 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.450
 well and let's be honest one of them 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.030
 problems but it is very beautiful 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.970
 telephone good telephone screen good 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.680
 camera in that consumer also looks 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.430
 because he is selling a huge amount 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.650
 be this year 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.630
 analysts estimate around 45 million 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.330
 shipped models of care of the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.770
 galaxy s6 nss exam woman thing that 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.300
 in between it is not entirely clear what 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.080
 well all what well the best sale 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.850
 just think of ss so yes samsung 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.530
 does very well 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.700
 25 million is a bit more the less 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.960
 then samsung that money that hoped 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.880
 actually at 50 but I think silo 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.610
 I will let one come to live there 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.840
 on the next one pee of course 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.370
 we have a lot of people on it 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.990
 wait the hand was live send and david 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.610
 successful companies did that too 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.710
 unknown but still secretly one 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.470
 subsidiary of op is nevertheless 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.150
 the oneplus is on its way to 27 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.050
 July then is also arrived by 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.820
 oneplus 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.500
 that will be done specially through a live 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.690
 stream on the internet and this live 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.640
 stream that you can follow in 360 degrees 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.600
 them convincingly during streaming 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.400
 so you can actually film 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.830
 look around and therefore at the 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.119
 press conference in one 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.979
 what does and will follow with or 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.990
 actually with the virtual reality glasses yes 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.310
 it is really very cool 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.750
 we continue with apple because I have 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.280
 here in my hand my iphone 6 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.990
 plus caught and I really like it 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.760
 phone beyond the fact that you are way too 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.800
 great is largely due is 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.270
 home button and apple has for that now 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.340
 good news it seems because apple has 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.530
 a technique thought that she 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.150
 fingerprint sensor that sits here that 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.680
 they can handle the screen 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.300
 that actually means that hopefully 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.610
 peace can be time and that would mean 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.200
 that also estimates the tablets from apple 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.850
 soon there will be a few compact pieces 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.440
 which are more handy so I can see that very well 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.270
 like to sit probably still see that 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.400
 not in the iphone 6s or the iphone 6s 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.200
 plus such a phone with virtual 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.760
 software home button and that cap and 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.010
 hardware-based home button 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.600
 but maybe the iphone 7 possibly that 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.220
 and you could have what me 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.720
 that may happen, yes, as far as I am concerned 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.300
 also concerns and I hope that I do not 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.560
 in the iphone 6s but the seventh after 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.140
 that is how we re-design 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.459
 and that round button is large and 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.590
 a little bit i just added 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.990
 android words windows phone yes then to 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.100
 to close this week 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.930
 research from telecompaper 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.640
 proved that more and more Dutch people 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.260
 go for a symbolic moment with the 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.760
 the phone also have moose and or 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.050
 I had this also check on us 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.120
 Youtube Channel 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.620
 but indeed it the trends and went too 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.600
 More and more Dutch are real 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.040
 was a form by phone at additional 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.650
 so choose to pay 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.910
 simoni at moments for old simyo or 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.380
 simple whatever 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.910
 and therefore they are cheap out there 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.400
 then simply opt for cheap 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.900
 telephone between 200 and 300 euros 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.430
 and well really kind of win-win situation 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.230
 consumer disadvantage is duration 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.550
 summer fruit tattoo shoot some with 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.170
 you do not want that opt ​​for normal 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.850
 at the moment but everyone who ever does 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.350
 is cheaper at the bottom 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.760
 so indeed still a whole 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.830
 interesting trend 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.690
 yes, that was him again, they say 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.430
 again as with a nice bouncer 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.750
 develop the simoni in the netherlands 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.100
 next to him again I course 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.780
 new cultivation week tomorrow we are going again 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.850

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.200
 we go in our new belgian colleague 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.940
 talking about the oneplus does the 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.320
 definitely switch on and we wish you now 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.560
 have a great Saturday 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.560
 adios
