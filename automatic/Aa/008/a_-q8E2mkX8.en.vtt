00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.700
 we will go back in time with klein 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.700
 the historian who dreamed of being a railway 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.090
 in this machine launched at great 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:22.899
 speed we have however encountered at 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.480
 a still traveler clea flaminia and 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:27.009
 historian is passionate about paths 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.969
 of iron 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:34.890
 his thing is to travel back in time 

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:34.890
 direction the 19th century 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.149
 I have a very old engraving that 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.100
 watercolor dating from 1846 which is the 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.170
 first station the ground is not everything 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.110
 given and we vote for etam who are there in 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.640
 currie and these ladies raises the rose 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.989
 precaution because of walking a little 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.530
 in the foam and it's a bit complicated 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.290
 it's very hard judged unworthy of the 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.930
 capital this first station and shaved 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.589
 twenty years after its construction for 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.259
 give way to the current building 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:09.440
 an ode to modern travel where every 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.770
 statue is christened london lille or at 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.920
 amsterdam from number of destinations 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.110
 served by the North Network is the 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.850
 more important he can say the first 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.700
 lady of strength with obviously that's 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.649
 party between the old lady of stone and 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.890
 the man of letters the love story 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.899
 goes back to childhood 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.140
 when he discovers the North Station 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.509
 kleib at age eight and he arrives from his 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.810
 Great native Brittany to settle 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.170
 in Paris with his parents 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.610
 you were crazy in the 50s 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.620
 the mood was completely different 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.170
 first the sound atmosphere the sounds of 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.420
 the steam these monsters he was smoking who 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:58.229
 was heating up and there was an atmosphere 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:59.670
 to know in smoke the journey on the way of 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.509
 iron was something extremely healthy 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.509
 saying trying 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.490
 at the time to come from london in 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.370
 boat then by train it was necessary near 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.650
 12 hours 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.110
 it takes less than May 2 at the garden of 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.790
 onlookers yet there is one who 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.120
 are more interested in the sets than 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.830
 hero for clyde line at once 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.950
 historian here son 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.629
 the train station is a great source 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.629
 inspired by novelesque 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.959
 the cema immediately understood 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.659
 the importance of the station as the 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.450
 place par excellence and other varieties 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:45.540
 separation of the essential points of the 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.569
 Sudanese tsonga life and when the reality 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.310
 does not live up to the fiction 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.200
 klein plays the consultants for 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.340
 allow filmmakers to reconstruct 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.859
 an authentic decor 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.890
 the last one to ask him to 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:01.769
 help is called martin scorsese for 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.079
 his film Hugo Klein sent her 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.260
 nearly 800 archival documents on the 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:09.450
 north station t the third second of the 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.129
 movie we dive inside the train station 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.079
 from the north I recognized all the photos 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.849
 immediately and helped me to go around 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.650
 I find wonderful for example this 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.470
 famous hanging clock in which 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.189
 hugo executives were a hundred and hid in 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.319
 interior 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:24.120
 monitor naggar movements and well 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.459
 this money never existed forever 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.109
 in the clock stations suspended ggp 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.350
 do a lot of the sprain in history 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:38.750
 the story of a solid soul 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:42.020
 m all but one at the controls of this 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:46.670
 miniature locomotive the only railroad 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:49.660
 it's clyde &amp; mail to play him 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.660
 never goes on strike 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.610
 every day when your job 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.060
 it's for me an overtaking to do 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.080
 a way of doing that signals 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.680
 operate to watch ordered from 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.420
 cabins 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.040
 so that's to take care of all this 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.390
 very delicate little mechanics and 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.190
 capricious who is resting 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.890
 the banks are thinking 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.480
 and finally I will change my signal 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.760
 hurting the trains 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.739
 hull all they are enlightened 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.660
 it's true that in the evening I can 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.030
 also maneuver and sharpening bias 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.479
 here I am still in a night guard 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.889
 the night in best and play at the small 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.620
 train for live 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.680
 so it's a very serious case in 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:36.160
 40 years the historian ended up transforming 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.930
 his apartment in a museum dedicated staff 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.270
 to the glory of the trains that made the 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.820
 great hours from the north station of the 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.620
 last steam locomotive 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.090
 nicknamed the divine this is a 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.250
 perfect model 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.820
 yes and she can actually walk to the 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.520
 steam to the railcar that achieves a 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:58.570
 exploit by putting Lille at three o'clock 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.820
 of paris has risen if we can say to 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.930
 the time of the 30s his home north 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.410
 by the way 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.390
 here is the most legendary train 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:11.020
 Here we are here to train you 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:13.570
 throws of a French train of 1928 which 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.220
 represents with ac of accuracy the 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.229
 famous train the golden arrow the north 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.930
 was the most beautiful or full network 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.419
 speed prestige cleanliness of the trains 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.210
 Accuracy it was our disgust China 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:27.940
 tags it still remains 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.650
 some but that's not why 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.040
 that klein comes to the station 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.040
 today 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:40.700
 p funk shit normally it's 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.320
 modern mechanics hello 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:47.600
 computing little rendezvous in 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.640
 will find railways for a 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.490
 guided tour of what we will call you 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.640
 the marina back shop 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:06:00.110
 I already had a very 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:02.390
 a long time and we will have for 150 years 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.950
 it is in these warehouses that all 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.690
 northern trains were serviced 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.510
 mended 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.910
 it's that silence a year ago 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.220
 the building was abandoned for 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.010
 more functional premises and lend to 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:22.330
 associations that restore old 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:22.330
 trains on the arts of northern paris 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.070
 what a collection of material from 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:33.210
 several associations that are rhdp here 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:35.400
 so natural with 6180 he known as the 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.560
 name of little gray this is the last 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.000
 retired at the train station 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.250
 North 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.540
 here also some of the most evil is born 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:47.250
 in the 1960s when it came out 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.750
 they symbolized in spite of herself 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.840
 then what I would call time 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.540
 rowing that morning the progress was 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.090
 absolutely hate and symbolize it 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:00.500
 which we called the metro feeds you only 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:03.210
 it's not metro but for people 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.870
 powerful were young of the facts his 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.750
 universe 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.310
 here we can not advance in the 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.200
 first car that will control in 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.140
 the flow agrees the first class 

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.450
 today restore the old trains of 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.410
 suburb will allow clyde to 

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.250
 Make a dream come true 

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.250
 how 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:25.240
 can we put the contact will only be 

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:25.240
 installed on the handles of the machine 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:32.509
 there was light 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.159
 ok I'm like a child who 

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:36.860
 revive his childhood because the Maghreb 

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:38.419
 played but rarely has it but that's 

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.090
 true that a toy like this one size 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:43.550
 nature makes me dream it's like we say 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.090
 heavy but indestructible 

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.940
 magnificent 

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.770
 before becoming a brilliant 

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.990
 academic kleib would have liked to 

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:53.960
 slip into the shoes of a railway worker to 

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:56.710
 his 76 years the little gray and finally offers 

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.710
 this chance
