hi I'm mark Clement and welcome to

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.140 
hi I'm mark Clement and welcome to
recipt<00:00:10.460> saw<00:00:10.700> 101<00:00:11.740> the<00:00:12.740> key<00:00:13.040> to<00:00:13.250> demolition<00:00:13.639> is

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
recipt saw 101 the key to demolition is

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.380 
recipt saw 101 the key to demolition is
smart<00:00:14.960> demolition<00:00:15.680> and<00:00:15.889> the<00:00:16.400> technique<00:00:16.880> I<00:00:17.090> use

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
smart demolition and the technique I use

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.810 
smart demolition and the technique I use
for<00:00:17.630> that<00:00:17.660> is<00:00:18.050> plunge<00:00:18.590> cutting<00:00:19.099> it's<00:00:19.610> all

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
for that is plunge cutting it's all

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.060 
for that is plunge cutting it's all
about<00:00:20.029> getting<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.570> shoe<00:00:20.869> in<00:00:21.230> the<00:00:21.349> blade<00:00:21.650> at

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
about getting the shoe in the blade at

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.580 
about getting the shoe in the blade at
the<00:00:22.240> optimum<00:00:23.240> angle<00:00:23.480> of<00:00:23.720> attack<00:00:23.840> for<00:00:24.320> the<00:00:24.380> work

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
the optimum angle of attack for the work

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.740 
the optimum angle of attack for the work
I'm<00:00:24.800> doing<00:00:24.830> in<00:00:25.460> some<00:00:26.210> cases

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
I'm doing in some cases

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.010 
I'm doing in some cases
I'll<00:00:26.990> have<00:00:27.770> wide<00:00:28.730> open<00:00:29.090> access<00:00:29.270> to<00:00:29.689> the<00:00:29.810> work

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
I'll have wide open access to the work

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.910 
I'll have wide open access to the work
so<00:00:30.980> I<00:00:31.010> can<00:00:31.279> put<00:00:31.520> the<00:00:31.670> blade<00:00:31.939> in<00:00:32.559> what<00:00:33.559> I'd<00:00:33.710> call

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
so I can put the blade in what I'd call

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.299 
so I can put the blade in what I'd call
right<00:00:34.309> side<00:00:34.610> up<00:00:34.879> in<00:00:35.150> other<00:00:35.540> cases<00:00:35.930> I<00:00:36.379> might<00:00:37.070> not

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
right side up in other cases I might not

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.610 
right side up in other cases I might not
have<00:00:37.340> great<00:00:38.000> access<00:00:38.479> to<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.780> work<00:00:39.019> and<00:00:39.229> I<00:00:39.320> want

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
have great access to the work and I want

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.640 
have great access to the work and I want
the<00:00:39.800> saw<00:00:40.010> to<00:00:40.070> have<00:00:40.339> a<00:00:40.370> lower<00:00:40.790> angle<00:00:41.120> of<00:00:41.449> attack

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
the saw to have a lower angle of attack

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.590 
the saw to have a lower angle of attack
so<00:00:42.650> I'll<00:00:42.800> turn<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:43.190> blade<00:00:43.489> upside<00:00:43.970> down<00:00:44.269> and

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
so I'll turn the blade upside down and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.649 
so I'll turn the blade upside down and
I'll<00:00:45.019> turn<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.470> saw<00:00:45.739> upside<00:00:46.339> down<00:00:46.640> which<00:00:47.449> will

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:47.659 
I'll turn the saw upside down which will

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:50.289 
I'll turn the saw upside down which will
give<00:00:47.870> me<00:00:48.019> a<00:00:48.049> different<00:00:48.640> approach<00:00:49.640> to<00:00:49.699> the<00:00:50.089> work

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:50.299 
give me a different approach to the work

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:52.930 
give me a different approach to the work
and<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:50.690> way<00:00:51.379> we<00:00:51.559> get<00:00:51.710> started<00:00:52.280> is<00:00:52.430> with<00:00:52.760> the

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
and the way we get started is with the

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:15.790 
and the way we get started is with the
plunge<00:00:53.210> cut<00:00:54.940> so<00:00:55.940> what<00:00:56.089> I<00:00:56.120> can<00:00:56.239> do<00:00:56.540> here

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.770 

you<00:01:16.800> use<00:01:17.010> a<00:01:17.040> tool<00:01:17.430> for<00:01:17.790> what<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.150> best<00:01:18.450> for

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
you use a tool for what it's best for

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.890 
you use a tool for what it's best for
now<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.860> remove<00:01:20.160> much<00:01:20.580> more<00:01:20.820> drywall<00:01:21.450> now

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
now I can remove much more drywall now

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.100 
now I can remove much more drywall now
with<00:01:22.830> my<00:01:23.040> hands<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.940> can<00:01:24.180> with<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.540> saw<00:01:24.810> by

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
with my hands then I can with the saw by

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.620 
with my hands then I can with the saw by
disabling<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.650> fasteners<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:33.060> whole<00:01:33.270> sheet

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
disabling the fasteners the whole sheet

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.950 
disabling the fasteners the whole sheet
and<00:01:33.870> that<00:01:34.250> goes<00:01:35.250> right<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.910> trash<00:01:36.150> when<00:01:36.840> it

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
and that goes right in the trash when it

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.180 
and that goes right in the trash when it
comes<00:01:37.260> to<00:01:37.530> taking<00:01:37.830> an<00:01:38.100> actual<00:01:38.520> wall<00:01:38.970> apart

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
comes to taking an actual wall apart

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.470 
comes to taking an actual wall apart
people<00:01:41.190> see<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.760> this<00:01:41.910> went<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.300> with<00:01:42.450> a

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
people see that this went in with a

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.540 
people see that this went in with a
hammer<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> guess<00:01:43.410> the<00:01:43.620> initial<00:01:44.010> reaction

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
hammer and I guess the initial reaction

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.070 
hammer and I guess the initial reaction
is<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.060> should<00:01:45.240> come<00:01:45.420> out<00:01:45.540> with<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.780> hammer

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
is that it should come out with a hammer

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.070 
is that it should come out with a hammer
but<00:01:46.800> I<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.490> take<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.850> out<00:01:47.940> faster<00:01:48.570> more

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
but I can take it out faster more

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.320 
but I can take it out faster more
effectively<00:01:49.770> with<00:01:50.190> way<00:01:50.460> less<00:01:50.490> dust<00:01:51.090> and

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
effectively with way less dust and

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.810 
effectively with way less dust and
collateral<00:01:51.840> damage<00:01:52.320> if<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:53.040> simply<00:01:53.460> cut<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
collateral damage if I simply cut the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.670 
collateral damage if I simply cut the
fasteners

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.440 

you<00:02:00.680> hear<00:02:00.830> the<00:02:00.979> sound<00:02:01.250> change<00:02:01.640> that<00:02:02.030> means<00:02:02.180> I'm

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
you hear the sound change that means I'm

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:13.670 
you hear the sound change that means I'm
into<00:02:02.720> a<00:02:02.750> fastener<00:02:03.350> in<00:02:03.500> here

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.710 

low<00:02:14.680> impact<00:02:15.129> is<00:02:15.400> how<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:15.640> make<00:02:15.970> your<00:02:16.000> Big<00:02:16.420> Bang

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
low impact is how you make your Big Bang

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.940 
low impact is how you make your Big Bang
so<00:02:17.349> thanks<00:02:17.739> for<00:02:17.860> watching<00:02:17.920> tool<00:02:18.610> school
