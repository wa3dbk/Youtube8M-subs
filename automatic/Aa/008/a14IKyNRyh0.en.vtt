map<00:00:15.809> so<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.350> wanted<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.130> be<00:00:17.250> pretty<00:00:17.460> tactical

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
map so I wanted to be pretty tactical

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.000

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
and try to save as many units as I could

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.570 
and try to save as many units as I could
while<00:00:20.220> getting<00:00:20.520> all<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> golden<00:00:21.090> elixir<00:00:21.500> so

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
while getting all the golden elixir so

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.950 
while getting all the golden elixir so
to<00:00:23.580> start<00:00:23.760> off<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.119> dropped<00:00:24.359> some<00:00:24.480> archers<00:00:24.810> on

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
to start off I dropped some archers on

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.500 
to start off I dropped some archers on
the<00:00:25.019> outside<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.740> destroy<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.510> buildings

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
the outside to destroy the buildings

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.089 
the outside to destroy the buildings
that<00:00:27.570> were<00:00:27.750> unprotected<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.859> just

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
that were unprotected so I just

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.209 
that were unprotected so I just
scattered<00:00:29.490> them<00:00:29.609> out<00:00:30.199> and<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.650> just<00:00:31.920> gave<00:00:32.070> me

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
scattered them out and this just gave me

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.440 
scattered them out and this just gave me
a<00:00:32.250> head<00:00:32.430> start<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.940> where<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.090> didn't<00:00:33.300> have<00:00:33.360> to

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
a head start so where I didn't have to

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.120 
a head start so where I didn't have to
drop<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.719> bunch<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.050> units<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.559> here<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.800> dropped

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
the wizard tower that was standing in my

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.069 
the wizard tower that was standing in my
way<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.840> middle<00:00:41.660> so<00:00:42.660> I'm<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:42.870> going<00:00:42.989> to

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
way in the middle so I'm just going to

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.380 
way in the middle so I'm just going to
let<00:00:43.200> my<00:00:43.290> archers<00:00:43.620> go<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.829> work<00:00:44.010> at<00:00:44.219> first<00:00:44.460> I'm

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
let my archers go to work at first I'm

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.790 
let my archers go to work at first I'm
and<00:00:45.600> attack<00:00:45.840> all<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.079> things<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.500> were<00:00:46.649> out

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
and attack all the things that were out

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.330 
and attack all the things that were out
of<00:00:46.829> range<00:00:47.930> from<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.110> towers<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.920> cannons

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
of range from the towers and the cannons

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.889 
of range from the towers and the cannons
etc<00:00:52.730> so<00:00:53.730> now<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:53.910> see<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.360> gold<00:00:54.570> right<00:00:54.870> there

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
etc so now I see that gold right there

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.779 
etc so now I see that gold right there
I'm<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.320> going<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.469> drop<00:00:55.620> some<00:00:55.829> goblins<00:00:56.039> it's

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
I'm just going to drop some goblins it's

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.639 
I'm just going to drop some goblins it's
completely<00:00:57.480> unprotected<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.500> just

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
completely unprotected so I can just

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.250 
completely unprotected so I can just
drop<00:00:59.219> about<00:00:59.789> 15<00:01:00.239> goblins<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.809> take<00:01:00.989> care<00:01:01.170> of

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.730 
drop about 15 goblins to take care of
that<00:01:05.540> so<00:01:06.540> now<00:01:06.659> my<00:01:06.780> archers<00:01:07.170> are<00:01:07.320> starting<00:01:07.619> to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
that so now my archers are starting to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.830 
that so now my archers are starting to
take<00:01:07.920> care<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.189> more<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.939> buildings<00:01:09.570> and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
take care of more of the buildings and

take care of more of the buildings and
they're<00:01:09.990> starting<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.409> get<00:01:10.470> destroyed<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.340> I

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
they're starting to get destroyed so I

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.300 
they're starting to get destroyed so I
can<00:01:11.549> get<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.900> elixir<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.860> gold

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
can get to the the elixir and the gold

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.990 
can get to the the elixir and the gold
in<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.580> middle<00:01:16.490> so<00:01:17.490> I'm<00:01:17.549> just<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.850> keep

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
in the middle so I'm just going to keep

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.390 
in the middle so I'm just going to keep
dropping<00:01:18.180> some<00:01:18.479> archers<00:01:18.840> trying<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.200> steal

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
buildings by just using one unit to

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.130 
buildings by just using one unit to
destroy<00:01:24.210> them<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:25.580> anything<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:27.780> what<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> did

of that goldmine and take care of that

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.020 
of that goldmine and take care of that
one<00:02:00.570> as<00:02:00.720> well<00:02:00.980> as<00:02:01.980> well<00:02:02.220> as<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.400> elixir<00:02:02.670> on<00:02:02.940> the

one as well as well as the elixir on the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.540 
one as well as well as the elixir on the
bottom<00:02:03.710> so<00:02:04.710> now<00:02:04.800> that<00:02:04.860> all<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:05.160> outside

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
bottom so now that all the outside

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.940 
bottom so now that all the outside
forces<00:02:05.820> are<00:02:06.300> gone<00:02:06.990> or<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.500> buildings<00:02:07.830> are

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
forces are gone or the buildings are

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.280 
forces are gone or the buildings are
gone<00:02:08.070> I'm<00:02:08.970> going<00:02:09.210> to<00:02:09.270> do<00:02:09.390> two<00:02:09.660> wall<00:02:09.869> or<00:02:10.050> two

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
gone I'm going to do two wall or two

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.170 
gone I'm going to do two wall or two
giants<00:02:10.710> to<00:02:10.860> distract<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.460> towers<00:02:11.850> and<00:02:12.120> then

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
giants to distract the towers and then

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.940 
giants to distract the towers and then
I'm<00:02:12.270> going<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.420> drop<00:02:12.600> two<00:02:12.840> wall<00:02:13.410> breakers<00:02:13.740> to

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
I'm going to drop two wall breakers to

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.680 
I'm going to drop two wall breakers to
destroy<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.370> wall<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:15.209> way<00:02:15.390> they're<00:02:15.660> not

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
destroy the wall that way they're not

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.420 
destroy the wall that way they're not
shot<00:02:16.110> by<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.320> cannons<00:02:16.709> or<00:02:16.800> mortars<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.340> now<00:02:17.400> I

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
shot by the cannons or mortars and now I

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.140 
shot by the cannons or mortars and now I
can<00:02:17.670> drop<00:02:17.820> my<00:02:17.910> goblins<00:02:19.550> free<00:02:20.550> from<00:02:20.820> being

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
can drop my goblins free from being

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.500 
can drop my goblins free from being
attacked<00:02:22.790> all<00:02:23.790> right<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:24.060> now<00:02:24.180> pretty<00:02:24.420> much

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
attacked all right so now pretty much

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.840 
attacked all right so now pretty much
I've<00:02:24.780> taken<00:02:25.110> all<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.440> gold<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.700> last

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
I've taken all the gold so the last

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.280 
I've taken all the gold so the last
thing<00:02:27.030> remaining<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.570> elixir<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:28.200> I'm

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
thing remaining is the elixir so I'm

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.500 
thing remaining is the elixir so I'm
going<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.500> drop<00:02:28.790> what<00:02:29.790> I'm<00:02:29.880> going<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.060> do<00:02:30.270> is

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
going to drop what I'm going to do is

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.070 
going to drop what I'm going to do is
that<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:32.120> can<00:02:33.120> try<00:02:33.300> just<00:02:33.510> drop<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.840> wall

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
that I can try just drop the wall

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.050 
that I can try just drop the wall
breakers<00:02:34.440> there<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:35.010> destroy<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.550> walls<00:02:35.760> I

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
breakers there to destroy the walls I

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.000 
breakers there to destroy the walls I
actually<00:02:36.300> messed<00:02:36.630> up<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.590> I'm<00:02:37.650> gonna<00:02:37.770> have<00:02:37.920> to

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
actually messed up so I'm gonna have to

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.100 
actually messed up so I'm gonna have to
destroy<00:02:38.340> some<00:02:38.670> use<00:02:39.060> some<00:02:39.239> goblins<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.810> destroy

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
destroy some use some goblins to destroy

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.050 
destroy some use some goblins to destroy
the<00:02:40.230> wall<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.590> then<00:02:41.489> I'm<00:02:41.550> just<00:02:41.580> going<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.820> pour

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
the wall and then I'm just going to pour

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.910 
the wall and then I'm just going to pour
goblins<00:02:42.480> inside<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:43.140> take<00:02:43.350> care<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.739> last

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
goblins inside to take care of the last

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.750 
goblins inside to take care of the last
elixir<00:02:46.040> all<00:02:47.040> right<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.400> I've<00:02:47.489> pretty<00:02:47.670> much

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
elixir all right so I've pretty much

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.610 
elixir all right so I've pretty much
robbed<00:02:48.060> him<00:02:48.239> clean<00:02:48.480> at<00:02:49.050> this<00:02:49.260> point<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.560> don't

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
robbed him clean at this point I don't

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.530 
robbed him clean at this point I don't
really<00:02:49.800> care<00:02:50.010> about<00:02:50.220> getting<00:02:50.520> 100%<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.390> was

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
really care about getting 100% I was

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.080 
really care about getting 100% I was
just<00:02:51.720> trying<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:51.959> steal<00:02:52.170> this<00:02:52.320> golden<00:02:52.650> elixir

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
just trying to steal this golden elixir

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.850 
just trying to steal this golden elixir
but<00:02:54.090> as<00:02:54.269> you<00:02:54.390> can<00:02:54.510> see<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:55.110> was<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.320> pretty<00:02:55.739> big

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
but as you can see it was a pretty big

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.400 
but as you can see it was a pretty big
haul<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:56.549> again<00:02:57.150> try<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.480> minimize<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.290> amount

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
haul so again try to minimize the amount

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.110 
haul so again try to minimize the amount
of<00:02:58.530> units<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:58.950> have<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.160> use<00:02:59.340> by<00:02:59.549> just<00:02:59.880> using

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
of units you have to use by just using

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.140 
of units you have to use by just using
one<00:03:00.450> Archer<00:03:00.840> against<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:02.610> buildings

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
one Archer against the the buildings

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.520 
one Archer against the the buildings
that<00:03:03.239> are<00:03:03.299> unprotected<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.290> will<00:03:04.380> help

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
that are unprotected and that will help

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.960 
that are unprotected and that will help
you<00:03:04.709> in<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:04.890> long<00:03:05.040> run<00:03:05.070> that<00:03:05.489> way<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:05.730> can

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
you in the long run that way you can

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.400 
you in the long run that way you can
save<00:03:06.209> up<00:03:06.360> units<00:03:06.720> for<00:03:06.900> when<00:03:07.019> you<00:03:07.110> need<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.260> go

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
save up units for when you need to go

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.500 
save up units for when you need to go
inside<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.950> base<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.400> take<00:03:09.299> what's

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
inside the base and take what's

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.170 
inside the base and take what's
remaining<00:03:10.040> so<00:03:11.040> overall<00:03:11.459> just<00:03:11.700> using<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.030> bunch

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
remaining so overall just using a bunch

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.610 
remaining so overall just using a bunch
of<00:03:12.299> goblins<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.810> archers<00:03:13.110> doesn't<00:03:13.500> really

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
of goblins and archers doesn't really

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.830 
of goblins and archers doesn't really
cost<00:03:13.860> me<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.100> lot<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.310> elixir<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:14.970> did<00:03:15.630> have<00:03:15.750> to

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
cost me a lot of elixir I did have to

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.360 
cost me a lot of elixir I did have to
use<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.989> couple<00:03:16.320> wall<00:03:16.590> breakers<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.070> Giants

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
use a couple wall breakers and Giants

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.580 
use a couple wall breakers and Giants
but<00:03:17.549> it<00:03:17.670> wasn't<00:03:18.269> really<00:03:18.390> that<00:03:18.600> much<00:03:18.660> so<00:03:19.260> as<00:03:19.470> you

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
but it wasn't really that much so as you

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.430 
but it wasn't really that much so as you
can<00:03:19.680> see<00:03:19.739> I<00:03:20.130> won<00:03:20.820> 300<00:03:21.269> thousand<00:03:21.540> gold<00:03:21.720> 250

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
can see I won 300 thousand gold 250

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.900 
can see I won 300 thousand gold 250
thousand<00:03:22.739> elixir<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.549> was<00:03:23.640> pretty<00:03:23.820> easy

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
thousand elixir and that was pretty easy

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.020 
thousand elixir and that was pretty easy
so<00:03:24.900> if<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.769> ever<00:03:25.860> see<00:03:26.070> a<00:03:26.100> base<00:03:26.280> like<00:03:26.489> this<00:03:26.519> use

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
so if you ever see a base like this use

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.240 
so if you ever see a base like this use
this<00:03:27.239> strategy<00:03:27.510> I'm<00:03:28.290> actually<00:03:28.500> releasing

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
this strategy I'm actually releasing

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.430 
this strategy I'm actually releasing
another<00:03:30.120> video<00:03:30.450> that's<00:03:30.660> about<00:03:30.780> 15<00:03:31.170> minutes

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
another video that's about 15 minutes

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.560 
another video that's about 15 minutes
long<00:03:31.650> it's<00:03:32.459> going<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.640> come<00:03:32.760> out<00:03:32.790> either<00:03:33.060> today

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
long it's going to come out either today

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.940 
long it's going to come out either today
or<00:03:33.600> tomorrow<00:03:33.720> that's<00:03:34.470> going<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.680> have<00:03:34.769> more
