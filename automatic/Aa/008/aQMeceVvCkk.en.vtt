00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
the athlete doesn't cut that squash Ward

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.350 
the athlete doesn't cut that squash Ward
that's<00:01:48.710> not<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:48.980> legitimate<00:01:49.460> squat<00:01:49.970> we<00:01:50.150> want

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
that's not a legitimate squat we want

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.850 
that's not a legitimate squat we want

that crease at the hip and below the

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.920 
that crease at the hip and below the
knee<00:01:52.040> it's<00:01:52.490> very<00:01:52.820> common<00:01:53.270> for<00:01:53.300> athletes<00:01:53.720> to
