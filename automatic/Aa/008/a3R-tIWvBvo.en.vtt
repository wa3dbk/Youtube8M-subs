00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.330
 Welcome to our YouTube channel 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.160
 Mr. doctor today we are going to review what 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.880
 is the genesis tool that is 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.150
 divided into 1 genesis and spermatogenesis 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.660
 good we continue 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.660
 or 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.500
 in the process of oogenesis the o 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.470
 buttons differ in oocytes 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.350
 mature maturation of the oocytes is 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.050
 begins before birth the cells 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.390
 primal germinal reach gonads 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.309
 women and they differ in advocacy 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.190
 niasse by various myth divisions 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.839
 tics the follicular cells 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.030
 originate from the epithelium 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.030
 superficial covering the ovary 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.329
 the stoves continue to divide by 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.820
 mitosis some stop their divisions 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:14.280
 in the proposal the mean 1 reported 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.860
 different primary in the fifth month 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.560
 prenatal the number of wagons is 7 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.869
 millions but they start to die and 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.539
 many wagons and primary oocytes of 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.969
 generate and they turn to three guys in the 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.729
 seventh month almost all wagons have 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:32.310
 degenerate except those on the surface 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.469
 the primary oocytes enter into pro 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.689
 phase of meiosis 1 which are the 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:40.759
 survivors and are surrounded by a 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.759
 Follicular cell layer 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.150
 the primordial follicle is the set of 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.220
 flat epithelial cells and oocytes 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.710
 primary maturation of oocytes 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.380
 they continue puberty at birth 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.710
 the oocytes remain at rest entered 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.530
 phase of the mizuno that is part of the 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.649
 enjoyment not and is characterized by a network 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.959
 lax chromatin is the resting phase 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.660
 inhibited by individual maturation 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.830
 the oocyte and the cells secrete 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:22.070
 curricula at birth have 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:28.330
 800,000 to 600,000 primary oocytes in 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.330
 puberty 400,000 and they will only fly 5500 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.960
 i 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.200
 and 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.120
 at puberty every month between 15 and 20 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.090
 follicles of this reserve begin to 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.360
 mature and this process goes through three 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.150
 stages that is the primary or prenatal the 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.730
 secondary or andrade and the pre or bullet 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.250
 the central phase is the longest and 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.040
 is where the zona pellucida appears 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.410
 but the probation lasts 37 hours 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.720
 prior to ovulation the cells 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.300
 Flat follicles pass to your gas 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.730
 which is the primary follicle and they appear 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.250
 completes the pellucid zone of teak 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.350
 follicular is where the cells rest 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.980
 granules that separate it from the tissue 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.290
 conjunctive there are 2 texas internal tile and 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.420
 the external in the internal are the cells 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.930
 secreters and in the external one are the 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:41.890
 fibrous capsule the zona pellucida are 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.530
 granulosa cells and the oocyte segregate 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.010
 a protein group layer 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.010
 or 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.390
 one 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.830
 spaces filled with liquid appear 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.200
 between the granular cells the 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.480
 spaces form andros and the follicle 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.490
 it becomes secondary that is vesicular 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.860
 when the secondary follicle has 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.190
 Matured hormone is used by tlh 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.890
 induces the growth phase 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.720
 probation is completed meiosis 1 what 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.420
 which leads to the formation of two cells 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.370
 daughters with three double chromosomes the 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.670
 secondary oocyte receives the most 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.280
 of plasma first goal muscle polar no 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.680
 receives cytoplasm in the cell 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.350
 in between 62 but stops at goal 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.330
 phase approximately 3 hours before the 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.770
 ovulation and at meiosis 2 and it 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.770
 complete 6 fertilized 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.130
 the maturation of the sperm is 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.710
 starts at puberty spermatogonium 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.199
 transform into sperm or the 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.889
 terminals appear surrounded cells of 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:55.139
 sustenance channel and at birth before 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.410
 of puberty the computer laces 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.660
 they are transformed into seminiferous tubules 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.970
 form spermatogonia types and start 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.400
 spermatogenesis and they experience 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.860
 divisions and the last originates 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.320
 spermatogonia type b are divided and 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.750
 form sperm if the primary ones 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.350
 Primary sperm enter into pro 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.350
 phase approximately 22 days and complete 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.790
 the meiosis one to thus form 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.370
 secondary sperm 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:27.030
 sperm remain together with bridges 2 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.850
 plasmics and the smooth pig cell 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.470
 have and protect the germ cells 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:34.520
 that at the same time nourish and liberate 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.520
 mature sperm 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:46.130
 spermatogenesis is regulated by the 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:50.120
 production of lh by the pituitary gland 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:52.430
 the hormone using the fact lh 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.040
 joins the lighting cells and stimulates 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.650
 the testosterone production that binds 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.689
 the cell defected reads and stimulates the 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.229
 spermatogenesis 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:06.860
 and we go to the term genesis and what 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:09.829
 different is changing 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.809
 sperm sperm and is the 

00:06:09.829 --> 00:06:13.849
 formation of the crusade that covers the 

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:16.610
 nuclear surface and contains the 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:18.699
 enzymes the spermatogonia then it 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:23.119
 Transforms the sperm more or less 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:25.509
 approximately 74 days and they occur 

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:29.019
 300 million sperm from 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:29.019
 daily sperm before 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.840
