some<00:03:05.739> insects<00:03:06.189> here<00:03:06.400> they've<00:03:06.760> done<00:03:06.969> some

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
some insects here they've done some

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.110 
some insects here they've done some
damage<00:03:07.359> you<00:03:07.810> could<00:03:07.959> see<00:03:08.169> it<00:03:08.290> on<00:03:08.349> the<00:03:08.469> leaves

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
damage you could see it on the leaves

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.869 
damage you could see it on the leaves
but<00:03:10.120> uh<00:03:10.150> it's<00:03:11.079> minimal<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:12.189> tree<00:03:12.400> seems<00:03:12.639> to<00:03:12.760> be

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
but uh it's minimal the tree seems to be

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.789 
but uh it's minimal the tree seems to be
thriving<00:03:13.239> quite<00:03:13.659> well<00:03:14.400> as<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.459> matter<00:03:15.639> of<00:03:15.760> fact

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
thriving quite well as a matter of fact

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.550 
thriving quite well as a matter of fact
we've<00:03:17.799> got<00:03:17.859> ourselves<00:03:18.129> a<00:03:18.489> really<00:03:18.730> nice

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
we've got ourselves a really nice

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.629 
we've got ourselves a really nice
developing<00:03:20.560> a<00:03:20.650> Tomoya<00:03:20.919> fruit<00:03:21.219> right<00:03:21.430> there

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
developing a Tomoya fruit right there

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:26.250 
developing a Tomoya fruit right there
and<00:03:23.939> that<00:03:24.939> seems<00:03:25.180> pretty<00:03:25.389> sturdy<00:03:25.750> right<00:03:26.019> there

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
and that seems pretty sturdy right there

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.740 
and that seems pretty sturdy right there
I<00:03:26.549> think<00:03:27.549> we're<00:03:27.760> gonna<00:03:27.849> have<00:03:28.030> a<00:03:28.090> fruit<00:03:28.449> right

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
I think we're gonna have a fruit right

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.159 
I think we're gonna have a fruit right
there<00:03:29.430> it's<00:03:30.430> nice<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:31.060> green<00:03:31.419> it's<00:03:31.689> not<00:03:31.750> brown

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:32.169 
there it's nice and green it's not brown

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:34.039 
there it's nice and green it's not brown
it's<00:03:32.469> not<00:03:32.620> yellow<00:03:32.919> if<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.400> look<00:03:33.549> at<00:03:33.639> the<00:03:33.759> stem

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
it's not yellow if you look at the stem

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.449 
it's not yellow if you look at the stem
so<00:03:35.049> I<00:03:35.079> believe<00:03:35.409> that's<00:03:35.650> gonna<00:03:35.769> develop<00:03:36.040> into<00:03:36.280> a

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
so I believe that's gonna develop into a

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.659 
so I believe that's gonna develop into a
nice<00:03:36.669> Adam<00:03:37.209> Moya<00:03:37.359> fruit<00:03:37.689> right<00:03:37.900> there<00:03:41.669> let's
