down a bit or actually give it a low

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.020 
down a bit or actually give it a low
four<00:02:23.330> on<00:02:23.420> five<00:02:23.629> would<00:02:24.620> be<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:25.129> contender<00:02:25.760> for<00:02:25.970> a

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
four on five would be a contender for a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.580 
four on five would be a contender for a
five<00:02:26.269> if<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.569> price<00:02:26.810> got<00:02:27.019> knocked<00:02:27.260> out<00:02:27.410> cuz
