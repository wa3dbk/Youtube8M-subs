notice<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.329> gone<00:00:54.870> are<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> days<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.890> left

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
notice is that gone are the days of left

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.760 
notice is that gone are the days of left
tracks<00:00:56.550> building<00:00:57.059> being<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.899> solid<00:00:58.469> white

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
tracks building being that solid white

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.000 
tracks building being that solid white
we<00:00:59.399> now<00:00:59.550> have<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.000> blue<00:01:00.270> window<00:01:00.690> frames<00:01:01.079> some

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
we now have the blue window frames some

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.350 
we now have the blue window frames some
blue<00:01:02.190> trim<00:01:03.260> red<00:01:04.260> gutters<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.979> more<00:01:05.670> red<00:01:05.939> trim

blue trim red gutters and more red trim

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.460 
blue trim red gutters and more red trim
so<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.380> building<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.010> red<00:01:08.310> white<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.850> blue

onto<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.759> building<00:01:27.000> but<00:01:27.750> that's<00:01:27.990> only

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
onto the building but that's only

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.910

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
little it's a little bit challenging to

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.359 
little it's a little bit challenging to
get<00:01:33.210> pictures<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.659> since<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> park<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.009> closed

thankfully<00:01:37.979> though<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.640> alt<00:01:38.909> air<00:01:39.210> and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
thankfully though we have alt air and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.630 
thankfully though we have alt air and
we're<00:01:40.200> gonna<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.439> bringing<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.860> position<00:01:41.430> as

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
we're gonna be bringing in position as
