little work to get it running but I

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.019 
little work to get it running but I
ended<00:00:23.150> up<00:00:23.300> taking<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:24.170> bolt<00:00:25.010> the<00:00:25.460> drain<00:00:25.699> out

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
ended up taking the bolt the drain out

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.679 
ended up taking the bolt the drain out
of<00:00:26.570> the<00:00:26.630> ball<00:00:26.840> draining<00:00:27.680> the<00:00:27.769> old<00:00:27.920> fuel<00:00:28.220> out

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
of the ball draining the old fuel out

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.080 
of the ball draining the old fuel out
till<00:00:29.689> new<00:00:30.140> fuel<00:00:30.439> was<00:00:30.619> flowing<00:00:30.859> through<00:00:31.010> it<00:00:31.279> and

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
till new fuel was flowing through it and

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.780 
till new fuel was flowing through it and
it<00:00:32.150> got<00:00:32.300> run<00:00:32.570> it<00:00:32.720> got<00:00:33.019> it<00:00:33.110> running<00:00:33.350> but<00:00:33.800> there's

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
it got run it got it running but there's

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.039 
it got run it got it running but there's
still<00:00:35.089> something<00:00:35.330> plugged<00:00:35.659> up<00:00:35.809> in<00:00:35.960> the

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:36.049 
still something plugged up in the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:37.630 
still something plugged up in the
carburetor<00:00:36.350> because<00:00:36.769> it's<00:00:36.920> only<00:00:37.070> it<00:00:37.460> only

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
carburetor because it's only it only

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.090 
carburetor because it's only it only
stays<00:00:37.940> running<00:00:38.360> with<00:00:38.479> the<00:00:38.629> choke<00:00:38.870> on<00:00:39.049> so<00:00:39.920> let's

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
stays running with the choke on so let's

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.360 
stays running with the choke on so let's
fire<00:00:40.400> it<00:00:40.430> up<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:40.820> show<00:00:41.720> you<00:00:41.780> how<00:00:42.019> it<00:00:42.370> works

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
fire it up and show you how it works

00:00:43.370 --> 00:02:07.339 
fire it up and show you how it works
here<00:00:43.519> see<00:00:44.000> you

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:09.719 

now<00:02:08.349> when<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.709> was<00:02:08.830> practically<00:02:09.250> strolling

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
now when it was practically strolling

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.979 
now when it was practically strolling
out<00:02:09.879> there<00:02:10.179> that<00:02:10.450> was<00:02:10.780> with<00:02:11.319> the<00:02:11.440> choke<00:02:11.680> off

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
out there that was with the choke off

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.809 
out there that was with the choke off
and<00:02:13.989> normal<00:02:14.440> rod<00:02:14.590> o-ring<00:02:14.680> with<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.519> running

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
and normal rod o-ring with it running

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.850 
and normal rod o-ring with it running
good<00:02:16.030> was<00:02:16.510> when<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.750> choke<00:02:16.930> was<00:02:17.110> on<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:17.680> it's

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
good was when the choke was on so it's

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.250 
good was when the choke was on so it's
not<00:02:18.010> getting<00:02:18.250> in<00:02:18.430> fuel<00:02:18.690> for<00:02:19.690> some<00:02:19.870> reason

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
not getting in fuel for some reason

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.570 
not getting in fuel for some reason
probably<00:02:20.440> something<00:02:20.950> from<00:02:21.069> getting<00:02:21.370> better

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
probably something from getting better

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.949 
probably something from getting better
just<00:02:22.450> gummed<00:02:22.750> up<00:02:23.099> so<00:02:24.099> I'm<00:02:24.220> really<00:02:24.370> torn<00:02:24.760> apart

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
just gummed up so I'm really torn apart

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:32.100 
just gummed up so I'm really torn apart
but<00:02:26.640> otherwise<00:02:27.640> their<00:02:27.940> shape<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:31.390> IV<00:02:31.780> just<00:02:31.989> a

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
but otherwise their shape the IV just a

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.780 
but otherwise their shape the IV just a
little<00:02:32.290> bit<00:02:32.410> because<00:02:32.560> sometimes<00:02:33.370> doesn't

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
little bit because sometimes doesn't

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.789 
little bit because sometimes doesn't
engaged<00:02:34.120> right<00:02:34.330> away<00:02:34.390> but<00:02:35.379> other<00:02:35.530> than<00:02:35.709> that

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
engaged right away but other than that

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.829 
engaged right away but other than that
pretty<00:02:37.620> decent<00:02:38.620> fine
