00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.160 
pick the finish on the outside now one
of<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> most<00:00:33.480> important<00:00:33.809> parts<00:00:34.050> that

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
of the most important parts that

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.060 
of the most important parts that
distinguishes<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.739> one<00:00:34.860> from<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.040> other

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
distinguishes this one from the other

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.400 
distinguishes this one from the other
ones<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.550> very<00:00:35.850> very<00:00:36.120> cool<00:00:36.420> nearly

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
ones is this very very cool nearly

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.549 
ones is this very very cool nearly
carbon<00:00:37.920> fiber<00:00:38.129> look<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.670> not<00:00:38.850> really<00:00:39.559> design

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
carbon fiber look but not really design

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.930 
carbon fiber look but not really design
check<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.160> out<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.370> can<00:00:41.430> see<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.730> it's<00:00:41.850> like

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
check it out you can see that it's like

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.840 
check it out you can see that it's like
a<00:00:42.120> kind<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> crosshatch<00:00:43.620> pattern<00:00:43.850> it

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
a kind of like a crosshatch pattern it

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.700 
a kind of like a crosshatch pattern it
depending<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.539> which<00:00:45.719> way<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:45.989> look<00:00:46.200> at<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.469> it

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
depending on which way you look at it it

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.580 
depending on which way you look at it it
kind<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:46.920> changes<00:00:47.370> it's<00:00:47.579> very<00:00:48.000> very<00:00:48.329> cool<00:00:48.719> and

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
kind of changes it's very very cool and

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.139 
kind of changes it's very very cool and
it<00:00:49.710> actually<00:00:49.860> follows<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> same<00:00:50.700> pattern

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
it actually follows the same pattern

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.139 
it actually follows the same pattern
over<00:00:51.360> here<00:00:52.079> onto<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> wrist<00:00:52.739> rests<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
over here onto the wrist rests the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.029 
over here onto the wrist rests the
trackpad<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.780> actually<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.739> flat

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
trackpad is actually like just a flat

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.860 
trackpad is actually like just a flat
material<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.640> rest<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.239> little

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
material and the rest is like little

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.939 
material and the rest is like little
material<00:00:58.230> does<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.649> little<00:00:58.710> bit<00:00:58.859> of

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
material does have a little bit of

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.830 
material does have a little bit of
texture<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.579> it's<00:00:59.670> very<00:00:59.789> cool<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.629> is

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
texture to it so it's very cool it is

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.450 
texture to it so it's very cool it is

very nice 1.3 megapixel webcam which is
an<00:01:30.299> improvement<00:01:30.390> over<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.930> prior<00:01:31.200> netbooks

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
an improvement over the prior netbooks

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.840 
an improvement over the prior netbooks
and<00:01:31.560> only<00:01:31.740> had<00:01:31.829> point<00:01:32.159> three<00:01:32.430> megapixel

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
and only had point three megapixel

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.300 
and only had point three megapixel
webcam<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.869> very<00:01:34.079> very<00:01:34.110> nice<00:01:34.350> now<00:01:34.799> as<00:01:34.979> far<00:01:35.189> as

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
webcam so very very nice now as far as

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.179 
webcam so very very nice now as far as
processor<00:01:35.759> goes<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.060> here<00:01:36.240> we<00:01:36.360> do<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.689> atom
