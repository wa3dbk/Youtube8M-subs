00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.799
 if this issue appears it is only 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.440
 Only a few days to go to football 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.030
 european championship needs more reasons 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.800
 It really is not about the back 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.570
 a football match in the hall of fame too 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.309
 honor and soon we will join you 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.049
 international superstar soccer already 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.960
 our favorite comedian classic 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.810
 have shown this time fifa fifa off 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.600
 96 to be exact because we are already in 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.990
 intro see is the game from the years 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.980
 1995 the first fifa with 3d graphics 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.740
 virtual developers call the developers 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.809
 all that today considering of 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.969
 photorealistic stadiums rather silly 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.829
 At the time , the fan heart makes you feel higher 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.820
 beat 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.770
 at the latest as the camera through the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.750
 gate of the wembley stadium flies and 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.290
 we hear the fan masses is about us 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.750
 done 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.559
 it is the first fifa that we have in ours 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.600
 close heart 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.590
 Incidentally, you see the version in the picture 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.360
 for sega saturn 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.850
 the game appeared in similar quality 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.399
 synonymous for the ps1 on the super nintendo 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.039
 and other 16 bit consoles are missing things 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.079
 of course, like this intro on the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.080
 field play the modern time 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.939
 consoles your whole graphics power out of the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.040
 invasion of the players is a force 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.439
 even if the models of the kicker only as 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.150
 already be presented but also 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.430
 playful has the presentation big 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.280
 added value even if you cross with the digi 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.580
 controlled one experiences unforeseen 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.860
 freedom of movement 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.750
 You even get tempted 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.360
 Concept like to use ball physics 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.619
 because in contrast to many 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.799
 Isometric soccer games hops the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.020
 ball in fifa 96 rudimentary realistic 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.880
 the title is not only playful 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.850
 a journey into the past 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.799
 Germany plays against Portugal 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.400
 as you know, the dfb kick-off match of the em 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.230
 2012 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.360
 and another duel at the 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.710
 this year's european championship 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.930
 will be held 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.060
 Spain against Italy 17 years ago 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.220
 runs for the azzurri a budding 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.380
 star named alessandro del piero 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.960
 there is also a spain 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.410
 Interesting personalities of the later 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.380
 world goalkeeper iker casillas is still in 1995 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.330
 substitute keeper for the goalkeeper on the 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.440
 you have to overcome the goal in front of the goal 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.720
 to be on guard 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.030
 actually come through the 3d mechanics 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.370
 exciting situation materialize 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.540
 here the Spaniards try italy 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.330
 to overcome keeper 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.070
 but it was unsuccessful at that time 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.990
 By the way, no rarity 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.330
 Today, the Iberians are world and 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.160
 European champions in the 90s are considered 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.230
 but still as a troupe of players 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.120
 decisive moment fail too 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.870
 tactically, the game is a journey into the 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.150
 past 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.040
 in this menu, the whole sees 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.450
 quite modern for everyone 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.880
 crew part can be cleared 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.459
 determine that has something of a shift 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.290
 from modern room layout the next 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.170
 menu, on the other hand, is a descent into the 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.390
 football is attacking first there is a 3 5 2 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.660
 then even a variant with 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.519
 libero the 42 31 exhibition the today 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.230
 played by so many teams 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.050
 on the other hand, it is far from over 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.410
 but modern is what is successful 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.660
 is 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.370
 maybe come up with libero 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.920
 in the future yes again in fashion 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.600
 Of course, in fifa 96 not only 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.739
 national teams but also club 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.440
 represented 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.330
 at that time it was a real license 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.000
 monster including the complete 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.850
 bundesliga fans revel here in 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.180
 nostalgia at werder bremen run zb 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:23.150
 stars like dieter hails marco bode mario 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.940
 basler or wynton rufer up and even 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.370
 some things can not be done at fifa 96 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.750
 at least if it is of such a pain 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.850
 sympathetic players like that 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.570
 Austrian cologne Toni Polster 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.570
 is told 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.450
 a highlight is the subsequent 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.939
 most silly story on the 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.909
 a virtual scoreboard at that time 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:49.230
 Hunk atmosphere so while I am 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:51.359
 now still this residue bend 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.040
 I say goodbye to even the 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.120
 It was with the retro hall of fame we 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.120
 hear us next month
