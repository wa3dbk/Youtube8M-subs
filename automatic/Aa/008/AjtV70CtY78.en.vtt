00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
elastic you peeed design foam it's like

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.070 
elastic you peeed design foam it's like
a<00:01:26.280> wrap<00:01:26.580> setting<00:01:27.030> foam<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.659> kind<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.930> give

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
a wrap setting foam just to kind of give

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.630

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
so hopefully this side will last a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.399 
so hopefully this side will last a
little<00:01:32.070> more<00:01:32.340> than<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> few<00:01:32.790> days<00:01:32.939> okay<00:01:33.630> all

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
little more than a few days okay all

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.080 
little more than a few days okay all
right<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:34.979> guys<00:01:35.189> want<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.549> see<00:01:35.729> how

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
right so if you guys want to see how

00:01:36.090 --> 00:03:14.330 
right so if you guys want to see how
this<00:01:36.240> all<00:01:36.479> turns<00:01:36.810> out<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.530> keep<00:01:37.740> watching

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.800 

hopefully<00:03:15.340> should<00:03:15.400> take<00:03:15.910> that<00:03:16.060> long<00:03:16.300> because

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
hopefully should take that long because

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.880 
hopefully should take that long because
as<00:03:17.590> you<00:03:18.040> know<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.460> curlformer<00:03:19.300> or<00:03:19.890> beef

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
as you know the curlformer or beef

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.540 
as you know the curlformer or beef
curlformer<00:03:21.640> dupes<00:03:21.880> have<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:22.780> mesh<00:03:23.550> so

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
curlformer dupes have the mesh so

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.460 
curlformer dupes have the mesh so
hopefully<00:03:25.030> it<00:03:25.270> shouldn't<00:03:25.690> take<00:03:26.110> that<00:03:26.230> long<00:03:26.290> to

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
hopefully it shouldn't take that long to

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.860 
hopefully it shouldn't take that long to
dry<00:03:26.800> but<00:03:27.490> I<00:03:27.670> will<00:03:27.850> come<00:03:28.030> back<00:03:28.270> and<00:03:28.600> show<00:03:28.810> you

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.360 
feels so soft
now<00:04:41.400> I<00:04:41.430> didn't<00:04:42.000> notice<00:04:42.540> that<00:04:42.570> this<00:04:43.320> is<00:04:43.500> after<00:04:44.010> I

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
now I didn't notice that this is after I

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.180 
now I didn't notice that this is after I
start<00:04:45.330> putting<00:04:45.630> them<00:04:45.780> in<00:04:46.080> that<00:04:46.530> I<00:04:46.590> noticed

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
start putting them in that I noticed

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.320 
start putting them in that I noticed
that<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:49.110> two<00:04:49.500> different<00:04:49.950> colors<00:04:50.520> curled

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
that the the two different colors curled

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.680 
that the the two different colors curled
a<00:04:51.630> different<00:04:52.140> way<00:04:52.290> so<00:04:53.090> what<00:04:54.090> I<00:04:54.120> should've<00:04:54.540> did

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
a different way so what I should've did

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.710 
a different way so what I should've did
was<00:04:54.900> just<00:04:55.080> put<00:04:55.169> all<00:04:55.590> of<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:56.160> pink<00:04:56.640> ones<00:04:56.820> on<00:04:57.360> the

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
was just put all of the pink ones on the

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.440 
was just put all of the pink ones on the
right<00:04:57.990> side<00:04:58.350> and<00:04:58.950> the<00:04:59.669> orange<00:05:00.060> ones<00:05:00.270> on<00:05:00.360> the

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
right side and the orange ones on the

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.000 
right side and the orange ones on the
left<00:05:00.660> side<00:05:00.900> so<00:05:01.169> I<00:05:01.200> could<00:05:01.500> have<00:05:01.590> got<00:05:01.740> some

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
left side so I could have got some

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
it after I wash it and stuff so that's

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.400 
it after I wash it and stuff so that's
why<00:05:20.479> most<00:05:21.479> of<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:21.750> time<00:05:21.870> I'll<00:05:21.990> just<00:05:22.020> end<00:05:22.320> up

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
why most of the time I'll just end up

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.909 
why most of the time I'll just end up
braiding<00:05:22.890> it<00:05:23.010> up<00:05:23.160> and<00:05:23.460> putting<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.210> wig<00:05:24.390> on
