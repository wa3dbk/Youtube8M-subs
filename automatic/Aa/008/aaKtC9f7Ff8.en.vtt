00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
battlefield 3 installed on my ram so

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.320 
battlefield 3 installed on my ram so
once<00:00:08.069> again<00:00:08.189> I'm<00:00:08.490> going<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.700> be<00:00:08.849> filming<00:00:09.179> this

once again I'm going to be filming this
with<00:00:09.570> my<00:00:09.719> camera<00:00:10.019> since<00:00:10.500> fraps<00:00:11.099> will<00:00:11.429> reduce

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
with my camera since fraps will reduce

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.360 
with my camera since fraps will reduce
the<00:00:12.000> performance<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.780> my<00:00:12.929> computer<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.530> I

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
the performance of my computer and I

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.890 
the performance of my computer and I
just<00:00:14.730> want<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.000> show<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.120> guys<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.299> quick<00:00:15.599> test

just want to show you guys a quick test

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.480 
just want to show you guys a quick test
here<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.320> want<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.680> be<00:00:16.800> as<00:00:17.039> fair<00:00:17.369> as

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
here and I want to be as fair as

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.849

what<00:00:20.340> i<00:00:20.369> mean<00:00:20.670> by<00:00:21.199> installed<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.410> my<00:00:22.590> ram<00:00:22.859> so<00:00:23.730> i

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
what i mean by installed on my ram so i

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.480 
what i mean by installed on my ram so i
use<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.359> program<00:00:24.779> called<00:00:25.109> ramdisk<00:00:25.710> to

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
use this program called ramdisk to

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.019 
use this program called ramdisk to
create<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.119> ram<00:00:27.510> partition<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.410> my<00:00:29.160> computer<00:00:29.789> so

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
create a ram partition on my computer so

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.359 
create a ram partition on my computer so
basically<00:00:30.510> my<00:00:30.539> ram<00:00:30.960> acts<00:00:31.320> like<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> hard<00:00:32.160> drive

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
basically my ram acts like a hard drive

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.240 
basically my ram acts like a hard drive
and<00:00:32.610> as<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.719> can<00:00:33.870> see<00:00:33.899> i<00:00:34.079> created<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.680> 20

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
and as you can see i created a 20

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.319 
and as you can see i created a 20
gigabyte<00:00:35.640> partition<00:00:36.300> since<00:00:37.879> battlefield<00:00:38.879> 3

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
gigabyte partition since battlefield 3

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.380 
gigabyte partition since battlefield 3
is<00:00:39.510> almost<00:00:39.899> 19<00:00:40.800> gigabytes<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:42.180> right

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
is almost 19 gigabytes and it's right

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.720 
is almost 19 gigabytes and it's right
here<00:00:42.570> local<00:00:42.960> disk<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:44.129> go<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.340> there<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.579> I

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
here local disk I can go on there and I

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.220 
here local disk I can go on there and I
have<00:00:44.850> battlefield<00:00:45.180> 3<00:00:45.510> installed<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.020> there

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
have battlefield 3 installed on there

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.330 
have battlefield 3 installed on there
and<00:00:47.390> so<00:00:48.390> what<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:48.840> does<00:00:49.110> basically<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:50.039> it

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
and so what this does basically is it

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.380 
and so what this does basically is it
makes<00:00:50.610> load<00:00:51.120> times<00:00:51.739> extremely<00:00:52.739> faster<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.460> lot

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
makes load times extremely faster a lot

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.170 
makes load times extremely faster a lot
faster<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.620> doesn't<00:00:55.949> necessarily<00:00:56.039> increase<00:00:56.879> a

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
faster it doesn't necessarily increase a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.959 
faster it doesn't necessarily increase a
frame<00:00:57.719> rate<00:00:57.930> or<00:00:58.199> performance<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:59.550> really

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
frame rate or performance but really

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.580 
frame rate or performance but really
just<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.270> loading<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.020> really<00:01:01.230> does<00:01:01.440> make

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
just the loading and it really does make

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.229 
just the loading and it really does make
a<00:01:01.649> significant<00:01:02.340> difference<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.879> i'm<00:01:03.030> going<00:01:03.180> to

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
a significant difference so i'm going to

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.119 
a significant difference so i'm going to
show<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.390> guys<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.600> right<00:01:03.989> now<00:01:04.170> i'm<00:01:04.619> going

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
show you guys that right now i'm going

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.890 
show you guys that right now i'm going
to<00:01:05.189> set<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> camera<00:01:05.970> down<00:01:06.000> right<00:01:06.659> here

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
to set the camera down right here

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.440 
to set the camera down right here
signals<00:01:07.320> going<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.590> get<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> good<00:01:07.950> angle<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.729> my

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
signals going to get a good angle of my

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.260 
signals going to get a good angle of my
main<00:01:10.260> monitor<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:13.520> also<00:01:14.520> i'm<00:01:14.850> going<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.150> get

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
main monitor and also i'm going to get

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.149 
main monitor and also i'm going to get
my<00:01:15.299> phone<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.900> we're<00:01:16.590> going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.799> time<00:01:17.130> how

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
my phone and we're going to time how

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.539 
my phone and we're going to time how
long<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.729> takes<00:01:18.290> for<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.530> game<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.890> load<00:01:20.040> up<00:01:20.220> so

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
long it takes for the game to load up so

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.929 
long it takes for the game to load up so
let<00:01:21.000> me<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.240> find<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.900> an<00:01:22.740> observer<00:01:23.340> close<00:01:23.729> to

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
let me just find a an observer close to

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.600 
let me just find a an observer close to
me<00:01:24.090> okay<00:01:24.830> and<00:01:27.259> get<00:01:28.259> my<00:01:28.409> phone<00:01:28.619> ready<00:01:28.860> there<00:01:29.579> we

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
me okay and get my phone ready there we

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.990 
me okay and get my phone ready there we
go<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.030> I'm<00:01:30.240> gonna<00:01:30.450> start<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.950> counter<00:01:32.369> when

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
go so I'm gonna start the counter when

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.440 
go so I'm gonna start the counter when
battlefield<00:01:33.659> starts<00:01:34.590> saying<00:01:35.450> loading

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
battlefield starts saying loading

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.060 
battlefield starts saying loading
because<00:01:36.900> before<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.619> actually<00:01:37.920> just

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
because before that it's actually just

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.210 
because before that it's actually just
connecting<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.820> server<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:40.320> it's

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
connecting to the server so it's it's

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.399 
connecting to the server so it's it's
only<00:01:41.430> based<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.790> my<00:01:41.909> internet<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.869> then<00:01:43.020> after

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
only based on my internet but then after

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.840 
only based on my internet but then after
that<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.829> actually<00:01:44.009> when<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.340> starts<00:01:44.640> loading

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
that it's actually when I starts loading

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.429 
that it's actually when I starts loading
the<00:01:45.119> textures<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.810> everything<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.320> that's

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
the textures and everything so that's

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.620 
the textures and everything so that's
when<00:01:46.649> I'm<00:01:46.740> going<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.979> start<00:01:47.130> my<00:01:47.250> counter<00:01:47.630> so

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
when I'm going to start my counter so

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.719 
when I'm going to start my counter so
you<00:01:49.020> guys<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.380> see<00:01:49.439> over<00:01:50.189> here<00:01:50.220> saying

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
you guys can see over here saying

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.520 
you guys can see over here saying
joining<00:01:51.119> server<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.689> I'm<00:01:51.930> going<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.140> start<00:01:52.409> my

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
joining server and I'm going to start my

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.800 
joining server and I'm going to start my
counter<00:01:52.920> when<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:54.000> starts<00:01:54.509> saying<00:01:54.810> loading<00:01:56.810> so

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
counter when it starts saying loading so

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.069 
counter when it starts saying loading so
really<00:01:58.290> now<00:01:58.469> it's<00:01:58.890> all<00:01:59.880> on<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.360> internet

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
really now it's all on the internet

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.770 
really now it's all on the internet
connection<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:03.259> hope<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.469> cameras<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.040> focus

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
connection I hope the cameras and focus

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.100 
connection I hope the cameras and focus
okay<00:02:06.780> connecting<00:02:08.300> loading<00:02:09.300> their<00:02:09.479> go<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:09.899> we

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
okay connecting loading their go so we

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.220 
okay connecting loading their go so we
started<00:02:10.560> now

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
started now

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.040 
started now
and<00:02:12.349> then<00:02:13.310> I'll<00:02:13.519> stop<00:02:13.879> it<00:02:14.120> once<00:02:14.540> we're<00:02:14.840> in<00:02:14.930> the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
and then I'll stop it once we're in the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.399 
and then I'll stop it once we're in the
game<00:02:19.299> actually<00:02:20.299> I<00:02:20.360> can<00:02:20.510> probably<00:02:20.690> click<00:02:21.170> that

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
game actually I can probably click that

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.089 
game actually I can probably click that
come<00:02:21.709> on<00:02:21.860> at<00:02:22.280> Gotham<00:02:22.849> by<00:02:22.970> itself<00:02:23.180> nor<00:02:23.390> mine<00:02:23.629> and

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
come on at Gotham by itself nor mine and

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.289 
come on at Gotham by itself nor mine and
there<00:02:25.099> we<00:02:25.190> go<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:25.610> yeah<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.180> was<00:02:26.269> about<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:28.299> 15

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
there we go so yeah that was about a 15

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.000 
there we go so yeah that was about a 15
seconds<00:02:29.780> fourteen<00:02:30.260> seconds<00:02:30.680> I'll<00:02:30.830> say

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
seconds fourteen seconds I'll say

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.270 
seconds fourteen seconds I'll say
because<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.310> stopped<00:02:31.610> it<00:02:31.819> a<00:02:32.000> little<00:02:32.599> bit<00:02:32.900> I

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
because I stopped it a little bit I

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.910 
because I stopped it a little bit I
stopped<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.459> little<00:02:34.610> bit<00:02:34.760> after<00:02:35.560> via<00:02:36.560> you

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
stopped it a little bit after via you

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.860 
stopped it a little bit after via you
guys<00:02:37.099> can<00:02:37.280> see<00:02:37.310> well<00:02:37.940> if<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:38.390> want<00:02:38.690> to

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
guys can see well if you want to

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.770 
guys can see well if you want to
calculate<00:02:39.260> like<00:02:39.799> also<00:02:40.129> the<00:02:40.430> loading<00:02:41.390> time<00:02:41.569> of

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
calculate like also the loading time of

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.780 
calculate like also the loading time of
the<00:02:41.989> internet<00:02:42.680> so<00:02:42.920> like<00:02:43.129> how<00:02:43.280> long<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:43.579> takes

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
the internet so like how long it takes

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.460 
the internet so like how long it takes
to<00:02:43.879> connect<00:02:44.239> to<00:02:44.390> server<00:02:44.690> then<00:02:44.989> I<00:02:45.019> guess<00:02:45.349> you

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
to connect to server then I guess you

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.509 
to connect to server then I guess you
can<00:02:45.590> add<00:02:45.709> that<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:46.099> it<00:02:46.569> but<00:02:47.569> I<00:02:47.870> think<00:02:48.739> this<00:02:49.220> is<00:02:49.489> a

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
can add that to it but I think this is a

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.440 
can add that to it but I think this is a
good<00:02:50.030> enough<00:02:50.239> result<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:51.579> usually<00:02:52.579> on<00:02:52.790> an<00:02:52.970> HDD

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
good enough result and usually on an HDD

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.780 
good enough result and usually on an HDD
this<00:02:53.780> takes<00:02:54.049> about<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.709> minute<00:02:54.890> and<00:02:55.160> a<00:02:55.280> half<00:02:55.310> and

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
this takes about a minute and a half and

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.589 
this takes about a minute and a half and
on<00:02:56.209> SSD<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:56.930> can<00:02:57.079> take<00:02:57.230> like<00:02:57.609> 40<00:02:58.609> 50<00:02:59.180> seconds

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
on SSD it can take like 40 50 seconds

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.880 
on SSD it can take like 40 50 seconds
maybe<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.109> on<00:03:01.069> your<00:03:01.459> ram<00:03:01.700> it<00:03:02.090> takes<00:03:02.660> about<00:03:03.049> 14

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
maybe and on your ram it takes about 14

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.740 
maybe and on your ram it takes about 14
seconds<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:04.489> that's<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.879> huge<00:03:05.120> difference<00:03:05.329> and

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
seconds so that's a huge difference and

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.420 
seconds so that's a huge difference and
yeah<00:03:06.560> that's<00:03:06.680> all<00:03:06.829> I<00:03:06.950> wanted<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.250> show<00:03:07.400> you

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
yeah that's all I wanted to show you

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.750 
yeah that's all I wanted to show you
guys<00:03:07.519> so<00:03:08.060> ya<00:03:08.390> see<00:03:08.420> ya
