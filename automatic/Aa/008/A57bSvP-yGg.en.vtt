00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290 

okay<00:00:00.659> now<00:00:00.870> we're<00:00:01.110> going<00:00:01.199> to<00:00:01.290> build<00:00:02.070> it<00:00:02.220> up<00:00:02.340> with

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
okay now we're going to build it up with

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.070 
okay now we're going to build it up with
a<00:00:03.330> little<00:00:03.449> bit<00:00:03.810> of<00:00:06.200> pink<00:00:07.200> your<00:00:07.410> tone<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:08.040> the

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
a little bit of pink your tone and the

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.080 
a little bit of pink your tone and the
darker<00:00:10.080> areas<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:11.070> remember<00:00:11.460> it's<00:00:11.580> fairly

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
darker areas and remember it's fairly

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.160 
darker areas and remember it's fairly
wet<00:00:12.530> so<00:00:13.530> when<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.009> place<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.490> down<00:00:14.960> you<00:00:15.960> want

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
wet so when you place it down you want

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.580 
wet so when you place it down you want
to<00:00:16.260> make<00:00:16.410> sure<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.859> it's<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:20.930> right<00:00:21.930> wetness

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
to make sure that it's the right wetness

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.070 
to make sure that it's the right wetness
if<00:00:22.800> it's<00:00:22.920> too<00:00:23.130> wet<00:00:23.160> it'll<00:00:23.580> it'll<00:00:24.019> flow<00:00:25.019> too

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
if it's too wet it'll it'll flow too

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.370 
if it's too wet it'll it'll flow too
quickly<00:00:28.820> if<00:00:29.820> it's<00:00:30.000> not<00:00:30.150> wet<00:00:30.390> enough<00:00:30.420> it'll

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
quickly if it's not wet enough it'll

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:41.389 
quickly if it's not wet enough it'll
cause<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> hard<00:00:32.219> edge<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.980> we're<00:00:41.250> going<00:00:41.370> to

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
cause a hard edge and we're going to

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:50.180 
cause a hard edge and we're going to
turn<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.629> do<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> gradation<00:00:49.070> because<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
turn this to do a gradation because the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.549 
turn this to do a gradation because the
cheek<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> little<00:00:50.850> bit<00:00:50.940> darker<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.559> edge

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
cheek is a little bit darker on the edge

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.279 
cheek is a little bit darker on the edge
of<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> cheek<00:00:53.809> so<00:00:54.809> we're<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:54.989> sort<00:00:55.260> of

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
of the cheek so we're just sort of

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.650 
of the cheek so we're just sort of
dabbing<00:00:55.800> paint<00:00:56.219> into<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.000> edge<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.420> cheek

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
dabbing paint into the edge of the cheek

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.369 
dabbing paint into the edge of the cheek
and<00:00:58.340> then<00:00:59.340> we're<00:00:59.520> going<00:00:59.699> to<00:01:00.020> bring<00:01:01.020> up<00:01:01.199> some

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
and then we're going to bring up some

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.800 
and then we're going to bring up some
color<00:01:01.620> here<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:03.409> then<00:01:05.060> just<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> inside

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
color here and then just on the inside

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.260 
color here and then just on the inside
of<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.020> nose<00:01:07.640> put<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> little<00:01:08.820> more<00:01:09.000> color

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
of the nose put a little more color

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.730 
of the nose put a little more color
there<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.310> then<00:01:11.510> right<00:01:12.510> below<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.170> nostrils

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
there and then right below the nostrils

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.060 
there and then right below the nostrils
there's<00:01:14.340> going<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.610> be<00:01:14.640> some<00:01:14.909> color<00:01:15.180> there

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
there's going to be some color there

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.679 
there's going to be some color there
then<00:01:17.070> we're<00:01:17.220> going<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> take<00:01:18.060> out<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.479> color

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
then we're going to take out the color

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.240 
then we're going to take out the color
and<00:01:21.110> before<00:01:22.110> we<00:01:22.140> do<00:01:22.409> anything<00:01:22.619> else<00:01:22.890> we're

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
and before we do anything else we're

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:38.649 
and before we do anything else we're
going<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.520> soften<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.119> any<00:01:24.930> edges

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:46.950 

and<00:01:39.109> remove<00:01:39.619> any<00:01:39.770> paint<00:01:40.100> that<00:01:40.340> we<00:01:40.429> need<00:01:40.609> to

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.260 

sometimes<00:01:47.960> hard<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.319> remove<00:01:49.060> because<00:01:50.060> there's

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
sometimes hard to remove because there's

00:01:50.270 --> 00:02:07.080 
sometimes hard to remove because there's
not<00:01:50.390> that<00:01:50.450> much<00:01:50.719> remove

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.089 

this<00:02:07.630> is<00:02:07.750> a<00:02:07.810> soft<00:02:08.110> face<00:02:08.440> there's<00:02:08.890> not<00:02:09.039> really

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
this is a soft face there's not really

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.240 
this is a soft face there's not really
going<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.489> be<00:02:09.580> too<00:02:10.149> many<00:02:10.330> hard<00:02:10.539> edges<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:12.099> look

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
going to be too many hard edges to look

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.430 
going to be too many hard edges to look
at
