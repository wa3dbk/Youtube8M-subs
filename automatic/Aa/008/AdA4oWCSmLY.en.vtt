00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
right now but anyways for the makeup I

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.890 
right now but anyways for the makeup I
did<00:01:35.460> one<00:01:35.670> look<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.060> then<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> decided<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.810> add

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
did one look but then I decided to add

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.050

on<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.380> look<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:37.979> that's<00:01:38.159> why<00:01:38.369> there's

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
on to that look so that's why there's

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.219 
on to that look so that's why there's

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
it maybe like four to five you can do

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.200 
it maybe like four to five you can do
more<00:04:31.080> or<00:04:31.200> less<00:04:31.380> it's<00:04:31.860> up<00:04:32.040> to<00:04:32.190> you<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.640> it<00:04:32.880> is<00:04:32.910> so

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
more or less it's up to you and it is so

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:41.499 
more or less it's up to you and it is so
so<00:04:33.510> easy

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.779 

and<00:04:42.509> once<00:04:43.499> you<00:04:43.619> finish<00:04:43.769> cutting<00:04:44.129> like<00:04:44.369> across

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
and once you finish cutting like across

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.219 
and once you finish cutting like across
the<00:04:45.029> tea<00:04:45.179> you<00:04:45.449> might<00:04:45.599> want<00:04:45.869> to<00:04:45.929> cut<00:04:46.110> the

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
the tea you might want to cut the

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.350 
the tea you might want to cut the
neckline<00:04:46.649> and<00:04:47.069> that's<00:04:47.279> just<00:04:47.489> what<00:04:47.639> I<00:04:47.669> did<00:04:47.819> and

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
neckline and that's just what I did and

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.699 
neckline and that's just what I did and
I<00:04:48.539> think<00:04:48.599> it<00:04:48.809> looks<00:04:48.959> a<00:04:49.050> lot<00:04:49.169> better<00:04:49.409> and<00:04:49.649> it

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:49.709 
I think it looks a lot better and it

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:51.259 
I think it looks a lot better and it
made<00:04:49.860> it<00:04:49.979> into<00:04:50.339> like<00:04:50.550> an<00:04:50.669> off-the-shoulder

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:51.269 
made it into like an off-the-shoulder

00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:53.239 
made it into like an off-the-shoulder
top<00:04:51.599> and<00:04:52.199> then<00:04:52.409> once<00:04:52.619> you<00:04:52.709> finish<00:04:52.860> that<00:04:53.009> you

00:04:53.239 --> 00:04:53.249 
top and then once you finish that you
