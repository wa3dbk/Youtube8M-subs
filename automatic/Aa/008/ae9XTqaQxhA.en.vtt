00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
want to remove the back bolts for the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.750 
want to remove the back bolts for the
caliper<00:00:43.649> itself<00:00:43.739> now<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.160> have<00:00:44.370> two<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.550> them

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
caliper itself now you have two of them

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.639 
caliper itself now you have two of them
one<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.000> top<00:00:45.030> here<00:00:45.480> one<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.140> bottom<00:00:46.469> side

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
one on top here one on the bottom side

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.479 
one on top here one on the bottom side
now<00:00:47.340> they<00:00:47.489> are<00:00:47.640> both<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.270> fourteen<00:00:48.690> millimeter

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
now they are both a fourteen millimeter

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.770 
now they are both a fourteen millimeter
next<00:00:50.489> what<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.670> want<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.850> move<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.329> here<00:00:51.660> is

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
next what you want to move on to here is

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.600 
next what you want to move on to here is
before<00:00:52.320> removing<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> caliper<00:00:53.070> itself

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
before removing the caliper itself

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.580 
before removing the caliper itself
sometimes<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.899> be<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.020> little<00:00:55.260> harder<00:00:55.530> as

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
sometimes it can be a little harder as

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.520 
sometimes it can be a little harder as
you<00:00:55.620> remove<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.039> caliper<00:00:56.309> off<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:58.199> Pistons

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
you remove the caliper off the Pistons

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
you remove the caliper off the Pistons
will<00:00:58.620> actually<00:00:58.829> be<00:00:58.890> sticking<00:00:59.190> out<00:00:59.309> just

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
will actually be sticking out just

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.680 
will actually be sticking out just
enough<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.030> can't<00:01:00.270> actually<00:01:00.360> get<00:01:00.600> them

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
enough so you can't actually get them

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.689 
enough so you can't actually get them
off<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> pads<00:01:01.110> themselves<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.370> helps<00:01:02.579> if

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
off the pads themselves so it helps if

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.389 
off the pads themselves so it helps if
you<00:01:02.789> have<00:01:02.940> say<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:04.160> bigger<00:01:05.160> pair<00:01:05.309> of

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
you have say a bigger pair of

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:06.590 
you have say a bigger pair of
channellocks<00:01:05.910> and<00:01:06.030> what<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.210> want<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.479> is

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
channellocks and what you want to do is

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.560 
channellocks and what you want to do is
actually<00:01:06.750> put<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> jaws<00:01:07.289> in<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:08.150> outer<00:01:09.150> ends

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
actually put the jaws in the outer ends

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.630 
actually put the jaws in the outer ends
here<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.260> simply<00:01:11.040> push<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> pistons

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
here and just simply push the pistons

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.070 
here and just simply push the pistons
back<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> little<00:01:12.030> bit<00:01:12.210> now<00:01:12.420> also<00:01:12.840> before

you'll be ready to remove the rotor

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.399 
you'll be ready to remove the rotor
itself<00:01:38.509> now<00:01:39.509> just<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.840> case<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.170> didn't<00:01:40.320> make

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
itself now just in case it didn't make

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.870 
itself now just in case it didn't make
note<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.829> before<00:01:41.159> what<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.520> want<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.790> do

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
note of it before what we want to do

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.030 
note of it before what we want to do
actually<00:01:42.270> here<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.659> tie<00:01:43.409> your<00:01:43.560> caliper<00:01:43.920> back

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
actually here is tie your caliper back

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.530 
actually here is tie your caliper back
so<00:01:44.220> doesn't<00:01:44.430> actually<00:01:44.520> put<00:01:44.759> any<00:01:44.880> strain<00:01:45.509> on

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
so doesn't actually put any strain on

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.210 
so doesn't actually put any strain on
the<00:01:45.720> brake<00:01:45.900> line<00:01:46.110> itself<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.680> can<00:01:46.799> see<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:46.979> have

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the brake line itself you can see I have

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.810 
the brake line itself you can see I have
a<00:01:47.250> strap<00:01:48.119> holding<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.630> place<00:01:48.750> there<00:01:49.820> next

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
a strap holding it in place there next

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.429 
a strap holding it in place there next
we<00:01:51.270> want<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.479> do<00:01:51.600> here<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.899> remove<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.259> rotor

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
we want to do here is remove the rotor

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.560 
we want to do here is remove the rotor
itself<00:01:52.680> now<00:01:53.460> if<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.149> have<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.299> little<00:01:54.420> trouble

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
itself now if you have a little trouble

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.210 
itself now if you have a little trouble
removing<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.110> rotor<00:01:55.320> maybe<00:01:55.560> rusted<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.009> to

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
removing the rotor maybe rusted on to

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.910 
removing the rotor maybe rusted on to
the<00:01:56.340> hub<00:01:56.909> assembly<00:01:57.439> so<00:01:58.439> what<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.619> want<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.799> do

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
the hub assembly so what you want to do

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.310 
the hub assembly so what you want to do
here<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.220> actually<00:01:59.340> reinstall<00:02:00.000> your<00:02:00.079> lug<00:02:01.079> nuts

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
here is actually reinstall your lug nuts

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.260 
here is actually reinstall your lug nuts
and<00:02:01.500> what<00:02:01.590> you'll<00:02:01.710> do<00:02:01.920> then<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.399> using<00:02:03.210> a

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
and what you'll do then is using a

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.580 
and what you'll do then is using a
hammer<00:02:03.479> just<00:02:03.689> hit<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.229> center<00:02:04.469> between

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
hammer just hit in the center between

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.709 
hammer just hit in the center between
all<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.009> lugs<00:02:05.640> here<00:02:05.820> which<00:02:06.030> should<00:02:06.240> rattle<00:02:06.479> it

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
all the lugs here which should rattle it

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.900 
all the lugs here which should rattle it
loose<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.880> make<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.030> rotor<00:02:09.660> come<00:02:09.899> off<00:02:10.910> now

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
loose and make the rotor come off now

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.720 
loose and make the rotor come off now
next<00:02:12.150> moving<00:02:12.420> on<00:02:12.540> here<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.650> not<00:02:14.129> holding<00:02:14.610> the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
next moving on here the not holding the

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.630 
next moving on here the not holding the
hub<00:02:14.910> on<00:02:15.090> itself<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.349> spindle<00:02:16.739> is<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:17.220> inch

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
hub on itself to the spindle is a inch

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.850 
hub on itself to the spindle is a inch
and<00:02:17.760> three

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
and three

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.110 
and three
now<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:19.920> just<00:02:20.160> want<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.340> remove<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.730> loosen<00:02:21.030> it

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
now you just want to remove it loosen it

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.050 
now you just want to remove it loosen it
up<00:02:21.210> just<00:02:21.420> enough<00:02:21.570> here<00:02:22.520> then<00:02:23.520> what<00:02:23.760> you'll<00:02:23.880> do

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
up just enough here then what you'll do

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.490 
up just enough here then what you'll do
here<00:02:24.090> in<00:02:24.420> order<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.660> remove<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.020> hub<00:02:25.140> itself

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
here in order to remove the hub itself

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.500 
here in order to remove the hub itself
considering<00:02:26.280> we're<00:02:26.490> not<00:02:26.640> keeping<00:02:26.910> this<00:02:27.270> hub

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
considering we're not keeping this hub

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.390 
considering we're not keeping this hub
assembly<00:02:27.990> here<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:28.890> we<00:02:28.980> don't<00:02:29.040> really<00:02:29.160> care

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
assembly here so we don't really care

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.170 
assembly here so we don't really care
too<00:02:29.550> much<00:02:29.580> about<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:29.970> bearing<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:32.180> hit

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
too much about the bearing and it is hit

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.850 
too much about the bearing and it is hit
from<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.450> backside<00:02:33.900> with<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.050> hammer<00:02:34.350> here<00:02:34.680> or

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
from the backside with a hammer here or

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.470 
from the backside with a hammer here or
you<00:02:35.310> can<00:02:35.520> use<00:02:35.820> an<00:02:36.140> actual<00:02:37.140> two<00:02:37.410> jaw<00:02:37.650> puller<00:02:38.480> now

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
you can use an actual two jaw puller now

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.850 
you can use an actual two jaw puller now
you<00:02:39.570> also<00:02:39.720> don't<00:02:39.930> have<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.140> worry<00:02:40.380> about<00:02:40.530> the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
you also don't have to worry about the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.650 
you also don't have to worry about the
spindle<00:02:41.490> itself<00:02:41.610> spinning<00:02:42.120> considering<00:02:42.510> this

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
spindle itself spinning considering this

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.590 
spindle itself spinning considering this
is<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.890> fixed<00:02:43.890> assembly<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:45.150> spinning

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
is a fixed assembly and the spinning

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.110 
is a fixed assembly and the spinning
part<00:02:45.780> here<00:02:46.110> is<00:02:46.260> only<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.590> hub<00:02:46.710> itself<00:02:47.120> now

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
part here is only the hub itself now

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.150 
part here is only the hub itself now
before<00:02:48.510> installing<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.260> new<00:02:49.410> hub<00:02:49.620> we<00:02:49.950> want<00:02:50.100> to

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
before installing the new hub we want to

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.520 
before installing the new hub we want to
make<00:02:50.280> sure<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.580> this<00:02:50.990> shaft<00:02:51.990> here<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.320> nice<00:02:52.500> and

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
make sure is this shaft here is nice and

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.680 
make sure is this shaft here is nice and
clean<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.100> get<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.220> little<00:02:53.430> scotch<00:02:54.390> brite

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
clean so you get a little scotch brite

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.950 
clean so you get a little scotch brite
here<00:02:55.020> or<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.650> like<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.910> abrasive<00:02:56.910> pad<00:02:57.180> or

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
here or this is like a abrasive pad or

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.090 
here or this is like a abrasive pad or
you<00:02:58.020> can<00:02:58.110> use<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.260> little<00:02:58.350> emery<00:02:58.710> paper<00:02:58.740> on

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
you can use a little emery paper on

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.050 
you can use a little emery paper on
there<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.280> want<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.460> make<00:02:59.550> sure<00:02:59.760> that's<00:02:59.850> all

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
there you want to make sure that's all

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.180 
there you want to make sure that's all
clean<00:03:00.390> free<00:03:00.630> of<00:03:00.750> any<00:03:00.870> rust<00:03:01.200> or<00:03:01.440> any<00:03:01.530> grease<00:03:02.040> or

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
clean free of any rust or any grease or

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.720 
clean free of any rust or any grease or
anything<00:03:02.220> like<00:03:02.460> that

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
anything like that

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.970 
anything like that
now<00:03:03.690> when<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.900> new<00:03:04.020> hub<00:03:04.230> slides<00:03:04.500> on<00:03:04.710> and<00:03:04.860> just

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
now when the new hub slides on and just

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.520 
now when the new hub slides on and just
basically<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.400> sliding<00:03:05.820> fit<00:03:06.200> now<00:03:07.200> wouldn't

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
basically a sliding fit now wouldn't

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.290 
basically a sliding fit now wouldn't
reinstall<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.070> new<00:03:08.310> hub<00:03:08.520> itself<00:03:08.850> as<00:03:09.150> I

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
reinstall a new hub itself as I

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.970 
reinstall a new hub itself as I
mentioned<00:03:09.600> earlier<00:03:09.870> just<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:10.260> sliding<00:03:10.590> fit<00:03:10.800> so

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
mentioned earlier just a sliding fit so

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:11.900 
mentioned earlier just a sliding fit so
you<00:03:11.010> actually<00:03:11.190> don't<00:03:11.400> need<00:03:11.610> any<00:03:11.760> assistance

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
you actually don't need any assistance

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.450 
you actually don't need any assistance
of<00:03:12.510> having<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:12.960> pressed<00:03:13.410> on<00:03:13.620> or<00:03:13.890> tapped<00:03:14.310> on

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
of having it pressed on or tapped on

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.300 
of having it pressed on or tapped on
with<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.670> hammer<00:03:14.820> itself<00:03:15.860> now<00:03:16.860> as<00:03:17.010> for<00:03:17.220> the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
with the hammer itself now as for the

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.040
