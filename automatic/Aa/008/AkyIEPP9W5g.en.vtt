00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.800
 It is relief and right 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:21.330
 Today's lecture is a three-quarters of the basics. 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:25.859
 I posted a four-quarters- baseline lecture ahead of time. 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:29.090
 If today's lesson is to understand that you come andoesineun saw earlier raised the river 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.090
 It will help you 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.390
 Today's lecture is similar to last lecture 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.930
 Oh, you go rhythmically. 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:44.190
 Last beat in last measure 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:48.390
 Today is three quarters, so it's the third. Third time. 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.949
 3 Oh, the third time in the last word 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:59.519
 It won the three-to-three parts 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:05.549
 I'll put in an appeal. The first one is 8-bit, eight-minute . 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:09.540
 Let's put the other three 16-bit rhythms. 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.990
 Uh, first one first Phil I will try 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.180

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.180
 The last four beats 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.650
 Another 4 2 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:31.120
 It's three . 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:36.840
 And then you start the circle again and start again from the beginning. 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.840
 I'll get you a demonstration once. 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.340
