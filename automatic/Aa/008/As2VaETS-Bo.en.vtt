alright folks in this series we're

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.130 
alright folks in this series we're
drawing<00:00:01.949> magical<00:00:02.850> objects<00:00:03.300> in<00:00:03.510> this<00:00:03.689> clip<00:00:03.990> I'm

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
drawing magical objects in this clip I'm

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.210 
drawing magical objects in this clip I'm
going<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.319> teach<00:00:04.440> you<00:00:04.589> how<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.740> draw<00:00:04.980> different

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
going to teach you how to draw different

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.369 
going to teach you how to draw different
types<00:00:05.400> of<00:00:05.670> magical<00:00:06.150> rings<00:00:06.420> so<00:00:07.080> let's<00:00:07.230> come<00:00:07.350> up

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
types of magical rings so let's come up

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.839 
types of magical rings so let's come up
here<00:00:07.470> in<00:00:07.680> this<00:00:07.740> corner<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:08.370> we'll<00:00:08.519> start<00:00:08.760> up

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
here in this corner and we'll start up

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.100 
here in this corner and we'll start up
here<00:00:10.519> now<00:00:11.519> obviously<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.210> theory<00:00:12.630> rings<00:00:12.870> are

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
here now obviously in theory rings are

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.340 
here now obviously in theory rings are
quite<00:00:13.349> simple<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:14.009> can<00:00:14.340> just<00:00:14.490> kind<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.790> draw

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
quite simple you can just kind of draw

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.429 
quite simple you can just kind of draw
the<00:00:16.350> rough<00:00:16.560> shape<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.130> ring<00:00:17.340> itself<00:00:18.439> just

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
the rough shape of the ring itself just

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.170 
the rough shape of the ring itself just
by<00:00:19.529> drawing<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.859> simple<00:00:20.039> circle<00:00:20.580> maybe<00:00:20.730> come<00:00:21.029> in

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
by drawing a simple circle maybe come in

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.700 
by drawing a simple circle maybe come in
and<00:00:21.359> draw<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.570> inside<00:00:21.840> now<00:00:22.380> if<00:00:22.439> you're<00:00:22.560> just

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
and draw the inside now if you're just

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.320 
and draw the inside now if you're just
drawing<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.039> ring<00:00:23.220> by<00:00:23.400> itself<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:24.090> have<00:00:24.119> this

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
drawing the ring by itself you have this

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.509 
drawing the ring by itself you have this
would<00:00:24.510> be<00:00:24.689> quite<00:00:25.500> easy<00:00:25.740> then<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.220> could<00:00:26.340> draw

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
would be quite easy then you could draw

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.089 
would be quite easy then you could draw
maybe<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.000> little<00:00:27.150> setting<00:00:27.750> for<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.050> stone<00:00:28.380> and

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
maybe a little setting for the stone and

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.380 
maybe a little setting for the stone and
the<00:00:29.849> stone<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:30.840> top<00:00:31.940> like<00:00:32.940> that

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the stone on top like that

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.410 
the stone on top like that
emanating<00:00:33.780> its<00:00:34.020> magical<00:00:34.440> power<00:00:34.680> or<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:36.300> know

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
emanating its magical power or you know

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.569 
emanating its magical power or you know
if<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.690> want<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.050> can<00:00:37.170> get<00:00:37.320> even<00:00:37.410> more<00:00:37.530> ornate

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.069 

again<00:00:41.579> good<00:00:42.030> practice<00:00:42.450> running<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> draw

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
again good practice running on a draw

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.160 
again good practice running on a draw
circle<00:00:45.140> draw<00:00:46.140> something<00:00:46.710> with<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.860> lotta<00:00:48.170> sort

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
circle draw something with a lotta sort

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.360 
circle draw something with a lotta sort
of<00:00:49.289> uh<00:00:50.660> frills<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.960> flair<00:00:52.379> draw<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> ruby

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
of uh frills and flair draw like a ruby

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.900 
of uh frills and flair draw like a ruby
shaped<00:00:53.640> thing

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.999 

also<00:01:02.719> interesting<00:01:02.960> now<00:01:03.379> what<00:01:03.530> I'm<00:01:03.649> gonna<00:01:03.769> do

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
also interesting now what I'm gonna do

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:05.830 
also interesting now what I'm gonna do
though<00:01:04.189> is<00:01:04.489> there's<00:01:04.909> obviously<00:01:05.449> lots<00:01:05.689> of

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
though is there's obviously lots of

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.300 
though is there's obviously lots of
choices<00:01:06.140> you<00:01:06.439> can<00:01:06.560> do<00:01:06.770> when<00:01:06.920> it<00:01:07.009> comes<00:01:07.040> to

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
choices you can do when it comes to

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.620 
choices you can do when it comes to
drawing<00:01:07.460> rings<00:01:07.729> I'm<00:01:07.880> gonna<00:01:07.970> teach<00:01:08.150> you<00:01:08.330> how<00:01:08.360> to

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
drawing rings I'm gonna teach you how to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.130 
drawing rings I'm gonna teach you how to
draw<00:01:08.960> a<00:01:09.290> ring<00:01:10.130> similar<00:01:10.790> to<00:01:11.210> one<00:01:11.650> found<00:01:12.650> on<00:01:13.190> a

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
no but first Roger the the texture and

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.730 
no but first Roger the the texture and
the<00:01:26.390> shape<00:01:26.659> of<00:01:26.810> a<00:01:26.930> ring<00:01:27.110> we're<00:01:27.470> gonna<00:01:27.560> learn

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
the shape of a ring we're gonna learn

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.320 
the shape of a ring we're gonna learn
how<00:01:27.830> to<00:01:27.860> draw<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.100> little<00:01:28.580> bit<00:01:28.670> in<00:01:28.789> perspective

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
how to draw a little bit in perspective

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330 
how to draw a little bit in perspective
here<00:01:29.450> so<00:01:29.630> this<00:01:29.750> would<00:01:29.960> be<00:01:30.140> start<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:31.250> that

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
here so this would be start and that

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.680 
here so this would be start and that
would<00:01:31.430> be<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.640> outer<00:01:31.789> edge<00:01:32.119> of<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:32.360> ring<00:01:32.539> and

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
would be the outer edge of the ring and

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.609 
would be the outer edge of the ring and
now<00:01:32.750> here<00:01:32.899> we're<00:01:32.990> gonna<00:01:33.080> come<00:01:33.289> in<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:33.500> draw

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
now here we're gonna come in and draw

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.309 
now here we're gonna come in and draw
the<00:01:33.649> inner<00:01:33.920> edge<00:01:34.509> keeping<00:01:35.509> in<00:01:35.630> mind<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:36.140> rough

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:36.319 
the inner edge keeping in mind the rough

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:42.190 
the inner edge keeping in mind the rough
shape<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:38.780> as<00:01:39.409> you<00:01:39.590> can<00:01:39.710> see<00:01:40.929> it's<00:01:41.929> gonna<00:01:42.020> be

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
shape and as you can see it's gonna be

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.630 
shape and as you can see it's gonna be
the<00:01:42.289> inner<00:01:42.440> part<00:01:42.800> and<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:42.979> outer<00:01:43.039> part<00:01:43.520> of<00:01:43.550> the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
the inner part and the outer part of the

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.059 
the inner part and the outer part of the
Ring<00:01:43.899> now<00:01:44.899> we<00:01:44.960> could<00:01:45.200> come<00:01:45.619> in<00:01:45.649> here<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:45.890> draw

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
Ring now we could come in here and draw

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:50.340 
Ring now we could come in here and draw
a<00:01:46.100> little<00:01:46.220> bit<00:01:46.399> of<00:01:46.460> a<00:01:46.550> shadow<00:01:46.819> to<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:47.420> too<00:01:48.909> and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
a little bit of a shadow to it too and

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.550 
a little bit of a shadow to it too and
if<00:01:51.350> you<00:01:51.560> have<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:52.130> ability<00:01:52.670> you<00:01:53.380> could<00:01:54.380> come

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
if you have the ability you could come

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.139 
if you have the ability you could come
in<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:54.770> shadow<00:01:55.159> these<00:01:55.490> parts<00:01:55.789> like<00:01:55.940> take<00:01:56.119> a

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
in and shadow these parts like take a

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.630 
in and shadow these parts like take a
pen<00:01:56.509> that<00:01:56.690> so<00:01:56.840> maybe<00:01:57.049> a<00:01:57.140> little<00:01:57.200> bit<00:01:57.640> thicker

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
pen that so maybe a little bit thicker

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.670 
pen that so maybe a little bit thicker
come<00:01:58.940> in<00:01:59.060> here<00:02:03.549> color<00:02:04.549> in<00:02:04.909> that<00:02:05.299> part<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:05.960> this

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
come in here color in that part and this

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.990 
come in here color in that part and this
is<00:02:06.829> just<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:07.070> rough<00:02:07.250> shadowing<00:02:07.820> technique

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
is just a rough shadowing technique

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.210 
is just a rough shadowing technique
obviously<00:02:08.420> they're<00:02:09.079> a<00:02:09.110> lot<00:02:09.590> more<00:02:09.619> detailed

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
obviously they're a lot more detailed
