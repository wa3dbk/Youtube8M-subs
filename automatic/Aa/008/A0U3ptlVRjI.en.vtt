00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.020 
the back of the net from a dead ball
position<00:02:18.570> just<00:02:19.200> beautiful<00:02:19.490> great<00:02:20.490> free-kick

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
position just beautiful great free-kick

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.850 
position just beautiful great free-kick
got<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.390> give<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.750> him<00:02:21.900> but<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.230> know<00:02:22.260> it

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
got to give it to him but you know it

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.120 
got to give it to him but you know it
was<00:02:23.040> our<00:02:23.220> fault<00:02:23.490> we<00:02:23.850> gave<00:02:24.120> away<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.450> freaky

was our fault we gave away that freaky
so<00:02:26.130> one-nil<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:26.880> them<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:27.960> that's<00:02:28.500> basically

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
so one-nil to them and that's basically

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.610 
so one-nil to them and that's basically
all<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.730> happened<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.240> that<00:02:30.270> game<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:31.500> know

all that happened in that game you know
it's<00:02:31.800> not<00:02:31.950> nice<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.220> lose<00:02:32.670> especially<00:02:33.480> just

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
it's not nice to lose especially just

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.070 
it's not nice to lose especially just
from<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.710> one<00:02:34.770> action<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.850> both<00:02:36.420> teams<00:02:36.810> had

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080

one<00:02:37.350> shot<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:38.010> had<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.730> shot<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.270> it<00:02:39.390> was<00:02:39.510> saved

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
one shot I had a shot and it was saved

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.420

thought what why so you know at this

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.250 
thought what why so you know at this
point<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.760> thinking<00:02:48.240> it's<00:02:48.480> this<00:02:48.720> ever<00:02:48.990> gonna

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
point is thinking it's this ever gonna

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.820 
point is thinking it's this ever gonna
go<00:02:49.530> in<00:02:49.710> for<00:02:49.740> me<00:02:50.360> it<00:02:51.360> it's<00:02:51.930> not<00:02:52.200> looking<00:02:52.650> good

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
go in for me it it's not looking good

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.340 
go in for me it it's not looking good
the<00:02:53.190> amount<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.490> shots<00:02:53.790> on<00:02:54.060> getting<00:02:54.360> see<00:02:54.690> I<00:02:54.870> got

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
attempt to occur I would have been a

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.710 
attempt to occur I would have been a
beautiful<00:03:34.770> debut<00:03:35.580> goal<00:03:35.850> if<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.209> had<00:03:36.330> gone<00:03:36.390> in

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
going for the simple finesse a lot of

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.250 
going for the simple finesse a lot of
curl<00:03:41.610> was<00:03:41.820> put<00:03:42.060> on<00:03:42.180> it<00:03:42.300> just<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.600> bit<00:03:42.750> too<00:03:42.990> much

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
curl was put on it just a bit too much

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.240 
curl was put on it just a bit too much
power<00:03:43.880> but<00:03:44.880> we<00:03:45.270> played<00:03:45.780> well<00:03:46.220> we're<00:03:47.220> just
