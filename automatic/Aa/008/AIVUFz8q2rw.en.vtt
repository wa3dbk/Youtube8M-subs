 work on the selection had an accident 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.240
 after this genre 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.440

 us and eu territories 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.220
 second priority is given 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.050
 this option where the authors first

 as a rule Turkey 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.010
 all these are actors who 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.509
 designed hoped 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.149
 in the text

 crisis shos 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:54.179
 m 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:01.589

 Zaporizhia 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.470
 cavalier airport and the action of this or that 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.379
 another player and I think that this 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.839
 means only one 3 thousand 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:40.959
 all these tasks are solved problems 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.509
 ensure what happened 

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:45.179

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:57.589
 so on but because that is 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:03:59.470
 respectively 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.609
 16a p. 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.359
 so even if the animal press 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.359
 after the crisis refused 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:11.799
 correct decision reflects 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.799

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.379
 with this edition 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:24.379
 so here

 As a result, Alexander Chepik increasingly 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.960
 union now 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:50.159

 Khabarovsk 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:10.589
 it would seem, why to begin its decay 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:11.939

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:23.979
 a crowd of teenagers 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.229
