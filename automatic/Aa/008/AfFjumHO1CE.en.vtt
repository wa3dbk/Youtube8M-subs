00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
studio in a previous tutorial we

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.010 
studio in a previous tutorial we
motive<00:00:14.710> room<00:00:14.920> in<00:00:15.099> this<00:00:15.820> tutorial<00:00:16.030> we'll<00:00:16.750> build

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
motive room in this tutorial we'll build

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.740 
motive room in this tutorial we'll build
the<00:00:17.410> tire<00:00:17.680> that<00:00:17.950> goes<00:00:18.130> around<00:00:18.279> that<00:00:18.640> rim<00:00:18.910> using

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
the tire that goes around that rim using

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.170 
the tire that goes around that rim using
flow<00:00:20.020> along<00:00:20.289> surface<00:00:20.830> and<00:00:21.039> flow<00:00:21.430> along<00:00:21.760> curve

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
flow along surface and flow along curve

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.720 
flow along surface and flow along curve
in<00:00:22.720> order<00:00:22.990> to<00:00:23.170> construct<00:00:23.470> the<00:00:24.070> tread<00:00:24.700> pattern

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
in order to construct the tread pattern

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.440 
in order to construct the tread pattern
that<00:00:25.660> will<00:00:25.840> wrap<00:00:26.080> around<00:00:26.110> the<00:00:26.590> surface<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:28.090> in

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
that will wrap around the surface so in

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.999 
that will wrap around the surface so in
this<00:00:28.750> you<00:00:28.930> can<00:00:29.050> see<00:00:29.290> that<00:00:29.470> I<00:00:29.500> have<00:00:29.800> some

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
this you can see that I have some

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.570 
this you can see that I have some
objects<00:00:30.850> set<00:00:31.029> up<00:00:31.180> in<00:00:31.330> space<00:00:32.370> here<00:00:33.370> you'll

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
objects set up in space here you'll

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.210 
objects set up in space here you'll
recognize<00:00:34.180> from<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:34.600> rim<00:00:34.960> tutorial<00:00:35.559> that

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
recognize from the rim tutorial that

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.689 
recognize from the rim tutorial that
this<00:00:36.489> is<00:00:36.730> the<00:00:37.390> rim<00:00:37.900> piece<00:00:38.170> that<00:00:38.739> that<00:00:38.980> will

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
this is the rim piece that that will

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.350 
this is the rim piece that that will
hold<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.210> tire<00:00:40.480> in<00:00:40.809> place<00:00:41.430> all<00:00:42.430> these

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
hold the tire in place all these

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.930 
hold the tire in place all these
dimensions<00:00:43.960> for<00:00:44.320> these<00:00:44.530> tutorials<00:00:45.339> are

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
dimensions for these tutorials are

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.479 
dimensions for these tutorials are
basically<00:00:46.390> taken<00:00:46.809> directly<00:00:47.410> from<00:00:47.530> dimensions

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
basically taken directly from dimensions

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.470 
basically taken directly from dimensions
of<00:00:48.730> a<00:00:49.300> rim<00:00:49.540> including<00:00:50.410> offset<00:00:50.980> in<00:00:51.480> bolt

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
of a rim including offset in bolt

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.130 
of a rim including offset in bolt
pattern<00:00:52.930> etc<00:00:53.760> here<00:00:54.760> you'll<00:00:54.969> see<00:00:55.270> that<00:00:55.750> this<00:00:55.930> is

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
pattern etc here you'll see that this is

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.709 
pattern etc here you'll see that this is
just<00:00:56.379> a<00:00:56.469> simple<00:00:56.770> surface<00:00:57.180> using<00:00:58.180> this<00:00:58.360> black

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
just a simple surface using this black

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.220 
just a simple surface using this black
curve<00:00:59.260> as<00:00:59.500> a<00:00:59.640> revolve<00:01:00.640> this<00:01:01.570> black<00:01:01.899> curve

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
representing what a ball tire might look

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.800 
representing what a ball tire might look
like<00:01:04.839> in<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.800> green<00:01:06.240> representing<00:01:07.240> where<00:01:07.780> I

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
like in the green representing where I

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.960 
like in the green representing where I
would<00:01:08.170> like<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.950> tread<00:01:09.460> pattern<00:01:09.490> to<00:01:10.119> rise<00:01:10.330> to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
would like the tread pattern to rise to

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.090 
would like the tread pattern to rise to
over<00:01:12.970> here<00:01:13.270> you'll<00:01:13.450> see<00:01:13.539> the<00:01:13.840> tread<00:01:14.140> and<00:01:14.380> I

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
over here you'll see the tread and I

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.760 
over here you'll see the tread and I
just<00:01:15.340> googled<00:01:15.580> an<00:01:15.850> image<00:01:16.149> of<00:01:16.380> tread<00:01:17.380> pattern

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
just googled an image of tread pattern

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.650 
just googled an image of tread pattern
and<00:01:17.800> then<00:01:19.830> copied<00:01:20.830> a<00:01:20.860> part<00:01:21.399> of<00:01:21.520> it<00:01:21.670> and<00:01:21.819> then<00:01:22.479> I

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
and then copied a part of it and then I

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.020 
and then copied a part of it and then I
rate<00:01:22.959> it<00:01:22.990> about<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.220> length<00:01:24.459> that<00:01:24.759> I<00:01:24.789> would

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
rate it about the length that I would

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.410 
rate it about the length that I would
require<00:01:25.630> to<00:01:26.500> wrap<00:01:26.740> around<00:01:26.770> this<00:01:27.340> rim<00:01:27.610> and<00:01:27.849> you

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
require to wrap around this rim and you

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.870 
require to wrap around this rim and you
can<00:01:28.569> find<00:01:28.869> that<00:01:29.259> approximate<00:01:29.950> length<00:01:30.160> by

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
can find that approximate length by

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.889 
can find that approximate length by
simply<00:01:31.660> doing<00:01:31.840> analyze<00:01:32.759> length<00:01:33.759> it<00:01:34.090> asks

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
simply doing analyze length it asks

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.499 
simply doing analyze length it asks
curves<00:01:35.259> to<00:01:35.500> measure<00:01:35.709> and<00:01:36.039> it<00:01:36.729> would<00:01:36.880> be<00:01:37.060> this

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
curves to measure and it would be this

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.889 
curves to measure and it would be this
curve<00:01:37.869> right<00:01:38.229> here<00:01:38.490> hit<00:01:39.490> enter<00:01:39.849> and<00:01:40.630> that's

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
curve right here hit enter and that's

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.469 
curve right here hit enter and that's
about<00:01:41.080> seventy<00:01:41.830> three<00:01:42.130> point<00:01:42.910> six<00:01:43.209> five

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
about seventy three point six five

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.020 
about seventy three point six five
inches<00:01:43.989> long<00:01:44.050> and<00:01:44.560> that's<00:01:45.340> about<00:01:45.520> what<00:01:45.880> this

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
inches long and that's about what this

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.370 
inches long and that's about what this
is<00:01:47.910> same<00:01:48.910> for<00:01:48.940> the<00:01:49.239> sidewall<00:01:49.690> so<00:01:49.989> you<00:01:50.050> just

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
is same for the sidewall so you just

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.979 
is same for the sidewall so you just
analyze<00:01:50.649> that<00:01:51.250> length<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:52.149> the<00:01:52.569> reason<00:01:52.869> why

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:52.989 
analyze that length the the reason why

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:55.050 
analyze that length the the reason why
it<00:01:53.110> needs<00:01:53.319> to<00:01:53.380> be<00:01:53.560> close<00:01:53.800> is<00:01:54.190> if<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:54.759> isn't

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
it needs to be close is if it isn't

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.350 
it needs to be close is if it isn't
there'll<00:01:55.690> be<00:01:55.720> some<00:01:56.020> unexpected<00:01:57.360> stretching

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
there'll be some unexpected stretching

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.339 
there'll be some unexpected stretching
or<00:01:58.539> squishing<00:01:59.259> of<00:01:59.410> your<00:02:00.190> geometry<00:02:01.349> depending

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:02.349 
or squishing of your geometry depending

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:05.400 
or squishing of your geometry depending
on<00:02:02.440> if<00:02:02.560> it's<00:02:02.709> too<00:02:02.890> long<00:02:03.099> or<00:02:03.340> too<00:02:03.369> short<00:02:03.789> so<00:02:04.410> the

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
on if it's too long or too short so the

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.380 
on if it's too long or too short so the
first<00:02:05.649> thing<00:02:05.830> that<00:02:05.890> we're<00:02:06.069> going<00:02:06.190> to<00:02:06.310> need<00:02:07.209> to

first thing that we're going to need to

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.040 
first thing that we're going to need to
do<00:02:07.569> is<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:08.229> look<00:02:08.950> at<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:10.030> tread<00:02:10.330> profile<00:02:10.810> in

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.280 
we're going to have to flatten the tread
as<00:02:27.319> if<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.680> was<00:02:27.830> sort<00:02:28.099> of<00:02:28.189> a<00:02:28.310> tire<00:02:28.610> retread<00:02:29.360> that

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
as if it was sort of a tire retread that

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.080 
as if it was sort of a tire retread that
we're<00:02:30.470> then<00:02:30.769> going<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.069> wrap<00:02:31.400> onto<00:02:31.670> a<00:02:31.819> ball

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
we're then going to wrap onto a ball

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.920 
we're then going to wrap onto a ball
tire<00:02:32.420> so<00:02:33.260> in<00:02:33.409> order<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.860> do<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.220> we'll<00:02:34.610> use

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
tire so in order to do that we'll use

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.000 
tire so in order to do that we'll use
flow<00:02:35.930> along<00:02:36.230> curve<00:02:36.760> so<00:02:37.760> go<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.030> transform<00:02:39.010> flow

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
flow along curve so go to transform flow

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.970 
flow along curve so go to transform flow
along<00:02:40.310> curve<00:02:40.700> it's<00:02:41.000> going<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.900> ask<00:02:42.079> objects<00:02:42.829> to

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
along curve it's going to ask objects to

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.280 
along curve it's going to ask objects to
flow<00:02:43.220> along<00:02:43.370> curve<00:02:43.879> that's<00:02:44.629> going<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.019> be<00:02:45.140> the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
flow along curve that's going to be the

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.059 
flow along curve that's going to be the
tread<00:02:45.560> profile<00:02:46.390> hit<00:02:47.390> enter<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.860> base

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
tread profile hit enter and the base

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.610 
tread profile hit enter and the base
curve<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.849> base<00:02:50.090> curve<00:02:50.450> is<00:02:50.659> basically<00:02:51.019> the

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
curve the base curve is basically the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.800 
curve the base curve is basically the
spine<00:02:52.099> of<00:02:52.959> this<00:02:53.959> object<00:02:54.730> as<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:56.000> exists<00:02:56.510> now

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
spine of this object as it exists now

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.050 
spine of this object as it exists now
and<00:02:58.390> then<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.599> target<00:03:00.049> curve<00:03:00.349> is<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:01.159> spine

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
and then the target curve is the spine

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.129 
and then the target curve is the spine
of<00:03:02.359> the<00:03:02.599> object<00:03:03.079> as<00:03:03.230> you<00:03:03.920> want<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:04.400> be<00:03:04.790> and

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
of the object as you want it to be and

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:09.550 
of the object as you want it to be and
make<00:03:06.139> sure<00:03:06.319> stretch<00:03:06.769> equals<00:03:07.310> yes<00:03:07.639> is<00:03:07.940> on<00:03:08.750> so

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
make sure stretch equals yes is on so

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.559 
make sure stretch equals yes is on so
I'm<00:03:09.620> going<00:03:09.769> to<00:03:09.799> click<00:03:10.040> that<00:03:10.069> and<00:03:10.549> now<00:03:11.299> you<00:03:11.389> can

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
I'm going to click that and now you can

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.190 
I'm going to click that and now you can
see<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:12.139> this<00:03:13.150> would<00:03:14.150> be<00:03:14.329> this<00:03:14.690> if<00:03:14.930> it<00:03:15.049> was

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
see that this would be this if it was

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.369 
see that this would be this if it was
flattened<00:03:16.090> that's<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.450> curve<00:03:17.840> that<00:03:17.870> we<00:03:18.079> want

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
flattened that's the curve that we want

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.270 
flattened that's the curve that we want
to<00:03:18.560> turn<00:03:18.739> this<00:03:18.950> into<00:03:19.659> so<00:03:20.659> now<00:03:20.870> we<00:03:20.930> need<00:03:21.170> to

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
to turn this into so now we need to

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.250 
to turn this into so now we need to
extrude<00:03:22.280> our<00:03:23.889> rubber<00:03:24.889> and<00:03:25.329> then<00:03:26.329> edit<00:03:26.870> it<00:03:26.959> with

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
extrude our rubber and then edit it with

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.349 
extrude our rubber and then edit it with
this<00:03:27.470> curve<00:03:27.829> that<00:03:28.010> we<00:03:28.129> just<00:03:28.370> made<00:03:28.609> so<00:03:29.269> I'm

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
this curve that we just made so I'm

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.789 
this curve that we just made so I'm
going<00:03:29.569> to<00:03:29.629> extrude<00:03:30.970> close<00:03:31.970> planar<00:03:32.329> curves<00:03:32.799> and

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
going to extrude close planar curves and

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.680 
going to extrude close planar curves and
we<00:03:34.099> want<00:03:34.310> that<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.639> go<00:03:35.109> 0.5<00:03:37.510> just<00:03:38.510> high<00:03:38.660> enough

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
we want that to go 0.5 just high enough

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.610 
we want that to go 0.5 just high enough
that<00:03:39.620> we<00:03:39.739> can<00:03:39.949> then<00:03:40.699> boo<00:03:41.389> lean<00:03:41.629> out<00:03:41.870> what<00:03:42.500> we

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
that we can then boo lean out what we

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.970 
that we can then boo lean out what we
don't<00:03:42.859> want<00:03:43.209> so<00:03:44.209> in<00:03:44.599> order<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:45.109> do<00:03:45.470> that<00:03:45.680> we're

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
don't want so in order to do that we're

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.309 
don't want so in order to do that we're
going<00:03:46.099> to<00:03:46.250> add<00:03:46.430> some<00:03:46.790> more<00:03:47.000> geometry<00:03:47.359> here<00:03:48.049> in

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
going to add some more geometry here in

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.039 
going to add some more geometry here in
order<00:03:48.949> to<00:03:49.160> to<00:03:49.970> make<00:03:50.000> something<00:03:50.599> that<00:03:50.780> we<00:03:50.900> can

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
order to to make something that we can

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.659 
order to to make something that we can
edit<00:03:51.230> this<00:03:51.500> with<00:03:51.769> so<00:03:52.730> I'm<00:03:52.849> going<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.090> go<00:03:54.669> one

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
edit this with so I'm going to go one

00:03:55.669 --> 00:04:03.750 
edit this with so I'm going to go one
inch<00:03:55.910> out<00:03:56.949> say<00:03:57.949> two<00:03:58.010> inches<00:03:58.519> up<00:04:01.000> one<00:04:02.000> inch<00:04:02.180> out

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
inch out say two inches up one inch out

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.589 
inch out say two inches up one inch out
two<00:04:04.760> inches<00:04:05.060> up

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.229 

and<00:04:08.079> now<00:04:08.409> we'll<00:04:08.650> extrude<00:04:09.189> this<00:04:09.519> shape<00:04:09.879> all<00:04:10.180> the

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
and now we'll extrude this shape all the

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.679 
and now we'll extrude this shape all the
way<00:04:11.049> across<00:04:11.549> these<00:04:12.549> new<00:04:12.849> objects<00:04:13.389> that<00:04:13.540> we

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:13.689 
way across these new objects that we

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:20.009 
way across these new objects that we
made<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:14.370> booing<00:04:15.370> them<00:04:15.819> out<00:04:17.100> so<00:04:18.100> extrude<00:04:19.030> all

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
made and booing them out so extrude all

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.129 
made and booing them out so extrude all
the<00:04:20.889> way<00:04:21.039> across<00:04:21.360> just<00:04:22.360> an<00:04:22.479> arbitrary<00:04:22.690> amount

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
the way across just an arbitrary amount

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.999 
the way across just an arbitrary amount
so<00:04:23.740> it<00:04:23.830> goes<00:04:23.979> across<00:04:24.220> everything<00:04:24.789> and<00:04:25.000> then

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:26.009 
so it goes across everything and then

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:31.140 
so it goes across everything and then
we'll<00:04:27.009> have<00:04:27.190> to<00:04:27.310> look<00:04:27.520> in<00:04:27.759> the<00:04:28.860> front<00:04:30.000> side<00:04:31.000> the

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
we'll have to look in the front side the

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.740 
we'll have to look in the front side the
side<00:04:31.419> view<00:04:33.090> I'm<00:04:34.090> going<00:04:34.240> to<00:04:34.330> change<00:04:34.570> the

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
side view I'm going to change the

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.390 
side view I'm going to change the
wireframe<00:04:35.259> so<00:04:35.470> I<00:04:35.500> can<00:04:35.680> easily<00:04:35.830> select

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
wireframe so I can easily select

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.210 
wireframe so I can easily select
everything<00:04:36.699> and<00:04:37.169> I'm<00:04:38.169> going<00:04:38.320> to<00:04:38.380> do<00:04:38.710> boolean

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
everything and I'm going to do boolean

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.870 
everything and I'm going to do boolean
difference<00:04:40.349> so<00:04:41.349> it<00:04:41.440> says<00:04:41.680> select<00:04:41.949> surfaces<00:04:42.669> or

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
difference so it says select surfaces or

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.749 
difference so it says select surfaces or
poly<00:04:43.090> surfaces<00:04:43.750> to<00:04:43.990> subtract<00:04:44.500> from<00:04:44.759> that

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
poly surfaces to subtract from that

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.110 
poly surfaces to subtract from that
would<00:04:45.910> be<00:04:46.090> all<00:04:46.389> of<00:04:46.449> these<00:04:47.910> which<00:04:48.910> are<00:04:49.060> the

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
would be all of these which are the

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.850 
would be all of these which are the
extruded<00:04:49.870> tread<00:04:50.880> hit<00:04:51.880> enter<00:04:52.710> surfaces<00:04:53.710> or

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
extruded tread hit enter surfaces or

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.760 
extruded tread hit enter surfaces or
poly<00:04:54.099> surfaces<00:04:54.759> to<00:04:54.970> subtract<00:04:55.449> with<00:04:55.750> would<00:04:56.620> be

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
poly surfaces to subtract with would be

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.680 
poly surfaces to subtract with would be
this<00:04:56.949> object<00:04:57.449> hit<00:04:58.449> enter<00:05:00.090> okay<00:05:01.090> you<00:05:01.360> can<00:05:01.509> see

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
this object hit enter okay you can see

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.439 
this object hit enter okay you can see
that<00:05:01.870> that<00:05:02.070> worked<00:05:03.070> and<00:05:03.340> I<00:05:03.699> also<00:05:03.910> wanted<00:05:04.300> to

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
that that worked and I also wanted to

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.749 
that that worked and I also wanted to
note<00:05:04.630> that<00:05:04.900> I<00:05:05.320> left<00:05:05.440> a<00:05:05.860> little<00:05:06.039> bit<00:05:06.280> extra

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 
note that I left a little bit extra

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:09.540 
note that I left a little bit extra
there<00:05:07.630> just<00:05:07.960> so<00:05:08.110> I<00:05:08.139> knew<00:05:08.349> that<00:05:08.380> bullying<00:05:08.949> would

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
there just so I knew that bullying would

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.510 
there just so I knew that bullying would
work<00:05:09.820> sometimes<00:05:10.389> when<00:05:10.720> you<00:05:11.380> have<00:05:11.560> endpoints

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
work sometimes when you have endpoints

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.249 
work sometimes when you have endpoints
match<00:05:12.729> up<00:05:13.030> on<00:05:13.240> booing<00:05:13.509> it<00:05:13.960> will<00:05:14.710> fail<00:05:15.099> so<00:05:16.259> let's

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:17.259 
match up on booing it will fail so let's

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:23.100 
match up on booing it will fail so let's
check<00:05:17.560> out<00:05:17.740> our<00:05:17.770> new<00:05:18.210> retread<00:05:19.979> and<00:05:21.870> I'll<00:05:22.870> go<00:05:23.050> to

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
check out our new retread and I'll go to

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.870 
check out our new retread and I'll go to
ghosted<00:05:23.680> so<00:05:23.830> we<00:05:23.919> can<00:05:24.039> see<00:05:24.250> a<00:05:24.280> little<00:05:24.639> bit<00:05:26.880> so

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
ghosted so we can see a little bit so

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.210 
ghosted so we can see a little bit so
that's<00:05:28.090> looking<00:05:28.479> pretty<00:05:28.720> good<00:05:29.020> in<00:05:29.289> order<00:05:29.919> to

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
that's looking pretty good in order to

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.700 
that's looking pretty good in order to
select<00:05:30.520> this<00:05:30.849> easier<00:05:31.330> I'm<00:05:31.930> going<00:05:31.990> to<00:05:32.139> do<00:05:32.289> edit

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
select this easier I'm going to do edit

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.469 
select this easier I'm going to do edit
select<00:05:33.460> objects<00:05:34.060> last<00:05:34.930> created<00:05:35.530> objects<00:05:35.949> and

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
select objects last created objects and

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.450 
select objects last created objects and
then<00:05:37.479> group<00:05:37.900> those<00:05:38.199> just<00:05:38.830> so<00:05:38.949> they're<00:05:39.130> easier

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
then group those just so they're easier

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.129 
then group those just so they're easier
to<00:05:39.490> select<00:05:39.759> next<00:05:40.210> time<00:05:41.130> okay<00:05:42.150> so<00:05:43.150> now<00:05:43.389> our<00:05:43.690> task

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
to select next time okay so now our task

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.270 
to select next time okay so now our task
is<00:05:44.440> to<00:05:44.650> wrap<00:05:44.919> this<00:05:45.190> retread<00:05:45.820> onto<00:05:46.780> this<00:05:46.960> tire

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
is to wrap this retread onto this tire

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.490 
is to wrap this retread onto this tire
so<00:05:48.280> we<00:05:48.490> do<00:05:48.639> that<00:05:48.880> by<00:05:49.419> using<00:05:49.690> flow<00:05:50.169> along

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
so we do that by using flow along

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.420 
so we do that by using flow along
surface<00:05:51.070> so<00:05:51.880> I<00:05:51.909> go<00:05:52.120> to<00:05:52.180> transform<00:05:53.130> flow<00:05:54.130> along

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
surface so I go to transform flow along

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.279 
surface so I go to transform flow along
surface<00:05:55.409> objects<00:05:56.409> to<00:05:56.530> flow<00:05:56.800> would<00:05:57.580> be<00:05:58.289> the

00:05:59.279 --> 00:05:59.289 
surface objects to flow would be the

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:02.939 
surface objects to flow would be the
tread<00:06:00.630> but<00:06:01.630> make<00:06:01.990> sure<00:06:02.169> that<00:06:02.320> you<00:06:02.440> just<00:06:02.710> grab

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
tread but make sure that you just grab

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.999 
tread but make sure that you just grab
the<00:06:02.979> tread<00:06:03.400> so<00:06:03.759> I'm<00:06:04.419> going<00:06:04.599> to<00:06:04.860> unselect<00:06:05.860> that

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.009 
the tread so I'm going to unselect that

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:08.129 
the tread so I'm going to unselect that
and<00:06:06.400> make<00:06:06.759> sure<00:06:06.969> that<00:06:07.120> I<00:06:07.180> just<00:06:07.270> got<00:06:07.719> the<00:06:07.900> tread

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:08.139 
and make sure that I just got the tread

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:12.990 
and make sure that I just got the tread
not<00:06:08.380> the<00:06:08.560> curves<00:06:08.860> as<00:06:09.070> well<00:06:09.690> hit<00:06:10.690> enter<00:06:12.000> select

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
not the curves as well hit enter select

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.899 
not the curves as well hit enter select
base<00:06:13.300> surface<00:06:13.630> and<00:06:14.050> it<00:06:14.889> says<00:06:15.130> to<00:06:15.340> select<00:06:15.490> near

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909 
base surface and it says to select near

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:18.240 
base surface and it says to select near
a<00:06:15.940> corner<00:06:16.389> so<00:06:17.020> it's<00:06:17.169> important<00:06:17.710> where<00:06:18.070> you

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
a corner so it's important where you

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.270 
a corner so it's important where you
select<00:06:18.520> based<00:06:19.270> on<00:06:19.510> how<00:06:20.169> it's<00:06:20.380> going<00:06:20.620> to<00:06:20.740> wrap

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
select based on how it's going to wrap

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.100 
select based on how it's going to wrap
the<00:06:21.460> tire<00:06:21.700> so<00:06:22.330> I'm<00:06:22.540> going<00:06:22.720> to<00:06:22.780> select<00:06:23.010> here

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
the tire so I'm going to select here

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.160 
the tire so I'm going to select here
which<00:06:26.110> means<00:06:26.440> on<00:06:27.240> this<00:06:28.240> model<00:06:28.540> I<00:06:28.810> need<00:06:28.990> to

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.170 
which means on this model I need to

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:35.700 
which means on this model I need to
select<00:06:29.350> here<00:06:32.250> okay<00:06:33.250> and<00:06:33.900> since<00:06:34.900> I<00:06:35.050> was<00:06:35.230> careful

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
select here okay and since I was careful

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.540 
select here okay and since I was careful
when<00:06:36.400> I<00:06:36.430> drew<00:06:36.760> this<00:06:36.970> you<00:06:37.930> can<00:06:38.080> see<00:06:38.290> that<00:06:38.620> the

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
when I drew this you can see that the

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.270 
when I drew this you can see that the
tread<00:06:39.790> pattern<00:06:39.820> is<00:06:40.360> continuous<00:06:40.990> as<00:06:41.169> it<00:06:41.680> passes

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 
tread pattern is continuous as it passes

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.820 
tread pattern is continuous as it passes
over<00:06:42.820> that<00:06:43.000> seam<00:06:44.550> I'm<00:06:45.550> going<00:06:45.700> to<00:06:45.790> fit<00:06:46.000> view<00:06:46.240> and

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
over that seam I'm going to fit view and

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.810 
over that seam I'm going to fit view and
I'm<00:06:47.830> going<00:06:47.980> to<00:06:48.330> go<00:06:49.330> ahead<00:06:49.450> and<00:06:49.960> hide<00:06:50.290> that

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
I'm going to go ahead and hide that

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.490 
I'm going to go ahead and hide that
geometry<00:06:51.870> just<00:06:52.870> so<00:06:53.080> that<00:06:53.260> we're<00:06:53.470> not

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.500 
geometry just so that we're not

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.520 
geometry just so that we're not
rendering<00:06:53.980> extra<00:06:54.490> stuff<00:06:54.760> and<00:06:55.050> we<00:06:56.050> want<00:06:56.260> to<00:06:56.350> put

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:56.530 
rendering extra stuff and we want to put

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.250 
rendering extra stuff and we want to put
something<00:06:56.770> on<00:06:56.980> the<00:06:57.040> sidewall<00:06:57.610> here<00:06:57.820> so<00:06:58.300> I<00:06:58.630> have

00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.260 
something on the sidewall here so I have

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.300 
something on the sidewall here so I have
these<00:06:59.710> objects<00:07:01.230> and<00:07:02.230> we'll<00:07:02.530> do<00:07:02.710> flow<00:07:03.010> along

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.310 
these objects and we'll do flow along

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.840 
these objects and we'll do flow along
surface<00:07:03.790> again<00:07:04.150> so<00:07:04.990> transform<00:07:05.710> flow<00:07:06.550> along

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:06.850 
surface again so transform flow along

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.890 
surface again so transform flow along
surface<00:07:07.380> base<00:07:08.380> surface<00:07:08.620> select<00:07:09.340> near<00:07:09.550> corner

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 
surface base surface select near corner

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:21.129 
surface base surface select near corner
so<00:07:10.900> we'll<00:07:11.110> select<00:07:11.290> there<00:07:11.770> and<00:07:12.900> select<00:07:14.430> here

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:21.139 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:24.820 

and<00:07:21.229> there's<00:07:21.979> our<00:07:22.099> new<00:07:22.280> tire<00:07:23.349> now<00:07:24.349> let's<00:07:24.590> bring

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:24.830 
and there's our new tire now let's bring

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.369 
and there's our new tire now let's bring
us<00:07:24.979> all<00:07:25.129> together<00:07:25.340> into<00:07:25.999> a<00:07:26.030> complete<00:07:26.569> model

00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:29.379 

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:31.600 

here<00:07:30.379> you<00:07:30.469> can<00:07:30.620> see<00:07:30.800> the<00:07:30.919> finished<00:07:31.249> model

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:31.610 
here you can see the finished model

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:44.450 
here you can see the finished model
complete<00:07:32.060> with<00:07:32.330> brake<00:07:32.900> discs<00:07:33.199> and<00:07:33.469> caliper
