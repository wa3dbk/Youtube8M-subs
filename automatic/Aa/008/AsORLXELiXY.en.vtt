range and extended mags on the ump

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.510 
range and extended mags on the ump
people<00:01:55.470> have<00:01:55.560> told<00:01:55.710> me<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:55.950> setup<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.280> better

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
people have told me this setup is better

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.340 
people have told me this setup is better
than<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.000> rapid-fire<00:01:57.329> focus<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.049> which<00:01:58.200> i

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
than the rapid-fire focus to which i

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.080 
than the rapid-fire focus to which i
become<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:58.829> accustomed<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.430> don't<00:01:59.729> honestly

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
become so accustomed to I don't honestly

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.420 
become so accustomed to I don't honestly
I<00:02:00.390> don't<00:02:00.479> think<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.619> mean<00:02:01.920> especially<00:02:02.040> in

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
I don't think so I mean especially in

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.859 
I don't think so I mean especially in
modern<00:02:02.610> warfare<00:02:02.729> 3<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.090> maps<00:02:03.329> just<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.600> tiny

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
modern warfare 3 the maps just so tiny

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.520 
modern warfare 3 the maps just so tiny
that<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:05.130> don't<00:02:05.280> really<00:02:05.399> benefit<00:02:05.939> from

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
that you don't really benefit from

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.809 
that you don't really benefit from
getting<00:02:07.530> an<00:02:07.619> extra<00:02:07.799> range<00:02:08.039> boost<00:02:08.340> especially

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
getting an extra range boost especially

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.460 
getting an extra range boost especially
if<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.000> play<00:02:09.239> like<00:02:09.390> me<00:02:09.569> with<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.780> ump<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.229> tend

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
if you play like me with the ump I tend

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.020 
if you play like me with the ump I tend
to<00:02:10.500> use<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.800> within<00:02:10.950> its<00:02:11.129> limits<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.520> don't<00:02:11.760> if<00:02:11.940> I

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
to use it within its limits I don't if I

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.550 
to use it within its limits I don't if I
see<00:02:12.209> someone<00:02:12.390> across<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.780> map

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
see someone across the map

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.290 
see someone across the map
I'm<00:02:14.099> not<00:02:14.220> gonna<00:02:14.370> go<00:02:14.520> after<00:02:14.670> them<00:02:14.970> i<00:02:15.030> mean<00:02:15.180> i'm

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
I'm not gonna go after them i mean i'm

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.330 
I'm not gonna go after them i mean i'm
not<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.540> ballsy<00:02:15.959> because<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.069> know<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.220> had

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
not that ballsy because you know you had

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.920 
not that ballsy because you know you had
a<00:02:17.370> control<00:02:17.670> recoil<00:02:17.819> on<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.239> but<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.780> point

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
a control recoil on that but the point

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.680 
a control recoil on that but the point
is<00:02:19.050> i<00:02:19.080> mean<00:02:19.230> rapid<00:02:20.220> fire<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.790> focus<00:02:21.330> seems<00:02:21.540> to

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
is i mean rapid fire and focus seems to

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.300 
is i mean rapid fire and focus seems to
come<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.959> play<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.110> lot<00:02:22.319> more<00:02:22.470> often<00:02:22.680> than<00:02:23.160> the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
come to play a lot more often than the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.949 
come to play a lot more often than the
need<00:02:23.459> for<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.790> few<00:02:24.000> extra<00:02:24.090> bullets<00:02:24.510> or<00:02:24.660> that

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
need for a few extra bullets or that

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.440 
need for a few extra bullets or that
extra<00:02:25.260> arrange<00:02:25.500> boost<00:02:25.800> so<00:02:26.730> that's<00:02:26.849> why<00:02:27.030> i<00:02:27.060> use

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
extra arrange boost so that's why i use

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.550 
extra arrange boost so that's why i use
that<00:02:27.630> especially<00:02:27.989> when<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.140> come<00:02:28.260> up<00:02:28.380> against

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
that especially when you come up against

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.530 
that especially when you come up against
more<00:02:28.800> than<00:02:28.860> one<00:02:29.069> person<00:02:29.099> or<00:02:29.700> even<00:02:30.150> if<00:02:30.450> you're

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
more than one person or even if you're

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.839 
more than one person or even if you're
being<00:02:30.630> shot<00:02:30.930> at<00:02:31.110> focus<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.769> just<00:02:31.950> probably<00:02:32.610> the

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
being shot at focus is just probably the

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.309 
being shot at focus is just probably the
best<00:02:33.060> proficiency<00:02:33.630> in<00:02:33.840> my<00:02:33.930> opinion<00:02:34.140> it's

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
best proficiency in my opinion it's

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.780 
best proficiency in my opinion it's
probably<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.800> best<00:02:35.040> proficiency<00:02:35.519> in<00:02:35.670> the

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
probably the best proficiency in the

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.250 
probably the best proficiency in the
game<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.720> know<00:02:36.810> maybe<00:02:36.959> aside<00:02:37.319> from<00:02:37.470> damage<00:02:37.890> or

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
game you know maybe aside from damage or

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.040 
game you know maybe aside from damage or
speed<00:02:40.459> speed<00:02:41.459> speed<00:02:41.700> pretty<00:02:42.300> fucking<00:02:42.630> sick<00:02:42.840> if

I could put speed on an SMG I fucking
what<00:02:44.880> they<00:02:45.000> need<00:02:45.209> light<00:02:45.420> weight<00:02:45.600> in<00:02:45.690> this<00:02:45.780> game

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
what they need light weight in this game

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.229 
what they need light weight in this game
really<00:02:46.110> they<00:02:46.319> do<00:02:46.380> I<00:02:46.650> know<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.640> guns<00:02:47.850> are<00:02:48.180> the

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
really they do I know the guns are the

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.940 
really they do I know the guns are the
depending<00:02:49.049> on<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.200> class<00:02:49.319> you<00:02:49.530> have<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.799> move

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
depending on the class you have you move

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.020 
depending on the class you have you move
faster<00:02:50.340> but<00:02:50.489> I<00:02:50.519> think<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.730> should<00:02:50.880> be<00:02:50.910> that

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
faster but I think it should be that

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.840 
faster but I think it should be that
that<00:02:51.450> little<00:02:51.720> extra<00:02:51.840> boost<00:02:52.200> like<00:02:52.530> speed<00:02:52.890> as

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
that little extra boost like speed as

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.670 
that little extra boost like speed as
you<00:02:54.000> can<00:02:54.120> throw<00:02:54.299> on<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.810> run<00:02:54.989> like<00:02:55.140> fucking

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
you can throw on and run like fucking

you can throw on and run like fucking
