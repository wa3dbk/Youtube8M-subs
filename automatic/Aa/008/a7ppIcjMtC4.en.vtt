you<00:00:05.759> that<00:00:06.180> will<00:00:06.420> allow<00:00:06.779> you<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.740> figure<00:00:08.280> out<00:00:08.490> if

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
you that will allow you to figure out if

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.669 
you that will allow you to figure out if
your<00:00:08.700> frets<00:00:08.940> have<00:00:09.090> been<00:00:09.179> set<00:00:09.420> in<00:00:09.570> properly<00:00:10.110> now

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
your frets have been set in properly now

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.009 
your frets have been set in properly now
you<00:00:10.740> can<00:00:10.980> do<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.219> one<00:00:11.519> by<00:00:11.700> one<00:00:11.750> I've<00:00:12.750> done

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
you can do this one by one I've done

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.900 
you can do this one by one I've done
this<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.290> few<00:00:13.320> times<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:14.099> I'm<00:00:14.219> very<00:00:14.370> confident

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
this a few times and I'm very confident

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.349 
this a few times and I'm very confident
in<00:00:15.089> my<00:00:15.330> technique<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:15.960> how<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.170> do<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.619> but<00:00:17.359> if

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
in my technique and how I do this but if

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.240 
in my technique and how I do this but if
you<00:00:18.720> take<00:00:18.990> something<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.439> tap<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.740> fret

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
you take something and tap that fret

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.750 
you take something and tap that fret
wire<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:21.000> should<00:00:21.270> sound<00:00:21.480> nice<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.930> solid<00:00:22.170> and

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
wire it should sound nice and solid and

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.580 
wire it should sound nice and solid and
what<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.789> use<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.210> an<00:00:24.359> exacto<00:00:24.869> knife<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.410> just

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
what I use is an exacto knife and I just

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.920 
what I use is an exacto knife and I just
use<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.920> butt<00:00:26.099> end<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.599> what<00:00:27.599> I'll<00:00:27.689> do<00:00:27.810> is

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
use the butt end and what I'll do is

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.310 
use the butt end and what I'll do is
I'll<00:00:28.050> just<00:00:28.199> go<00:00:28.349> along<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.769> neck<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.160> just<00:00:30.320> tap

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
I'll just go along the neck and just tap

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.920 
I'll just go along the neck and just tap
on<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.590> front<00:00:31.890> layer<00:00:35.120> now<00:00:36.120> if<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.480> tap<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
on the front layer now if you tap on the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.959 
on the front layer now if you tap on the
end<00:00:37.170> you're<00:00:37.410> gonna<00:00:37.469> hear<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> different<00:00:38.399> tone<00:00:38.670> I

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
end you're gonna hear a different tone I

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.310 
end you're gonna hear a different tone I
hope<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.600> can<00:00:39.719> hear<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:40.170> camera<00:00:42.230> see<00:00:43.230> how

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
hope you can hear this on camera see how

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.220 
hope you can hear this on camera see how
it<00:00:43.410> gets<00:00:43.530> kind<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.890> dull<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.640> muted<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:45.899> you

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
it gets kind of dull and muted if you

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.619 
it gets kind of dull and muted if you
hear<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.710> anywhere<00:00:47.340> across<00:00:47.610> your<00:00:47.969> fretboard

dead on that neck you might even hear a

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.380 
dead on that neck you might even hear a
rattle<00:00:59.100> when<00:00:59.250> we<00:00:59.340> start<00:00:59.579> doing<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> filing<00:01:00.300> on

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
rattle when we start doing the filing on

rattle when we start doing the filing on
the<00:01:00.510> next<00:01:00.750> few<00:01:00.930> steps<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:02.280> go<00:01:02.430> ahead<00:01:02.460> and

the next few steps so just go ahead and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.070 
the next few steps so just go ahead and
take<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.910> little<00:01:03.120> bit<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.570> know<00:01:03.629> extra

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080

minute and just tap all your fret wire
make<00:01:07.229> sure<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.590> doesn't<00:01:07.799> sound<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:09.200> you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
make sure it doesn't sound like this you

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.330 
make sure it doesn't sound like this you
want<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> nice<00:01:10.830> salad<00:01:12.229> nice<00:01:13.229> ping<00:01:13.590> okay

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
want to have a nice salad nice ping okay

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.170 
want to have a nice salad nice ping okay
if<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:15.090> hear<00:01:15.330> any<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.820> center<00:01:18.119> of

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
if you hear any of this in the center of

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.660 
if you hear any of this in the center of
your<00:01:18.270> fret<00:01:18.570> board<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.740> run<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> small<00:01:20.430> bead

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
your fret board you can run a small bead

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.969 
your fret board you can run a small bead
of<00:01:20.759> glue<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.150> side<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.590> will<00:01:22.619> suck

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
of glue on the side and it will suck

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.830 
of glue on the side and it will suck
into<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.430> slot<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.210> will<00:01:24.390> solve<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
into that slot and it will solve the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.480 
into that slot and it will solve the
problem<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.380> don't<00:01:25.680> have<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.979> go<00:01:26.100> back<00:01:26.250> and

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
problem so you don't have to go back and

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.249 
problem so you don't have to go back and
refresh<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.150> slot<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:30.000> some<00:01:30.810> people<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.200> know

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
refresh that slot so some people I know

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.249 
refresh that slot so some people I know
actually<00:01:31.619> do<00:01:32.119> usually<00:01:33.119> just<00:01:33.479> run<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> bead<00:01:34.020> on

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
actually do usually just run a bead on

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.499 
actually do usually just run a bead on
either<00:01:34.920> side<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> fret<00:01:35.610> wire<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.479> will

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
either side of the fret wire it will

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.690 
either side of the fret wire it will
ensure<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.409> fret<00:01:37.680> wire<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.100> not<00:01:38.369> going

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
ensure that that fret wire is not going

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.539 
ensure that that fret wire is not going
to<00:01:38.790> go<00:01:38.939> anywhere<00:01:39.680> but<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:40.829> flooded<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.280> slots

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
to go anywhere but we flooded the slots

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.920 
to go anywhere but we flooded the slots
really<00:01:41.820> good<00:01:42.000> on<00:01:42.180> here<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.659> I'm<00:01:42.780> very

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
really good on here and I'm very

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.749 
really good on here and I'm very
confident<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.799> already<00:01:43.979> did<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.250> tap<00:01:44.460> test

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
confident and I already did the tap test

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.670 
confident and I already did the tap test
on<00:01:45.000> all<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.270> them<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:46.110> wanted<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.409> show<00:01:46.590> you

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
on all of them I just wanted to show you

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.620 
on all of them I just wanted to show you
that<00:01:46.829> technique<00:01:47.310> before<00:01:47.759> we<00:01:48.060> start<00:01:48.299> trimming

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
that technique before we start trimming

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.210 
that technique before we start trimming
because<00:01:49.399> once<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.549> trim<00:01:50.850> them<00:01:51.710> you<00:01:52.710> know<00:01:52.829> it's

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
because once you trim them you know it's

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.889 
because once you trim them you know it's
gonna<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.579> little<00:01:53.670> bit<00:01:53.850> harder<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.060> pull<00:01:54.360> and

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
gonna be a little bit harder to pull and

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.600 
gonna be a little bit harder to pull and
you're<00:01:55.439> you're<00:01:55.950> not<00:01:55.979> gonna<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.369> as<00:01:56.460> much

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
you're you're not gonna have as much

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.340 
you're you're not gonna have as much
control<00:01:56.820> with<00:01:57.360> what<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:57.990> going<00:01:58.140> on

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
control with what you have going on

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.230 
control with what you have going on
having<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:58.890> little<00:01:59.189> bit<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.399> flap<00:01:59.640> -<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.060> can

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
having this little bit of flap - you can

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.270 
having this little bit of flap - you can
pick<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.170> neck<00:02:01.350> up<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.740> make<00:02:01.920> sure<00:02:02.070> that

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
pick the neck up and make sure that

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.859 
pick the neck up and make sure that
everything's<00:02:02.640> seated<00:02:03.060> properly<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.780> that

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
everything's seated properly and that

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.530 
everything's seated properly and that
none<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> front<00:02:04.469> wires<00:02:04.619> are<00:02:04.829> pulling<00:02:05.159> up

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
none of the front wires are pulling up

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.059 
none of the front wires are pulling up
so<00:02:06.540> our<00:02:06.689> next<00:02:06.869> step<00:02:07.170> here<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.680> we'll<00:02:07.950> get

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
so our next step here and we'll get

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.040 
so our next step here and we'll get
right<00:02:08.220> into<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.729> we're<00:02:09.539> going<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.720> take<00:02:09.869> that

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
right into this we're going to take that

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.250 
right into this we're going to take that
fret<00:02:10.410> puller<00:02:10.679> fret<00:02:11.310> cutter<00:02:11.610> and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
fret puller fret cutter and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.930 
fret puller fret cutter and
we're<00:02:13.769> gonna<00:02:13.860> go<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.129> trim<00:02:14.310> all<00:02:14.519> these<00:02:14.700> fret

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
we're gonna go and trim all these fret

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.259 
we're gonna go and trim all these fret
wires<00:02:15.120> off<00:02:15.390> I'll<00:02:16.260> just<00:02:16.530> do<00:02:16.709> one<00:02:16.950> side<00:02:17.269> doing

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
wires off I'll just do one side doing

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.380 
wires off I'll just do one side doing
two<00:02:18.480> sides<00:02:18.780> would<00:02:19.110> be<00:02:19.519> fairly<00:02:20.519> redundant<00:02:21.269> and

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
two sides would be fairly redundant and

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.960 
two sides would be fairly redundant and
I<00:02:21.480> don't<00:02:21.629> want<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.810> waste<00:02:21.959> your<00:02:22.080> time<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.970> there

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
I don't want to waste your time so there

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.539 
I don't want to waste your time so there
are<00:02:24.090> certain<00:02:24.390> techniques<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.930> want<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:25.140> do

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
are certain techniques you want to do

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.680 
are certain techniques you want to do
especially<00:02:26.549> up<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:26.819> here<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.299> want<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.510> come

especially up in here you want to come

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.110 
especially up in here you want to come
from<00:02:27.840> underneath<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.700> always<00:02:32.879> want<00:02:33.060> to

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
from underneath and you always want to

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.420 
from underneath and you always want to
push<00:02:33.360> down<00:02:34.430> as<00:02:35.430> you're<00:02:36.120> doing<00:02:36.299> it<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:37.190> know<00:02:38.190> that

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
push down as you're doing it I know that

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.850 
push down as you're doing it I know that
seems<00:02:38.700> sloppy<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.840> apologize<00:02:40.440> I'm<00:02:40.620> trying

seems sloppy and I apologize I'm trying

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.280 
seems sloppy and I apologize I'm trying
to<00:02:40.950> get<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.069> good<00:02:41.220> camera<00:02:41.430> angle<00:02:42.049> then<00:02:43.049> you<00:02:43.140> just

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
to get a good camera angle then you just

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.990 
to get a good camera angle then you just
go<00:02:43.409> to<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.590> next<00:02:43.739> one<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.190> go<00:02:44.310> rest<00:02:44.790> that

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
go to the next one you go rest that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.900 
go to the next one you go rest that
right<00:02:45.269> up<00:02:45.390> against<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.840> neck<00:02:47.930> pinch<00:02:49.910> while

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
right up against the neck pinch while

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.140 
right up against the neck pinch while
you<00:02:51.000> push<00:02:51.239> down<00:02:52.700> now<00:02:53.700> if<00:02:53.790> we've<00:02:53.940> done

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
you push down now if we've done

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.400 
you push down now if we've done
everything<00:02:54.480> correctly<00:02:54.510> if<00:02:55.019> this<00:02:55.170> neck

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
everything correctly if this neck

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.190 
everything correctly if this neck
bounces<00:02:55.950> around<00:02:56.069> a<00:02:56.370> little<00:02:56.459> bit<00:02:56.810> we're<00:02:57.810> okay<00:02:58.170> I

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
bounces around a little bit we're okay I

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.539 
bounces around a little bit we're okay I
mean<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.530> obviously<00:02:58.650> don't<00:02:59.069> want<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.310> damage

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
mean you obviously don't want to damage

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.199 
mean you obviously don't want to damage
the<00:02:59.730> neck<00:03:00.060> but<00:03:01.190> go<00:03:02.190> right<00:03:02.430> up<00:03:02.579> against<00:03:02.910> there

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.490 

pinch<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.450> push<00:03:06.660> down<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.079> that'll<00:03:07.290> give<00:03:07.440> you

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
pinch and push down and that'll give you

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.039 
pinch and push down and that'll give you
a<00:03:07.560> good<00:03:07.769> clean<00:03:07.799> edge<00:03:08.450> be<00:03:09.450> careful<00:03:09.930> though

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
a good clean edge be careful though

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.199 
a good clean edge be careful though
you're<00:03:10.290> cutting<00:03:10.620> metal<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:11.640> edge<00:03:11.879> is<00:03:12.060> going

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
you're cutting metal that edge is going

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.789 
you're cutting metal that edge is going
to<00:03:12.299> be<00:03:12.450> extremely<00:03:12.930> sharp<00:03:12.959> at<00:03:13.379> this<00:03:13.530> point

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
to be extremely sharp at this point

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.140 
to be extremely sharp at this point
we're<00:03:14.010> gonna<00:03:14.069> come<00:03:14.370> back<00:03:14.400> on<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.790> next<00:03:15.030> few

we're gonna come back on the next few

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.789 
we're gonna come back on the next few
