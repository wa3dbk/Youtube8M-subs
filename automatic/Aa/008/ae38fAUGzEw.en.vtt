 it is as in life an indemnity and our 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:50.130
 and are two murderers who have the 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.060

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.270
 good 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.130
 It's going to happen something this line is. 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.940
 secondly because I'm 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:11.820
 liking all the characters are 18 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:14.250
 copenhagen if I love these signs and the 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.300
 their weapons and it's incredible 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:23.850
 first and want to know are 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:28.610
 ready did not win there and went exactly 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.610
 personal because in game life 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.080
 For me it was one of the best animals 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.080
 this year 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:41.510
 This is what I think is comedy is 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.920
 team faces the cse internet uol 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.769
 It does not even talk about two brothers who are 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.110
 completely addicted to games 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:53.670
 basically won many games at 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.500
 take in front of the cameras and on one day the 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.590
 are transferred to a world of 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:02.790
 alternative for a puppy that I feel 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:06.300
 You between you and God and from there 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.870
 will start a series of a series of 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.090
 adventures 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.629
 incredible and for those who are first 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.340
 because I found the 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.340
 incredible visual design 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:23.440
 Now all those things and not even 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.780
 to listen and I think the dialogues are 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:31.210
 was completely enrolled only for the 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:33.490
 nortão the same as believe all my blue and 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.729
 stay my opinion are the friends who 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:40.630
 I think I should be in these places. 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:43.570
 this year and that's just I think there's a 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:48.389
 look for their animals and see why 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.389
 fantastic until the next staff
