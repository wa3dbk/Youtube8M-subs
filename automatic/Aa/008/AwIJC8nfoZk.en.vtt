00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.680 
I'm so bad right now okay so you need
some<00:01:40.120> redstone<00:01:40.330> of<00:01:41.200> course<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:44.020> need<00:01:44.170> to

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
some redstone of course you need to

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.370 
some redstone of course you need to
linked<00:01:46.690> and<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:47.760> to<00:01:48.760> repeater<00:01:49.270> so<00:01:50.080> they<00:01:50.200> don't

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
linked and to to repeater so they don't

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:58.110 
linked and to to repeater so they don't
activate<00:01:50.800> at<00:01:50.980> the<00:01:51.130> same<00:01:51.370> time<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:57.120> something

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
activate at the same time so something

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:07.790 
activate at the same time so something
like<00:01:58.150> that<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:01.360> something

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
another repeater here

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.140 
another repeater here
it's<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.700> redstone<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.570> there<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.590> are<00:02:33.650> that's

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
it's a redstone and there you are that's

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.370 
it's a redstone and there you are that's
kinda<00:02:36.150> how<00:02:36.300> you<00:02:36.330> make<00:02:36.600> an<00:02:36.720> innovator<00:02:39.080> now<00:02:40.080> just

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
kinda how you make an innovator now just

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.100 
kinda how you make an innovator now just
add<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:42.080> switch<00:02:43.550> or<00:02:44.550> button<00:02:45.090> whatever<00:02:45.360> make<00:02:46.080> a

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
add a switch or button whatever make a

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.910 
add a switch or button whatever make a
never<00:02:48.050> stop<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:50.450> so<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:52.560> other<00:02:52.650> thing<00:02:52.890> you

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
never stop it so the other thing you

never stop it so the other thing you
need<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.459> do<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.390> gravel<00:02:55.200> or<00:02:55.440> sand<00:02:57.530> you

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
need to do this is gravel or sand you

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.130 
need to do this is gravel or sand you
need<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.860> put<00:02:59.130> like<00:02:59.910> one<00:03:00.239> two<00:03:00.450> three<00:03:00.600> four<00:03:00.810> five

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
need to put like one two three four five

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:10.180 
need to put like one two three four five
gravel<00:03:01.950> or<00:03:02.100> sand<00:03:02.420> above<00:03:03.420> air<00:03:04.940> like<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:07.730> for<00:03:08.730> I

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
gravel or sand above air like that for I

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.390 
gravel or sand above air like that for I
so<00:03:11.190> every<00:03:11.940> time<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:13.110> first<00:03:13.410> piston<00:03:13.980> pusher

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
so every time the first piston pusher

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.490 
so every time the first piston pusher
block<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:15.709> that<00:03:16.709> one<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.910> will<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.720> gravel<00:03:19.350> will

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
block and that one it will a gravel will

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.350 
block and that one it will a gravel will
fall<00:03:19.769> and<00:03:20.070> then<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.549> will<00:03:20.700> be<00:03:20.820> able<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.209> push

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
fall and then it will be able to push

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.870 
fall and then it will be able to push
another<00:03:21.600> one<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.950> then<00:03:23.070> this<00:03:23.190> one<00:03:23.250> will<00:03:23.519> go<00:03:23.730> up

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
another one and then this one will go up

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.210 
another one and then this one will go up
and<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:25.380> make<00:03:25.590> an<00:03:25.709> elevator<00:03:26.870> so<00:03:27.920> let's<00:03:28.920> try

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
and to make an elevator so let's try

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.580 
and to make an elevator so let's try
this<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:31.590> there<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:32.040> are

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
this and there you are

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
that's how you make an elevator with

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.990 
that's how you make an elevator with
pistons<00:03:37.100> so<00:03:38.100> yeah<00:03:38.220> that's<00:03:38.430> pretty<00:03:38.489> much<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.970> so

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
pistons so yeah that's pretty much it so
