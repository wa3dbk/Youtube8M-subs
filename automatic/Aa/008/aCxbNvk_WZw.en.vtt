I have a recording Lane so now I'm gonna
actually<00:02:00.869> do

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
actually do

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.060 
actually do
a<00:02:01.610> recording<00:02:02.330> track<00:02:02.690> so<00:02:03.500> I'm<00:02:03.830> gonna<00:02:03.920> hit

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
a recording track so I'm gonna hit

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:15.930 
a recording track so I'm gonna hit

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.620 

and<00:02:16.630> I<00:02:16.870> might<00:02:17.080> put<00:02:17.290> this<00:02:17.470> on<00:02:17.710> I<00:02:18.270> might<00:02:19.270> put<00:02:19.480> this

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
and I might put this on I might put this

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.160 
and I might put this on I might put this
on<00:02:19.840> after<00:02:21.390> after<00:02:22.390> I've<00:02:22.510> already<00:02:22.660> recorded

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
on after after I've already recorded

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.260 
on after after I've already recorded
some<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.560> my<00:02:23.740> tracks<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.250> make<00:02:24.400> sure<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:25.060> hits

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
some of my tracks so make sure the hits

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.240 
some of my tracks so make sure the hits
go<00:02:25.450> with<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.720> comping<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.260> stuff<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:28.830> no<00:02:29.830> I'll

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
go with the comping and stuff so no I'll

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:40.350 
go with the comping and stuff so no I'll
get<00:02:30.460> those<00:02:30.580> extra<00:02:30.880> couple<00:02:31.060> bars<00:02:31.450> there<00:02:39.240> but<00:02:40.240> it

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
get those extra couple bars there but it

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.610 
get those extra couple bars there but it
now<00:02:40.480> it's<00:02:40.660> alive<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:43.410> changing<00:02:44.410> every

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
now it's alive and changing every

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.440 
now it's alive and changing every
pattern<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.460> that's<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.760> pretty<00:02:45.970> simple<00:02:46.330> way

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
pattern and that's a pretty simple way

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.680 
pattern and that's a pretty simple way
to<00:02:46.480> do<00:02:46.690> that<00:02:46.870> now<00:02:47.770> if<00:02:48.070> I<00:02:48.430> choose<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:49.150> could<00:02:49.480> get

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
to do that now if I choose I could get

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.270 
to do that now if I choose I could get
rid<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:49.900> this<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.350> if<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.710> just<00:02:50.920> want<00:02:51.160> to

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
rid of this and if I just want to

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.690 
rid of this and if I just want to
automate<00:02:51.820> just<00:02:52.450> want<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.840> automate<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:53.710> simple

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
automate just want to automate a simple

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.820 
automate just want to automate a simple
swing<00:02:55.000> pattern<00:02:55.300> then<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.900> thing<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:56.410> do<00:02:56.590> is

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
swing pattern then the thing to do is

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.950 
swing pattern then the thing to do is
I've<00:02:57.070> got<00:02:57.340> my<00:02:57.580> ride<00:02:58.030> that's<00:02:58.420> this<00:02:58.660> one<00:02:58.900> right

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
I've got my ride that's this one right

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.980 
I've got my ride that's this one right
here<00:02:59.380> now<00:02:59.620> I'm<00:02:59.770> going<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.010> put<00:03:00.730> in<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.330> so<00:03:01.810> what

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
here now I'm going to put in and so what

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.800 
here now I'm going to put in and so what
are<00:03:02.080> we<00:03:02.170> gonna<00:03:02.290> have<00:03:02.560> we're<00:03:02.770> gonna<00:03:02.890> have<00:03:03.160> one

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
are we gonna have we're gonna have one

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.480 
are we gonna have we're gonna have one
two<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:05.170> I'm<00:03:05.350> going<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.530> use<00:03:05.680> sixteenths<00:03:06.310> but

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
two and I'm going to use sixteenths but

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.730 
two and I'm going to use sixteenths but
I'm<00:03:06.580> gonna<00:03:06.730> have<00:03:06.940> shuffle<00:03:07.540> selected<00:03:08.320> here<00:03:08.500> so

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
I'm gonna have shuffle selected here so

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.190 
I'm gonna have shuffle selected here so
it's<00:03:08.860> sort<00:03:09.070> of<00:03:09.100> going<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.570> not<00:03:10.570> be<00:03:10.750> a<00:03:10.780> straight

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
it's sort of going to not be a straight

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.570 
it's sort of going to not be a straight
sixteenth<00:03:11.800> one<00:03:12.130> two<00:03:12.580> and<00:03:12.880> three<00:03:13.390> four<00:03:14.320> and<00:03:14.680> if

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
sixteenth one two and three four and if

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.000 
sixteenth one two and three four and if
I<00:03:15.700> play<00:03:16.000> that<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:19.630> then<00:03:19.780> down<00:03:19.990> here<00:03:20.050> a<00:03:20.410> global

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
I play that and then down here a global

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.840 
I play that and then down here a global
shuffle<00:03:21.459> pattern<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:24.220> can<00:03:24.340> see<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.760> I<00:03:24.790> can

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
shuffle pattern you can see that I can

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.150 
shuffle pattern you can see that I can
control<00:03:25.450> how<00:03:25.720> much<00:03:26.020> of<00:03:26.080> that<00:03:26.380> shuffle<00:03:26.920> is<00:03:26.980> in

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
control how much of that shuffle is in

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.520 
control how much of that shuffle is in
there<00:03:27.370> so<00:03:28.180> I'm<00:03:28.300> just<00:03:28.330> gonna<00:03:28.630> put<00:03:28.930> in<00:03:29.080> about

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.230 

maybe<00:03:32.530> fifty<00:03:33.280> four<00:03:33.550> percent<00:03:33.730> four<00:03:34.209> percent

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
maybe fifty four percent four percent

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.560 
maybe fifty four percent four percent
over<00:03:34.690> normal<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.950> that<00:03:36.520> won't<00:03:36.730> be<00:03:36.850> so<00:03:37.060> bad<00:03:37.090> and

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
over normal and that won't be so bad and

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.880 
over normal and that won't be so bad and
so<00:03:37.600> now<00:03:38.970> when<00:03:39.970> I<00:03:40.000> have<00:03:40.240> my<00:03:40.450> track<00:03:40.780> then<00:03:41.560> I<00:03:41.709> can

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
so now when I have my track then I can

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.380 
so now when I have my track then I can
just<00:03:42.130> play<00:03:42.850> that<00:03:43.120> everything's<00:03:43.600> in<00:03:43.780> there<00:03:45.390> and

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
just play that everything's in there and

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.979 
just play that everything's in there and
it's<00:03:47.170> a<00:03:47.260> little<00:03:47.530> stale<00:03:47.860> but<00:03:47.890> it<00:03:48.280> is<00:03:48.459> there<00:03:48.989> so

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
it's a little stale but it is there so

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.199 
it's a little stale but it is there so
that<00:03:50.170> if<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.410> want<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.770> go<00:03:50.890> ahead<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.400> put<00:03:52.060> in<00:03:52.180> my

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
that if I want to go ahead and put in my

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.990 
that if I want to go ahead and put in my
bass<00:03:52.570> line<00:03:52.890> and<00:03:53.890> I<00:03:54.310> have<00:03:54.459> just<00:03:54.640> like<00:03:54.760> a<00:03:54.790> regular

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
bass line and I have just like a regular

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.720 
bass line and I have just like a regular
a<00:03:55.480> regular<00:03:55.900> acoustic<00:03:56.680> bass<00:03:56.890> and<00:03:57.280> so<00:03:57.400> I<00:03:57.430> could

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
a regular acoustic bass and so I could

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.000 
a regular acoustic bass and so I could
be<00:03:57.880> walking<00:03:58.090> my<00:03:58.420> bass<00:03:58.660> line<00:03:58.989> and<00:03:59.020> you<00:03:59.830> know

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
be walking my bass line and you know

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:14.570 
be walking my bass line and you know
I'll<00:04:00.250> go<00:04:00.489> this

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.280 

you<00:04:15.580> hear<00:04:15.730> how<00:04:15.880> that<00:04:15.959> alright<00:04:16.959> for<00:04:17.170> some

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
you hear how that alright for some

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.479 
you hear how that alright for some
reason<00:04:17.500> that<00:04:17.530> didn't<00:04:17.830> record<00:04:18.160> but<00:04:18.400> that's

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
reason that didn't record but that's

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.440 
reason that didn't record but that's
okay<00:04:18.850> that's<00:04:19.150> neither<00:04:19.360> here<00:04:19.600> to<00:04:19.690> there<00:04:21.360> so<00:04:22.360> you

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
okay that's neither here to there so you

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.560 
okay that's neither here to there so you
could<00:04:22.570> hear<00:04:22.780> how<00:04:22.900> that<00:04:22.960> went<00:04:23.410> and<00:04:23.590> so<00:04:24.360> we<00:04:25.360> have

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
could hear how that went and so we have

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.210 
could hear how that went and so we have
a<00:04:25.600> couple<00:04:26.290> other<00:04:26.470> different<00:04:26.890> ways<00:04:27.010> that<00:04:27.130> we

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
a couple other different ways that we
