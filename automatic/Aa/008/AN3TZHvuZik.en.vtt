impressions of this track tracks good
it's<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.900> little<00:03:56.079> tight<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:57.310> bikes<00:03:57.489> going

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
it's a little tight and the bikes going

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.650 
it's a little tight and the bikes going
to<00:03:57.760> be<00:03:57.820> a<00:03:57.850> little<00:03:57.910> underpowered<00:03:58.180> you<00:03:58.570> know

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
to be a little underpowered you know

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.539 
to be a little underpowered you know
being<00:03:58.870> at<00:03:58.930> this<00:03:59.049> altitude<00:03:59.200> so<00:03:59.739> it's<00:04:00.340> probably

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
being at this altitude so it's probably

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.190 
being at this altitude so it's probably
going<00:04:00.760> to<00:04:00.820> be<00:04:00.880> a<00:04:01.000> little<00:04:01.150> tougher<00:04:01.989> than<00:04:02.079> it

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
going to be a little tougher than it

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.230 
going to be a little tougher than it
actually<00:04:02.320> looks<00:04:02.739> so<00:04:03.190> I<00:04:03.489> just

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
actually looks so I just

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.090 
actually looks so I just
it's<00:04:04.630> gonna<00:04:04.780> take<00:04:05.050> a<00:04:05.260> lot<00:04:05.410> of<00:04:05.470> momentum<00:04:05.740> you're

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
it's gonna take a lot of momentum you're

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.440 
it's gonna take a lot of momentum you're
gonna<00:04:06.190> have<00:04:06.280> to<00:04:06.370> carry<00:04:06.760> a<00:04:06.910> lot<00:04:07.180> of<00:04:07.210> momentum

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
gonna have to carry a lot of momentum

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.520 
gonna have to carry a lot of momentum
through<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.780> corners<00:04:08.110> to<00:04:08.170> be<00:04:08.260> able<00:04:08.380> to<00:04:08.440> get

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
through the corners to be able to get

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.230 
through the corners to be able to get
over<00:04:08.560> these<00:04:08.710> obstacles<00:04:09.010> so<00:04:09.430> it's<00:04:10.000> gonna<00:04:10.090> be

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
over these obstacles so it's gonna be

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
to win how about the rocks we looked at

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.630 
to win how about the rocks we looked at
all<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.830> rocks<00:04:14.950> that<00:04:15.190> are<00:04:15.220> in<00:04:15.340> this<00:04:15.430> or<00:04:15.580> not

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
all the rocks that are in this or not

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.280 
all the rocks that are in this or not
too<00:04:15.850> big<00:04:16.030> but<00:04:16.060> there<00:04:16.300> are<00:04:16.450> quite<00:04:16.690> a<00:04:16.750> few<00:04:16.840> does

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
too big but there are quite a few does

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.140 
too big but there are quite a few does
that<00:04:17.470> hand<00:04:17.860> guard<00:04:18.100> time<00:04:18.310> or<00:04:18.550> nothing<00:04:18.940> for<00:04:19.060> you

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
that hand guard time or nothing for you

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.420 
that hand guard time or nothing for you
I'll<00:04:19.930> see<00:04:20.140> how<00:04:20.230> bad<00:04:20.410> it<00:04:20.530> hurts<00:04:20.739> after<00:04:20.860> practice

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
I'll see how bad it hurts after practice

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.820 
I'll see how bad it hurts after practice
I<00:04:21.640> am<00:04:22.540> NOT<00:04:22.750> trying<00:04:23.290> to<00:04:23.440> switch<00:04:23.680> into

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
I am NOT trying to switch into

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.230 
I am NOT trying to switch into
handguards<00:04:24.340> I'm<00:04:24.430> not<00:04:24.550> a<00:04:24.580> big<00:04:24.730> fan<00:04:24.760> of<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.120> look

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
handguards I'm not a big fan of the look

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.040 
handguards I'm not a big fan of the look
of<00:04:25.420> them<00:04:25.540> but<00:04:25.720> if<00:04:25.870> I<00:04:26.200> half<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:26.530> author<00:04:26.680> along
