00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
and at that time when I fired him the

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.909 
and at that time when I fired him the
last<00:05:16.900> fight<00:05:17.110> as<00:05:17.229> well<00:05:17.350> he<00:05:17.500> does<00:05:17.620> something

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
last fight as well he does something

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.860 
last fight as well he does something
like<00:05:18.040> three<00:05:18.280> fights<00:05:18.520> in<00:05:18.790> six<00:05:19.510> weeks<00:05:19.660> or

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
like three fights in six weeks or

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.629 
like three fights in six weeks or
something<00:05:20.020> they'd<00:05:20.770> been<00:05:20.979> fighting<00:05:21.310> every<00:05:21.490> two

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
something they'd been fighting every two

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.010 
something they'd been fighting every two
weeks<00:05:21.850> and<00:05:22.060> I<00:05:22.150> thought<00:05:22.360> his<00:05:22.510> body<00:05:22.630> might<00:05:22.900> have

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
weeks and I thought his body might have

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.450 
weeks and I thought his body might have
a<00:05:23.050> few<00:05:23.229> little<00:05:23.440> niggly<00:05:23.710> injuries<00:05:24.160> he<00:05:24.220> might<00:05:24.370> be

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
a few little niggly injuries he might be

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.580 
a few little niggly injuries he might be
slowing<00:05:24.700> down<00:05:24.850> a<00:05:25.000> little<00:05:25.240> bit<00:05:25.479> and<00:05:26.229> I<00:05:26.350> just

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
slowing down a little bit and I just

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.140 
slowing down a little bit and I just
thought<00:05:26.710> I'd<00:05:26.860> try<00:05:27.010> and<00:05:27.070> smash<00:05:27.729> him<00:05:27.910> with<00:05:27.940> low

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
thought I'd try and smash him with low

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.420 
thought I'd try and smash him with low
kicks<00:05:28.510> and<00:05:29.260> try<00:05:29.470> and<00:05:29.590> box<00:05:29.800> his<00:05:29.950> head<00:05:30.070> movement

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
kicks and try and box his head movement

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
kicks and try and box his head movement
