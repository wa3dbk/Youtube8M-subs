00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.790 

sometimes<00:00:22.060> it's<00:00:22.390> quite<00:00:22.779> difficult<00:00:23.050> getting

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
sometimes it's quite difficult getting

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.620 
sometimes it's quite difficult getting
into<00:00:24.039> the<00:00:24.130> festive<00:00:24.490> spirit<00:00:24.609> and<00:00:25.060> if<00:00:25.329> this<00:00:25.480> is

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
into the festive spirit and if this is

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.179 
into the festive spirit and if this is
the<00:00:25.779> case<00:00:25.929> for<00:00:25.960> you<00:00:26.259> that<00:00:26.560> we<00:00:26.739> found<00:00:27.009> a

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
the case for you that we found a

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.939 
the case for you that we found a
solution<00:00:27.369> it<00:00:27.910> involves<00:00:28.480> snow<00:00:28.750> and<00:00:29.289> curls<00:00:29.769> and

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
solution it involves snow and curls and

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:40.829 
solution it involves snow and curls and
it's<00:00:30.279> called<00:00:30.550> slava<00:00:30.970> snow<00:00:31.359> show<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:40.420> how<00:00:40.780> many

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:40.839 
it's called slava snow show so how many

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:43.500 
it's called slava snow show so how many
crowns<00:00:41.199> are<00:00:41.440> in<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.710> show<00:00:41.890> in<00:00:42.040> total<00:00:42.370> well<00:00:42.820> we

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
crowns are in the show in total well we

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.450 
crowns are in the show in total well we
never<00:00:43.659> really<00:00:44.079> know<00:00:44.260> because<00:00:44.769> they<00:00:45.129> just

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
never really know because they just

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.680 
never really know because they just
seemed<00:00:45.760> to<00:00:45.909> appear<00:00:46.269> sometimes<00:00:46.659> and<00:00:48.690> so

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
seemed to appear sometimes and so

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.819 
seemed to appear sometimes and so
sometimes<00:00:50.170> are<00:00:50.320> a<00:00:50.350> lot<00:00:50.470> more<00:00:50.500> than<00:00:50.710> other

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
sometimes are a lot more than other

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.490 
sometimes are a lot more than other
times<00:00:51.129> so<00:00:52.059> they're<00:00:52.269> rather<00:00:52.449> unpredictable<00:00:52.899> as

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
times so they're rather unpredictable as

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.020 
times so they're rather unpredictable as
you<00:00:54.010> can<00:00:54.189> see<00:00:56.309> they<00:00:57.309> all<00:00:57.489> know<00:00:57.670> each<00:00:57.699> other

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
you can see they all know each other

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.999 
you can see they all know each other
really<00:00:58.299> well<00:00:58.390> and<00:00:58.750> they<00:00:59.019> are<00:00:59.049> like<00:00:59.470> and<00:00:59.920> the

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:00.009 
really well and they are like and the

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:12.219 
really well and they are like and the
whole<00:01:00.189> show<00:01:00.430> is<00:01:00.460> like<00:01:00.790> a<00:01:00.820> family

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.149 

most<00:01:12.860> of<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.100> clowns<00:01:13.400> have<00:01:13.640> worked<00:01:14.299> and<00:01:15.159> build

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
most of the clowns have worked and build

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.920 
most of the clowns have worked and build
their<00:01:16.400> character<00:01:16.580> over<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.270> period<00:01:17.570> of<00:01:17.780> eight

their character over a period of eight

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.100 
their character over a period of eight
to<00:01:18.409> ten<00:01:18.590> years<00:01:19.119> so<00:01:20.119> we<00:01:20.509> couldn't<00:01:20.750> become<00:01:21.080> a

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
to ten years so we couldn't become a

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.389 
to ten years so we couldn't become a
clown<00:01:21.380> like<00:01:21.619> we<00:01:21.799> couldn't<00:01:22.009> be<00:01:22.130> in<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.250> show
