00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.340 
want to blow it up and put it on a
canvas<00:06:30.010> I<00:06:30.490> guess<00:06:31.390> that<00:06:31.420> is<00:06:31.630> what<00:06:31.840> this<00:06:32.020> does

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.930 
canvas I guess that is what this does
which<00:06:32.680> is<00:06:32.710> really<00:06:33.010> cool<00:06:33.280> I<00:06:33.340> think<00:06:33.610> it'd<00:06:33.910> be

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
which is really cool I think it'd be

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.120 
which is really cool I think it'd be
awesome<00:06:34.180> if<00:06:34.600> I<00:06:35.050> did<00:06:35.260> this<00:06:35.470> and<00:06:35.830> got<00:06:35.950> like<00:06:36.100> a

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.130 
awesome if I did this and got like a

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.130
