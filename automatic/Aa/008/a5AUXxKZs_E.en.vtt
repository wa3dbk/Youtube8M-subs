these cobbles are submerged and whatnot
and<00:00:57.999> we've<00:00:58.999> got<00:00:59.149> a<00:00:59.179> little<00:00:59.449> pocket<00:00:59.690> hole<00:01:00.019> here

and we've got a little pocket hole here

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.329 
and we've got a little pocket hole here
we've<00:01:00.440> dug<00:01:00.709> in<00:01:02.619> just<00:01:03.619> trying<00:01:03.889> to<00:01:03.979> dug<00:01:04.159> all

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
we've dug in just trying to dug all

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.480 
we've dug in just trying to dug all
around<00:01:04.609> in<00:01:04.789> here<00:01:05.740> from<00:01:06.740> like<00:01:06.890> there<00:01:07.100> there<00:01:07.340> and

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
around in here from like there there and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.010 
around in here from like there there and
there's<00:01:07.909> what<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:08.090> clay<00:01:08.299> ledge<00:01:08.570> is<00:01:08.780> right

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
there's what the clay ledge is right

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.569 
there's what the clay ledge is right
there<00:01:09.229> so<00:01:09.740> we're<00:01:09.829> just<00:01:09.859> working<00:01:10.070> that<00:01:10.369> ledge

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:10.579 
there so we're just working that ledge

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.149 
there so we're just working that ledge
real<00:01:10.850> good<00:01:11.090> same<00:01:11.810> with<00:01:11.960> over<00:01:12.200> here<00:01:12.469> because<00:01:13.039> it

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
real good same with over here because it

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.099 
real good same with over here because it
kind<00:01:13.280> of<00:01:13.369> humps<00:01:13.609> up<00:01:13.789> right<00:01:14.509> here<00:01:14.689> and<00:01:14.840> kind<00:01:15.020> of

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:15.109 
kind of humps up right here and kind of

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:16.599 
kind of humps up right here and kind of
curves<00:01:15.289> back<00:01:15.469> down<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:16.280> so<00:01:16.460> we're<00:01:16.579> just

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:16.609 
curves back down and so we're just

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.039 
curves back down and so we're just
cleaning<00:01:17.030> this<00:01:17.119> all<00:01:17.299> out<00:01:17.479> and<00:01:17.659> pretty<00:01:17.840> much

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
cleaning this all out and pretty much

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.560 
cleaning this all out and pretty much
from<00:01:18.740> what<00:01:18.890> we've<00:01:19.009> done<00:01:19.880> with<00:01:20.060> our<00:01:20.119> test<00:01:20.359> bands

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
from what we've done with our test bands

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.480 
from what we've done with our test bands
from<00:01:20.840> from<00:01:21.500> anywhere<00:01:21.859> you've<00:01:22.039> seen<00:01:22.340> these

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
from from anywhere you've seen these

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.990 
from from anywhere you've seen these
cobbles<00:01:22.939> out<00:01:23.119> here<00:01:23.390> all<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.590> way<00:01:24.740> down<00:01:25.000> the

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
cobbles out here all the way down the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.760 
cobbles out here all the way down the
creek<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.420> all<00:01:26.539> the<00:01:26.630> way<00:01:26.750> if<00:01:27.259> I<00:01:27.380> go<00:01:27.500> around<00:01:27.619> the

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
creek and all the way if I go around the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.060 
creek and all the way if I go around the
corner<00:01:28.100> here<00:01:28.719> you<00:01:29.719> can<00:01:29.899> see<00:01:30.079> it<00:01:30.560> goes<00:01:30.740> -<00:01:30.920> there

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
corner here you can see it goes - there

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.190 
corner here you can see it goes - there
-<00:01:31.159> and<00:01:31.789> this<00:01:31.939> is<00:01:32.060> all<00:01:32.210> just<00:01:32.390> a<00:01:32.479> big<00:01:32.630> flat<00:01:32.899> clay

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
- and this is all just a big flat clay

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.050 
- and this is all just a big flat clay
layer<00:01:33.439> and<00:01:34.159> like<00:01:34.280> right<00:01:34.460> here's<00:01:34.609> a<00:01:34.670> real<00:01:34.880> good

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
layer and like right here's a real good

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.370 
layer and like right here's a real good
it<00:01:35.149> almost<00:01:35.329> looks<00:01:35.570> like<00:01:35.630> bedrock<00:01:36.109> and<00:01:36.259> it's

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
it almost looks like bedrock and it's

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.649 
it almost looks like bedrock and it's
almost<00:01:36.560> as<00:01:36.799> hard<00:01:37.070> as<00:01:37.249> bedrock<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:38.299> so<00:01:38.479> that's

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
almost as hard as bedrock and so that's

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.209 
almost as hard as bedrock and so that's
why<00:01:38.780> we're<00:01:38.960> getting<00:01:39.259> these<00:01:39.409> good<00:01:39.859> play<00:01:40.039> and

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
why we're getting these good play and

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.069 
why we're getting these good play and

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
you can see a lot of stuff like this an

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.510 
you can see a lot of stuff like this an
old<00:01:42.259> rotor<00:01:42.530> turn<00:01:43.460> old<00:01:43.640> drum<00:01:44.270> for<00:01:44.569> a<00:01:44.630> drum<00:01:44.899> break

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
old rotor turn old drum for a drum break

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.919 
old rotor turn old drum for a drum break
anyway<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:46.579> any<00:01:47.060> time<00:01:47.270> you<00:01:47.420> find<00:01:47.569> stuff<00:01:47.869> like

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
anyway so any time you find stuff like

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:49.749 
anyway so any time you find stuff like

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
that you're going to be getting in where

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.260 
that you're going to be getting in where
the<00:01:49.880> color<00:01:50.060> is<00:01:50.149> going<00:01:50.240> to<00:01:50.329> be<00:01:51.100> so<00:01:52.149> Stevens<00:01:53.149> got

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
the color is going to be so Stevens got

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.309 
the color is going to be so Stevens got
a<00:01:53.329> test<00:01:53.749> pan<00:01:53.960> going<00:01:54.229> here<00:01:55.899> we<00:01:56.899> got<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:57.170> gold

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
a test pan going here we got the gold

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:58.450 
a test pan going here we got the gold
out<00:01:57.439> of<00:01:57.499> it<00:01:57.649> but<00:01:57.740> you<00:01:57.889> can<00:01:58.009> see<00:01:58.130> that<00:01:58.280> there's

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
out of it but you can see that there's

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.399 
out of it but you can see that there's
there's<00:01:59.240> all<00:01:59.329> kinds<00:01:59.569> of<00:01:59.600> lead<00:01:59.810> pieces<00:02:00.229> and

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
there's all kinds of lead pieces and

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.819 
there's all kinds of lead pieces and
whatnot<00:02:00.679> in<00:02:00.889> there<00:02:02.499> but<00:02:03.499> yeah<00:02:03.619> there's

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
whatnot in there but yeah there's

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.789 
whatnot in there but yeah there's
there's<00:02:04.729> good<00:02:04.969> enough<00:02:05.210> color<00:02:05.479> to<00:02:06.439> come<00:02:06.619> back

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
there's good enough color to come back

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.190 
there's good enough color to come back
here<00:02:07.039> and<00:02:07.159> sluice<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:08.420> way<00:02:08.539> I<00:02:08.569> figure<00:02:08.989> it<00:02:09.019> is

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
here and sluice the way I figure it is

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.890 
here and sluice the way I figure it is
we<00:02:09.470> find<00:02:09.709> about<00:02:09.830> four<00:02:10.190> or<00:02:10.310> five<00:02:10.569> these<00:02:11.569> in<00:02:11.720> size

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
we find about four or five these in size

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.380 
we find about four or five these in size
little<00:02:12.230> salt<00:02:12.440> pieces<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.190> salt<00:02:13.370> flakes

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
little salt pieces and salt flakes

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.810 
little salt pieces and salt flakes
per<00:02:14.660> pan<00:02:14.960> and<00:02:15.290> then<00:02:15.950> we<00:02:16.070> only<00:02:16.190> move<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.670> know

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
per pan and then we only move you know

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.300 
per pan and then we only move you know
maybe<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.270> eighth<00:02:17.870> of<00:02:18.080> a<00:02:18.200> buckets<00:02:18.860> worth<00:02:19.010> of

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
maybe a eighth of a buckets worth of

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.790 
maybe a eighth of a buckets worth of
material<00:02:19.730> for<00:02:19.880> a<00:02:19.910> pan<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.630> figure<00:02:21.200> we<00:02:21.620> come

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
material for a pan so I figure we come

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.990 
material for a pan so I figure we come
back<00:02:21.890> with<00:02:22.070> a<00:02:22.130> sluice<00:02:22.340> box<00:02:22.550> which<00:02:22.730> should<00:02:22.760> do

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
back with a sluice box which should do

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.220 
back with a sluice box which should do
pretty<00:02:23.120> good

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
pretty good

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.900 
pretty good
