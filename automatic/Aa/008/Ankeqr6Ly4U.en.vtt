so<00:00:12.360> this<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.750> optimus<00:00:13.349> 4x<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:14.099> has<00:00:14.690> 4.7<00:00:15.690> inch

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
so this is optimus 4x it has 4.7 inch

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.679 
so this is optimus 4x it has 4.7 inch

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.290 
per inch resolution very high and it has
a<00:00:24.090> Tegra<00:00:24.600> 3<00:00:24.630> quad-core<00:00:25.619> processor<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.699> here

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
a Tegra 3 quad-core processor and here

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.810 
a Tegra 3 quad-core processor and here
at<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.480> corner<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> small<00:00:29.160> indicator

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
at the corner we have a small indicator

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.540 
at the corner we have a small indicator
that<00:00:29.910> tells<00:00:30.150> whether<00:00:30.960> which<00:00:31.470> how<00:00:32.009> many<00:00:32.219> quad

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
that tells whether which how many quad

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.540 
that tells whether which how many quad
cores<00:00:32.850> are<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:34.200> fact<00:00:34.440> Tegra<00:00:34.890> 3<00:00:35.070> has<00:00:35.520> a

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
cores are on and in fact Tegra 3 has a

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.450 
cores are on and in fact Tegra 3 has a
companion<00:00:36.120> or<00:00:36.510> as<00:00:36.899> another<00:00:37.260> for<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.980> when<00:00:38.309> it's

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
companion or as another for so when it's

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.580 
companion or as another for so when it's
a<00:00:38.550> red<00:00:38.790> bar<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.480> means<00:00:39.660> it's<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.930> companion<00:00:40.350> core

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
a red bar it means it's a companion core

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.229 
a red bar it means it's a companion core
when<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:40.890> green<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.430> means<00:00:41.460> one<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> quad

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
when it's green it means one of the quad

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.880 
when it's green it means one of the quad
core<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.170> can<00:00:43.320> see<00:00:43.469> when<00:00:43.649> I'm<00:00:43.739> not

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
core so you can see when I'm not

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.799 
core so you can see when I'm not
touching<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.430> phone<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:45.120> basically<00:00:45.390> has<00:00:45.750> a

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
touching the phone it basically has a

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.229 
touching the phone it basically has a
very<00:00:46.110> low<00:00:46.350> efficient<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.730> Enda<00:00:47.910> right<00:00:48.090> now

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
very low efficient for Enda right now

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.760 
very low efficient for Enda right now
when<00:00:48.570> I'm<00:00:48.600> not<00:00:48.840> touching<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.440> using<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
when I'm not touching it it's using the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.740 
when I'm not touching it it's using the
companion<00:00:50.280> poor<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> lot<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.629> people

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
companion poor so a lot of people

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.600 
companion poor so a lot of people
question<00:00:52.410> whether<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.829> fifth<00:00:53.070> poor<00:00:53.370> thing

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
question whether that fifth poor thing

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.340 
question whether that fifth poor thing
is<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> marketing<00:00:54.449> hype<00:00:54.719> or<00:00:54.960> whether<00:00:55.170> it's

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
is a marketing hype or whether it's

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.170 
is a marketing hype or whether it's
really<00:00:55.620> efficient<00:00:56.039> I'm<00:00:56.370> telling<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.789> look<00:00:57.059> at

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
really efficient I'm telling you look at

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.700 
really efficient I'm telling you look at
this<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:57.809> I'm<00:00:57.899> not<00:00:57.930> touching<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.410> phone<00:00:58.590> it

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
this but I'm not touching the phone it

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.410 
this but I'm not touching the phone it
spends<00:00:59.010> most<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> time<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.820> canyon<00:01:00.210> or

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
spends most of the time in the canyon or

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.700 
spends most of the time in the canyon or
stage<00:01:00.719> which<00:01:01.219> conserves<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:04.170> moving<00:01:04.530> on

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
stage which conserves on and moving on

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.030 
stage which conserves on and moving on
to<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:04.970> true<00:01:05.970> effectiveness<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.960> wat<00:01:07.229> or<00:01:07.500> when

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
to the true effectiveness of wat or when

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.520 
to the true effectiveness of wat or when
I<00:01:08.070> turn<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.490> camera<00:01:09.200> there's<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.290> lot<00:01:10.500> of

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
I turn on the camera there's a lot of

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.530 
I turn on the camera there's a lot of
things<00:01:10.740> going<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.369> behind<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:12.330> doing

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
things going on in the behind it's doing

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.000 
things going on in the behind it's doing
the<00:01:12.630> autofocus<00:01:13.290> auto<00:01:13.710> white<00:01:13.979> balance

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the autofocus auto white balance

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.760 
the autofocus auto white balance
adjustment<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.479> distributes<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.259> task<00:01:16.590> of

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
adjustment it distributes the task of

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.010 
adjustment it distributes the task of
crossed<00:01:17.100> paths<00:01:17.460> poor<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.630> maintains

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
crossed paths poor so that it maintains

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.080 
crossed paths poor so that it maintains
a<00:01:19.350> relatively<00:01:19.770> low<00:01:19.979> frequency<00:01:20.490> across<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
a relatively low frequency across the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.669 
a relatively low frequency across the
course

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:22.679 
course

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:24.929 
course
actually<00:01:23.679> the<00:01:23.799> camera<00:01:24.340> needs<00:01:24.520> some<00:01:24.700> tuning

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
actually the camera needs some tuning

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.630 
actually the camera needs some tuning
but<00:01:25.240> that's<00:01:25.539> the<00:01:25.719> idea<00:01:26.049> and<00:01:26.259> then<00:01:26.710> it<00:01:27.249> actually

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
but that's the idea and then it actually

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.779 
but that's the idea and then it actually
has<00:01:27.880> a<00:01:27.909> very<00:01:28.149> fast<00:01:28.869> zero<00:01:29.499> shutter<00:01:29.710> lag<00:01:29.950> I<00:01:30.280> mean

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
has a very fast zero shutter lag I mean

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.349 
has a very fast zero shutter lag I mean
I<00:01:31.030> focus<00:01:31.780> and<00:01:32.020> then<00:01:32.469> when<00:01:32.649> I<00:01:33.149> basically<00:01:34.149> done

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
I focus and then when I basically done

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.539 
I focus and then when I basically done
so<00:01:35.020> it<00:01:35.140> has<00:01:35.259> a<00:01:35.289> very<00:01:35.560> very<00:01:35.679> fast<00:01:36.039> as<00:01:36.340> your

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
so it has a very very fast as your

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.809 
so it has a very very fast as your
shadow<00:01:36.789> lack<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.240> then<00:01:37.840> another<00:01:38.819> advantage

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
shadow lack and then another advantage

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.169 
shadow lack and then another advantage
of<00:01:40.030> a<00:01:40.209> quad<00:01:40.420> core<00:01:40.719> is<00:01:40.959> a<00:01:41.380> gaming<00:01:41.829> oh<00:01:42.069> I<00:01:43.030> don't

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
of a quad core is a gaming oh I don't

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:44.490 
of a quad core is a gaming oh I don't
have<00:01:43.390> to<00:01:43.479> get<00:01:43.630> me<00:01:43.719> here<00:01:43.869> I<00:01:43.899> have<00:01:44.109> the<00:01:44.140> gaming

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
have to get me here I have the gaming

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.830 
have to get me here I have the gaming
here<00:01:44.789> so

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
here so

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:54.450 
here so
when<00:01:47.770> I<00:01:48.509> when<00:01:49.509> I<00:01:49.539> open<00:01:49.929> it<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:52.770> go<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:53.829> the<00:01:54.070> gaming

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
when I when I open it I go to the gaming

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.209 
when I when I open it I go to the gaming
and<00:01:54.759> rip<00:01:55.000> tide<00:01:55.210> it<00:01:56.049> has<00:01:56.200> an<00:01:56.380> amazing<00:01:56.890> water

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
and rip tide it has an amazing water

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:00.749 
and rip tide it has an amazing water
flash<00:01:57.549> it<00:01:57.729> so<00:01:58.600> this<00:01:59.439> is<00:01:59.619> a<00:01:59.649> riptide<00:02:00.189> game<00:02:00.429> on<00:02:00.700> a

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
flash it so this is a riptide game on a

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.520 
flash it so this is a riptide game on a
true<00:02:01.719> HD<00:02:01.929> IPS<00:02:02.140> display<00:02:02.560> oh<00:02:03.899> yeah<00:02:04.899> running<00:02:05.350> out

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
true HD IPS display oh yeah running out

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.619 
true HD IPS display oh yeah running out
of<00:02:05.560> battery<00:02:05.920> but<00:02:06.100> it<00:02:06.219> should<00:02:06.369> be<00:02:06.399> fine

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.150 

and<00:02:11.629> then<00:02:11.810> it<00:02:12.170> gets<00:02:12.290> better<00:02:12.530> look<00:02:12.920> at<00:02:13.040> this

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
and then it gets better look at this

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.670 
and then it gets better look at this

we prepare the backup battery for all of
them<00:03:28.890> we<00:03:29.070> never<00:03:29.280> use<00:03:29.490> a<00:03:29.520> single<00:03:29.850> of<00:03:30.030> them

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
them we never use a single of them

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.140 
them we never use a single of them
yesterday<00:03:31.160> we<00:03:32.160> are<00:03:32.220> very<00:03:32.280> have<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.760> very<00:03:33.000> high

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
yesterday we are very have a very high

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.870 
yesterday we are very have a very high
confidence<00:03:33.390> on<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.810> battery<00:03:34.110> life<00:03:37.880> within

couple<00:03:39.180> of<00:03:39.330> months<00:03:39.710> so<00:03:41.060> well<00:03:42.060> i<00:03:42.090> would<00:03:42.540> say

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
couple of months so well i would say

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.710 
couple of months so well i would say
early<00:03:43.440> third<00:03:43.860> quarter<00:03:44.130> should<00:03:45.000> be<00:03:45.090> safe<00:03:47.720> i'm

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
early third quarter should be safe i'm

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.030 
early third quarter should be safe i'm
from<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.080> engineering<00:03:49.440> side<00:03:49.650> i<00:03:49.710> don't<00:03:49.980> know

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
from the engineering side i don't know

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.140 
from the engineering side i don't know
about<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.310> price
