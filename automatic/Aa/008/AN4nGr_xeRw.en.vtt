00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.769
 Immediate putting of a candy with two 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.780
 little pieces of cinnamon and water and we're going to 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.750
 leave until the candy melts and 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.180
 this is going to have a honey consistency 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.430
 this is the yolk cake you can 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.140
 get a bakery in some 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.329
 vacation comes alone with the candy and 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.399
 without sugar but this time I 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.829
 I have sugar we are going to cut 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.259
 slices 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.619
 and make the ears after having 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.119
 match the bread let's beat the egg whites 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.090
 once we have in this way the 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.090
 we are going to add the yolks 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.729
 let's go heating the pan with the 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.649
 oil in what we finished beating the 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.689
 egg I'm going to add bread flour 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.509
 It can be any kind of flour 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.409
 This serves to pan the egg 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.920
 stick on the bread 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.920
 ah 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.829
 let's go through milk this is a 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.840
 way of doing the turrets can 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.609
 make them cilic and only wrapped in 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.060
 egg then we will go through the 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:47.060
 egg 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.289
 as if checking our candy if you 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.390
 you want a more express honey you can 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.579
 add the other half of the sweet afternoon 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.319
 we are going to go around trying to 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:10.680
 brown it from all sides the egg will brown 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.680
 this is so that the very rich 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.680
 very many 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:22.440
 if you do not have cake the yolk you can 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.040
 do share camera there's no excuse 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:31.080
 that you can not eat in this holy week 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.599
 let's soak milk bread and 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.470
 quickie egg because if it's not going to 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:40.890
 undo and the oil are going to go 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:45.019
 putting on a paper towel so that 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.019
 go absorb the oil 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.360
 we've finished making the torrijas 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.550
 let's make the last step that is 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.440
 add the honey and let the bread 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.990
 absorb the honey 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.640
 simply and simply when you go to 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.560
 serve it orders you then you add the 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.760
 honey let's do the first step that goes 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.990
 to be already with honey done add the 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.990
 honey to the torrejas 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.400
 and we're going to let the bread absorb 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:22.310
 that delicious honey placed glasses bread 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.730

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.800
 torrents then we will add what 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.930
 that in the diet so that we do not leave 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.240
 to undo the bread 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:37.530
 until this 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.540
