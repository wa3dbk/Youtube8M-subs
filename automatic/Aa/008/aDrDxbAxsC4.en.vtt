00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
else to really talk about I mean there

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.610 
else to really talk about I mean there
is<00:02:47.620> not<00:02:47.860> just<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.250> talk<00:02:48.459> about<00:02:48.489> right<00:02:48.940> now

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
is not just to talk about right now

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.240 
is not just to talk about right now
other<00:02:50.620> than<00:02:50.769> you<00:02:51.220> know<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:52.440> I'm<00:02:53.440> still<00:02:53.950> working

on<00:02:54.340> these<00:02:54.489> brawl<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:54.910> gloves<00:02:55.269> I've<00:02:55.540> still

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
on these brawl and gloves I've still

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.110 
on these brawl and gloves I've still
have<00:02:56.290> only<00:02:57.069> like<00:02:57.430> 15<00:02:57.850> bank<00:02:58.120> spaces<00:02:59.250> and<00:03:00.250> which

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
have only like 15 bank spaces and which

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.470 
have only like 15 bank spaces and which
is<00:03:01.239> surprising<00:03:01.750> because<00:03:01.780> i<00:03:02.200> think<00:03:02.260> i<00:03:02.650> am<00:03:02.950> up<00:03:03.220> to

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
is surprising because i think i am up to

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.770 
is surprising because i think i am up to
a<00:03:04.480> ten<00:03:05.230> brawl<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:05.620> gloves<00:03:05.769> used<00:03:06.400> well<00:03:06.940> I<00:03:07.150> guess

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
a ten brawl and gloves used well I guess

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.630 
a ten brawl and gloves used well I guess
that's<00:03:07.989> not<00:03:08.110> really<00:03:08.170> surprising<00:03:08.799> but<00:03:09.190> still

yeah higher quality videos for the win I

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.230 
yeah higher quality videos for the win I
don't<00:04:53.440> think<00:04:53.500> YouTube<00:04:54.280> goes<00:04:54.490> above<00:04:54.729> 30<00:04:54.970> frames

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
don't think YouTube goes above 30 frames

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.659 
don't think YouTube goes above 30 frames
per<00:04:55.300> second<00:04:55.720> though<00:04:55.840> so<00:04:56.229> I<00:04:56.560> think<00:04:57.370> it's

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
per second though so I think it's

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.170 
per second though so I think it's
