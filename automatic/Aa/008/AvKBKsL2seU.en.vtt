00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.909 
victory okay didn't expect that actually
I<00:03:00.139> thought<00:03:01.139> that<00:03:01.200> she<00:03:01.500> was<00:03:01.590> going<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:01.799> survive

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
I thought that she was going to survive

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.470 
I thought that she was going to survive
with<00:03:02.430> just<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.730> little<00:03:02.909> bit<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.060> health<00:03:03.180> left

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
with just a little bit of health left

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.909 
with just a little bit of health left
and<00:03:03.689> then<00:03:03.840> if<00:03:04.169> I<00:03:04.260> was<00:03:04.379> gonna<00:03:04.469> keep<00:03:04.620> going<00:03:04.829> on

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:04.919 
and then if I was gonna keep going on

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:06.319 
and then if I was gonna keep going on
where<00:03:05.549> ultimately<00:03:05.669> I<00:03:05.909> was<00:03:06.000> gonna<00:03:06.090> come<00:03:06.269> back

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
where ultimately I was gonna come back

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:07.550 
where ultimately I was gonna come back
and<00:03:06.480> win<00:03:06.599> because<00:03:06.719> golden<00:03:07.319> Frieza<00:03:07.409> is

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
and win because golden Frieza is

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.530 
and win because golden Frieza is

powerful just say that ah but that was a

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.789 
powerful just say that ah but that was a
good<00:03:09.659> match<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:10.109> was<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.230> really<00:03:10.650> good

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799

fighting<00:03:18.989> bona<00:03:19.139> fide<00:03:19.290> again<00:03:19.560> so<00:03:20.099> let's<00:03:20.400> see<00:03:20.489> if

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
fighting bona fide again so let's see if

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.369 
fighting bona fide again so let's see if
it<00:03:20.909> can<00:03:21.030> follow<00:03:21.359> up<00:03:21.510> in<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.690> second<00:03:21.989> round<00:03:22.079> and

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
it can follow up in the second round and

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:23.930 
it can follow up in the second round and
see<00:03:22.919> if<00:03:23.069> we<00:03:23.129> can<00:03:23.250> do<00:03:23.340> something<00:03:23.609> against<00:03:23.849> my

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
see if we can do something against my

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.280 
see if we can do something against my
golden<00:03:24.150> Frieza<00:03:24.329> you<00:03:24.840> look<00:03:24.959> like<00:03:25.079> you<00:03:25.139> switch

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
golden Frieza you look like you switch

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.750 
golden Frieza you look like you switch
up<00:03:25.440> his<00:03:25.560> variation<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:26.129> he's<00:03:26.250> coming<00:03:26.459> fight

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
up his variation so he's coming fight

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.430 
up his variation so he's coming fight
differently<00:03:27.180> hopefully<00:03:27.569> but<00:03:28.079> after<00:03:28.319> this

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
differently hopefully but after this

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.719 
differently hopefully but after this
we'll<00:03:28.560> do<00:03:28.620> another<00:03:28.739> round<00:03:28.919> and<00:03:29.189> then<00:03:29.310> next<00:03:29.549> one

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:29.729 
we'll do another round and then next one

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:30.979 
we'll do another round and then next one
after<00:03:30.000> this<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.239> going<00:03:30.389> to<00:03:30.449> be<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.569> final<00:03:30.930> one

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
after this is going to be the final one

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.679 
after this is going to be the final one
so<00:03:31.139> let's<00:03:31.290> see<00:03:31.500> if<00:03:31.819> he<00:03:32.819> can<00:03:32.970> get<00:03:33.150> us<00:03:33.269> victory

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:33.689 
so let's see if he can get us victory

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:38.210 
so let's see if he can get us victory
after<00:03:34.169> that<00:03:34.500> last<00:03:34.769> destruction<00:03:36.199> take<00:03:37.199> da<00:03:37.680> da
