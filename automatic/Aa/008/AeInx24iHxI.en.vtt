corner that corner in that corner but

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.440 
corner that corner in that corner but
then<00:02:12.960> we<00:02:13.050> also<00:02:13.230> figured<00:02:13.560> this<00:02:13.860> out<00:02:14.390> by<00:02:15.390> the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
then we also figured this out by the

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.800 
then we also figured this out by the
little<00:02:15.840> wall<00:02:16.080> over<00:02:16.440> here<00:02:19.880> if<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:21.240> stand<00:02:21.570> on

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
little wall over here if you stand on

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.560 
little wall over here if you stand on
these<00:02:22.190> then<00:02:23.190> like<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.459> little<00:02:23.790> shape<00:02:24.060> appears

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
these then like a little shape appears

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.890 
these then like a little shape appears
there<00:02:25.080> are<00:02:25.110> three<00:02:25.620> dots<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.370> one<00:02:26.640> on<00:02:27.060> this

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
there are three dots on that one on this

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.250 
there are three dots on that one on this
one<00:02:28.230> there<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.590> three<00:02:29.310> dots<00:02:30.320> on<00:02:31.320> this<00:02:32.040> one<00:02:33.260> yeah

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
one there is three dots on this one yeah

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.170 
one there is three dots on this one yeah
they<00:02:34.470> kind<00:02:34.709> of<00:02:34.800> change<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.550> like<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:35.970> up

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
they kind of change and like this up

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.310 
they kind of change and like this up
here<00:02:36.209> some<00:02:37.020> I<00:02:37.320> know<00:02:37.740> it's<00:02:38.130> confusing<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:39.320> that

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
here some I know it's confusing on that

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.890 
here some I know it's confusing on that
one<00:02:40.500> it's<00:02:40.850> yeah<00:02:41.850> they're<00:02:42.060> changing<00:02:42.600> right<00:02:42.810> now

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.230 

so<00:02:45.900> there<00:02:46.200> are<00:02:46.290> three<00:02:46.620> over<00:02:46.920> there<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.610> then

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
so there are three over there and then

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.170 
so there are three over there and then
there's<00:02:48.480> one<00:02:48.690> right<00:02:48.900> here<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.709> then<00:02:50.640> one

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
there's one right here and then one

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.199 
there's one right here and then one
right<00:02:51.390> here<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:52.580> so<00:02:53.580> we<00:02:53.730> can't<00:02:53.940> really<00:02:54.000> figure

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
right here and so we can't really figure

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.080 
right here and so we can't really figure
it<00:02:54.510> out<00:02:54.750> figure<00:02:55.440> out<00:02:55.739> what<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.130> do<00:02:56.280> I'm<00:02:56.760> pretty

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
it out figure out what to do I'm pretty

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
it out figure out what to do I'm pretty
sure<00:02:57.300> when<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.630> move<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.959> little<00:02:59.959> there's<00:03:00.959> a

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
sure when you move the little there's a

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.880 
sure when you move the little there's a
little<00:03:01.700> thing<00:03:02.700> over<00:03:02.850> here<00:03:06.410> when<00:03:07.410> you<00:03:07.500> move<00:03:07.680> one

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
little thing over here when you move one

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.590
