ship q4 well so now to q4 in for over
six<00:00:43.600> months<00:00:43.660> prior<00:00:44.230> to<00:00:44.290> that<00:00:44.440> I<00:00:44.589> had<00:00:44.769> a<00:00:44.800> Q<00:00:45.040> plus

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
six months prior to that I had a Q plus

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.189 
six months prior to that I had a Q plus
now<00:00:46.000> the<00:00:46.059> reason<00:00:46.390> why<00:00:46.449> I've<00:00:46.510> changed<00:00:46.870> for<00:00:46.930> q4

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
now the reason why I've changed for q4

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:48.959 
now the reason why I've changed for q4
is<00:00:47.650> because<00:00:48.070> it<00:00:48.280> is<00:00:48.400> so<00:00:48.610> much<00:00:48.760> more

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
is because it is so much more

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.029 
is because it is so much more
sophisticated<00:00:49.750> or<00:00:50.020> level<00:00:50.440> of<00:00:50.530> technical

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
terms and explanation to Travis now I'll

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.330
