00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Hello my dear, today 's that 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.450
 Therapy and papering means 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.589
 nothing else than something art full 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.589
 to lay unfold 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.269
 I'll show you how to do this today 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.510
 Drapes and benefits are needed 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.070
 Only fabric and a pair of scissors and I show 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.760
 as always, like the whole 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.740
 is working 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.230
 to explain you how the whole thing is easy 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.109
 is imitate I'm considering 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.189
 I'll show you on how to schmidt 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.739
 traced on the fabric and then only 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.290
 still from cuts was noticed that 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.210
 in that I use this woven fabric 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.550
 Unfortunately you can have taken that in the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.620
 Camera does not look so good then what 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.629
 I have this falls laughs differently 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.070
 I think that's the easiest way to you 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.969
 to understand and easiest 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.520
 imitate 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.460
 First of all, you take the stop 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.730
 and put him in the break we see 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.340
 Brings the edge is exactly the edge 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.710
 middle of the fabric where they are then 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.539
 then lived on each other when you did that 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.430
 later you also have the two works 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.560
 mirrored that means we do 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.890
 now only half of the time yes in the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.799
 space in the end at the side then take 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.420
 you a ruler a tape measure 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.400
 geodesic triangle whatever your hand 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.970
 got from match from above 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.770
 1 meter 70 on the break down I have 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.869
 the line action 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.969
 the vulnerable side to show that you 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.460
 could just see it but directly 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:33.829
 The wedding line would be easy 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.490
 to present a book then you have to exactly 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:39.140
 on the half mark 215 above and 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.640
 for max centimeters suspect 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.149
 logically and then you go 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:48.500
 later a little help needed the 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:52.459
 house then you go from the top of the 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.880
 top point 1 30 centimeters in the 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:58.700
 right angle and draw yourself afterwards 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.700
 there is in this from the endpoint 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.579
 right angle 15 centimeters down 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.259
 from the 15 centimeters down even 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.479
 for those fifteen centimeters 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.399
 extended and 20 cm 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.709
 but that's just a little less than helpful 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.299
 pulls not a whole line but I have 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.730
 a dashed line or a 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:19.670
 note from this to the teenie 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:24.019
 goes out 30 centimeters in the right angle 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.569
 outwardly and turns at this point 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:31.459
 at the end of the 30 centimeters one 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:33.829
 nice curves to others then extended 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.220
 yours will hinder your 30 centimeters 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:39.680
 long and five inches inside 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.609
 so that this cut is slightly smaller 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.519
 when I'm up at the 35 centimeters 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:49.609
 you can now from the endpoint in the 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.680
 right angle go down to the very bottom 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.599
 down I probably the single itself 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.970
 are finished and could be the two 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.680
 lines then connect and then 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.060
 It's actually still to salt made 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.180
 already made 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.810
 could a beautiful than now 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.599
 cutout so no 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.580
 circle and then you can do it all 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.290
 cut it out and so it should be in 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.020
 look like a final effect and if you like that 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.420
 whole out of what then I'll show you 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.720
 now how you put it on and that 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.700
 could head through the circle of 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.319
 then picks up the strings from behind 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.380
 forward the can you so nice to 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.819
 tie and straighten the whole thing 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.250
 top part a bit 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.080
 If you feel like it, the edges can of course 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.390
 to process that well, that is, once 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.970
 Bypass anyone who does not want to be able to do it all 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.819
 so that's only totally internal internally 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.200
 in 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.420
 so my dear that was it already 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.470
 have you done again went really 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.660
 that's super easy for any of you 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.340
 imitate and if you are all night 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.970
 did you do then forget but next 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.440
 hashtag without china and continue 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.360
 you write the comments but is that 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.910
 whole and he started more 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.739
 want to see what happens to it so 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.000
 you finally tailor potsdam 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.010
 can attract 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.599
 and if you all in general 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.530
 I liked it then let me have one 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.019
 Thumbs up 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.519
 I'm not happy about that 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:15.680
 The last videos are as usual 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:18.789
 under me for 1 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.789
 drag at night
