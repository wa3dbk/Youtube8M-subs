00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
coaster or this coaster which one see

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.580 
coaster or this coaster which one see
because<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.390> get<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.750> not<00:00:52.199> only<00:00:52.320> can<00:00:52.559> you

drink coasters the way that the plastic
is<00:02:51.360> set<00:02:51.630> up<00:02:51.780> is<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.350> you<00:02:53.010> know<00:02:53.100> pushes<00:02:53.760> that

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
is set up is it you know pushes that

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.840 
is set up is it you know pushes that
light<00:02:54.209> out<00:02:54.239> so<00:02:55.049> on<00:02:55.410> its<00:02:55.590> own<00:02:55.830> that<00:02:56.310> circuitry

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
light out so on its own that circuitry

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.360 
light out so on its own that circuitry
with<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.959> LEDs<00:02:58.349> attached<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.010> doesn't

really the light just you look I don't

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.809 
really the light just you look I don't
know<00:03:07.470> are<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.830> seeing<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.160> reflecting<00:03:08.549> off<00:03:08.670> my

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
know are you seeing it reflecting off my

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.449
