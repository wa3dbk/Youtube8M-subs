00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.599
 she an agent on youtube as they are 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.070
 I hope they are very good on the day of 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.099
 today starts touch this rule that 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.480
 exempt moon that is very good but good 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.950
 before you start, you know it's Friday 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.990
 question and today is very 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.669
 interesting the question today is if 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.090
 could an artist live here in 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.010
 Seville 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.080
 in my case I think it would be John Lennon 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.240
 I love videos I always liked 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.740
 a lot of work that john did after 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.390
 I finished the comments to that 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.610
 astun review artists is worth then 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.350
 Well let's move on 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.310
 ok this song is very very simple 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.770
 let's start in a chord of fame 7 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.230
 what would be this is very simple 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.020
 I say the fingers quickly finger 3 goes 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.000
 to go in dock s after three of the fifth the 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.640
 little finger was small remaining in 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.220
 three of the string that is a fa and then 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.310
 this middle finger fret bailÃ©n two 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:00.820
 of the third that is the idea one is going to go 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.550
 in two fret one of the second and the 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.980
 first string is going to sound to the air that is 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.470
 a me that is the seventh major of the chord 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.690
 that there is a detail here the sixth string 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.760
 will not do anything during all the 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.619
 song then the sixth string you have to 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.090
 issue the voucher is our first chord 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.460
 after the second is very simple is 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.500
 a greater sun we only go to 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.380
 run it 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.330
 the frets forward 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.780
 Bah 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.870
 and the third agreed is a minor that's 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.050
 very popular is very simple and then 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.820
 let's go back to the sun because 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.310
 everything already know the figures of the chord 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.550
 are here in the video on the corner of 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.890
 here in case you have a break and see well 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.600
 where the fingers go then it is worth 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.210
 those chords goes our verse I'm going to 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.960
 touch and right now he explained the strum voucher 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.960
 it would be this way 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.300
 80 it is very simple project 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.130
 the song goes to this form then the 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.700
 strumming is also very easy 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.060
 to make one down 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.720
 then down up and down again 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.640
 up that would be like 1 down and 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.319
 two combinations down top 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.210
 and here are the arrows also in case 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.370
 they have doubts then I'm going to touch 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.760
 slow one more time to check well 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:44.560
 the strum down down down up 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.560
 above is repeated 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.330
 It is comfortable 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.980
 i 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.040
 practice the slow and they will see that very 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.200
 soon they will leave pretty cool 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.090
 then we go to the next part that 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.090
 it's even simpler we're just going 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.610
 to use for as we had already seen it and 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.700
 the sun ok I'm going to touch it so that what 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.410
 Check me up a little bit behind this one 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.410
 in the verse and then enters the chorus 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.160
 and the girls stay 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.480
 Fat 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.909
 we go 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.790
 only those two different angles 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.549
 we return to the verse 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:15.319
 ok then it is very easy false verse 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.449
 the smallest sun and chorus fa sun only 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.880
 ok the rastillo is the same during 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.290
 the whole song then then the points 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.810
 to take into account this song is going to 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.330
 help a lot and they are starting 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.430
 to exercise a change of chords your 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.889
 rhythm and above all it is a strum on the 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.840
 right hand then it would be 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.520
