00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
screen now this power grid is really

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.920 
screen now this power grid is really
kind<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.279> your<00:00:32.520> brain<00:00:34.070> it<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.750> broken<00:00:36.750> down

kind of your brain it is broken down

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.500 
kind of your brain it is broken down
into<00:00:37.290> different<00:00:37.410> pie<00:00:37.920> charts<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.610> areas<00:00:39.480> of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
into different pie charts of areas of

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.119 
into different pie charts of areas of
life<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.140> are<00:00:40.170> important<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> keep<00:00:40.920> in

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
life that are important to keep in

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.150 
life that are important to keep in
balance<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:42.239> as<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:42.570> see<00:00:42.680> it's<00:00:43.680> keeping

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
balance so as you can see it's keeping

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.630 
balance so as you can see it's keeping
track<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.760> your<00:00:45.570> percentage<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.489> tasks<00:00:47.489> you

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
track of your percentage of tasks you

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.790 
track of your percentage of tasks you
have<00:00:47.879> against<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> percentage<00:00:49.530> of

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
have against the percentage of

have against the percentage of
completions<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.780> basically<00:00:52.850> it's

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
completions you have so basically it's

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
is an optional feature I set up that I

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.220 
is an optional feature I set up that I
have<00:03:00.380> medication<00:03:01.040> as<00:03:01.250> a<00:03:01.280> tool<00:03:01.580> that<00:03:01.849> I'm<00:03:01.970> using

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
have medication as a tool that I'm using

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.080 
have medication as a tool that I'm using
and<00:03:03.230> so<00:03:03.500> I'm<00:03:03.709> gonna<00:03:03.920> track<00:03:04.430> also<00:03:04.940> the

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
and so I'm gonna track also the

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.240 
and so I'm gonna track also the
prescriptions<00:03:05.780> so<00:03:06.440> this<00:03:06.590> is<00:03:06.739> important

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
prescriptions so this is important

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.339 
prescriptions so this is important
because<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.790> lot<00:03:08.090> of<00:03:08.360> times<00:03:08.569> from<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.900> inside

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
because a lot of times from the inside

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.470 
because a lot of times from the inside
you<00:03:09.980> can't<00:03:10.190> always<00:03:10.370> tell<00:03:10.640> exactly<00:03:11.239> what

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
you can't always tell exactly what

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.800 
you can't always tell exactly what
impact<00:03:11.690> a<00:03:12.200> medication<00:03:12.650> may<00:03:12.950> be<00:03:12.980> having<00:03:13.810> so

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
impact a medication may be having so

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.110 
impact a medication may be having so
it's<00:03:14.989> good<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.230> have<00:03:15.560> visual<00:03:16.010> feedback<00:03:16.489> and

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
it's good to have visual feedback and

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.720 
it's good to have visual feedback and
see<00:03:17.930> those<00:03:18.290> trends<00:03:18.829> and<00:03:18.950> tracking<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.640> you

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
see those trends and tracking and you

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.380 
see those trends and tracking and you
can<00:03:20.600> evaluate<00:03:21.530> if<00:03:22.130> you're<00:03:22.370> on<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.640> formula<00:03:23.150> if

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
can evaluate if you're on the formula if

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.870 
can evaluate if you're on the formula if
you're<00:03:23.570> on<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.780> dosage<00:03:24.200> that<00:03:24.459> was<00:03:25.459> working

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
you're on the dosage that was working

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.670 
you're on the dosage that was working
for<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:26.209> so<00:03:26.750> if<00:03:26.840> your<00:03:26.989> prescription<00:03:27.530> has

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
for you so if your prescription has

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
changed we just want to track that so we

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.199 
changed we just want to track that so we
can<00:03:30.230> see<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:32.170> differences<00:03:33.170> in<00:03:33.530> our<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:35.060> other
