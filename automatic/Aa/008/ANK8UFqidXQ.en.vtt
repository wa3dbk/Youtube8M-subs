 baking salt or after baking salt and I choose 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.180

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.100
 the baking process 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.100
 so we're going to do that now 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.729
 start with pepper from the mill and then 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.060
 I have nice sea salt 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:13.830

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:18.420

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.610
 fry steak 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.709
 well that's best if you pan 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.690
 preheated so a few 

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:28.080
 minutes or wash the pan and without butter 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:32.009
 and put oil on the fire and then continue 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.140
 the oil in it afterwards 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:39.560
 piece of butter of course real 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.560
 butter and you make it so hot 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.939
 First claim we arrived it 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.590
 meat as good as the premises 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.140
 momentarily 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.330
 of turning the temperature well 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:01.170
 butter and oil are the same everywhere 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.170
 is picking up the meat very carefully 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.610
 we put it in the butter with the oil and 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.170
 the tug the meat 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.170
 over the hot bottom of the pan 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:21.480
 then turn in the meat and do it 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.150
 We do the same with the other side as it 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.520
 meat and two sides is fried then 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.250
 get it out of the pan and then we lay 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.980
 put it on a baking dish 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:37.140
 and we'll have the steak for a while 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.770
 let it rest while the meat is too 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.480
 rest 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.520
 make a potato garnish this is 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.050
 a roseval potato that we go 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.239
 cook briefly 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.910
 water is on and that takes about 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.380
 minute or three is the hair you put in the 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.110
 pan light 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.140
 then we drain it and then it goes 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.650
 just bake in the romo to say after 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.650
 I put them in the pan 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.920
 meat has now rested for 10 minutes 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.690
 we're going to get the temperature meter 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.500
 stick the meat to the right one later 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.300
 to determine if the temperature is in eye 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.540
 order the temperature in at 50 degrees 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.340
 off the thermometer and then goes later 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.230
 the meat in the furnace and the running of the 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.540
 temperature at and if that at 50 degrees 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.120
 is there take the meat star out of the oven 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.010

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.080
 the meat is now ready to be put in the oven 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.080
 to go 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.390
 I just set up a fixed pan for the 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.550

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.620
