 [Applause] 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:15.160
 [Music] 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.340
 [Applause] 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.429

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.429
 [Music] 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.640
 let's meet today for the 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.430
 test the day before or fiji or ultra three 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.870
 axes mouth space and cameramen 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.600
 not easy to pronounce but that's when 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.850
 even great product so here it comes 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.670
 of the biggar site o on which to freeze a 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.010
 again orders and so that's 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.750
 a very practical three axis very easy 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.510
 a very very well finished product two 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.020
 qualities really for a price of 200 to 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.240
 look for a sports studio go to 269 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.950
 euros without course fees so I 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.259
 think that at that price it's really a 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.530
 very very good deal more than 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:26.200
 really compatible 03 and 03 more 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.450
 the fastening system is really very 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.899
 very well done the stabilization is 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.899
 perfect 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.220
 what to say more if not a very 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.729
 very good product so it is 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:43.369
 delivered with 4 batteries a small accessory 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:46.320
 to recharge on the 200 m there is also 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.350
 a small usb socket that allows the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.549
 recharge via the micro port via the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.369
 USB ports of your pc 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.750
 it's really a pure product the batteries 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.399
 they can be found in commerce or 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.720
 even on the mandatory site seeking 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.890
 well 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.460
 if you need you can find 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.020
 others stack for this model 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.659
 so it's really an extras product 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.729
 as I added here two small 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.479
 ivy that have been very helpful to me when 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.150
 I started 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.410
 it's precisely the introduction that was 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.980
 made by a teak controller not easy 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.340
 to fill 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.170
 we will pronounce also and always by the 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.430
 same site the operations notes so 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.500
 do not hesitate it's when you 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.650
 get on foot familiarize yourself with 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.850
 these different systems because you 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.440
 will really need it when you 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.060
 will start using it for not 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.510
 you lose and understand how 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.489
 it 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.840
 how does it work it really is 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.440
 tip top this camera 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.250
 go to the clan ben ali 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.470
 would immediately present a 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.500
 new product that I bought and which 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.280
 is called in my eyes as a little bit 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.050
 special and ten pisteurs pronounce 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.350
 but in fact it's a steadycam three 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.180
 simple axes so I make my move we go 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.970
 leave him a few seconds to 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.080
 to initialize and finally whatever she 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.060
 increases its stabilization 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.110
 so this is a product that I have since 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.850
 about two weeks 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.530
 and frankly it's pale east is 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.530
 exceptional this is the steadicam 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.720
 she is really bad but not in everything 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.780
 we manage to make videos of qufu 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.030
 so I had a little fun at 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.890
 start the habit was there to make 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.019
 effects you will find on the internet the 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.480
 different ways to configure it I 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.670
 you put links here have a simple 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.780
 knife with a few pressures that 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.270
 are amply sufficient 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.539
 there are three possible configurations 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.539
 [Music] 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:30.159
 it's really the top and even having a 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:37.900
 much more practical advice and by the 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:42.550
 following if I unscrew his hop there I can I 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:45.819
 fixed it a little bit better when their 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:50.350
 squeezing just let go really the 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:53.549
 perch of the really ultimate piece 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.549
