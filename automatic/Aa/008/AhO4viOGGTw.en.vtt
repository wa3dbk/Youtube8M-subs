when we play the flute we have to direct

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.290 
when we play the flute we have to direct
our<00:03:00.380> airstream<00:03:00.860> to<00:03:01.100> go<00:03:01.220> across<00:03:01.700> this<00:03:02.030> hole

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
our airstream to go across this hole

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.930 
our airstream to go across this hole
when<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.230> airstream<00:03:03.800> hits<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.280> outer<00:03:04.490> edge

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940

of the embouchure hole it splits in half

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.540 
of the embouchure hole it splits in half
and<00:03:07.790> that<00:03:08.060> vibration<00:03:08.440> causes<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.560> sound<00:03:09.830> so

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
and that vibration causes the sound so

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.280

are a few tips to help you improve first
make<00:04:19.390> sure<00:04:19.570> that<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.840> embouchure<00:04:20.170> hole<00:04:20.320> is

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
make sure that the embouchure hole is

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.830 
make sure that the embouchure hole is
directly<00:04:21.130> in<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.400> center<00:04:21.880> of<00:04:21.910> your<00:04:22.180> lips<00:04:22.420> I'll

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
directly in the center of your lips I'll

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.270 
directly in the center of your lips I'll
show<00:04:23.050> you<00:04:23.110> what<00:04:23.290> it<00:04:23.380> sounds<00:04:23.560> like<00:04:23.770> when<00:04:24.160> the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
show you what it sounds like when the

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:35.850 
show you what it sounds like when the
embouchure<00:04:24.610> hole<00:04:24.760> is<00:04:25.060> not<00:04:25.300> lined<00:04:25.660> up<00:04:34.860> the

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
embouchure hole is not lined up the

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.470 
embouchure hole is not lined up the
second<00:04:36.190> thing<00:04:36.310> to<00:04:36.400> check<00:04:36.580> is<00:04:36.820> make<00:04:37.090> sure<00:04:37.120> your

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
second thing to check is make sure your

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.120 
second thing to check is make sure your
air<00:04:37.690> stream<00:04:38.020> is<00:04:38.050> going<00:04:38.440> in<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:38.680> slightly

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
air stream is going in a slightly

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.580 
air stream is going in a slightly
downward<00:04:39.700> direction<00:04:40.330> so<00:04:40.480> it's<00:04:40.990> going<00:04:41.170> across

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
downward direction so it's going across

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.860 
downward direction so it's going across
the<00:04:42.010> edge<00:04:42.190> of<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.790> outer<00:04:42.940> part<00:04:43.450> of<00:04:43.630> the

the edge of the outer part of the

the edge of the outer part of the
embouchure<00:04:44.140> hole<00:04:44.290> if<00:04:44.620> your<00:04:44.980> air<00:04:45.160> stream<00:04:45.490> is

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
embouchure hole if your air stream is

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.820 
embouchure hole if your air stream is
pointed<00:04:46.000> too<00:04:46.180> high<00:04:46.390> you<00:04:46.450> won't<00:04:46.870> get<00:04:46.990> a<00:04:47.020> sound

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.990 

experiment<00:04:50.830> with<00:04:51.130> moving<00:04:51.430> your<00:04:51.550> air<00:04:51.700> stream

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
experiment with moving your air stream

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.730 
experiment with moving your air stream
up<00:04:52.180> and<00:04:52.360> down<00:04:52.600> like<00:04:52.930> we<00:04:53.050> practiced<00:04:53.260> on<00:04:53.590> our

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
up and down like we practiced on our

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.860 
up and down like we practiced on our
hand<00:04:56.700> another<00:04:57.700> reason<00:04:58.150> some<00:04:58.390> students<00:04:58.750> have

hand another reason some students have

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.600 
hand another reason some students have
trouble<00:04:59.230> making<00:04:59.380> a<00:04:59.590> sound<00:04:59.830> is<00:05:00.010> if<00:05:00.280> the<00:05:00.400> lips

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
trouble making a sound is if the lips

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:07.440 
trouble making a sound is if the lips
are<00:05:00.910> too<00:05:01.330> tight<00:05:01.600> and<00:05:01.810> tense<00:05:02.080> like<00:05:02.320> this<00:05:06.450> keep

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
are too tight and tense like this keep

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.180 
are too tight and tense like this keep
the<00:05:07.600> middle<00:05:07.900> of<00:05:07.990> your<00:05:08.140> lips<00:05:08.260> relaxed<00:05:09.010> and

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
the middle of your lips relaxed and

the middle of your lips relaxed and
smooth<00:05:12.570> another<00:05:13.570> thing<00:05:13.780> to<00:05:13.870> check<00:05:13.900> is<00:05:14.200> that

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
smooth another thing to check is that

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.750 
smooth another thing to check is that
your<00:05:14.710> lips<00:05:14.890> aren't<00:05:15.130> open<00:05:15.550> too<00:05:15.730> wide<00:05:15.760> like<00:05:16.240> this

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
your lips aren't open too wide like this

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.860 
your lips aren't open too wide like this
you<00:05:18.760> don't<00:05:18.940> want<00:05:19.090> to<00:05:19.150> imagine<00:05:19.390> that<00:05:19.600> you're

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
you don't want to imagine that you're

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.210 
you don't want to imagine that you're
making<00:05:20.170> a<00:05:20.260> hole<00:05:20.500> with<00:05:20.740> your<00:05:20.860> lips<00:05:21.070> because

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
making a hole with your lips because

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.130 
making a hole with your lips because
you'll<00:05:21.460> probably<00:05:21.700> let<00:05:22.180> out<00:05:22.330> too<00:05:22.630> much<00:05:22.810> air

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
you'll probably let out too much air

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.100 
you'll probably let out too much air
keep<00:05:23.800> your<00:05:23.980> lips<00:05:24.130> closed<00:05:24.610> and<00:05:25.020> imagine<00:05:26.020> the

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
keep your lips closed and imagine the

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.780

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
air pushing out with the sound of the

letter P here's the wrong way and the
right<00:05:32.020> way<00:05:36.420> finally<00:05:37.420> make<00:05:37.630> sure<00:05:37.810> the<00:05:37.990> corners

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
right way finally make sure the corners

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.410 
right way finally make sure the corners
of<00:05:38.500> your<00:05:38.530> lips<00:05:38.800> are<00:05:39.010> slightly<00:05:39.430> firm<00:05:39.880> so<00:05:40.390> that

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
of your lips are slightly firm so that

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.140 
of your lips are slightly firm so that
the<00:05:40.630> air<00:05:40.810> is<00:05:41.110> coming<00:05:41.320> out<00:05:41.530> just<00:05:41.860> the<00:05:42.100> middle<00:05:42.400> we

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
the air is coming out just the middle we

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.730 
the air is coming out just the middle we
don't<00:05:43.180> want<00:05:43.510> the<00:05:43.600> air<00:05:43.750> to<00:05:43.780> leak<00:05:44.140> out<00:05:44.350> all<00:05:44.590> the

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
don't want the air to leak out all the

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.140 
don't want the air to leak out all the
way<00:05:44.830> across<00:05:45.130> our<00:05:45.310> lips<00:05:45.550> or<00:05:45.790> it<00:05:45.910> will<00:05:46.000> sound

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
way across our lips or it will sound

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:58.370 
way across our lips or it will sound
like<00:05:46.300> this<00:05:51.630> lips<00:05:52.630> together<00:05:53.040> corners<00:05:54.040> firm

practice start with the head joint and

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.210 
practice start with the head joint and
practice<00:06:07.210> making<00:06:07.450> a<00:06:07.720> nice<00:06:07.990> clear<00:06:08.530> sound<00:06:08.890> like
