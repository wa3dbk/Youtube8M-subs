some<00:04:19.310> jumps<00:04:19.640> and<00:04:19.789> stuff<00:04:20.479> from<00:04:20.900> pets<00:04:21.709> at<00:04:21.859> home

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
some jumps and stuff from pets at home

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.930 
some jumps and stuff from pets at home
but<00:04:22.400> I<00:04:22.430> decided<00:04:22.729> not<00:04:22.970> to<00:04:23.150> go<00:04:23.270> there

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
but I decided not to go there

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.720 
but I decided not to go there
so<00:04:24.330> I<00:04:24.360> picked<00:04:24.720> up<00:04:24.840> some<00:04:24.930> of<00:04:25.140> this<00:04:25.260> it<00:04:25.500> is<00:04:25.650> a

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
so I picked up some of this it is a

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:32.560 
so I picked up some of this it is a
500ml<00:04:26.730> bottle<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.840> was<00:04:30.620> one<00:04:31.620> pound<00:04:31.830> 65

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
500ml bottle and it was one pound 65

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.290 
500ml bottle and it was one pound 65
which<00:04:33.570> I<00:04:33.690> thought<00:04:33.810> was<00:04:33.900> pretty<00:04:33.960> cheap<00:04:34.380> and

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
which I thought was pretty cheap and

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.970 
which I thought was pretty cheap and
I've<00:04:36.300> never<00:04:36.840> tried<00:04:37.080> it<00:04:37.140> but<00:04:37.470> I<00:04:37.530> know<00:04:37.620> a<00:04:37.710> lot<00:04:37.950> of

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
I've never tried it but I know a lot of

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.420 
I've never tried it but I know a lot of
people<00:04:38.070> who<00:04:38.880> use<00:04:39.180> it<00:04:39.440> so<00:04:40.440> I<00:04:40.860> thought<00:04:41.130> I'd<00:04:41.280> give

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
people who use it so I thought I'd give

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.480 
people who use it so I thought I'd give
it<00:04:41.460> a<00:04:41.610> go<00:04:43.460> so<00:04:44.460> yeah<00:04:44.640> anyway<00:04:45.510> I've<00:04:45.900> got<00:04:45.960> smell<00:04:46.320> up

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
it a go so yeah anyway I've got smell up

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.300 
it a go so yeah anyway I've got smell up
and<00:04:47.490> then<00:04:48.120> I<00:04:48.330> also<00:04:48.570> got<00:04:49.100> these<00:04:50.100> simply<00:04:51.090> nibbles

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
and then I also got these simply nibbles

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.950 
and then I also got these simply nibbles
crunchy<00:04:53.310> carrots<00:04:53.670> now<00:04:54.360> these<00:04:54.510> are<00:04:54.720> made<00:04:54.810> by

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
crunchy carrots now these are made by

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.230 
crunchy carrots now these are made by
rosewood<00:04:55.260> and<00:04:55.710> I'm<00:04:56.070> pretty<00:04:56.340> sure<00:04:56.490> rosewood

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
rosewood and I'm pretty sure rosewood

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.400 
rosewood and I'm pretty sure rosewood
are<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.420> same<00:04:57.600> people<00:04:57.780> you<00:04:58.110> make<00:04:58.260> the

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
are the same people you make the

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.560 
are the same people you make the
naturals<00:04:58.800> range<00:04:59.010> I'm<00:04:59.340> not<00:04:59.640> quite<00:04:59.970> sure<00:05:00.000> but

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
naturals range I'm not quite sure but

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.900 
naturals range I'm not quite sure but
these<00:05:01.380> look<00:05:01.560> exactly<00:05:02.190> like<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.490> naturals

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
these look exactly like the naturals

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.320 
these look exactly like the naturals
cavities<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:04.220> so<00:05:05.220> they're<00:05:05.790> suitable<00:05:06.060> for

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
cavities and so they're suitable for

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.090 
cavities and so they're suitable for
rabbits<00:05:06.600> guinea<00:05:06.780> pig<00:05:06.990> hamsters<00:05:07.470> gerbils<00:05:07.500> mice

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
rabbits guinea pig hamsters gerbils mice

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.010 
rabbits guinea pig hamsters gerbils mice
and<00:05:08.460> rats<00:05:08.640> say<00:05:09.420> are<00:05:09.600> a<00:05:09.630> 250<00:05:10.440> gram<00:05:10.590> packet<00:05:10.770> and

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
and rats say are a 250 gram packet and

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.750 
and rats say are a 250 gram packet and
these<00:05:13.020> were<00:05:13.200> an<00:05:13.350> absolute<00:05:13.470> bargain<00:05:14.010> there<00:05:14.640> was

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
these were an absolute bargain there was

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.820 
these were an absolute bargain there was
79<00:05:15.150> p<00:05:16.100> and<00:05:17.360> i'm<00:05:18.360> pretty<00:05:19.050> sure<00:05:19.260> they<00:05:19.500> are<00:05:19.620> made

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
79 p and i'm pretty sure they are made

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.770 
79 p and i'm pretty sure they are made
by<00:05:20.100> the<00:05:20.160> same<00:05:20.340> people<00:05:20.550> in<00:05:20.880> me<00:05:20.940> not<00:05:21.090> who<00:05:21.540> meet<00:05:21.750> in

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
by the same people in me not who meet in

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.560 
by the same people in me not who meet in
the<00:05:21.900> natural<00:05:22.230> range<00:05:22.470> so<00:05:23.270> you<00:05:24.270> know<00:05:24.420> this

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
the natural range so you know this

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.870 
the natural range so you know this
should<00:05:24.690> be<00:05:24.780> pretty<00:05:24.900> good<00:05:25.200> so<00:05:26.010> when<00:05:26.370> I<00:05:26.400> saw<00:05:26.640> them

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
should be pretty good so when I saw them

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.480 
should be pretty good so when I saw them
I<00:05:26.940> just<00:05:27.900> stood<00:05:28.590> there<00:05:28.830> and<00:05:28.950> I<00:05:29.040> was<00:05:29.100> like<00:05:29.280> I'm

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
I just stood there and I was like I'm

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.460 
I just stood there and I was like I'm
pretty<00:05:29.640> sure<00:05:29.820> their<00:05:30.000> nuptials<00:05:30.240> ones<00:05:30.630> and<00:05:30.900> I

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
pretty sure their nuptials ones and I

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.020 
pretty sure their nuptials ones and I
went<00:05:31.650> on<00:05:31.740> pets<00:05:31.919> at<00:05:32.070> home<00:05:32.100> website<00:05:32.370> and<00:05:32.820> they

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
went on pets at home website and they

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.390 
went on pets at home website and they
looked<00:05:33.240> exactly<00:05:33.390> the<00:05:33.780> same<00:05:33.900> and<00:05:34.370> although<00:05:35.370> I

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
looked exactly the same and although I

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.290 
looked exactly the same and although I
think<00:05:35.520> these<00:05:35.730> might<00:05:35.850> be<00:05:35.970> a<00:05:36.000> little<00:05:36.150> bit

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
think these might be a little bit

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.340 
think these might be a little bit
smaller<00:05:36.540> than<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:37.350> natural<00:05:37.800> ones<00:05:39.110> so<00:05:40.110> I

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
smaller than the natural ones so I

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.260 
smaller than the natural ones so I
picked<00:05:40.650> up<00:05:40.770> some<00:05:40.830> of<00:05:41.040> them<00:05:41.160> to<00:05:41.820> try<00:05:42.000> for<00:05:42.210> the

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
picked up some of them to try for the

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.510 
picked up some of them to try for the
pets<00:05:42.450> I<00:05:42.750> mean<00:05:43.169> at<00:05:43.290> seventy<00:05:43.440> nine<00:05:43.770> p<00:05:44.040> they're

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
pets I mean at seventy nine p they're

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.230 
pets I mean at seventy nine p they're
really<00:05:44.669> cheap<00:05:45.260> so<00:05:46.260> it<00:05:47.250> just<00:05:47.490> says<00:05:47.640> crisp<00:05:47.970> and

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
really cheap so it just says crisp and

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.110

crunchy<00:05:48.950> cereal<00:05:49.950> piece<00:05:50.460> is<00:05:50.669> naturally

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120

carrots around their home to create a

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.630 
carrots around their home to create a
stimulating<00:06:01.050> challenge<00:06:01.410> so<00:06:02.280> I<00:06:02.340> picked<00:06:02.550> up

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
stimulating challenge so I picked up

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.880 
stimulating challenge so I picked up
some<00:06:02.700> them<00:06:02.970> and<00:06:03.930> then<00:06:04.080> the<00:06:04.410> last<00:06:04.560> thing<00:06:04.710> I

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.040 
some them and then the last thing I
picked<00:06:05.130> up<00:06:05.250> was<00:06:05.310> the<00:06:05.790> simple<00:06:06.330> nibbles<00:06:06.750> little
