00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
quite a bit so it's a lot of fun let's

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.490 
quite a bit so it's a lot of fun let's

box you have your ground target I made

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.230 
box you have your ground target I made
to<00:01:51.360> look<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:52.259> radar<00:01:52.799> station<00:01:53.430> comes<00:01:54.119> with

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
to look like a radar station comes with

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.850 
to look like a radar station comes with
your<00:01:54.360> double<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.690> batteries<00:01:55.200> plug<00:01:55.590> them<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.770> the

the<00:02:53.820> box<00:02:56.600> controller<00:02:57.600> is<00:02:57.810> basically<00:02:58.380> your

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
the box controller is basically your

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.500 
the box controller is basically your
spectrum<00:02:59.070> DSM<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.940> controller<00:03:00.270> that

mcx to and quite a few different models

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.960 
mcx to and quite a few different models
are<00:03:06.900> out<00:03:07.050> there<00:03:07.290> with<00:03:08.010> one<00:03:08.520> additional

are out there with one additional
feature<00:03:09.230> your<00:03:10.230> trigger<00:03:10.500> buttons<00:03:10.890> so<00:03:11.670> these

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
feature your trigger buttons so these

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.390 
feature your trigger buttons so these
are<00:03:11.880> actually<00:03:12.210> used<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.570> shoot<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.930> laser

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
are actually used to shoot the laser

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.100 
are actually used to shoot the laser
which<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.640> actually<00:03:14.880> found<00:03:15.240> on<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.810> front<00:03:16.020> of

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
which is actually found on the front of

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.600 
which is actually found on the front of
the<00:03:16.170> helicopter<00:03:16.350> right<00:03:16.830> there<00:03:17.190> i'm<00:03:17.430> not

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
the helicopter right there i'm not

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.210 
the helicopter right there i'm not
taking<00:03:17.910> catch<00:03:18.390> that<00:03:18.690> real<00:03:18.960> quick<00:03:19.290> but<00:03:20.070> that

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
taking catch that real quick but that

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.350 
taking catch that real quick but that
right<00:03:20.340> there<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.550> actually<00:03:20.850> gonna<00:03:20.940> be<00:03:21.060> lazy

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
right there is actually gonna be lazy

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.540 
right there is actually gonna be lazy
and<00:03:21.720> on<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.500> bottom<00:03:22.680> of<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.070> laser<00:03:23.280> is

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
and on the bottom of that laser is

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.330 
and on the bottom of that laser is
actually<00:03:23.910> where<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.540> target<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:24.960> so<00:03:25.920> when<00:03:26.220> you

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
actually where the target is so when you

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.750 
actually where the target is so when you
shoot<00:03:26.640> within<00:03:27.180> 20<00:03:27.630> feet<00:03:27.660> is<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.620> standard<00:03:29.070> you

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
shoot within 20 feet is the standard you

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.290 
shoot within 20 feet is the standard you
will<00:03:29.970> strike<00:03:30.720> a<00:03:30.750> hit<00:03:31.050> and<00:03:31.350> 10<00:03:32.250> feet<00:03:32.490> is<00:03:32.820> the

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
will strike a hit and 10 feet is the

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.640 
will strike a hit and 10 feet is the
other<00:03:33.390> option<00:03:33.600> so<00:03:34.110> there's<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.350> couple<00:03:34.470> options

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
other option so there's a couple options

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.990 
other option so there's a couple options
you<00:03:34.950> can<00:03:35.010> do<00:03:35.160> with<00:03:35.340> this<00:03:35.490> kind<00:03:35.820> of<00:03:35.850> make<00:03:35.970> a

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
you can do with this kind of make a

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.790 
you can do with this kind of make a
little<00:03:36.090> tougher<00:03:36.660> you<00:03:37.230> can<00:03:37.380> make<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.710> where

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
little tougher you can make it to where

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.860 
little tougher you can make it to where
it's<00:03:37.950> only<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.160> 10<00:03:38.400> feet<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:39.000> can<00:03:39.090> also<00:03:39.360> set<00:03:39.750> it

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
it's only a 10 feet you can also set it

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.000 
it's only a 10 feet you can also set it
up<00:03:39.960> if<00:03:40.140> you're<00:03:40.230> flying<00:03:40.470> more<00:03:40.710> than<00:03:40.890> one

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
up if you're flying more than one

make on these helicopters the mcx mcx

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.390 
make on these helicopters the mcx mcx
cube<00:04:54.690> came<00:04:54.900> to<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.080> charging<00:04:55.530> base<00:04:55.740> just<00:04:56.160> kind

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
cube came to the charging base just kind

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.790 
cube came to the charging base just kind
of<00:04:56.460> gone<00:04:56.640> now<00:04:56.880> they<00:04:57.540> went<00:04:57.810> ahead<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:58.080> did<00:04:58.590> to

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
of gone now they went ahead and did to

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.230 
of gone now they went ahead and did to
where<00:04:58.950> you<00:04:59.040> actually<00:04:59.160> just<00:04:59.310> plug<00:04:59.640> it<00:04:59.760> into<00:04:59.940> the

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
where you actually just plug it into the

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.120 
where you actually just plug it into the
back<00:05:00.270> of<00:05:00.480> the<00:05:00.810> bottom<00:05:01.650> of<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.770> controller

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
back of the bottom of the controller

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.520 
back of the bottom of the controller
right<00:05:02.310> here<00:05:02.580> plug<00:05:03.360> it<00:05:03.510> in<00:05:03.690> looks<00:05:04.260> like<00:05:04.410> to

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
right here plug it in looks like to

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.260 
right here plug it in looks like to
charge<00:05:04.830> you're<00:05:05.340> good<00:05:05.490> to<00:05:05.580> go<00:05:05.610> in<00:05:05.820> about<00:05:05.910> 10

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
charge you're good to go in about 10

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.120 
charge you're good to go in about 10
minutes<00:05:06.510> and<00:05:06.780> you<00:05:07.169> get<00:05:07.290> to<00:05:07.380> fly<00:05:07.530> for<00:05:07.650> about<00:05:07.950> 10

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
minutes and you get to fly for about 10

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.150 
minutes and you get to fly for about 10
minutes<00:05:08.370> so<00:05:08.910> it's<00:05:09.330> a<00:05:09.510> very<00:05:09.540> good<00:05:09.990> ratio<00:05:10.800> of

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
minutes so it's a very good ratio of

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.800 
minutes so it's a very good ratio of
charging<00:05:11.880> the<00:05:11.940> flying<00:05:12.210> time<00:05:12.450> so<00:05:12.630> you<00:05:12.720> can

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
charging the flying time so you can

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.780 
charging the flying time so you can
enjoy<00:05:12.960> yourself<00:05:13.470> now<00:05:14.280> another<00:05:14.550> neat<00:05:14.760> thing

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
enjoy yourself now another neat thing

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.970 
enjoy yourself now another neat thing
you<00:05:15.060> can<00:05:15.210> do<00:05:15.330> with<00:05:15.419> these<00:05:15.680> you<00:05:16.680> can<00:05:16.860> actually

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
you can do with these you can actually

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.920 
you can do with these you can actually
have<00:05:17.250> one<00:05:17.430> charging<00:05:17.850> while<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.600> other<00:05:18.750> ones
