vesicle movement vesicle Oh vesicles
were<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.670> structure<00:00:09.300> that<00:00:09.330> we<00:00:09.480> talked<00:00:09.660> about<00:00:09.719> we

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
were a structure that we talked about we

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.600 
were a structure that we talked about we
talked<00:00:10.080> about<00:00:10.200> cells<00:00:10.559> right<00:00:11.250> they<00:00:11.400> were<00:00:11.460> just

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
talked about cells right they were just

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.180 
talked about cells right they were just
little<00:00:11.880> storage<00:00:12.090> sacks<00:00:12.620> vesicle<00:00:13.620> movement<00:00:14.040> is

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
little storage sacks vesicle movement is

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.620 
little storage sacks vesicle movement is
for<00:00:14.429> molecules<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.450> are<00:00:15.509> too<00:00:16.230> big<00:00:16.310> all<00:00:17.310> right

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
for molecules that are too big all right

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.550 
for molecules that are too big all right
too<00:00:18.630> big<00:00:18.960> for<00:00:19.830> diffusion<00:00:20.480> too<00:00:21.480> big<00:00:21.810> for<00:00:22.529> a

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
too big for diffusion too big for a

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.279 
too big for diffusion too big for a
protein<00:00:22.859> channel<00:00:23.640> all<00:00:24.060> right<00:00:24.150> they're<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:24.960> big

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
protein channel all right they're so big

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.160 
protein channel all right they're so big
that<00:00:25.320> they<00:00:25.619> need<00:00:25.769> their<00:00:25.920> own<00:00:26.220> mode<00:00:26.910> of

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
that they need their own mode of

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.450 
that they need their own mode of
transportation<00:00:28.170> they<00:00:28.949> need<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.220> specific

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
transportation they need a specific

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.730 
transportation they need a specific
method<00:00:30.119> just<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.480> get<00:00:30.689> themselves<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.410> or<00:00:31.590> out

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
method just to get themselves in or out

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.910 
method just to get themselves in or out
of<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.949> cell<00:00:32.189> they<00:00:32.460> need<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> vesicle<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.300> help

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
of the cell they need a vesicle to help

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.350 
of the cell they need a vesicle to help
so<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.100> vesicle<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.610> membrane<00:00:35.940> mount<00:00:36.120> sac

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
so that vesicle is a membrane mount sac

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.110 
so that vesicle is a membrane mount sac
and<00:00:36.690> its<00:00:37.620> gonna<00:00:37.770> bring<00:00:37.980> substances<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.670> or<00:00:38.940> out

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
and its gonna bring substances in or out

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.110 
and its gonna bring substances in or out
of<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.329> cell<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.710> vesicle<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.340> made<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.059> a

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
of the cell and a vesicle is made of a

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.299 
of the cell and a vesicle is made of a
phospholipid<00:00:42.570> bilayers<00:00:43.260> just<00:00:43.739> like<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> cell

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
phospholipid bilayers just like the cell

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.660 
phospholipid bilayers just like the cell
membrane<00:00:44.340> right<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.690> here's<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.989> picture<00:00:46.289> of

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
membrane right so here's a picture of

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.930 
membrane right so here's a picture of
our<00:00:47.670> vesicle<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:49.520> let's<00:00:50.520> say<00:00:50.730> we're

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
our vesicle and let's say we're

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.360 
our vesicle and let's say we're
transporting<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.780> protein<00:00:52.230> here's<00:00:53.160> our

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
transporting a protein here's our

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.119 
transporting a protein here's our
protein<00:00:53.960> packaged<00:00:54.960> inside<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.559> our<00:00:55.649> vegetable

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
protein packaged inside of our vegetable

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.170 
protein packaged inside of our vegetable
here<00:00:56.699> are<00:00:56.850> phospholipids<00:00:58.760> all<00:00:59.760> right<00:00:59.879> all<00:01:00.059> of

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
here are phospholipids all right all of

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.490 
here are phospholipids all right all of
our<00:01:00.270> fossil<00:01:01.079> lipid<00:01:01.469> by<00:01:01.770> layer<00:01:02.899> right<00:01:03.899> just

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
our fossil lipid by layer right just

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.350 
our fossil lipid by layer right just
like<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> cell<00:01:05.010> membrane<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.820> doesn't<00:01:06.240> have

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
like the cell membrane just doesn't have

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.149 
like the cell membrane just doesn't have
all<00:01:06.510> or<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:06.930> all<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> stuff<00:01:07.560> inside<00:01:07.770> like<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
all or have all the stuff inside like a

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.270 
all or have all the stuff inside like a
cell<00:01:08.400> would<00:01:09.170> so<00:01:10.170> let's<00:01:10.470> talk<00:01:10.590> about<00:01:10.650> movement

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
cell would so let's talk about movement

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.560 
cell would so let's talk about movement
in<00:01:11.930> into<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.990> cell<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.979> called<00:01:14.570> endocytosis

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
in into a cell it's called endocytosis

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.260 
in into a cell it's called endocytosis
we<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.530> take<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.890> word<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:17.909> break

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
we can take this word and we can break

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.749 
we can take this word and we can break
it<00:01:18.299> down<00:01:18.600> end<00:01:18.960> up<00:01:20.060> meeting<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.560> saito<00:01:22.759> meaning

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
it down end up meeting in saito meaning

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.679 
it down end up meeting in saito meaning
cell<00:01:24.060> osis<00:01:25.070> reverses<00:01:26.070> meaning<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:29.540> process<00:01:30.540> of

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
cell osis reverses meaning a process of

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.960 
cell osis reverses meaning a process of
so<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> cellular<00:01:31.740> process<00:01:32.340> moving

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
so this is a cellular process moving

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.149 
so this is a cellular process moving
stuff<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.600> alright<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.380> how<00:01:34.500> cells<00:01:34.920> get

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
stuff in alright this is how cells get

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.749 
stuff in alright this is how cells get
moved<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:36.049> with<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> vesicle<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.829> also<00:01:38.310> tell<00:01:38.640> my

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
moved in with a vesicle I also tell my

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.510 
moved in with a vesicle I also tell my
students<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.659> go<00:01:41.780> for<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:43.020> turn<00:01:43.890> all<00:01:44.369> right

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
students and go for in turn all right

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.510 
students and go for in turn all right
this<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.630> white<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.470> no<00:01:46.799> psychosis<00:01:47.399> is

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
this is the white in and no psychosis is

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.289 
this is the white in and no psychosis is
for<00:01:47.670> entry<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.600> got<00:01:48.720> two<00:01:49.110> types<00:01:49.439> of

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
for entry you got two types of

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.410 
for entry you got two types of
endocytosis

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.929 

pinocytosis<00:01:56.740> right<00:01:57.740> pinocytosis<00:01:58.130> is<00:01:58.759> when

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
pinocytosis right pinocytosis is when

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.749 
pinocytosis right pinocytosis is when
liquids<00:01:59.719> all<00:02:00.350> right<00:02:00.469> are<00:02:00.740> going<00:02:00.799> to<00:02:01.579> be

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
liquids all right are going to be

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.270 
liquids all right are going to be
packaged<00:02:02.329> and<00:02:02.570> moved<00:02:03.229> in<00:02:03.470> or<00:02:03.680> out<00:02:03.860> of<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.039> cell

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
packaged and moved in or out of the cell

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.729 
packaged and moved in or out of the cell
all<00:02:04.759> right<00:02:05.259> this<00:02:06.259> is<00:02:06.409> like<00:02:06.590> silk<00:02:06.860> drinking<00:02:07.340> and

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
all right this is like silk drinking and

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.900 
all right this is like silk drinking and
then<00:02:09.739> you've<00:02:09.860> got<00:02:09.890> that<00:02:10.190> go<00:02:10.340> psychosis

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
then you've got that go psychosis

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.750 
then you've got that go psychosis
phagocytosis<00:02:11.810> is<00:02:12.170> for<00:02:12.470> food<00:02:12.800> this<00:02:13.459> is<00:02:13.610> how

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
phagocytosis is for food this is how

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.710 
phagocytosis is for food this is how
food<00:02:14.540> molecules<00:02:14.810> large<00:02:15.680> solid<00:02:16.489> molecules<00:02:17.090> are

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
food molecules large solid molecules are

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.170 
food molecules large solid molecules are
going<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.319> be<00:02:18.440> moved<00:02:18.709> so<00:02:19.459> we've<00:02:19.940> got

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
going to be moved so we've got

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.350 
going to be moved so we've got
pinocytosis<00:02:20.950> for<00:02:21.950> liquids<00:02:22.849> moving<00:02:23.180> in

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
pinocytosis for liquids moving in

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.830 
pinocytosis for liquids moving in
phagocytosis<00:02:24.160> for<00:02:25.160> solids<00:02:26.030> moving<00:02:26.690> in

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
phagocytosis for solids moving in

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.449 
phagocytosis for solids moving in
alright<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:27.290> we<00:02:27.410> acquitting<00:02:27.980> them<00:02:28.099> to<00:02:28.220> sell

right here is showing you endocytosis

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.160 
right here is showing you endocytosis
you<00:02:34.610> have<00:02:34.730> all<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.030> your<00:02:35.360> little<00:02:35.690> liquid

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
you have all of your little liquid

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.400 
you have all of your little liquid
molecules<00:02:37.239> these<00:02:38.239> liquid<00:02:38.660> molecules<00:02:39.080> are<00:02:39.230> not

water<00:02:39.680> why<00:02:41.560> water<00:02:42.560> moves<00:02:42.830> by<00:02:43.010> osmosis<00:02:43.450> right

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
water why water moves by osmosis right

not<00:02:45.019> endocytosis<00:02:45.829> all<00:02:46.370> right<00:02:46.489> so<00:02:46.579> here<00:02:46.760> are

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
not endocytosis all right so here are

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.670

all of our little liquid molecules
they're<00:02:49.400> going<00:02:49.549> to<00:02:49.640> push<00:02:49.849> up<00:02:50.060> against<00:02:50.329> the

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
letting them pastor they're too big to

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.960 
letting them pastor they're too big to

diffuse straight through the cell

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.940 
diffuse straight through the cell
membrane<00:02:56.000> so<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.049> cell<00:02:57.230> membrane<00:02:57.260> starts<00:02:57.860> to

membrane so the cell membrane starts to

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.780

actually dimple in that dimple starts to

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.160 
actually dimple in that dimple starts to
form<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.359> pocket<00:03:03.579> that<00:03:04.579> pocket<00:03:05.019> starts<00:03:06.019> to

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
form the pocket that pocket starts to

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.460 
form the pocket that pocket starts to
actually<00:03:06.650> close<00:03:07.190> in<00:03:07.519> on<00:03:07.760> itself<00:03:08.180> until<00:03:08.470> it

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
actually close in on itself until it

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.059 
actually close in on itself until it
closes<00:03:10.180> completely<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.720> pinches<00:03:12.560> off<00:03:12.799> a

closes completely and pinches off a

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.740 
closes completely and pinches off a
vesicle<00:03:15.100> now<00:03:16.100> that<00:03:16.370> vesicle<00:03:16.850> is<00:03:17.000> inside<00:03:17.600> the

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
vesicle now that vesicle is inside the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.069 
vesicle now that vesicle is inside the
cell<00:03:17.989> endo<00:03:18.980> entering<00:03:19.700> it's<00:03:19.940> inside<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.720> cell

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
cell endo entering it's inside the cell

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.229 
cell endo entering it's inside the cell
and<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.590> stuff<00:03:21.829> inside<00:03:22.010> of<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.459> has<00:03:22.790> gotten<00:03:23.150> in

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
and the stuff inside of it has gotten in

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.080 
and the stuff inside of it has gotten in
now<00:03:23.450> we<00:03:23.840> said<00:03:24.139> that<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.470> membrane<00:03:25.459> of<00:03:25.730> a

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
now we said that the membrane of a

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.000 
now we said that the membrane of a
vesicle<00:03:26.420> is<00:03:26.720> still<00:03:27.049> a<00:03:27.079> phospholipid<00:03:27.440> bilayer

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
vesicle is still a phospholipid bilayer

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.610 
vesicle is still a phospholipid bilayer
well<00:03:28.400> look<00:03:29.030> at<00:03:29.150> it<00:03:29.269> where<00:03:30.109> did<00:03:30.290> it<00:03:30.350> come<00:03:30.590> from

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
well look at it where did it come from

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.500 
well look at it where did it come from
it's<00:03:31.100> a<00:03:31.430> part<00:03:31.910> of<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:33.380> cell<00:03:33.709> membrane<00:03:34.510> that

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
it's a part of the cell membrane that

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.470 
it's a part of the cell membrane that
broke<00:03:36.139> off<00:03:36.700> writing<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.180> shouldn't<00:03:38.450> be

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
broke off writing so it shouldn't be

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.420 
broke off writing so it shouldn't be
made<00:03:38.690> of<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:38.989> exact<00:03:39.410> same<00:03:39.680> stuff<00:03:39.980> in<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.220> cell

made of the exact same stuff in the cell

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.940 
made of the exact same stuff in the cell
membrane

phagocytosis showing the same thing
except<00:03:46.090> for<00:03:46.209> now<00:03:46.300> we're<00:03:46.480> looking<00:03:46.569> at<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.870> solid

except for now we're looking at a solid

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.470 
except for now we're looking at a solid
right<00:03:47.800> this<00:03:47.950> big<00:03:48.130> giant<00:03:48.340> molecule<00:03:48.849> pushes<00:03:49.360> in

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
right this big giant molecule pushes in

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.180 
right this big giant molecule pushes in
on<00:03:49.569> the<00:03:49.660> cell<00:03:49.840> membrane<00:03:49.870> crees<00:03:50.530> creates<00:03:51.099> a

on the cell membrane crees creates a
dimple<00:03:51.610> pocket<00:03:52.239> and<00:03:52.450> that<00:03:52.750> pocket<00:03:53.170> pinches

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
dimple pocket and that pocket pinches

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.640 
dimple pocket and that pocket pinches
off<00:03:53.709> to<00:03:54.160> create<00:03:54.400> a<00:03:54.459> vesicle<00:03:54.819> inside<00:03:55.470> let's<00:03:56.470> say

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
off to create a vesicle inside let's say

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.490 
off to create a vesicle inside let's say
that's<00:03:56.860> a<00:03:57.190> big<00:03:57.880> protein<00:03:58.450> right<00:03:58.750> you<00:03:58.989> have<00:03:59.170> eggs

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
that's a big protein right you have eggs

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.320 
that's a big protein right you have eggs
or<00:03:59.830> chicken<00:04:00.130> or<00:04:00.220> something<00:04:00.459> that<00:04:00.819> you<00:04:00.910> ate<00:04:00.940> and

or chicken or something that you ate and

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.059 
or chicken or something that you ate and
you've<00:04:01.660> got<00:04:01.780> a<00:04:01.840> lot<00:04:01.989> of<00:04:02.020> protein<00:04:02.440> that<00:04:02.650> protein

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
you've got a lot of protein that protein

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.729 
you've got a lot of protein that protein
is<00:04:03.220> coming<00:04:03.489> into<00:04:03.730> yourself<00:04:04.200> all<00:04:05.200> right<00:04:05.319> now

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
is coming into yourself all right now

it's inside of yourself and it needs to

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.559 
it's inside of yourself and it needs to
be<00:04:08.350> further<00:04:08.530> broken<00:04:08.709> down<00:04:09.120> all<00:04:10.120> right<00:04:10.180> because

be further broken down all right because

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.559 
be further broken down all right because

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
it would be the lysosomes lysosomes

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.980 
it would be the lysosomes lysosomes
contain<00:04:36.610> digestive<00:04:37.090> enzymes<00:04:37.419> right<00:04:37.630> the

lysosome is going to break down right
break<00:04:42.790> it<00:04:42.820> all<00:04:43.030> apart<00:04:43.330> into<00:04:43.630> all<00:04:43.930> these<00:04:44.139> little

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
break it all apart into all these little

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.100 
break it all apart into all these little
amino<00:04:46.720> acids<00:04:48.210> amino<00:04:49.210> acid<00:04:49.660> to<00:04:49.720> remember<00:04:49.960> their

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
the subunit of the protein all right now

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.100 
the subunit of the protein all right now
you<00:04:54.070> have<00:04:54.340> molecules<00:04:54.850> that<00:04:55.390> your<00:04:55.600> self<00:04:55.870> in<00:04:56.050> you

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
you have molecules that your self in you

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.090 
you have molecules that your self in you
use<00:04:56.440> all<00:04:57.250> right<00:04:57.400> amino<00:04:57.850> acids<00:04:58.450> are<00:04:58.780> usable<00:04:59.680> by

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
use all right amino acids are usable by

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.360 
use all right amino acids are usable by
the<00:05:00.160> cell<00:05:00.490> whole<00:05:01.000> proteins<00:05:01.510> all<00:05:02.380> right<00:05:02.500> you

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
the cell whole proteins all right you

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.010 
the cell whole proteins all right you
need<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:03.580> first<00:05:03.789> break<00:05:04.120> them<00:05:04.360> further<00:05:04.630> down

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
need to first break them further down

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.950 
need to first break them further down
before<00:05:05.470> your<00:05:05.620> body<00:05:05.800> can<00:05:06.010> start<00:05:06.220> to<00:05:06.340> use<00:05:06.370> them

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.090 

so<00:05:10.960> now<00:05:11.169> let's<00:05:11.350> talk<00:05:11.500> about<00:05:11.620> how<00:05:11.770> stuff<00:05:12.010> gets

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
so now let's talk about how stuff gets

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.100 
so now let's talk about how stuff gets
back<00:05:12.340> out<00:05:13.500> exocytosis<00:05:15.000> all<00:05:16.000> right<00:05:16.150> exocytosis

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
back out exocytosis all right exocytosis

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:23.130 
back out exocytosis all right exocytosis
I<00:05:17.710> leave<00:05:17.860> all<00:05:18.100> my<00:05:18.130> students<00:05:18.640> XO<00:05:19.740> for<00:05:20.740> exit<00:05:22.140> this

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
I leave all my students XO for exit this

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.700 
I leave all my students XO for exit this
is<00:05:23.320> the<00:05:23.410> way<00:05:23.500> out<00:05:23.820> this<00:05:24.820> is<00:05:24.970> basically<00:05:25.710> going

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
is the way out this is basically going

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.670 
is the way out this is basically going
to<00:05:26.770> be<00:05:26.830> endocytosis<00:05:27.580> but<00:05:28.419> in<00:05:28.539> Reverse<00:05:28.900> right

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
to be endocytosis but in Reverse right

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.909 
to be endocytosis but in Reverse right
it's<00:05:29.830> gonna<00:05:29.950> look<00:05:30.100> very<00:05:30.370> similar<00:05:31.770> think<00:05:32.770> about

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
it's gonna look very similar think about

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.070 
it's gonna look very similar think about
it<00:05:33.039> this<00:05:33.160> way<00:05:33.330> now<00:05:34.330> you<00:05:34.390> have<00:05:34.570> all<00:05:34.690> those<00:05:34.840> amino

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
it this way now you have all those amino

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.650 
it this way now you have all those amino
acids<00:05:35.470> right<00:05:35.620> you<00:05:35.800> ate<00:05:36.100> something<00:05:36.430> for<00:05:37.390> lunch

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
acids right you ate something for lunch

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.050 
acids right you ate something for lunch
you<00:05:37.990> ate<00:05:38.080> protein<00:05:38.530> whatever<00:05:38.860> and<00:05:39.130> the<00:05:39.700> protein

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
you ate protein whatever and the protein

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.000 
you ate protein whatever and the protein
is<00:05:40.150> down<00:05:40.300> into<00:05:40.539> your<00:05:40.660> cells<00:05:40.930> your<00:05:41.620> cells<00:05:41.860> have

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
is down into your cells your cells have

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.080 
is down into your cells your cells have
broken<00:05:42.220> up<00:05:42.370> down<00:05:42.550> and<00:05:42.669> now<00:05:42.729> you<00:05:42.789> have<00:05:42.940> all

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
broken up down and now you have all

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.900 
broken up down and now you have all
these<00:05:43.210> little<00:05:43.360> amino<00:05:43.720> acids<00:05:44.110> floating<00:05:44.500> around

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
these little amino acids floating around

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.219 
these little amino acids floating around
those<00:05:45.910> amino<00:05:46.180> acids<00:05:46.600> need<00:05:46.780> to<00:05:46.840> be<00:05:46.930> assembled

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
those amino acids need to be assembled

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.150 
those amino acids need to be assembled
into<00:05:47.410> something<00:05:47.710> that<00:05:47.830> your<00:05:47.919> cell<00:05:48.100> can<00:05:48.280> use

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
into something that your cell can use

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.160 
into something that your cell can use
right<00:05:50.000> needs<00:05:50.420> to<00:05:50.540> be<00:05:50.630> assembled<00:05:50.930> into<00:05:51.110> a

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170 
right needs to be assembled into a

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.660 
right needs to be assembled into a
protein<00:05:51.590> that<00:05:51.620> you<00:05:51.800> actually<00:05:51.950> need<00:05:52.310> let's<00:05:52.550> say

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:52.670 
protein that you actually need let's say

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:53.800 
protein that you actually need let's say
the<00:05:52.730> protein<00:05:53.060> that<00:05:53.150> your<00:05:53.270> body<00:05:53.420> needs<00:05:53.510> is

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
the protein that your body needs is

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.320 
the protein that your body needs is
hemoglobin<00:05:54.380> hemoglobin<00:05:55.370> is<00:05:55.460> the<00:05:55.490> protein<00:05:55.670> on

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
hemoglobin hemoglobin is the protein on

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.270 
hemoglobin hemoglobin is the protein on
red<00:05:57.050> blood<00:05:57.230> cells<00:05:57.470> that's<00:05:57.680> responsible<00:05:58.070> for

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
red blood cells that's responsible for

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.470 
red blood cells that's responsible for
carrying<00:05:58.430> oxygen<00:05:59.410> so<00:06:01.150> the<00:06:02.150> first<00:06:02.360> thing

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 
carrying oxygen so the first thing

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.720 
carrying oxygen so the first thing
that's<00:06:02.690> going<00:06:02.840> to<00:06:02.930> happen<00:06:03.080> is<00:06:03.380> that<00:06:03.920> those

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:04.730 
that's going to happen is that those

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.610 
that's going to happen is that those
amino<00:06:05.000> acids<00:06:05.450> are<00:06:05.570> going<00:06:05.690> to<00:06:05.750> get<00:06:05.840> reassembled

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
amino acids are going to get reassembled

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.950 
amino acids are going to get reassembled
and<00:06:06.950> turned<00:06:07.490> into<00:06:07.610> a<00:06:07.700> protein<00:06:08.150> by<00:06:08.570> and<00:06:08.720> working

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
and turned into a protein by and working

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.560 
and turned into a protein by and working
out<00:06:09.080> what<00:06:09.290> organelle<00:06:09.650> makes<00:06:09.890> proteins<00:06:10.570> the

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
out what organelle makes proteins the

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.140 
out what organelle makes proteins the
ribosomes<00:06:12.040> so<00:06:13.040> the<00:06:13.160> ribosome<00:06:13.610> builds<00:06:13.970> a<00:06:14.030> new

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
ribosomes so the ribosome builds a new

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.270 
ribosomes so the ribosome builds a new
protein<00:06:14.510> via<00:06:14.780> fill<00:06:15.020> the<00:06:15.170> hemoglobin<00:06:15.920> molecule

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
protein via fill the hemoglobin molecule

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.300 
protein via fill the hemoglobin molecule
this<00:06:16.460> new<00:06:16.640> protein<00:06:17.200> the<00:06:18.200> ribosomes<00:06:18.650> send<00:06:19.220> it

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
this new protein the ribosomes send it

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.950 
this new protein the ribosomes send it
to<00:06:19.370> the<00:06:19.460> Golgi<00:06:19.640> apparatus<00:06:19.790> because<00:06:20.390> the

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
to the Golgi apparatus because the

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.140 
to the Golgi apparatus because the
hemoglobin<00:06:21.500> is<00:06:21.620> not<00:06:21.800> needed<00:06:22.100> inside<00:06:22.760> the<00:06:22.910> cell

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
hemoglobin is not needed inside the cell

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.940 
hemoglobin is not needed inside the cell
it's<00:06:23.480> needed<00:06:23.870> outside<00:06:24.350> of<00:06:24.380> the<00:06:24.500> cell<00:06:24.680> where<00:06:24.830> it

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
it's needed outside of the cell where it

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.980 
it's needed outside of the cell where it
can<00:06:25.100> carry<00:06:25.280> oxygen<00:06:25.910> so<00:06:26.540> the<00:06:26.570> Golgi<00:06:26.960> apparatus

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
can carry oxygen so the Golgi apparatus

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.020 
can carry oxygen so the Golgi apparatus
is<00:06:27.590> going<00:06:27.770> to<00:06:27.890> package<00:06:28.280> it<00:06:28.400> up<00:06:28.490> into<00:06:28.730> a<00:06:28.760> little

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
is going to package it up into a little

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.390 
is going to package it up into a little
vesicle<00:06:29.510> and<00:06:29.660> send<00:06:30.440> it<00:06:30.620> to<00:06:30.770> the<00:06:31.130> cell<00:06:31.370> membrane

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
vesicle and send it to the cell membrane

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.500 
vesicle and send it to the cell membrane
where<00:06:32.390> that<00:06:32.600> vesicle<00:06:33.200> can<00:06:33.740> leave<00:06:34.250> the<00:06:34.610> cell<00:06:34.910> by

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:35.510 
where that vesicle can leave the cell by

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.420 
where that vesicle can leave the cell by
exocytosis<00:06:37.240> so<00:06:38.240> alright<00:06:39.170> here's<00:06:39.770> our<00:06:39.980> picture

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
exocytosis so alright here's our picture

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.860 
exocytosis so alright here's our picture
this<00:06:41.300> would<00:06:41.510> be<00:06:41.540> like<00:06:41.840> our<00:06:42.710> protein<00:06:43.400> right<00:06:44.330> not

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
this would be like our protein right not

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.990 
this would be like our protein right not
really<00:06:44.990> a<00:06:45.140> good<00:06:45.290> color<00:06:45.560> start<00:06:45.920> yes<00:06:46.100> this<00:06:46.790> would

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 
really a good color start yes this would

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.360 
really a good color start yes this would
be<00:06:47.090> like<00:06:47.120> our<00:06:47.420> protein<00:06:48.130> inside<00:06:49.130> of<00:06:49.250> our

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
be like our protein inside of our

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.730 
be like our protein inside of our
vesicle<00:06:49.850> that's<00:06:50.360> been<00:06:50.540> packaged<00:06:51.020> and<00:06:51.230> it's

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:51.740 
vesicle that's been packaged and it's

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.950 
vesicle that's been packaged and it's
going<00:06:51.950> to<00:06:52.100> get<00:06:52.310> a<00:06:52.370> chance<00:06:52.670> to<00:06:52.880> leave<00:06:53.150> so<00:06:53.780> that

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
going to get a chance to leave so that

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:03.529 
going to get a chance to leave so that
it<00:06:54.200> can<00:06:54.380> do<00:06:54.530> its<00:06:54.800> job<00:06:55.220> outside<00:06:56.000> the<00:06:56.240> cell

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:03.539 

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:06.989 

again<00:07:04.539> same<00:07:05.050> thing<00:07:05.399> phospholipid<00:07:06.399> bilayer

00:07:06.989 --> 00:07:06.999 
again same thing phospholipid bilayer

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:09.809 
again same thing phospholipid bilayer
went<00:07:07.749> that<00:07:08.050> vesicle<00:07:08.739> comes<00:07:09.099> in<00:07:09.339> it<00:07:09.489> merges

00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:09.819 
went that vesicle comes in it merges

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:12.959 
went that vesicle comes in it merges
with<00:07:10.360> the<00:07:10.989> cell<00:07:11.319> membrane<00:07:11.429> it's<00:07:12.429> just<00:07:12.759> going

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:12.969 
with the cell membrane it's just going

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:15.719 
with the cell membrane it's just going
to<00:07:13.029> become<00:07:13.719> a<00:07:14.139> new<00:07:14.800> part<00:07:15.129> of<00:07:15.369> the<00:07:15.489> cell

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:15.729 
to become a new part of the cell

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:17.759 
to become a new part of the cell
membrane
