00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
condensed milk to start this first I am

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.500 
condensed milk to start this first I am
going<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.229> add<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:08.400> ingredients<00:01:09.119> into<00:01:09.479> a

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
going to add the ingredients into a

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.560 
going to add the ingredients into a
mixing<00:01:10.020> bowl<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.159> added<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.850> flour<00:01:11.970> into<00:01:12.390> a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
mixing bowl so I added the flour into a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.630 
mixing bowl so I added the flour into a
mixing<00:01:12.600> bowl<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.920> I'm<00:01:14.010> going<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.310> add<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
mixing bowl so I'm going to add the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.210 
mixing bowl so I'm going to add the
yeast<00:01:14.909> directly<00:01:15.570> into<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.930> flour<00:01:16.220> because

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
yeast directly into the flour because

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.429 
yeast directly into the flour because
when<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.640> add<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.090> yeast<00:01:18.299> into<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.810> warm<00:01:19.110> milk

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
when I add the yeast into the warm milk

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.730 
when I add the yeast into the warm milk
some<00:01:19.890> when<00:01:20.580> they<00:01:20.610> do<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.270> they<00:01:21.570> just<00:01:21.600> get<00:01:22.290> mixed

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
some when they do it they just get mixed

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.920 
some when they do it they just get mixed
up<00:01:22.860> with<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.580> little<00:01:23.970> extra<00:01:24.180> liquid<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:24.900> I

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
up with a little extra liquid so I

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.590 
up with a little extra liquid so I
thought<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.409> doing<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.710> way<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:27.330> Lee

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
thought of doing this way so I have Lee

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.230 
thought of doing this way so I have Lee
East<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:29.009> sugar<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.750> then<00:01:31.009> going<00:01:32.009> to

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
East and the sugar and then going to

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.590 
East and the sugar and then going to
need<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.630> one<00:01:34.009> mini<00:01:35.030> until<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.150> gets

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
need this one mini until it gets

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.399 
need this one mini until it gets
so<00:01:38.260> while<00:01:38.470> mixing<00:01:38.830> I'd<00:01:39.729> enough<00:01:40.210> salt<00:01:40.690> to<00:01:41.110> the

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
so while mixing I'd enough salt to the

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.180 
so while mixing I'd enough salt to the
flour<00:01:41.440> and<00:01:42.430> then<00:01:43.150> start<00:01:44.110> adding<00:01:44.680> the<00:01:44.890> warm

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
flour and then start adding the warm

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.860 
flour and then start adding the warm
milk<00:01:45.490> little<00:01:45.940> by<00:01:46.150> little<00:01:46.690> into<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.380> flour<00:01:47.770> mix

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.850 

then<00:01:51.500> at<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.820> eggs<00:01:53.060> one<00:01:53.510> and<00:01:53.750> half<00:01:53.960> eggs<00:01:54.410> into

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
then at the eggs one and half eggs into

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.900 
then at the eggs one and half eggs into
the<00:01:55.510> kneading<00:01:56.510> dough<00:01:56.780> tool<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.650> mix<00:01:58.400> it<00:01:58.670> and

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.720 
the kneading dough tool and mix it and
knead<00:01:59.270> it<00:01:59.300> about<00:01:59.840> ten<00:02:00.290> minutes<00:02:00.730> while

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
knead it about ten minutes while

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.570 
knead it about ten minutes while
kneading<00:02:02.210> if<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:02.810> find<00:02:03.140> it<00:02:03.320> a<00:02:03.500> bit<00:02:03.530> harder<00:02:04.310> add

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
kneading if you find it a bit harder add

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.080 
kneading if you find it a bit harder add
a<00:02:04.640> little<00:02:04.970> bit<00:02:05.240> more<00:02:05.480> milk<00:02:05.770> into<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:07.090> flour

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
a little bit more milk into the flour

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.020 
a little bit more milk into the flour
and<00:02:08.450> mix<00:02:08.510> it<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.470> need<00:02:09.830> it<00:02:09.860> about<00:02:10.490> ten<00:02:10.820> minutes

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
and mix it and need it about ten minutes

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.220
