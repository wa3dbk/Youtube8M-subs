I'm here back for another minecraft
video<00:00:04.380> and<00:00:04.830> in<00:00:05.279> this<00:00:05.549> video<00:00:05.730> I<00:00:05.910> found<00:00:06.180> this

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
video and in this video I found this

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.930 
video and in this video I found this
really<00:00:06.509> cool<00:00:06.629> glitch<00:00:07.049> that<00:00:07.639> allows<00:00:08.639> you<00:00:08.820> go

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
really cool glitch that allows you go

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.720 
really cool glitch that allows you go
300<00:00:09.510> blocks<00:00:09.750> any<00:00:10.080> direction<00:00:10.349> does<00:00:11.250> not<00:00:11.490> matter

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
300 blocks any direction does not matter

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.880 
300 blocks any direction does not matter
where<00:00:12.090> it's<00:00:12.269> facing<00:00:12.389> in<00:00:13.730> 0<00:00:14.730> seconds<00:00:15.660> yeah<00:00:16.289> so

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
where it's facing in 0 seconds yeah so

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.730 
where it's facing in 0 seconds yeah so
basically<00:00:17.270> how<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.539> works<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.260> need<00:00:19.439> a

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
basically how this works is you need a

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.800 
basically how this works is you need a
for<00:00:20.160> brewing<00:00:20.520> stands<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.060> go<00:00:21.180> 3<00:00:21.420> inch<00:00:21.539> blocks

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
for brewing stands to go 3 inch blocks

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.170 
for brewing stands to go 3 inch blocks
if<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.109> put<00:00:22.289> five<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:23.430> crashes<00:00:23.850> your<00:00:23.970> game

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
if you put five it crashes your game

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.330 
if you put five it crashes your game
because<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.750> go<00:00:24.900> too<00:00:24.960> far<00:00:25.320> too<00:00:25.619> fast<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.220> you

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
because you go too far too fast and you

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.209 
because you go too far too fast and you
just<00:00:26.640> crash<00:00:27.590> yeah<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.160> need<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.550> up

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
just crash yeah so you need this up

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.180 
just crash yeah so you need this up
what's<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:33.020> dispenser<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.200> think<00:00:34.860> it's<00:00:34.980> all<00:00:35.160> I

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
what's I dispenser I think it's all I

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.160 
what's I dispenser I think it's all I
don't<00:00:35.610> know<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.969> then<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.780> need<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.020> put<00:00:37.140> a

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
don't know and then you need to put a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.479 
don't know and then you need to put a
boat<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:38.989> first<00:00:39.989> slot<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.649> believe<00:00:41.309> that's

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
boat in the first slot I believe that's

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.240 
boat in the first slot I believe that's
the<00:00:41.670> first<00:00:41.730> lot<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.329> then<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.110> need<00:00:43.320> three

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
the first lot and then you need three

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.240 
the first lot and then you need three
blocks<00:00:45.149> going<00:00:45.510> up<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.860> redstone

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
blocks going up like this to redstone

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.670 
blocks going up like this to redstone
redstone<00:00:48.000> torch<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.629> fluorescent<00:00:49.320> torture<00:00:49.649> oh

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
redstone torch a fluorescent torture oh

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.860 
redstone torch a fluorescent torture oh
so<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.920> does<00:00:50.129> not<00:00:50.160> work<00:00:50.550> I've<00:00:51.149> tested<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.600> so

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
so it does not work I've tested it so

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.170 
so it does not work I've tested it so
many<00:00:52.050> times<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.620> then<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> little<00:00:53.789> lever<00:00:53.969> to

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
many times and then a little lever to

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.450 
many times and then a little lever to
start<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.590> can<00:00:55.590> also<00:00:55.739> use<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.010> pressure<00:00:56.190> plate

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
start it can also use a pressure plate

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.610 
start it can also use a pressure plate
but<00:00:57.030> i<00:00:57.210> would<00:00:57.539> not<00:00:57.870> recommend<00:00:58.050> using<00:00:58.469> a

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
but i would not recommend using a

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.650 
but i would not recommend using a
pressure<00:00:58.770> plate<00:00:59.039> just<00:00:59.969> because<00:01:00.270> i<00:01:00.390> don't<00:01:00.629> like

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
pressure plate just because i don't like

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.399 
pressure plate just because i don't like
pressure<00:01:00.930> plates<00:01:01.260> are<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.559> pressure<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:03.690> then

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
pressure plates are so pressure and then

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.870 
pressure plates are so pressure and then
this<00:01:04.619> block<00:01:05.159> right<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:06.030> 0<00:01:06.990> 0<00:01:07.409> 0<00:01:07.880> wrong

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
this block right here is 0 0 0 wrong

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.800 
this block right here is 0 0 0 wrong
button<00:01:09.680> which<00:01:10.680> button<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.450> ok<00:01:12.450> there<00:01:12.659> we<00:01:12.750> go

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
see 002 and I could go down two blocks

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.270 
see 002 and I could go down two blocks
to<00:01:16.320> get<00:01:16.500> 20<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.610> yeah<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.270> nice<00:01:19.159> whatever<00:01:20.159> oh

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
you don't break the lever I can use a

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.190 
you don't break the lever I can use a
torch<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.530> basically<00:01:29.070> does<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> same<00:01:29.640> thing

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
torch it basically does the same thing

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.950 
torch it basically does the same thing
ok<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.409> then<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> boto<00:01:31.860> spawn<00:01:32.570> you<00:01:33.570> click<00:01:33.840> on

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
ok and then the boto spawn you click on

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.100 
ok and then the boto spawn you click on
the<00:01:34.110> boat<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.890> push<00:01:35.130> left<00:01:35.369> shift<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.990> yet<00:01:36.990> to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
the boat you push left shift and yet to

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.810 
the boat you push left shift and yet to
be<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.259> creative<00:01:37.590> mode<00:01:37.619> or<00:01:37.979> else<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.520> does<00:01:38.670> not

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
be in creative mode or else it does not

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.969 
be in creative mode or else it does not
work<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.920> you<00:01:40.920> know<00:01:41.240> why<00:01:42.240> would<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.570> not<00:01:42.689> be

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
work and you know why would you not be

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.770 
work and you know why would you not be
why<00:01:43.979> would<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.280> not<00:01:44.430> be<00:01:44.640> engraved<00:01:45.000> mode<00:01:45.270> it's

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
why would you not be engraved mode it's

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.010 
why would you not be engraved mode it's
so<00:01:45.990> much<00:01:46.140> easier<00:01:46.170> than<00:01:46.619> survival<00:01:47.189> mode<00:01:48.020> those

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
so much easier than survival mode those

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.690 
so much easier than survival mode those
people<00:01:49.259> playing<00:01:49.680> some<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.040> don't<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.369> people

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
people playing some I don't like people

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.630 
people playing some I don't like people
play<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.090> problem<00:01:51.630> yeah<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.799> this

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
play this problem yeah so and this

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.100 
play this problem yeah so and this
glitch<00:01:53.880> only<00:01:54.119> works<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.630> creative<00:01:55.079> mode

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
glitch only works in creative mode

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.139 
glitch only works in creative mode
sassing<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.280> get<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.729> front<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.030> the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
sassing and you get on the front of the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.230 
sassing and you get on the front of the
boat<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:58.100> it'll<00:01:59.100> start<00:01:59.490> like<00:01:59.700> glitching<00:02:00.090> out

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
boat and it'll start like glitching out
