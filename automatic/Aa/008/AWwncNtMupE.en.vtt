00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.810 
some good fights out on the circuit and
then<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.200> was<00:01:07.290> lured<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.950> myself<00:01:08.159> riding<00:01:08.670> out

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
then it was lured to myself riding out

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.410

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
and it was very heated that little

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.010 
and it was very heated that little
battle<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.400> good<00:01:14.549> front<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:14.970> came<00:01:15.810> away

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
battle of a good front and came away

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.510 
with second Lewis won the race I won to
which<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.049> very<00:01:19.470> difficult<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.250> in

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
which it's it's very difficult to do in

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.160 
which it's it's very difficult to do in

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
down Lewis Capitol laps to go I thought

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.340

I<00:01:57.119> could<00:01:57.329> catch<00:01:57.479> him<00:01:57.719> but<00:01:57.869> then<00:01:57.990> he<00:01:58.079> just

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
I could catch him but then he just

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.350 
I could catch him but then he just
kicked<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.329> kept<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.390> wind<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:02.240> 2011

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.720 
that car around a circuit that I loved
Spa<00:03:34.870> was<00:03:35.470> probably<00:03:36.280> one<00:03:36.430> of<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.549> most

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
Spa was probably one of the most

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.789 
Spa was probably one of the most
dominant<00:03:37.090> weekends<00:03:37.480> have<00:03:37.600> had<00:03:37.810> or<00:03:38.500> probably

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
dominant weekends have had or probably

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.349

the most dominant weekend have had here

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.360 
the most dominant weekend have had here

at McLaren that qualifying lap is one

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.860 
at McLaren that qualifying lap is one
