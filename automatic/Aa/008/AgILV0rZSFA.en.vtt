00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.879
 Hello takes ah today's tip 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:09.980
 What a cold, but do not know if those who are beginners like our favorite yesterday 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:15.019
 In order to take a picture for it 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:18.020
 Now I'll tell them to pick cotton when one word Tee Fight team fight the 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:22.340
 No, I do not have a current team and I do not have time to sue. 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:26.000
 In the case of a dyer, 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:30.230
 Now, in the case of a radiant , 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.590
 Before we die, if we win against the rider on this side, 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.490
 Because kids can ride kill fly Four came up frequently this 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.410
 It sleeps. 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:43.220
 So that's one kind of drill litter Ghana so there is logging your rabbit 3 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.710
 There's a road here. There's a road here. 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:50.510
 I've got it right . 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:57.050
 Go jjilttae yolro therefore do not fit to the bath 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:59.330
 Here the passage jjareugo of wood attached to the left itguyo second number in this way 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.040
 Here's the one here too. 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:09.380
 I'll get it here. Then it's connected again here . 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:13.940
 So, how do you look at the Korean version of the bee pack of b6 in the form of a metaphor 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.260
 There is a bub on the left, a corner on the left, and a 9th floor on the left. 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.500
 I did. 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.760
 Like this 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.700
 If you look at both sides of the ceremony, you are often sick 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:29.380
 And I will tell you another one. 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.659
 There 's a road here. 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.200
 So there's a spot here 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:40.720
 If you cut it with a tree, it would be that way. 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:43.180
 So itgoyo 3rd trees can be really dangerous when one cut him 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.150
 Then here too there is one length, 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:52.270
 There's a road, but it's blocked. 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:54.460
 So I came to this place and now I can count and I have many 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.570
 It's a waterway to a man's bath. 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:01.780
 After that, there are 2 groups 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:05.289
 Down here down here. 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:09.420
 Yes, because it's stuck here, but you can stomach it . 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:15.580
 The above can be cut when the tree'm so so left again 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:20.110
 I'll be right, but I can pull it up to the left. 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:23.769
 I'll just have to see you now and then I'll know. 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:28.060
 This depends on the case of a radiant g 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.690
 It's just a case of Dyer . 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.400
 I have. 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:36.460
 Here, too, is the same here and here. 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:41.160
 In fact, try to explore once again advance 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.160
 Yes, that would help a lot.
