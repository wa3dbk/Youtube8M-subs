and if I like it and stuff so my first

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:36.600 
and if I like it and stuff so my first
impressions<00:00:35.559> of<00:00:35.710> this<00:00:35.860> game<00:00:36.100> you're<00:00:36.400> playing

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
impressions of this game you're playing

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.570 
impressions of this game you're playing
TDM<00:00:37.000> only<00:00:37.269> I<00:00:37.449> think<00:00:38.230> it's<00:00:38.710> definitely<00:00:39.190> way

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
TDM only I think it's definitely way

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.610 
TDM only I think it's definitely way
outside<00:00:40.210> of<00:00:40.269> the<00:00:40.390> norm<00:00:40.750> for<00:00:40.839> Call<00:00:41.199> of<00:00:41.230> Duty<00:00:41.470> I

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
outside of the norm for Call of Duty I

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.470 
outside of the norm for Call of Duty I
think<00:00:42.010> it's<00:00:42.129> definitely<00:00:42.250> different<00:00:42.580> I<00:00:42.940> think

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
think it's definitely different I think

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.150 
think it's definitely different I think
there's<00:00:43.690> a<00:00:43.840> lot<00:00:44.350> of<00:00:44.469> different<00:00:44.739> variables

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
there's a lot of different variables

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.290 
there's a lot of different variables
that<00:00:45.250> people<00:00:45.520> are<00:00:45.579> gonna<00:00:45.670> have<00:00:45.879> to<00:00:46.000> adapt<00:00:46.270> to

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
that people are gonna have to adapt to

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.869 
that people are gonna have to adapt to
and<00:00:46.750> I<00:00:47.620> don't<00:00:47.680> know<00:00:48.100> how<00:00:48.250> well<00:00:48.460> it'll<00:00:48.610> be<00:00:48.730> for

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
and I don't know how well it'll be for

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.160 
and I don't know how well it'll be for
competitive<00:00:49.270> but<00:00:49.449> I<00:00:49.480> think<00:00:49.660> it<00:00:49.750> could<00:00:49.870> be<00:00:49.899> sick

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
competitive but I think it could be sick

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.779 
competitive but I think it could be sick
you<00:00:50.350> know<00:00:50.440> um<00:00:50.649> I<00:00:50.949> don't<00:00:51.190> know<00:00:51.370> if<00:00:51.460> the<00:00:51.550> skill

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
you know um I don't know if the skill

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:53.790 
you know um I don't know if the skill
gap<00:00:51.820> will<00:00:52.180> be<00:00:52.300> as<00:00:52.600> high<00:00:53.230> as<00:00:53.260> everyone<00:00:53.680> is

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
gap will be as high as everyone is

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.529 
gap will be as high as everyone is
saying<00:00:54.039> I'm<00:00:54.520> not<00:00:54.670> saying<00:00:54.910> that<00:00:54.969> the<00:00:55.180> game<00:00:55.360> is

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
saying I'm not saying that the game is

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.630 
saying I'm not saying that the game is
easy<00:00:55.660> however<00:00:56.050> I<00:00:56.320> don't<00:00:56.829> think<00:00:57.160> the<00:00:57.250> skill<00:00:57.489> gap

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
easy however I don't think the skill gap

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.549 
easy however I don't think the skill gap
will<00:00:57.850> be<00:00:57.879> as<00:00:58.180> high<00:00:58.780> as<00:00:58.809> people<00:00:59.170> say<00:00:59.260> because

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
will be as high as people say because

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:00.869 
will be as high as people say because
some<00:00:59.770> of<00:00:59.800> the<00:00:59.920> variables<00:01:00.340> in<00:01:00.430> it<00:01:00.550> like<00:01:00.699> the

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
some of the variables in it like the

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.410 
some of the variables in it like the
strafe<00:01:01.210> and<00:01:01.390> um<00:01:01.629> like<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.170> strafe<00:01:02.440> through

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
strafe and um like the strafe through

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.550 
strafe and um like the strafe through
using<00:01:04.420> like<00:01:04.629> your<00:01:04.750> jetpack<00:01:04.960> you<00:01:05.259> know<00:01:05.350> aids

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
using like your jetpack you know aids

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.920 
using like your jetpack you know aids
it's<00:01:05.920> just<00:01:06.160> kind<00:01:06.490> of<00:01:06.520> crazy<00:01:06.759> and<00:01:07.030> things<00:01:07.780> like

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930

like thus the stealth and the jetpack

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.990

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
stuff just like titanfall the head

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.740 
stuff just like titanfall the head
glitches<00:01:39.520> in<00:01:39.640> this<00:01:39.729> are<00:01:39.880> gonna<00:01:40.030> be<00:01:40.180> huge<00:01:40.360> but<00:01:40.720> I

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
glitches in this are gonna be huge but I

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.789 
glitches in this are gonna be huge but I
guess<00:01:40.930> it's<00:01:41.079> called<00:01:41.229> Judi<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:41.619> the<00:01:41.680> head

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
guess it's called Judi and the head

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.560 
guess it's called Judi and the head
glitches<00:01:42.070> are<00:01:42.189> always<00:01:42.430> huge<00:01:42.610> but<00:01:43.210> I<00:01:43.270> think<00:01:43.479> in

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
glitches are always huge but I think in

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.760 
glitches are always huge but I think in
this<00:01:43.689> game<00:01:43.750> they're<00:01:44.110> bringing<00:01:44.380> back<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.619> head

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
this game they're bringing back the head

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.280 
this game they're bringing back the head
glitches<00:01:45.130> for<00:01:45.759> sure<00:01:46.000> because<00:01:46.270> from<00:01:47.110> what<00:01:47.259> I

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
glitches for sure because from what I

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.920 
glitches for sure because from what I
played<00:01:47.649> on<00:01:47.680> it<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:49.299> could<00:01:49.420> head<00:01:49.600> glitch<00:01:49.780> so

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
played on it you could head glitch so

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.060 
played on it you could head glitch so
much<00:01:50.049> stuff<00:01:50.200> as<00:01:50.320> you<00:01:50.409> notice<00:01:50.680> here<00:01:50.710> actually

much stuff as you notice here actually

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.710 
much stuff as you notice here actually

behind the head glitch that's huge so
yeah<00:02:01.270> but<00:02:01.420> some<00:02:01.630> of<00:02:01.719> the<00:02:01.810> things<00:02:01.840> like<00:02:02.140> that

I'm<00:02:35.770> using<00:02:35.920> in<00:02:36.100> this<00:02:36.190> gameplay<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.850> I<00:02:37.780> really

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
I'm using in this gameplay and I really

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.440 
I'm using in this gameplay and I really
didn't<00:02:38.890> touch<00:02:39.040> any<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.280> my<00:02:39.340> my<00:02:39.910> perks<00:02:40.210> or

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
didn't touch any of my my perks or

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.910 
didn't touch any of my my perks or
attachments<00:02:40.870> or<00:02:40.930> anything<00:02:41.110> I<00:02:41.320> like<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.770> get<00:02:41.890> a

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
attachments or anything I like to get a

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.530 
attachments or anything I like to get a
feel<00:02:42.100> for<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.370> game<00:02:42.490> and<00:02:42.760> just<00:02:42.850> how<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.150> is<00:02:43.210> so

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
feel for the game and just how it is so

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.270 
feel for the game and just how it is so
another<00:02:44.290> thing<00:02:44.500> that<00:02:44.650> I<00:02:44.680> wanted<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.010> touch<00:02:45.100> on

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
another thing that I wanted to touch on

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.280 
another thing that I wanted to touch on
is<00:02:45.340> in<00:02:46.210> case<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.510> didn't<00:02:46.810> know<00:02:46.930> about<00:02:47.080> this

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
is in case you didn't know about this

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.450 
is in case you didn't know about this
game<00:02:47.500> I<00:02:48.090> really<00:02:49.090> think<00:02:49.360> that<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:50.460> competitive

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
game I really think that the competitive

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.010 
game I really think that the competitive
side<00:02:51.640> of<00:02:51.790> things<00:02:52.000> with<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.480> new<00:02:52.600> game<00:02:52.810> types

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
side of things with the new game types

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.960 
side of things with the new game types
no<00:02:53.260> matter<00:02:53.410> what<00:02:53.650> what<00:02:53.830> they<00:02:53.950> choose<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:54.520> think

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
no matter what what they choose I think

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
no matter what what they choose I think
that's<00:02:55.090> gonna<00:02:55.240> be<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.390> craziest<00:02:55.570> thing

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
that's gonna be the craziest thing

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.330 
that's gonna be the craziest thing
because<00:02:56.020> ultimately<00:02:56.440> it<00:02:56.770> always<00:02:56.890> comes<00:02:57.160> down

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
because ultimately it always comes down

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.100 
because ultimately it always comes down
to<00:02:57.460> the<00:02:57.520> game<00:02:57.670> types<00:02:57.940> anyway<00:02:58.270> you<00:02:58.330> know<00:02:58.510> search

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
to the game types anyway you know search

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.720 
to the game types anyway you know search
is<00:02:59.290> always<00:02:59.470> gonna<00:02:59.590> be<00:02:59.650> searched<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.220> so

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
is always gonna be searched and so

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.890 
is always gonna be searched and so
obviously<00:03:00.940> comes<00:03:01.150> down<00:03:01.270> to<00:03:01.360> your<00:03:01.450> coordinated

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
obviously comes down to your coordinated

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.020 
obviously comes down to your coordinated
rush<00:03:02.080> around<00:03:02.350> your<00:03:02.530> strats<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.070> ultimately

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
rush around your strats and ultimately

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.610 
rush around your strats and ultimately
just<00:03:04.270> being<00:03:04.480> a<00:03:04.780> smart<00:03:05.050> player<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.470> so<00:03:05.560> to

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
just being a smart player and so to

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.980 
just being a smart player and so to
destroy<00:03:05.950> CTF<00:03:06.940> is<00:03:07.060> gonna<00:03:07.240> come<00:03:07.420> down<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.600> strong

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
destroy CTF is gonna come down to strong

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.580 
destroy CTF is gonna come down to strong
cut-offs

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
cut-offs

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.430 
cut-offs
I<00:03:08.680> think<00:03:08.950> CTF<00:03:09.370> is<00:03:09.490> gonna<00:03:09.670> be<00:03:09.790> a<00:03:09.820> huge<00:03:10.440> addition

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
I think CTF is gonna be a huge addition

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.700 
I think CTF is gonna be a huge addition
to<00:03:11.530> this<00:03:11.650> game<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.960> CTF<00:03:13.960> is<00:03:14.020> always<00:03:14.320> crazy<00:03:14.530> you

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
to this game and CTF is always crazy you

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.660 
to this game and CTF is always crazy you
know<00:03:14.800> you're<00:03:14.920> either<00:03:14.980> gonna<00:03:15.190> get<00:03:15.400> beat<00:03:15.520> by<00:03:15.640> a

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
know you're either gonna get beat by a

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.910 
know you're either gonna get beat by a
lot<00:03:15.940> or<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.900> know<00:03:17.020> you're<00:03:17.350> gonna<00:03:17.440> camp<00:03:17.710> out<00:03:17.860> I

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
lot or you know you're gonna camp out I

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.320 
lot or you know you're gonna camp out I
remember<00:03:18.160> in<00:03:18.400> black<00:03:18.610> ops<00:03:18.850> a<00:03:18.970> lot<00:03:19.090> of<00:03:19.180> people

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
remember in black ops a lot of people

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.830 
remember in black ops a lot of people
would<00:03:19.450> give<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:20.590> team<00:03:20.770> obey<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.580> lot<00:03:22.540> of<00:03:22.660> crap

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
would give the team obey a lot of crap

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.110 
would give the team obey a lot of crap
because<00:03:23.020> they<00:03:23.320> would<00:03:23.440> always<00:03:23.560> camp<00:03:23.970> maybe<00:03:24.970> not

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
because they would always camp maybe not

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.270 
because they would always camp maybe not
camp<00:03:25.390> I<00:03:25.540> guess<00:03:26.140> they<00:03:26.290> would<00:03:26.410> cambia<00:03:26.800> it<00:03:27.190> was

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
camp I guess they would cambia it was

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.500 
camp I guess they would cambia it was
more<00:03:27.490> of<00:03:27.580> like<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.730> defensive<00:03:28.150> camping

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
more of like a defensive camping

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.180 
more of like a defensive camping
strategy<00:03:28.900> but<00:03:28.990> it<00:03:29.110> works<00:03:29.260> for<00:03:29.410> them<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.680> they

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
strategy but it works for them and they

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.410 
strategy but it works for them and they
if<00:03:30.310> they<00:03:30.430> people<00:03:30.730> think<00:03:30.940> that's<00:03:31.090> gonna<00:03:31.300> go

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
if they people think that's gonna go

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.550 
if they people think that's gonna go
away<00:03:31.540> then<00:03:31.810> they're<00:03:31.930> gonna<00:03:32.020> be<00:03:32.170> completely

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
away then they're gonna be completely

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.979 
away then they're gonna be completely
wrong<00:03:32.830> with<00:03:33.040> that<00:03:33.160> so<00:03:33.510> but<00:03:34.510> in<00:03:34.630> terms<00:03:34.840> of
