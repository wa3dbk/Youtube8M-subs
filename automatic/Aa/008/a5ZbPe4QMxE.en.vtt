okay<00:00:01.560> hi<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.360> small<00:00:03.360> video<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.830> share<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:05.069> basic

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
okay hi a small video to share the basic

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.580 
okay hi a small video to share the basic
workings<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.440> 4046<00:00:09.080> you<00:00:10.080> can<00:00:10.290> see<00:00:10.469> the

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
workings of the 4046 you can see the

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.450 
workings of the 4046 you can see the
forums<00:00:10.980> for<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.340> PDF<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.719> schematics

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
forums for a PDF of the schematics

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.070 
forums for a PDF of the schematics
basically<00:00:14.460> it's<00:00:15.240> no<00:00:15.480> more<00:00:15.690> than<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:16.279> 555<00:00:17.279> timer

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
basically it's no more than a 555 timer

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:27.320 
basically it's no more than a 555 timer
the<00:00:19.310> 4046<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:21.500> 4001<00:00:23.840> logic<00:00:24.840> i<00:00:25.109> see<00:00:26.330> currently

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
the 4046 and 4001 logic i see currently

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:40.000 
the 4046 and 4001 logic i see currently
I<00:00:27.660> have<00:00:31.279> no<00:00:32.279> log<00:00:33.559> yellow<00:00:35.120> over<00:00:36.120> here<00:00:36.350> is<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.049 

4046<00:00:41.010> output<00:00:41.690> it<00:00:42.690> currently<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.379> at<00:00:44.059> 2.5

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
4046 output it currently is at 2.5

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.190 
4046 output it currently is at 2.5
kilowatts<00:00:45.770> and<00:00:47.360> that's<00:00:48.360> because<00:00:48.719> there's<00:00:48.989> a

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
kilowatts and that's because there's a

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.709 
kilowatts and that's because there's a
10<00:00:50.719> nano<00:00:51.719> farad<00:00:53.329> capacitor<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.410> limits<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
10 nano farad capacitor so it limits the

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.000 
10 nano farad capacitor so it limits the
VCO<00:00:57.719> scanning<00:00:58.559> range<00:00:59.570> if<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.750> now<00:01:00.930> below<00:01:01.649> in

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
VCO scanning range if I now below in

blue<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.090> see<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:04.159> 505<00:01:05.159> I'll<00:01:05.400> put<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:06.600> right

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
blue you see the 505 I'll put it right

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.850 
blue you see the 505 I'll put it right
now<00:01:07.939> lower<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:11.280> 5x5<00:01:11.549> output<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:13.290> see<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.740> it

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
now lower the 5x5 output you see that it

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.170 
now lower the 5x5 output you see that it
gets<00:01:14.130> exactly<00:01:14.909> at<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> point<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:16.439> about<00:01:17.180> 2.5

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
gets exactly at a point of about 2.5

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.140 
gets exactly at a point of about 2.5
kilohertz<00:01:19.610> where<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.729> VCO<00:01:21.150> will<00:01:21.659> pick<00:01:21.900> up<00:01:22.110> and

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
kilohertz where the VCO will pick up and

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.050 
kilohertz where the VCO will pick up and
stay<00:01:24.229> locked<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.890> signal<00:01:26.369> all<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.790> way

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
stay locked in to the signal all the way

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.700 
stay locked in to the signal all the way
down<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:28.590> its<00:01:28.619> minimum

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.960 

and<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.010> put<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.460> up<00:01:32.670> again<00:01:35.000> CCO<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.060> up<00:01:36.680> blue

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
and you put it up again CCO is up blue

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.880 
and you put it up again CCO is up blue
below<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.480> 555<00:01:40.850> it<00:01:41.850> pass<00:01:42.390> us<00:01:42.500> about<00:01:43.500> two

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
below is the 555 it pass us about two

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.860 
below is the 555 it pass us about two
and<00:01:43.980> a<00:01:44.040> half<00:01:44.070> kilowatts<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:46.590> CCL<00:01:47.070> will<00:01:47.870> let

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
and a half kilowatts the CCL will let

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.800 
and a half kilowatts the CCL will let
loose<00:01:49.080> and<00:01:49.410> you<00:01:50.010> see<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.460> 505<00:01:51.060> continue<00:01:51.660> to

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
loose and you see the 505 continue to

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.520 
loose and you see the 505 continue to
rise<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.350> there's<00:01:53.160> no<00:01:53.310> locking<00:01:53.550> anymore<00:01:54.500> okay

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
rise but there's no locking anymore okay

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.790 
rise but there's no locking anymore okay
I<00:01:55.860> do<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.030> same<00:01:57.270> here<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.780> can<00:01:58.290> see<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.680> in

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
I do the same here you can see that in

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.370 
I do the same here you can see that in
the<00:01:59.010> let<00:01:59.510> currently<00:02:00.510> it's<00:02:00.960> locked<00:02:01.260> in<00:02:03.229> all<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the let currently it's locked in all the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.540 
the let currently it's locked in all the
way<00:02:04.500> down<00:02:06.290> we<00:02:07.290> start<00:02:07.560> moving<00:02:07.710> up<00:02:08.209> up<00:02:09.209> up<00:02:10.550> and

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
way down we start moving up up up and

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.880 
way down we start moving up up up and
there<00:02:11.850> it<00:02:11.940> goes<00:02:11.970> off<00:02:12.420> because<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.470> lost<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
there it goes off because it lost the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.910 
there it goes off because it lost the
lock

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.199 

so<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.569> basic<00:02:21.960> working<00:02:22.140> up<00:02:22.950> until

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
so this is the basic working up until

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.699 
so this is the basic working up until
two<00:02:24.209> point<00:02:24.480> five<00:02:25.069> kilowatts<00:02:26.069> because<00:02:26.819> of<00:02:27.709> this

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
two point five kilowatts because of this

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.470 
two point five kilowatts because of this
capacitor<00:02:30.500> okay<00:02:31.790> now<00:02:32.790> we're<00:02:32.970> going<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.240> change

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
capacitor okay now we're going to change

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.210 
capacitor okay now we're going to change
the<00:02:33.630> capacitor<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.380> increase<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.340> range<00:02:37.220> so

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
the capacitor and increase the range so

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.449 
the capacitor and increase the range so
now<00:02:38.730> I've<00:02:39.320> interchanged<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.680> capacitor<00:02:41.220> for

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
now I've interchanged the capacitor for

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.810 
now I've interchanged the capacitor for
a<00:02:41.730> lower<00:02:42.060> value<00:02:42.570> from<00:02:42.840> 10<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.200> efforts<00:02:43.740> to<00:02:43.890> 2.2

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
a lower value from 10 and efforts to 2.2

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.000 
a lower value from 10 and efforts to 2.2
nano<00:02:45.060> farad<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.690> we<00:02:46.260> will<00:02:46.410> see<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.709> the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
nano farad and we will see that the

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.970 
nano farad and we will see that the
scanning<00:02:47.340> range<00:02:47.640> increased<00:02:48.300> from<00:02:49.290> two<00:02:49.739> point

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
scanning range increased from two point

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.440 
scanning range increased from two point
five<00:02:50.220> kilo<00:02:50.489> Hertz<00:02:50.760> all<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.900> way<00:02:52.050> up<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.739> about

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
five kilo Hertz all the way up to about

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.810 
five kilo Hertz all the way up to about
12<00:02:54.450> kilowatts<00:02:55.340> okay<00:02:56.989> you<00:02:57.989> can<00:02:58.140> see<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.820> signal

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
12 kilowatts okay you can see the signal

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.979 
12 kilowatts okay you can see the signal
again<00:03:00.170> it<00:03:01.170> has<00:03:01.320> a<00:03:01.380> lock-in<00:03:02.239> and<00:03:03.239> if<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.510> continue

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
again it has a lock-in and if I continue

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:10.030 
again it has a lock-in and if I continue
to<00:03:04.910> rise<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.239> frequency<00:03:07.610> you<00:03:08.610> can<00:03:08.820> see<00:03:09.030> that

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
to rise the frequency you can see that

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.729 
to rise the frequency you can see that
yellow<00:03:11.040> stays<00:03:11.400> in<00:03:11.640> sync<00:03:12.080> your<00:03:13.080> right<00:03:13.290> hand<00:03:13.590> you

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
yellow stays in sync your right hand you

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.640 
yellow stays in sync your right hand you
see<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.010> frequency<00:03:14.550> one<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.780> yellow<00:03:16.200> two<00:03:16.260> is

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
see the frequency one is yellow two is

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.350 
see the frequency one is yellow two is
blue<00:03:17.239> one<00:03:18.239> is<00:03:18.390> VCO<00:03:18.840> 2<00:03:19.230> is<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.130> timer<00:03:20.430> if<00:03:21.269> I

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
blue one is VCO 2 is the timer if I

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.130 
blue one is VCO 2 is the timer if I
continue<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.080> timer<00:03:22.820> one<00:03:23.820> stays<00:03:24.180> at<00:03:24.959> the

maximum of about 12 kilowatts and I can

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.050 
maximum of about 12 kilowatts and I can
still<00:03:31.560> increase<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.070> timer<00:03:32.340> all<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.790> way<00:03:32.910> up

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
still increase the timer all the way up

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.890 
still increase the timer all the way up
to<00:03:33.239> about<00:03:36.350> 25<00:03:37.400> kilowatts<00:03:38.400> but<00:03:38.670> it's<00:03:38.820> it<00:03:39.690> just

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
to about 25 kilowatts but it's it just

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.340 
to about 25 kilowatts but it's it just
stays<00:03:40.280> unlocked<00:03:41.390> did<00:03:42.390> I<00:03:42.480> bring<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.810> down<00:03:42.840> again

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
stays unlocked did I bring it down again

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.630 
stays unlocked did I bring it down again
it<00:03:43.620> will<00:03:43.769> pick<00:03:44.190> up<00:03:44.220> again<00:03:45.950> it<00:03:46.950> around<00:03:47.310> 12

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
it will pick up again it around 12

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.910 
it will pick up again it around 12
kilowatts<00:03:48.150> as<00:03:48.870> we'll<00:03:49.079> continue<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.620> follow<00:03:49.829> it

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
kilowatts as we'll continue to follow it

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
kilowatts as we'll continue to follow it
so<00:03:53.450> now<00:03:54.450> we<00:03:54.510> have<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:55.290> VCO<00:03:55.860> that<00:03:56.130> locks<00:03:56.370> in<00:03:56.610> from

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
so now we have a VCO that locks in from

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.680 
so now we have a VCO that locks in from
about<00:03:57.500> three<00:03:58.500> hundred<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.860> sixty<00:03:59.690> seventy
