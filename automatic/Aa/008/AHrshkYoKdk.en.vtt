00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
 some people think that someday 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.710
 or the other I will get tired of games 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.660
 video me I do not think so because I play 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.580
 at the game I want to play among the whole 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.000
 collection and especially I play to my 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.000
 pace 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.779
 new little intro indeed 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.099
 to start I'm really sorry 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.750
 not to have released so many videos 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.070
 than banks as usual because 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.539
 that I had not received in May a 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.880
 new loupiotes but I finally have them 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.410
 received after a week of the order and 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.149
 abada as you can see the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.590
 video quality compared to h 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.219
 last week's weeklong it's the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.200
 day and night 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.149
 indeed to go look I bought 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.559
 two days supris a reserve 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.649
 look at the size of the ampoulé you the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.940
 just show curiosity 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.649
 they will cost would have 30 euros 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.539
 each the bulbs but I can you 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.100
 to say that it is clear but I force it 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.510
 the assam would write because the whole leg 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.870
 look at the size of their chickens 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.430
 cows indeed but it is worth its price 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.440
 and I can tell you that when you 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.270
 use a light bulb but one of this 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.129
 power this bridge to videos and beats 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.600
 direct we see the difference in quality 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.909
 which is mostly in high schools and video 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.210
 it's the light source and so at 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.659
 final we will compare with and without this 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.700
 light 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.140
 with this purchase this episode h weekly and 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.580
 water releases in the week 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.240
 last and you can see everything from 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.720
 following the difference 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.159
 so we will continue with what is it 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.250
 that I can advise you in small 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.049
 old video video that I had done good 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.540
 to be opposed to the council a rotten 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.100
 good video game ben I had an idea 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.630
 crazy crazy crazy 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.520
 at that time when I had when I 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.820
 do this video down watch the video 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.460
 ie in 15 seconds and you me 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.590
 give your opinion and the person 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.899
 example billy it's little collar and and 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.570
 finally get it back then for the purchases 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.369
 this week I really do not throw 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.720
 great thing bah it must be said that there is in 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.520

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.640

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.119
 Sunday I do not really want to get up 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.530
 the buttocks 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.420
 it's so cold so well 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.340
 in the piles that I have trouble getting up 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.899
 at 7am to go for scholarships 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.300
 to the toys is obvious big unibail in 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.060
 support is too cold but 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.690
 so I'm raging but I'm happy 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.670
 used shops clearance sale store 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.890
 professionals finally specialized I want 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.900
 say and we'll start with 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.540
 the purchases I made to us 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.180
 exactly every week during the 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.250
 head of at first I will you 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.750
 will show the purchases I made in 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.980
 east in the store noz at near home 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.340
 me ie the us in bourgoin 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.800
 jallieu 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.510
 because I'm a store of 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.980
 destocking and they never warn 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.930
 if they have video games or not because 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.270
 that it's frankly a fucking group 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.770
 brothel their stores but when he 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.990
 sells video games we can find some 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.790
 super price so then this week in 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.730
 this moment you can find in your 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.540
 note then the older michael jackson 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.650
 experience I him to me 50 so 0.50 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.570
 or the bestiary is completely rotten 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.920
 what in the store I had it 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.210
 open j -pd 1 it's not the blister 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.160
 official is it amon I 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.950
 disapproves of keeping them and there is in 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.170
 so in the end I will look and I will 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.330
 paid 0.50 also minus 50 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.060
 the michael jackson are ps3 in blister 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.320
 to two euros fifty good so 52 months 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.760
 5 euros 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.430
 I think it's the most 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.980
 interesting I saw specials like 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.230
 velocity under official blister for 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.520
 this euro so this kind of dirty 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.920
 but I preferred is one of the best 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.959
 race players of the ps3 generation 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.970
 360 I recommend you to everyone but it's 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.370
 a bomb this game is the case of diane 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.820
 is so explosive 7 euros more 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.080
 it's really an excellent price and 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.220
 how much video game but that's 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.200
 not really a video game it's rather 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.540
 a book about video games I found 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.670
 that moment in one in the radius abuja 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.080
 retracing the art of the twentieth century the 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.720
 video game but it's mostly the price that 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.239
 beat who scored me for 2 euros a 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.280
 book of this thickness I went I 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.810
 I'll go take it 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.980
 city ​​shows how to what 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.850
 looks like I'll tell you a goal 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.230
 four games 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:04:00.350
 euros really not it's a gift it's 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.990
 gift then we continue with ba the only 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.090
 vip trick by the games I bought at 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.620
 we are a game but not just 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.190

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.790
 maybe I was a little bit 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.190

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.840

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.340
 but nickel I am very happy to 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.870
 having taken it I put a little bit a 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.700
 little money in there to see it 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.420
 but frankly it's a very beautiful 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.740
 piece of collection 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.840

 I got back on the guitar hero 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.400
 rock band and precisely I noticed that 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.080
 on the ps3 I have a guitar so I 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.760

 second in case so I bought 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.150

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.460
 look at the state already have to listen to the 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.870
