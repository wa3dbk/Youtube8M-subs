00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.260
 hello after this wm was very gay 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.240
 Welcome there is my little one 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.310
 shake up a nice gameplay 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.160
 that was my first round at the clear 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.180
 but I have to say what went with it market 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.340
 I can not do that to this day 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.990
 explain things really fat 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.170
 almost always demolished and then unfortunately 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.369
 but not just yourself and 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.020
 that's why I have that after that 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.380
 small gameplay times to a small one 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.210
 commentary and every commentary he almost 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.950
 there is always a theme that's why 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.250
 again a topic and the topic 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.170
 today is avandia are around 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.420
 I do not know how many people this 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.670
 Know syndrome and how many people 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.680
 Ever know avandia back to 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.710
 Labbadia you have your city at 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.170
 pokémon red and green so the first 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.250
 pokémon issues this issue 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.780
 in february 1996 first appeared in 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.900
 Japan and in this long city 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:13.619
 there is like in every city in pokémon 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.270
 a t my music any sounds old 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.790
 and we store as a ghost town 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.430
 coast know and the pitfalls 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.960
 where this tune has made you have to 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.210
 has to be a little bit sick on everyone 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.680
 case thought yes ghost town make 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.720
 bit of skin protects music in and out 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.670
 Anyway, this is this music 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.119
 which you did then something like that 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.579
 I'm sick of the children that music 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.320
 have committed himself started 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.260
 to have 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.570
 and I would first think of that 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.070
 make this music as a manufacturer 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.570
 was going on with me, that's me, that's me 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.950
 a myth is not occupied by 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.850
 somehow a newspaper article about something 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.320
 is just a myth 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.560
 you do not have to believe everything in the world 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.869
 Internet is just as incidentally but in 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.090
 This music is so extremely high here 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.540
 and low frequencies in it 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.810
 these infants so 11 to 14 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.410
 just suicide 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:16.020
 have driven 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.070
 and yes he fucks right but 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.060
 we do not have to believe everything like that 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.890
 but still, introduce yourself 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.050
 You 're sitting in a room for eleven years 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.970
 old play pokémon could this 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.090
 lahmann decreed the city and up 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.000
 once comes this music and think so 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.940
 old because I would really really 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.670
 you shit it's just so so the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.870
 music is really not being 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.970
 later also accustomed to video 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.470
 come in but then say 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.040
 I again so must the music rights 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.750
 our back to la mancha are around 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.480
 you can see how much influence again 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.100
 simply has music on people says 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.600
 any disabled frequencies that 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.090
 brain to get something like that 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.560
 the station is just there 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.989
 you really just how much influence 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.980
 has music and is really really sick 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.840
 if you think so 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.159
 these programmers of the game have it 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.860
 also seen that relatively quickly 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.450
 something lazy these were at this 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.670
 that 's why she got labbadia 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.140
 thought if you hear this shit 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.360
 before something worse happens and 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.420
 what mass extermination by pokemon 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.209
 or so and then they have that shit 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.950
 censored and licensed version is 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.410
 this is the steam version that still exists 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.280
 because these are really tough 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.409
 very first music without this censored 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.569
 shit it no longer exists which is 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:36.459
 just gone so I can not you 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:41.180
 show only the censored version though 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:44.180
 this also really sick and yes 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.469
 and my comparison to pokémon heartgold 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.670
 and soulsilver any new ones 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:52.760
 editions and there was also labbadia 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.090
 and there they have the music like that 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.090
 made 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.240
 yes, really scary me 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.450
 not really but we like that 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:46.580
 somehow even with children and now 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:52.170
 last but not least to this pokémon 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:53.990
 theme of red and green the games me 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.310
 now here at the end one more time 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.550
 and you really do not have to change it 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.960
 wanted so does he necessarily when 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.440
 you really wanted to is really right 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.240
 sickly divorce but if it is not 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.340
 on the easy shoulder times better 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.080
 because I do not know how far away 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.820
 should somehow be influenced because friends 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.180
 I also have a head head 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.520
 get and well, so technically 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.080
 listen to others at your own risk and 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.000
 three people 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.400
 I really like it if yes 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.350
 Thumbs up the comments what 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.680
 So you know about the country of your syndrome 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:31.010
 how it finds and if there are any on 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.150
 because the choice is in truth behind it 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.850
 let me know that and go inside 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:40.100
 today and do and there are still these little ones 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.100
 avandia theme a lot of fun 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.740
 hey
