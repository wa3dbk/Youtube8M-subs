00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.350
 hence it will try again 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.760
 rather I would have to try for too long until they create legal 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.129
 Bockhoff wants this opportunity 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:12.129
 and the chances are bad 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.179
 too little 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.230
 I'm good at that 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.080
 that was not there that was not working at all 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.420
 not nearly 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.420
 At least BlueMotion is supposed to be using the Burns block 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.320
 No 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.320
 this is natural 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.830
 what do I do after this picture below 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.830
 that could be what will be drawn 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.830
 with concentration 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 if you have these values 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.940
 be better promoted 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.630
 could have been 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.140
 in the middle of the cash flow save if you are not sure 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.469
 that's more than that 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:14.469
 in the hour 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:18.269
 and that proves what they can do 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.499
 I did not want to believe that 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.499
 okay that me 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:26.409
 Thats still alright 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.669
 added is who goes 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.669
 I doubt it 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:38.789
 Michael Phelps was content 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:42.649
 in the spider web does that anything we are not so good at 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.069
 only occasionally 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.719
 put under pressure 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.359
 4 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.169
 4 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:09.949
 more 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.949
 in the net because itself 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:26.619
 so easy it was not that implausible 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.689
 Jer 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.989
 with the now luckier than mind and that done well no matter 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.500
 St 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.189
 No, I think so too 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.189
 Vienna pm Lingen 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.779
 and 9 

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:25.710
 the blame for yourself 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.050
 no longer bothered 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.880
