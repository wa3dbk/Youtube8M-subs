hi<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:00.840> is<00:00:01.110> Prussia<00:00:01.469> Walker<00:00:01.860> in<00:00:02.129> this<00:00:02.850> video

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
hi this is Prussia Walker in this video

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.059 
hi this is Prussia Walker in this video
I'm<00:00:03.330> going<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.629> explain<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:04.020> you<00:00:04.259> how<00:00:04.440> point

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
I'm going to explain to you how point

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.270 
I'm going to explain to you how point
nine<00:00:05.279> repeating<00:00:05.790> is<00:00:05.940> not<00:00:06.450> equal<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.109> one<00:00:07.350> in<00:00:07.589> a

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
nine repeating is not equal to one in a

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.520 
nine repeating is not equal to one in a
number<00:00:08.580> system<00:00:09.000> known<00:00:09.480> as<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.809> surreal

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
number system known as the surreal

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.240 
number system known as the surreal
numbers<00:00:12.320> now<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.380> probably<00:00:13.799> heard<00:00:14.219> that

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
numbers now you probably heard that

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.910 
numbers now you probably heard that
point<00:00:14.820> nine<00:00:14.969> repeating<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.660> equal<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.500> one<00:00:16.680> and

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
point nine repeating is equal to one and

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.920 
point nine repeating is equal to one and
you've<00:00:17.820> probably<00:00:17.970> seen<00:00:18.240> some<00:00:18.750> very

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
you've probably seen some very

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.980 
you've probably seen some very
convincing<00:00:19.260> proofs<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.840> what<00:00:21.840> you've

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
convincing proofs of it and what you've

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.120 
convincing proofs of it and what you've
learned<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.410> school<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:23.130> actually<00:00:23.640> true<00:00:24.240> it's

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
learned in school is actually true it's

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.439 
learned in school is actually true it's
true<00:00:26.130> for<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.430> numbers<00:00:26.760> we<00:00:26.910> commonly<00:00:27.330> use

number line but to explain how point

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.190 
number line but to explain how point
nine<00:00:46.200> repeating<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.860> not<00:00:47.280> equal<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.850> one<00:00:48.200> we're

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
nine repeating is not equal to one we're

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200 
nine repeating is not equal to one we're
going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.039> go<00:00:50.160> into<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> details<00:00:50.940> of

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
going to have to go into the details of

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.950 
going to have to go into the details of
what<00:00:51.989> exactly<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> real<00:00:53.010> number<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.940> how<00:00:54.899> we

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
what exactly a real number is and how we

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.529 
what exactly a real number is and how we
can<00:00:55.230> build<00:00:55.440> up<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.680> real<00:00:55.980> numbers<00:00:56.370> from<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.300> set

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
can build up the real numbers from a set

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.090 
can build up the real numbers from a set
theoretic<00:00:58.039> construction<00:01:00.590> so<00:01:01.590> we're<00:01:01.739> going<00:01:01.980> to

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
theoretic construction so we're going to

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.709 
theoretic construction so we're going to
start<00:01:02.340> out<00:01:02.460> by<00:01:02.489> building<00:01:02.910> up<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.539> real

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
start out by building up the real

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.850 
start out by building up the real
numbers<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.580> a<00:01:05.580> set<00:01:05.850> theory<00:01:06.119> manner<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.860> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
numbers in a set theory manner and the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.560 
numbers in a set theory manner and the
first<00:01:08.100> thing<00:01:08.310> we're<00:01:08.490> going<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.820> do<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.240> we're

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
first thing we're going to do is we're

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.719 
first thing we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.840> build<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.229> zero<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.220> positive

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
going to build up zero and the positive

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.870 
going to build up zero and the positive
numbers<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:13.799> process<00:01:14.310> works

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
numbers the process works

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.590 
numbers the process works
it<00:01:15.000> starts<00:01:15.869> out<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.290> from<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.040> empty<00:01:17.400> set<00:01:17.670> so

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
it starts out just from the empty set so

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.719 
it starts out just from the empty set so
originally<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.590> have<00:01:19.770> one<00:01:20.009> object<00:01:20.549> and

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
originally we just have one object and

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.480 
originally we just have one object and
the<00:01:21.090> set<00:01:21.330> contains<00:01:21.810> nothing<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.500> we're<00:01:23.280> going

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
the set contains nothing and we're going

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.490 
the set contains nothing and we're going
to<00:01:23.549> label<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.210> set<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.770> number<00:01:26.070> zero<00:01:27.500> now

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
to label this set as the number zero now

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.100 
to label this set as the number zero now
that<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.159> number<00:01:29.460> zero<00:01:29.900> we<00:01:30.900> can

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
that we have the number zero we can

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.590 
that we have the number zero we can
define<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> new<00:01:31.619> number<00:01:32.070> as<00:01:32.400> being<00:01:33.210> equal<00:01:33.570> to

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
define a new number as being equal to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.289 
define a new number as being equal to
the<00:01:33.780> set<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.500> contains<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.549> object<00:01:35.729> zero

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
the set that contains the object zero

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.230 
the set that contains the object zero
and<00:01:36.630> we're<00:01:37.560> going<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.829> say<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.939> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
and we're going to say that this is the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.649 
and we're going to say that this is the
number<00:01:39.570> one<00:01:40.820> we're<00:01:41.820> going<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.119> continue<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
number one we're going to continue the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.340 
number one we're going to continue the
process<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.490> put<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.640> set<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.450> contains<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
process and put a set that contains the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.170 
process and put a set that contains the
number<00:01:46.680> one<00:01:46.920> inside<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.790> call<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.780> two

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
number one inside of it and call it two

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.050 
number one inside of it and call it two
so<00:01:51.180> with<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.689> process<00:01:52.290> we<00:01:53.220> can<00:01:53.430> inductively

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
so with this process we can inductively

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.499 
so with this process we can inductively
build<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.720> all<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.009> positive<00:01:56.490> numbers<00:01:56.850> by

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
build up all of the positive numbers by

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.929 
build up all of the positive numbers by
saying<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.079> new<00:01:58.259> number<00:01:58.619> n<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:59.100> equal<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
saying the new number n is equal to the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.539 
saying the new number n is equal to the
set<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.450> previous<00:02:01.200> number<00:02:01.380> n<00:02:01.680> minus<00:02:02.310> one

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
set of the previous number n minus one

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.679 
set of the previous number n minus one
now<00:02:05.549> we<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.000> build<00:02:06.180> up<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.390> negative

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
now we have to build up the negative

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.859 
now we have to build up the negative
numbers<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.439> we<00:02:08.160> can<00:02:08.340> do<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.729> by<00:02:09.330> writing<00:02:09.629> it

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
numbers and we can do that by writing it

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.030 
numbers and we can do that by writing it
as<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> pair<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.709> two<00:02:11.340> positive<00:02:11.790> numbers

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
as a pair of two positive numbers

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.740 
as a pair of two positive numbers
so<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.190> positive<00:02:14.670> numbers<00:02:14.970> we<00:02:15.120> already<00:02:15.480> know

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
so the positive numbers we already know

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.010 
so the positive numbers we already know
we<00:02:16.500> can<00:02:16.709> define<00:02:17.069> as<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.520> pair<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:18.030> the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
we can define as the pair of the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.490 
we can define as the pair of the
positive<00:02:19.500> number<00:02:19.830> comma<00:02:20.310> zero<00:02:20.990> to<00:02:21.990> define<00:02:22.319> the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
positive number comma zero to define the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.680 
positive number comma zero to define the
negative<00:02:22.920> numbers<00:02:23.280> we're<00:02:24.060> going<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.450> flip

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
negative numbers we're going to flip

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.030 
negative numbers we're going to flip
that<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.650> negative<00:02:26.100> 1<00:02:26.310> will<00:02:26.520> be<00:02:26.700> 0<00:02:26.910> comma<00:02:27.600> 1

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
that so negative 1 will be 0 comma 1

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.199 
that so negative 1 will be 0 comma 1
negative<00:02:29.040> 2<00:02:29.280> will<00:02:29.970> be<00:02:30.150> 0<00:02:30.180> comma<00:02:30.810> 2<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:31.709> on

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
negative 2 will be 0 comma 2 and so on

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.030 
negative 2 will be 0 comma 2 and so on
so<00:02:33.209> in<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.630> way<00:02:33.810> we<00:02:34.020> can<00:02:34.200> take<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.590> positive

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
so in this way we can take the positive

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.100 
so in this way we can take the positive
numbers<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.550> build<00:02:36.060> up<00:02:36.239> all<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.720> negative

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
numbers and build up all the negative

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.240 
numbers and build up all the negative
numbers<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:39.420> build<00:02:39.630> up<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.110> fractions<00:02:40.739> or<00:02:40.950> all

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
numbers to build up the fractions or all

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.280 
numbers to build up the fractions or all
the<00:02:41.459> rationals<00:02:42.000> we're<00:02:42.840> going<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.140> have

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
the rationals we're going to have

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.970 
the rationals we're going to have
another<00:02:43.680> ordered<00:02:44.130> pair<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:45.260> any<00:02:46.260> of<00:02:46.709> the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
another ordered pair of any of the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.550 
another ordered pair of any of the
integers<00:02:47.400> we've<00:02:47.610> just<00:02:47.850> built<00:02:48.350> so<00:02:49.350> the

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
integers we've just built so the

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.449 
integers we've just built so the
fraction<00:02:50.040> 1/2<00:02:50.250> we<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:51.300> write<00:02:51.480> out<00:02:51.690> as<00:02:52.459> ordered

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
fraction 1/2 we can write out as ordered

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.150 
fraction 1/2 we can write out as ordered
pair<00:02:53.730> of<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.330> number<00:02:54.600> 1<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.590> number<00:02:55.620> 2

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.830 

finally<00:02:59.160> we<00:02:59.340> can<00:02:59.489> complete<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.239> real<00:03:00.420> numbers

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
finally we can complete the real numbers

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.460 
finally we can complete the real numbers
by<00:03:01.620> defining<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.280> Irrational's<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.300> this<00:03:04.290> is

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
by defining the Irrational's and this is

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.699 
by defining the Irrational's and this is
a<00:03:04.500> bit<00:03:04.709> complicated<00:03:05.390> but<00:03:06.390> let<00:03:07.260> me<00:03:07.380> just<00:03:07.410> tell

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
a bit complicated but let me just tell

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.680 
a bit complicated but let me just tell
you<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:07.920> can<00:03:08.370> define<00:03:08.819> numbers<00:03:09.239> like<00:03:09.660> negative

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
you you can define numbers like negative

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.190 
you you can define numbers like negative
square<00:03:10.410> root<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.739> 2<00:03:11.600> from<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.780> sets<00:03:13.019> we've

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
square root of 2 from the sets we've

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.340 
square root of 2 from the sets we've
already<00:03:13.440> built<00:03:13.739> up<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:15.140> that's<00:03:16.140> how<00:03:16.290> you

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
already built up and that's how you

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.050 
already built up and that's how you
build<00:03:16.650> up<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:17.160> real<00:03:17.370> numbers<00:03:19.549> now<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.610> reason

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
build up the real numbers now the reason

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.330 
build up the real numbers now the reason
I<00:03:21.150> did<00:03:21.299> all<00:03:21.450> this<00:03:21.630> is<00:03:21.840> that<00:03:22.799> it'll<00:03:23.010> give<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:23.310> a

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
I did all this is that it'll give you a

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.370 
I did all this is that it'll give you a
sense<00:03:23.640> of<00:03:23.820> how<00:03:24.180> we<00:03:24.239> build<00:03:24.600> up<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:25.019> surreal

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
sense of how we build up the surreal

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.340 
sense of how we build up the surreal
numbers<00:03:25.880> so<00:03:26.880> we<00:03:27.030> also<00:03:27.209> build<00:03:27.630> them<00:03:27.840> up<00:03:27.959> from

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
numbers so we also build them up from

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.720 
numbers so we also build them up from
sets<00:03:30.260> but<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.320> first<00:03:31.650> set<00:03:31.890> we<00:03:32.010> have<00:03:32.190> it's<00:03:32.459> not

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
sets but the first set we have it's not

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.750 
sets but the first set we have it's not
just<00:03:33.060> simply<00:03:33.570> an<00:03:33.750> empty<00:03:33.989> set<00:03:34.470> it's<00:03:35.280> going<00:03:35.640> to

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
just simply an empty set it's going to

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.750 
just simply an empty set it's going to
be<00:03:35.910> an<00:03:36.060> empty<00:03:36.480> set<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:37.350> has<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.620> left<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.400> a

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
be an empty set that has a left and a

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.370 
be an empty set that has a left and a
right<00:03:38.790> side<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:42.180> empty<00:03:42.570> set<00:03:42.780> we're<00:03:43.049> going<00:03:43.200> to

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
right side the empty set we're going to

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.849 
right side the empty set we're going to
define<00:03:43.739> as<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.370> number<00:03:44.670> zero<00:03:45.290> but<00:03:46.290> now<00:03:46.470> these

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
define as the number zero but now these

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.069 
define as the number zero but now these
sets<00:03:47.220> we're<00:03:47.459> going<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.880> use<00:03:48.120> have<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.630> left<00:03:48.930> and

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
sets we're going to use have a left and

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.340 
sets we're going to use have a left and
a<00:03:49.200> right<00:03:49.230> side<00:03:49.850> so<00:03:50.850> now<00:03:51.030> we<00:03:51.090> can<00:03:51.450> build<00:03:51.660> up<00:03:51.840> two

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
a right side so now we can build up two

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.860 
a right side so now we can build up two
more<00:03:52.650> numbers<00:03:53.130> once<00:03:53.940> we<00:03:54.090> have<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.299> number<00:03:54.600> 0

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
more numbers once we have the number 0

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.240 
more numbers once we have the number 0
by<00:03:55.859> putting<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.310> 0<00:03:56.640> on<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.060> left<00:03:57.299> side<00:03:57.570> or

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
by putting a 0 on the left side or

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.039 
by putting a 0 on the left side or
putting<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.280> 0<00:03:59.730> on<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.150> right<00:04:00.329> side<00:04:00.600> of<00:04:00.870> the

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
putting a 0 on the right side of the

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.930 
putting a 0 on the right side of the
divider<00:04:03.019> we<00:04:04.019> can<00:04:04.230> define<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:05.250> first<00:04:05.459> number

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
divider we can define the first number

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.660 
divider we can define the first number
as<00:04:06.090> 1<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.049> we're<00:04:07.739> going<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.070> define<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.549> other

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
as 1 and we're going to define the other

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.960 
as 1 and we're going to define the other
number<00:04:09.180> as<00:04:09.329> negative<00:04:10.049> 1<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.640> the<00:04:11.640> surreal

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
number as negative 1 and the surreal

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.789 
number as negative 1 and the surreal
numbers<00:04:12.000> are<00:04:12.540> built<00:04:12.900> up<00:04:13.140> in<00:04:13.320> this<00:04:13.500> manner

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
numbers are built up in this manner

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.699 
numbers are built up in this manner
where<00:04:14.670> each<00:04:14.910> time<00:04:15.269> we're<00:04:15.600> going<00:04:15.780> to<00:04:15.870> take<00:04:16.169> one

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
where each time we're going to take one

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.920 
where each time we're going to take one
of<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.919> numbers<00:04:17.250> we<00:04:17.400> built<00:04:17.640> up<00:04:17.850> and<00:04:18.150> we're

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
of the numbers we built up and we're

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.509 
of the numbers we built up and we're
going<00:04:19.079> to<00:04:19.229> see<00:04:19.380> what<00:04:19.560> happens<00:04:19.950> when<00:04:20.160> we<00:04:20.280> put

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
going to see what happens when we put

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.640 
going to see what happens when we put
that<00:04:20.640> number<00:04:21.030> on<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.390> left<00:04:21.599> side<00:04:21.840> or<00:04:22.620> the

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
numbers we've already built up

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.180 
numbers we've already built up
so<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.870> surreal<00:04:28.200> numbers<00:04:28.410> are<00:04:28.770> actually

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
so the surreal numbers are actually

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.360 
so the surreal numbers are actually
built<00:04:29.400> up<00:04:29.550> by<00:04:29.910> a<00:04:29.940> branching<00:04:30.510> process<00:04:31.050> we<00:04:32.040> start

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
built up by a branching process we start

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.930 
built up by a branching process we start
out<00:04:32.490> with<00:04:32.639> zero<00:04:33.919> then<00:04:34.919> we<00:04:35.130> build<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.610> numbers

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
out with zero then we build the numbers

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.900 
out with zero then we build the numbers
negative<00:04:36.389> 1<00:04:36.570> and<00:04:36.750> 1<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:37.610> each<00:04:38.610> of<00:04:38.790> those

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
negative 1 and 1 and each of those

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.790 
negative 1 and 1 and each of those
numbers<00:04:39.180> can<00:04:39.570> branch<00:04:39.870> out<00:04:40.139> to<00:04:40.380> build

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
numbers can branch out to build

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.629 
numbers can branch out to build
different<00:04:41.220> numbers<00:04:41.520> of<00:04:41.669> their<00:04:41.940> own<00:04:43.430> once<00:04:44.430> we

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
different numbers of their own once we

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.790 
different numbers of their own once we
have<00:04:44.820> these<00:04:45.060> new<00:04:45.270> numbers<00:04:45.450> we<00:04:46.050> branch<00:04:46.350> out<00:04:46.620> and

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
have these new numbers we branch out and

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.659 
have these new numbers we branch out and
build<00:04:47.130> out<00:04:47.340> new<00:04:47.550> numbers<00:04:48.120> and<00:04:49.460> eventually<00:04:50.460> if

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
build out new numbers and eventually if

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.180 
build out new numbers and eventually if
we<00:04:51.270> keep<00:04:51.480> ranching<00:04:51.990> out<00:04:52.110> infinitely<00:04:53.070> many

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
we keep ranching out infinitely many

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.480 
we keep ranching out infinitely many
times<00:04:53.720> we're<00:04:54.720> going<00:04:54.990> to<00:04:55.110> generate<00:04:55.350> all<00:04:55.800> of<00:04:56.340> the

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
times we're going to generate all of the

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.030 
times we're going to generate all of the
real<00:04:56.669> numbers<00:04:56.700> all<00:04:57.330> of<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:58.080> fractions<00:04:58.620> all<00:04:58.860> of

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
real numbers all of the fractions all of

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.190 
real numbers all of the fractions all of
the<00:04:59.160> irrational<00:04:59.490> x'<00:04:59.760> etc<00:05:00.390> all<00:05:00.540> of<00:05:00.600> the

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
the irrational x' etc all of the

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.920 
the irrational x' etc all of the
positive<00:05:01.620> and<00:05:01.740> negative<00:05:02.070> numbers<00:05:02.400> so<00:05:02.930> that's

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
positive and negative numbers so that's

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.950 
positive and negative numbers so that's
how<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.169> surreal<00:05:04.620> numbers<00:05:04.650> are<00:05:05.160> built<00:05:05.490> up<00:05:05.960> but

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
how the surreal numbers are built up but

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.360 
how the surreal numbers are built up but
what's<00:05:07.140> interesting<00:05:07.320> about<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:08.070> surreal

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
what's interesting about the surreal

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.700 
what's interesting about the surreal
numbers<00:05:08.400> is<00:05:08.970> that<00:05:09.870> we<00:05:10.050> end<00:05:10.230> up<00:05:10.410> on<00:05:10.590> the

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
numbers is that we end up on the

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.180 
numbers is that we end up on the
infinite<00:05:11.330> branch<00:05:12.330> branching<00:05:13.169> process<00:05:13.560> we<00:05:14.040> end

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
infinite branch branching process we end

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.730 
infinite branch branching process we end
up<00:05:14.340> with<00:05:14.520> some<00:05:14.700> weird<00:05:14.940> numbers<00:05:15.390> so<00:05:16.350> let<00:05:16.650> me

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
up with some weird numbers so let me

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.400 
up with some weird numbers so let me
write<00:05:16.919> out<00:05:16.950> a<00:05:17.100> number<00:05:17.340> for<00:05:17.729> you<00:05:18.020> let's<00:05:19.020> say<00:05:19.229> we

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
write out a number for you let's say we

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.560 
write out a number for you let's say we
have<00:05:19.530> a<00:05:19.560> set<00:05:19.860> we're<00:05:20.340> on<00:05:20.460> the<00:05:20.610> left<00:05:20.850> side<00:05:21.090> we

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
have a set we're on the left side we

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.469 
have a set we're on the left side we
just<00:05:21.600> have<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.140> number<00:05:22.410> 0<00:05:22.710> and<00:05:23.150> on<00:05:24.150> the<00:05:24.300> right

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
just have the number 0 and on the right

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:30.920 
just have the number 0 and on the right
side<00:05:24.750> we<00:05:25.560> have<00:05:25.590> 1<00:05:26.150> 1/2<00:05:27.440> 1/4<00:05:28.490> 1/8<00:05:29.490> and<00:05:29.760> so<00:05:30.750> on

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
side we have 1 1/2 1/4 1/8 and so on

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.680 
side we have 1 1/2 1/4 1/8 and so on
each<00:05:31.229> time<00:05:31.500> we<00:05:31.650> divide<00:05:31.919> by<00:05:32.100> 2<00:05:32.160> 1/16<00:05:33.090> and<00:05:33.270> so<00:05:33.510> on

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
each time we divide by 2 1/16 and so on

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.550 
each time we divide by 2 1/16 and so on
and<00:05:34.010> this<00:05:35.010> list<00:05:35.250> continues<00:05:35.729> infinitely<00:05:36.560> so

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
and this list continues infinitely so

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.590 
and this list continues infinitely so
this<00:05:37.890> is<00:05:38.070> a<00:05:38.100> valid<00:05:38.669> surreal<00:05:39.300> number<00:05:39.780> and<00:05:41.600> this

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
this is a valid surreal number and this

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.930 
this is a valid surreal number and this
number<00:05:43.080> by<00:05:43.919> the<00:05:43.979> way<00:05:44.160> the<00:05:44.460> surreal<00:05:44.789> numbers

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
number by the way the surreal numbers

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.150 
number by the way the surreal numbers
are<00:05:45.270> defined<00:05:45.660> is<00:05:45.930> going<00:05:46.590> to<00:05:46.680> be<00:05:46.830> a<00:05:46.860> positive

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
are defined is going to be a positive

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.450 
are defined is going to be a positive
number<00:05:47.630> that's<00:05:48.630> greater<00:05:48.900> than<00:05:49.200> zero<00:05:49.680> but

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
number that's greater than zero but

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.120 
number that's greater than zero but
smaller<00:05:50.940> than<00:05:51.479> any<00:05:51.810> other<00:05:52.110> positive<00:05:52.770> number

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
smaller than any other positive number

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.090 
smaller than any other positive number
and<00:05:53.780> this<00:05:54.780> number<00:05:55.050> will<00:05:55.470> write<00:05:55.740> out<00:05:55.890> as

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
and this number will write out as

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.580 
and this number will write out as
Epsilon<00:05:56.729> and<00:05:57.000> you<00:05:57.810> can<00:05:57.990> think<00:05:58.200> about<00:05:58.320> this

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
Epsilon and you can think about this

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.090 
Epsilon and you can think about this
number<00:05:58.830> as<00:05:59.100> being<00:05:59.760> 1<00:06:00.060> divided<00:06:00.750> by<00:06:00.870> infinity

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
number as being 1 divided by infinity

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.460 
number as being 1 divided by infinity
because<00:06:02.100> this<00:06:02.280> number<00:06:02.580> is<00:06:02.760> basically<00:06:03.479> the

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
because this number is basically the

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.680 
because this number is basically the
number<00:06:04.620> that's<00:06:05.130> greater<00:06:05.400> than<00:06:05.640> 0<00:06:06.060> but<00:06:06.539> it's

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
number that's greater than 0 but it's

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.130 
number that's greater than 0 but it's
smaller<00:06:07.020> than<00:06:07.320> all<00:06:07.530> other<00:06:07.919> positive<00:06:08.460> numbers

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
smaller than all other positive numbers

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.570 
smaller than all other positive numbers
so<00:06:10.140> you<00:06:10.229> can<00:06:10.380> think<00:06:10.500> about<00:06:10.650> it<00:06:10.919> as<00:06:11.010> maybe<00:06:11.250> point

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
so you can think about it as maybe point

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.580 
so you can think about it as maybe point
zero<00:06:11.910> repeating<00:06:12.479> with<00:06:13.110> the<00:06:13.229> one<00:06:13.410> at<00:06:13.530> the<00:06:13.680> end

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
zero repeating with the one at the end

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.230 
zero repeating with the one at the end
we<00:06:16.590> can<00:06:16.770> continue<00:06:17.250> there's<00:06:17.550> another<00:06:17.850> weird

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
we can continue there's another weird

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.170 
we can continue there's another weird
number<00:06:18.600> we<00:06:18.750> can<00:06:18.900> write<00:06:19.080> out<00:06:19.789> where<00:06:20.789> we<00:06:20.970> have<00:06:21.150> a

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
number we can write out where we have a

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.480 
number we can write out where we have a
zero<00:06:21.630> one<00:06:22.260> half<00:06:22.970> 3/4<00:06:24.060> 7/8<00:06:24.840> and<00:06:25.080> so<00:06:25.620> on<00:06:25.830> on<00:06:26.010> the

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
zero one half 3/4 7/8 and so on on the

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.250 
zero one half 3/4 7/8 and so on on the
left<00:06:26.729> side<00:06:26.910> each<00:06:27.690> time<00:06:29.870> you<00:06:30.870> know<00:06:30.990> we<00:06:31.110> would

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
left side each time you know we would

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.770 
left side each time you know we would
have<00:06:31.410> 15<00:06:31.590> 16<00:06:32.280> and<00:06:32.490> so<00:06:32.640> on<00:06:32.669> and<00:06:33.030> on<00:06:33.479> the<00:06:33.600> right

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
have 15 16 and so on and on the right

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.190 
have 15 16 and so on and on the right
side<00:06:33.990> we<00:06:34.200> have<00:06:34.229> 1<00:06:34.940> so<00:06:35.940> this<00:06:36.210> is<00:06:36.419> another<00:06:36.720> valid

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
side we have 1 so this is another valid

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.879 
side we have 1 so this is another valid
surreal<00:06:37.919> number

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889 
surreal number

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:41.189 
surreal number
and<00:06:38.979> this<00:06:39.580> number<00:06:39.819> is<00:06:39.969> going<00:06:40.419> to<00:06:40.629> be<00:06:40.749> defined

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 
and this number is going to be defined

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:45.209 
and this number is going to be defined
so<00:06:41.860> that<00:06:42.069> it's<00:06:42.219> greater<00:06:42.580> than<00:06:42.969> every<00:06:44.219> positive

00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:45.219 
so that it's greater than every positive

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:48.390 
so that it's greater than every positive
number<00:06:45.879> that's<00:06:46.389> less<00:06:46.689> than<00:06:46.749> one<00:06:47.249> but<00:06:48.249> it's

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 
number that's less than one but it's

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.629 
number that's less than one but it's
still<00:06:48.520> less<00:06:49.060> than<00:06:49.300> one<00:06:49.479> and<00:06:50.159> this<00:06:51.159> number<00:06:51.370> will

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:51.639 
still less than one and this number will

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:56.309 
still less than one and this number will
exactly<00:06:52.150> be<00:06:52.479> one<00:06:53.050> minus<00:06:53.469> Epsilon<00:06:54.099> and<00:06:55.169> you<00:06:56.169> can

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 
exactly be one minus Epsilon and you can

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:58.489 
exactly be one minus Epsilon and you can
think<00:06:56.529> about<00:06:56.620> it<00:06:56.949> as<00:06:57.069> point<00:06:57.520> nine<00:06:57.699> repeating

00:06:58.489 --> 00:06:58.499 
think about it as point nine repeating

00:06:58.499 --> 00:07:00.869 
think about it as point nine repeating
so<00:06:59.499> we've<00:06:59.680> come<00:06:59.919> up<00:06:59.949> with<00:07:00.099> the<00:07:00.310> very<00:07:00.550> weird

00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:00.879 
so we've come up with the very weird

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:03.600 
so we've come up with the very weird
number<00:07:01.300> point<00:07:02.289> nine<00:07:02.469> repeating<00:07:03.009> which<00:07:03.430> is

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610 
number point nine repeating which is

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.689 
number point nine repeating which is
clearly<00:07:03.999> not<00:07:04.389> equal<00:07:04.960> to<00:07:05.080> 1<00:07:05.259> because<00:07:06.219> 1<00:07:06.430> was

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:06.699 
clearly not equal to 1 because 1 was

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:09.450 
clearly not equal to 1 because 1 was
equal<00:07:06.900> to<00:07:07.900> the<00:07:08.020> set<00:07:08.229> which<00:07:08.439> just<00:07:08.740> had<00:07:08.889> zero<00:07:09.219> on

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460 
equal to the set which just had zero on

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.200 
equal to the set which just had zero on
the<00:07:09.669> left<00:07:09.879> side<00:07:10.770> so<00:07:11.770> we've<00:07:11.979> come<00:07:12.250> up<00:07:12.279> with<00:07:12.669> the

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.210 
the left side so we've come up with the

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.570 
the left side so we've come up with the
number<00:07:13.509> system<00:07:13.750> where<00:07:14.500> point<00:07:14.860> nine<00:07:15.039> repeating

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580 
number system where point nine repeating

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:21.450 
number system where point nine repeating
is<00:07:15.759> not<00:07:16.240> the<00:07:16.689> same<00:07:16.960> as<00:07:17.199> one<00:07:17.560> I<00:07:20.099> will<00:07:21.099> end<00:07:21.340> that

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:21.460 
is not the same as one I will end that

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.629 
is not the same as one I will end that
the<00:07:21.669> surreal<00:07:22.029> numbers<00:07:22.210> are<00:07:22.539> pretty<00:07:22.779> cool<00:07:23.080> it

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639 
the surreal numbers are pretty cool it

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:26.700 
the surreal numbers are pretty cool it
turns<00:07:24.639> out<00:07:24.879> that<00:07:25.330> the<00:07:25.840> surreal<00:07:26.169> numbers<00:07:26.349> can

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:26.710 
turns out that the surreal numbers can

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.920 
turns out that the surreal numbers can
also<00:07:26.830> be<00:07:27.099> derived<00:07:27.580> as<00:07:27.849> values<00:07:28.389> from<00:07:28.659> a<00:07:28.719> game

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:28.930 
also be derived as values from a game

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.719 
also be derived as values from a game
called<00:07:29.560> hackenbush<00:07:30.159> or<00:07:31.029> red<00:07:31.419> in<00:07:31.599> blue<00:07:31.839> players

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:32.729 
called hackenbush or red in blue players

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:35.790 
called hackenbush or red in blue players
alternately<00:07:33.729> take<00:07:34.060> turns<00:07:34.360> and<00:07:34.750> you<00:07:35.650> can

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 
alternately take turns and you can

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.489 
alternately take turns and you can
define<00:07:36.129> values<00:07:36.699> of<00:07:36.909> the<00:07:37.300> game<00:07:37.509> depending<00:07:38.349> on

00:07:38.489 --> 00:07:38.499 
define values of the game depending on

00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:45.619 
define values of the game depending on
how<00:07:38.949> the<00:07:39.009> red<00:07:39.400> and<00:07:39.580> blue<00:07:40.409> sticks<00:07:41.409> are<00:07:41.710> placed

00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:45.629 

00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:48.510 

so<00:07:46.629> what<00:07:46.810> this<00:07:46.990> means<00:07:47.259> is<00:07:47.500> that<00:07:47.560> all<00:07:48.009> of<00:07:48.279> life

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:48.520 
so what this means is that all of life

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.179 
so what this means is that all of life
is<00:07:48.759> numbers<00:07:49.360> and<00:07:49.599> all<00:07:50.139> of<00:07:50.319> numbers<00:07:50.680> are<00:07:50.919> simply

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:51.189 
is numbers and all of numbers are simply

00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:53.939 
is numbers and all of numbers are simply
a<00:07:51.400> game<00:07:51.639> and<00:07:51.909> therefore<00:07:52.810> all<00:07:53.020> of<00:07:53.469> life<00:07:53.680> is<00:07:53.889> a

00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:53.949 
a game and therefore all of life is a

00:07:53.949 --> 00:07:59.279 
a game and therefore all of life is a
game<00:07:54.310> I<00:07:56.460> hope<00:07:57.460> you<00:07:57.639> like<00:07:57.819> this<00:07:57.969> video<00:07:58.289> please
