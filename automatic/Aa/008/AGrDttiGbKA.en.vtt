afternoon hour of happiness for a dollar

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.780 
afternoon hour of happiness for a dollar
and<00:02:36.510> for<00:02:36.870> how<00:02:36.960> good<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.320> tastes<00:02:37.710> it's<00:02:38.310> worth<00:02:38.610> it

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
and for how good it tastes it's worth it

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.700 
and for how good it tastes it's worth it
for<00:02:38.820> sure<00:02:39.150> it's<00:02:39.480> definitely<00:02:39.870> like<00:02:40.350> just<00:02:40.560> an

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
for sure it's definitely like just an

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.250 
for sure it's definitely like just an
impulse<00:02:41.100> buy<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:42.240> think<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.960> good

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
impulse buy and I think that is a good

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.320 
impulse buy and I think that is a good
thing<00:02:43.560> it's<00:02:44.370> not<00:02:44.520> something<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.060> would<00:02:45.120> go

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
thing it's not something I would go

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.610 
thing it's not something I would go
there<00:02:45.480> specifically<00:02:45.930> for<00:02:46.200> though<00:02:46.350> I'd<00:02:46.470> have

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
there specifically for though I'd have

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.990 
there specifically for though I'd have
to<00:02:46.740> just<00:02:46.920> be<00:02:47.070> like<00:02:47.280> I've<00:02:47.430> drunk<00:02:47.700> I've<00:02:47.820> driven

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
to just be like I've drunk I've driven

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.910 
to just be like I've drunk I've driven
up<00:02:48.210> see<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.020> I'm<00:02:49.110> like<00:02:49.200> oh<00:02:49.350> yeah<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.590> sounds

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
up see it I'm like oh yeah that sounds

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.300 
up see it I'm like oh yeah that sounds
good

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
good

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.980 
good
so<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.730> would<00:02:50.910> write<00:02:51.000> this<00:02:51.150> thing<00:02:51.300> a<00:02:51.480> low<00:02:51.660> four

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
so I would write this thing a low four

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.199 
so I would write this thing a low four
that's<00:02:52.380> good<00:02:52.680> just<00:02:53.310> gets<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.700> bit<00:02:53.730> too<00:02:54.060> sweet

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
that's good just gets a bit too sweet

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.240 
that's good just gets a bit too sweet
and<00:02:54.570> I<00:02:54.990> think<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.380> would<00:02:55.500> get<00:02:55.620> tired<00:02:55.830> of<00:02:56.040> it

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
and I think I would get tired of it

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.460 
and I think I would get tired of it
overall<00:02:56.730> after<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.540> know<00:02:57.630> half<00:02:57.840> of<00:02:58.050> this<00:02:58.260> or

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
overall after you know half of this or

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.350 
overall after you know half of this or
so<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:58.890> might<00:02:59.070> be<00:02:59.190> able<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.400> stick<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.730> out<00:02:59.850> but<00:03:00.120> I

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
so I might be able to stick it out but I

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.510 
so I might be able to stick it out but I
just<00:03:00.780> don't<00:03:01.140> see<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.500> it's<00:03:01.709> really<00:03:02.280> really

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
just don't see it it's really really

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.850 
just don't see it it's really really
sweet<00:03:03.060> I<00:03:03.450> do<00:03:03.840> look<00:03:04.080> forward<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.590> them

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
sweet I do look forward to them

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.530 
sweet I do look forward to them
branching<00:03:05.400> out<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.520> other<00:03:05.730> types<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.360> flavors

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
branching out to other types of flavors

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.570 
branching out to other types of flavors
that<00:03:06.930> sounds<00:03:07.680> pretty<00:03:07.890> good<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.220> me

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
that sounds pretty good to me

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.370 
that sounds pretty good to me
I<00:03:08.610> think<00:03:09.209> it's<00:03:09.570> one<00:03:09.690> of<00:03:09.780> their<00:03:09.870> strong<00:03:10.110> suits

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
I think it's one of their strong suits

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.990 
I think it's one of their strong suits
