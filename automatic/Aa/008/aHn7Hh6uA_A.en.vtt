the engine because we just filled it up

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.430 
the engine because we just filled it up
with<00:00:41.219> gas<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:42.030> her<00:00:42.149> own<00:00:43.520> you<00:00:44.520> don't<00:00:44.670> see<00:00:44.879> that

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
with gas on her own you don't see that

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.350 
with gas on her own you don't see that
yeah<00:00:46.579> so<00:00:47.579> I'm<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:47.789> going<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:47.969> open<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:49.190> and

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:01.300 

stick<00:00:54.360> shift<00:00:57.620> hood

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.570 

so<00:01:01.910> I'm<00:01:02.540> going<00:01:02.720> to<00:01:02.750> open<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:04.000> engine<00:01:05.000> hood

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
so I'm going to open the engine hood

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:16.690 
so I'm going to open the engine hood
there<00:01:07.580> you<00:01:07.850> go<00:01:12.340> all<00:01:13.340> riley<00:01:14.000> that<00:01:15.580> all<00:01:16.580> right

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
there you go all riley that all right

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.610 
there you go all riley that all right
hold<00:01:17.000> up<00:01:18.460> and<00:01:19.460> I<00:01:19.520> open<00:01:19.940> this

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:33.850 

there<00:01:25.250> you<00:01:25.490> go<00:01:27.760> that's<00:01:28.760> the<00:01:28.910> engine<00:01:32.740> put<00:01:33.740> the

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
there you go that's the engine put the

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.700 
there you go that's the engine put the
bar<00:01:34.190> on<00:01:34.370> there<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:36.590> take

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.680 

I<00:01:39.799> think<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.610> reason<00:01:40.790> the<00:01:41.030> car<00:01:41.240> doesn't<00:01:41.450> start

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
I think the reason the car doesn't start

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.810 
I think the reason the car doesn't start
is<00:01:41.960> because<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:42.409> battery<00:01:42.770> acid<00:01:43.010> I<00:01:43.549> think

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
is because the battery acid I think

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.649 
is because the battery acid I think
that's<00:01:44.150> the<00:01:44.270> problem<00:01:46.000> engine<00:01:47.000> oil<00:01:47.150> I<00:01:47.390> think

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
that's the problem engine oil I think

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.600 
that's the problem engine oil I think
looks<00:01:47.840> fine<00:01:48.170> I<00:01:48.560> don't<00:01:49.100> see<00:01:49.310> anything<00:01:49.490> wrong

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
looks fine I don't see anything wrong

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.480 
looks fine I don't see anything wrong
with<00:01:49.820> that<00:01:51.700> everything<00:01:52.700> is<00:01:52.820> fine<00:01:54.280> I'm<00:01:55.280> going

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
with that everything is fine I'm going

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.859 
with that everything is fine I'm going
to<00:01:55.810> try<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:56.900> start<00:01:57.530> it<00:01:57.619> again<00:01:57.770> be<00:01:58.369> four<00:01:58.670> work

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
to try to start it again be four work

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.450 
to try to start it again be four work
because<00:01:59.869> it<00:02:00.170> hasn't<00:02:00.380> been<00:02:00.740> started<00:02:01.040> for<00:02:01.250> a

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
because it hasn't been started for a

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.899 
because it hasn't been started for a
while<00:02:01.670> now<00:02:02.920> so<00:02:05.950> I'm<00:02:06.950> going<00:02:07.159> to<00:02:07.220> try<00:02:07.399> to<00:02:07.460> start

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
while now so I'm going to try to start

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.780 
while now so I'm going to try to start
it<00:02:08.000> up<00:02:08.090> again<00:02:10.239> see<00:02:11.239> what<00:02:11.450> happens<00:02:12.489> because<00:02:13.489> you

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
it up again see what happens because you

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.560 
it up again see what happens because you
moved<00:02:15.070> somewhere<00:02:16.070> else<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:17.150> cars<00:02:17.390> are

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
moved somewhere else and the cars are

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.930 
moved somewhere else and the cars are
sitting<00:02:17.930> here<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:19.790> we're<00:02:20.450> going<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.840> find<00:02:21.110> out

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
sitting here so we're going to find out

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:33.809 
sitting here so we're going to find out
if<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:26.060> starts

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.290

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.240 

some<00:02:42.930> reason<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.260> key<00:02:43.469> doesn't<00:02:43.769> turn<00:02:43.950> all<00:02:44.099> the

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
some reason the key doesn't turn all the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:03:02.230 
some reason the key doesn't turn all the
