00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 hello girls i hope you 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.830
 go well today I find you 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.720
 for an oriental cake recipe 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.910
 so this is a gas pipeline that will be called 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.890
 the aiba which is made from pea flour 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.600
 chick 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.430
 so I use cups for 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.010
 do the doses so in fact we're going 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.279
 take three doses of pea flour 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:24.090
 chickens a dose of icing sugar so the 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:28.160
 icing sugar and finally a dose of 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.160
 normal wheat flour 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.160
 after pouring your doses of flour from 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.850
 sugar and chickpea flour 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.870
 you already go dimmed them so I 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.520
 did not want to show in the video but 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.500
 I sifted all that and there you go 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.559
 start mixing everything that is 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.840
 powder so you'll go all right 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.420
 gently to have a powder to 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.830
 the homogeneous end then when 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.260
 you will mix everything you go 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.550
 start with a master a 12 since the 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.900
 but against the dose of oil you the 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.760
 do not put everything at the same time 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.989
 put little by little so I'm doing 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.110
 little ones then and then then I 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.369
 I'm having fun with the flour on 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.479
 oil so that everything mixes well 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.140
 so when you started to 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.940
 pour the oil 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.420
 you will see that it will start to 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.039
 compact the smala must be very 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.330
 be careful mix with the 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.509
 flour story that is not too much 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.509
 oil 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.430
 so that's what the dough will give a 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.130
 once she will be good 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.160
 so you have to mix well she will have a 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.230
 consistency a little modeling clay and 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.020
 havas not stick to the hands so that's it 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.920
 must try to find the right mix 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.050
 then you will take small 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.390
 balls of dough and make the shapes that 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.200
 you want to put everything in the oven 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:56.490
 at 200 Â° for about 13 to 15 minutes 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.840
 and normally everything will be cooked so I 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.370
 will show you in the fort how 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.810
 it gives when it's cooked there are 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.810
 small cracks in the cakes 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.540
 and here are the girls do not hesitate to me 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.950

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.220

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.220
