definitely<00:01:54.810> came<00:01:54.990> down<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.590> very<00:01:55.770> last

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
definitely came down to the very last

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.770 
definitely came down to the very last
drive<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.850> then<00:01:56.939> we<00:01:57.090> had<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> highlight<00:01:57.659> reel

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
drive and then we had a highlight reel

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.030 
drive and then we had a highlight reel
and<00:01:58.869> you<00:01:59.110> know<00:01:59.229> so<00:01:59.409> we're<00:01:59.560> going<00:01:59.650> to<00:01:59.770> try<00:02:00.010> to

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
and you know so we're going to try to

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.550 
and you know so we're going to try to
stay<00:02:00.700> with<00:02:00.940> two<00:02:01.119> three<00:02:01.420> videos<00:02:01.600> a<00:02:01.750> day<00:02:01.930> there

stay with two three videos a day there

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.930

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
was definitely some good feedback for

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.880 
was definitely some good feedback for
that<00:02:04.150> so<00:02:04.450> I<00:02:04.690> will<00:02:05.170> definitely<00:02:05.350> try<00:02:05.710> my

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
that so I will definitely try my

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.890 
that so I will definitely try my
darndest<00:02:06.190> to<00:02:06.400> do<00:02:06.580> that<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:07.150> there<00:02:07.750> we<00:02:07.869> go

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
darndest to do that and there we go

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
goal unfortunately though it got called

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.250 
goal unfortunately though it got called
back<00:02:12.100> because<00:02:12.370> he<00:02:12.730> was<00:02:12.850> down<00:02:13.090> thank<00:02:13.930> God<00:02:14.110> for

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
back because he was down thank God for

back because he was down thank God for
us<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.770> then<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:14.980> we're<00:02:15.130> right<00:02:15.250> back<00:02:15.370> on

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
us and then so we're right back on

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.680 
us and then so we're right back on
offense<00:02:15.700> we're<00:02:16.030> able<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.270> score<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.480> touchdown

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
offense we're able to score a touchdown

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.040 
offense we're able to score a touchdown
so<00:02:17.200> now<00:02:17.890> back<00:02:18.100> on<00:02:18.310> defense<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:18.850> can<00:02:19.000> see<00:02:19.150> 1414

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
so now back on defense you can see 1414

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.350 
so now back on defense you can see 1414
going<00:02:20.470> in<00:02:20.709> towards<00:02:21.100> halftime<00:02:21.610> it's

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
going in towards halftime it's

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.240 
going in towards halftime it's
imperative<00:02:23.140> that<00:02:23.260> we<00:02:23.410> stop<00:02:23.739> them<00:02:23.950> look<00:02:24.130> at

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
imperative that we stop them look at

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.070 
imperative that we stop them look at
that<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.489> then<00:02:24.640> somehow<00:02:25.060> he<00:02:25.239> beats<00:02:25.660> two<00:02:25.900> men

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
now all we got to do here is try to

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.400 
now all we got to do here is try to
waste<00:05:11.790> some<00:05:11.940> time<00:05:11.970> we'd<00:05:12.900> score<00:05:13.170> a<00:05:13.200> touchdown

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
and then I pretty much feel like the

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.300 
and then I pretty much feel like the
games<00:05:15.150> walked<00:05:15.450> up<00:05:15.690> there<00:05:16.680> goes<00:05:16.890> the<00:05:17.010> play<00:05:17.160> we

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
I'm hoping they make him the positional

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:08.960 
I'm hoping they make him the positional
hero<00:06:07.650> because<00:06:08.010> his<00:06:08.190> run<00:06:08.430> blocking<00:06:08.700> and<00:06:08.910> the

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
hero because his run blocking and the

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.120 
hero because his run blocking and the
things<00:06:09.150> terrible<00:06:09.780> so<00:06:10.320> we<00:06:10.380> try<00:06:10.560> to<00:06:10.620> do<00:06:10.770> it<00:06:10.860> again

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
things terrible so we try to do it again

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.950 
things terrible so we try to do it again
that<00:06:11.310> time<00:06:11.490> he<00:06:11.580> was<00:06:11.610> able<00:06:11.790> to<00:06:11.910> pick<00:06:12.180> it<00:06:12.210> off<00:06:12.480> so

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
that time he was able to pick it off so

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.170 
that time he was able to pick it off so
he<00:06:13.050> does<00:06:13.200> have<00:06:13.350> a<00:06:13.410> small<00:06:13.980> chance<00:06:14.250> here<00:06:14.580> even

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
he does have a small chance here even

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.400 
he does have a small chance here even
though<00:06:15.240> we<00:06:15.330> send<00:06:15.540> that<00:06:15.630> corner<00:06:15.990> heat<00:06:16.170> right

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
though we send that corner heat right

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.740 
though we send that corner heat right
there<00:06:16.700> he<00:06:17.700> didn't<00:06:18.030> couldn't<00:06:18.180> handle<00:06:18.600> it<00:06:18.690> so

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
there he didn't couldn't handle it so

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.230 
there he didn't couldn't handle it so
now<00:06:19.560> he's<00:06:19.770> going<00:06:19.980> up<00:06:20.070> top<00:06:20.220> or<00:06:20.400> Revis<00:06:20.730> or<00:06:21.030> chrome

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
now he's going up top or Revis or chrome

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.460 
now he's going up top or Revis or chrome
already<00:06:21.510> i<00:06:21.540> think<00:06:21.750> that's<00:06:21.870> Revis<00:06:22.230> makes<00:06:22.410> a

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
already i think that's Revis makes a

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.740 
already i think that's Revis makes a
great<00:06:22.620> play<00:06:22.800> for<00:06:23.100> me<00:06:23.220> third<00:06:23.430> and<00:06:23.580> 15<00:06:23.760> goes

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
great play for me third and 15 goes

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.540 
great play for me third and 15 goes
