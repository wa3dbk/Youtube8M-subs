plain paper I'm going to put the two
sheets<00:00:38.460> down<00:00:38.700> here<00:00:39.260> like<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.860> we're

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
sheets down here like this and we're

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.709 
sheets down here like this and we're

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:05.859 
put that single sheet right down here at
the<00:00:54.239> very<00:00:54.270> end

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:18.920 

now<00:01:06.869> we're<00:01:07.229> going<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.580> this<00:01:17.689> we're<00:01:18.689> going<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
now we're going to this we're going to

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:27.680 
now we're going to this we're going to
let<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.140> soak<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:24.770> and<00:01:25.940> now<00:01:26.940> we<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.509> those

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
let that soak in and now we have those

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.139 
let that soak in and now we have those
soaked<00:01:28.350> wheatgrass<00:01:28.950> seeds

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
soaked wheatgrass seeds

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.050 
soaked wheatgrass seeds
so<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.960> wheatgrass<00:01:31.200> seeds<00:01:31.740> are<00:01:32.070> soaking<00:01:32.729> for

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
so the wheatgrass seeds are soaking for

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.210 
so the wheatgrass seeds are soaking for
maybe<00:01:33.270> eight<00:01:33.570> hours<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.500> don't<00:01:34.680> need<00:01:34.890> more

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
maybe eight hours you don't need more

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.080 
maybe eight hours you don't need more
but<00:01:35.789> not<00:01:36.479> quite<00:01:36.810> less<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.440> then<00:01:38.190> we're<00:01:38.880> going

but not quite less and then we're going

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.730 
but not quite less and then we're going
to<00:01:39.590> pour<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.830> seeds<00:01:41.130> out<00:01:41.569> onto<00:01:42.569> the<00:01:43.530> table

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
to pour the seeds out onto the table

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.230 
to pour the seeds out onto the table
onto<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> paper<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:46.340> you<00:01:47.340> want<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.610> pour<00:01:48.090> them

you<00:02:26.590> know<00:02:26.680> this<00:02:27.129> is<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:28.060> where<00:02:28.390> our<00:02:28.690> skills

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
you know this is that where our skills

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.300 
you know this is that where our skills
as<00:02:30.299> gardeners<00:02:31.299> come<00:02:32.049> into<00:02:32.440> play<00:02:32.739> did<00:02:33.040> we<00:02:33.129> do<00:02:33.280> a

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
as gardeners come into play did we do a

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.580 
as gardeners come into play did we do a
nice<00:02:33.610> job<00:02:33.970> of<00:02:34.000> this<00:02:34.390> do<00:02:34.599> we<00:02:34.690> do<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.840> sloppy<00:02:35.170> job

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
nice job of this do we do a sloppy job

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.670 
nice job of this do we do a sloppy job
of<00:02:35.650> this<00:02:36.280> do<00:02:38.099> we<00:02:39.099> make<00:02:39.940> it<00:02:40.180> hard<00:02:40.780> for<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.409> seeds

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
of this do we make it hard for the seeds

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.559 
of this do we make it hard for the seeds
to<00:02:41.920> grow<00:02:42.069> because<00:02:42.370> we<00:02:42.700> make<00:02:42.909> some<00:02:43.150> areas

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
to grow because we make some areas

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.470 
to grow because we make some areas
triple-check<00:02:44.290> deckers<00:02:44.799> and<00:02:45.480> quadruple

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
triple-check deckers and quadruple

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.170 
triple-check deckers and quadruple
Decker's<00:02:46.989> or<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:47.799> it<00:02:47.920> all<00:02:48.040> pretty<00:02:48.340> even<00:02:48.970> you

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
Decker's or is it all pretty even you

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.680 
Decker's or is it all pretty even you
know<00:02:49.299> one<00:02:49.569> layer<00:02:49.860> thick<00:02:51.450> approximately<00:02:52.450> one

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
know one layer thick approximately one

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.500 
know one layer thick approximately one
to<00:02:52.870> two<00:02:52.980> so<00:02:53.980> we'll<00:02:54.220> just<00:02:54.340> kind<00:02:54.579> of<00:02:54.700> back<00:02:54.970> down

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
to two so we'll just kind of back down

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.430 
to two so we'll just kind of back down
here<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:55.900> little<00:02:56.079> bit<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.519> smooth<00:02:57.519> them<00:02:57.879> out

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
here a little bit and smooth them out

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.830 
here a little bit and smooth them out
looking<00:02:59.440> good<00:02:59.769> looking<00:03:00.400> pretty<00:03:01.000> good<00:03:01.359> well
