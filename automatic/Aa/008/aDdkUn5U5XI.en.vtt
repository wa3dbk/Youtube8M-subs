stats<00:00:38.250> ax<00:00:38.550> as<00:00:38.910> we<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.300> see<00:00:39.510> we've<00:00:39.719> got<00:00:39.750> up

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
stats ax as we can see we've got up

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.729 
stats ax as we can see we've got up
damage<00:00:40.620> which<00:00:41.129> makes<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.700> primary<00:00:42.480> with<00:00:43.020> an

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
damage which makes it a primary with an

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.130 
damage which makes it a primary with an
element<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:45.210> obviously<00:00:45.600> very<00:00:45.660> very

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
element and that is obviously very very

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.970 
element and that is obviously very very
rare<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:48.809> first<00:00:49.170> thing<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:49.620> can<00:00:49.770> do

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
rare so the first thing that we can do

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.220 
rare so the first thing that we can do
is<00:00:50.250> put<00:00:50.579> steady<00:00:51.000> eye<00:00:51.090> sight<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.840> there<00:00:52.079> which

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
is put steady eye sight on there which

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.389 
is put steady eye sight on there which
is<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.739> know<00:00:52.860> your<00:00:53.010> standard

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
is just like you know your standard

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.650

singing whatever I've got it on there

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.819 
singing whatever I've got it on there
cuz<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.870> doesn't<00:00:55.079> really<00:00:55.170> do<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.469> much<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
cuz it doesn't really do so much the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.020 
cuz it doesn't really do so much the
