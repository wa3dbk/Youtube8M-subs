00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 today I will show you the very way 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:10.660
 simple and easy bike to make a light 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:17.910
 black woman using a cell phone 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:20.760
 [Music] 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.730
 if you do not know what a black light is 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.250
 here is a special bulb that emits 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.199
 a type of light called ultra violet a 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.349
 light that we can not see then 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.030
 in if you go to see technically nor is it a 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.130
 kind of light she 's just a wave 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.469
 electromagnetic radiation very close to the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.090
 we see but we can not see 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.460
 And what good is it for us? 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.820
 Can Spot Fluorescent Things 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.180
 how much is this pen used for a party? 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.670
 and it costs about 30 reais 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.710
 in these stores great time when the type 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.860
 ads but we'll make the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.989
 our homemade black light and to do it 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.940
 we're going to need only three things 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.350
 of a cell phone 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.789
 it can not be a brick cell phone 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.100
 of those old ones have to be a bit 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.650
 The younger you have a flash will need 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.210
 a little bit of tape and this 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.360
 here is the marker 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.060
 permanent blue that the process is well 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.799
 Just look, I'm just going to paste one 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.810
 piece of adhesive tape on top of led 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.060
 phone and paint blue 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.880
 then I'll get another piece necklace 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.100
 on top and painted again is another 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.259
 piece up there and paint in blue and 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.600
 another piece up there painted from 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.159
 blue and finally the fifth bit of 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.350
 tape that I'm going to paint in blue 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.810
 It's also clear if he's thinking there. 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.150
 that after so many layers of paint 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.890
 blue and this has turned into a melech and 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.140
 It will light up crap. 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.600
 Good before testing Let's put 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.450
 some things over here react to 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.600
 black light 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:54.250
 [Music] 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.110
 and for what you have a base of 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.840
 comparison I actually wanted to make a 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.630
 little suspense even I go first 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.610
 movie but only here using the cell phone without 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.240
 this cover over I put it on then 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.150
 I'll start the mobile hood and go 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:17.819
 record it here with the light off 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:19.750
 [Music] 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.240
 finally we'll see what happens 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.850
 when I put here in front of the led 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.850
 that dark blue milex we made 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:51.849
 [Music] 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.820
 only after the Mecca room all I did 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.410
 I'll need a good excuse in the face. 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.720
 to justify this 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.730
 experiment will understand everything then 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.250
 How do the colors work? 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.890
 see here on the side I put a 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.050
 scale that are the colors visible the 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.210
 colors that we see this is the most 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.770
 less the colors of the rainbow and 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.170
 rainbow is nothing more than the 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.030
 white light decomposition white light 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.630
 sum of everything you see here 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.600
 side 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.820
 downstairs when the colors end 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.040
 comes after it is called infrared and the 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.740
 that is up there what comes next if 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.420
 ultra violet flame then the light that the 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.290
 People do not see that they were being 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.150
 cell phone 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.600
 this light that is at the end of the spectrum 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.340
 color over there violet and when 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.920
 We put that blue here in the 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.900
 against the blue nor practically 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.130
 all the visible colors that we are 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.890
 seeing here, we came to the 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.620
 just beyond violet and left 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.630
 spend some culture and olenka 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.330
 then we do not all things either 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.290
 visible and let a little of the 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.490
 Visible color and a little color and of course 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.740
 you will want to know why 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.810
 there are some things that wrap 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.640
 both in the black light because these things 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.010
 seem to have their own light when 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.410
 places in the cloud is because these things 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.170
 are called fluorescents 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.780
 they receive the black light absorb this 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.940
 light and then paddle has in the form of light 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.989
 visible it receives a light that is 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.430
 invisible and emits a light 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.900
 visible and that's why it shines 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.970
 so much so that it seems that she is 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.940
 shining alone because you're not 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.410
 seeing the color that is coming here and has 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.790
 a very cool thing you'll realize 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.440
 if you do it at home because it's the 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.790
 next if you're playing a lot 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.650
 time with black light 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.750
 even if you have none almost 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.700
 Nothing much to see, you 're welcome. 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.550
 start your eye and it will start to 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.460
 be annoyed because that light 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.140
 also eye rita only that your eye does not 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.910
 protects her because he is not 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.010
 seeing this fight 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.570
 so eye does not close when you look 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.130
 against a very strong light you will 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.169
 realize that your fashion book 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.720
 He will not close against light. 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.950
 and there's one thing that's 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.930
 very similar to 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.300
 What happens when you buy a 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.820
 sunglasses too much bum 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.100
 These sunglasses can 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.570
 exactly how this works. 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.590
 blue filter that we put in the 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:20.250
 in front of them they will see visible light but 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.960
 go to the light in the ultraviolet light 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.540
 ultraviolet will arrive with everything in your 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.360
 eye will hurt your eye because it 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.390
 It will not protect it you will 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.280
 hurt without realizing more things than 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.740
 you can do at home and you do not need 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.690
 buy like this black light here you 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:41.800
 in a world manual 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.800
 [Music] 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.830
 if you feel like doing in 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.530
 light black homely house do not forget the 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.090
 a young man here below the video and 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.270
 there are many experiences that people 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.250
 can do with it here is one of them is 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.530
 of the flowing liquid can be made 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.450
 A liquid shines a lot in the black. 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.850
 very beautiful is a very 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.920
 I did a manual of the world and 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.450
 High on that side here on the other side and I 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.160
 leave the other experiment that explains 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.550
 a little about the light spectrum that the 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:15.370
 People see it's like making a rainbow. 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:17.590
 using a dvd and a cd is defined here 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.450
 It's one thing we 're going to ask a lot. 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.130
 success here works even as a light 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.080
 really black she's as strong as 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.120
 In the black light I think it's a bit more 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.250
 weak you can not do everything 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.500
 shine like a black light 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.690
 bought black light bought I imagine 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.910
 that it has an ultraviolet band a 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.820
 little bigger or you get types 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.500
 different from ultra violet more types 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.570
 than the one that picks up that 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.090
 experience for example of you 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.620
 He wrote using solar ink saver 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.060
 Secret Using Sunscreen 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.040
 I can not do this fight 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:51.250
 here but I can do it when black 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.420
 purchased this now given the link 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.400
 thriving I'm sure it will 

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.110
 because we managed to make the 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.790
 flourishing review works very well 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.790
 using black cell light
