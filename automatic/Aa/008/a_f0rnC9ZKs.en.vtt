00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.790
 I finished cleaning x from tire to see 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.790

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.349
 hey jo although you're doing here watching 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.900
 the restaurant that maybe I can not see it 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:25.150
 you can not see it because it does not give me the 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.369
 It earns you to see it in addition or believe that 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.220
 I'm still going to let you play no goal play 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.610
 but the more I'm going to be like this god 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.340
 my own 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.250
 Juanes is suffering too much I think that 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.470
 it's time I let him play but 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.570

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.570

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.250

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.020
 why that dream he had worries me 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.760
 maybe it's not a very bad thing but a 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.059
 simple nightmare but just like 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.320
 I will ask, I will enter the house but 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.320
 how strange that juan has not arrived 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.930
 hello hello friend look friend who was going to 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.509

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.420

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.299
 that you dreamed good ok I'll tell you I dreamed of a 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.549
 town that town seemed damn was not 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.409
 very big in that dream I also heard 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.119
 some voices the material with which 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.820
 they built the houses was a material 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.860
 very strange was a horrible thing up 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.860
 I felt there was a very strong man there 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.840
 and this is a terrible thing, look, I'll tell you 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.060
 that town exists that was a town 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.649
 common and current but one day they arrived 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.840
 four types that through a ritual 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.970
 bad said that town the town was 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.280
 the only thing is that they led the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.380
 ritual some houses were burned but that 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.390
 yes this is something terrible the one who dreams 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.330
 with that town is warning that something 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.909
 very bad will happen but that is something bad 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.009
 It's going to happen without going and that's why I'm going to give you 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.149
 a map so you can get to the town 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.040
 what's up 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.160
 good here you have 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.870
 thanks good diego if I do not return alone 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.289
 I told Juan that I left for a while 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.959
 good luck 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.790
 good according to the map that diego gave me 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.340
 town is in front 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.459
 but if it's here in front I'm going to 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.640
 save the map here starts my 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.640
 adventure 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.060
 it's more scary here than in a dream 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.670
 well everything is the same as before 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.799
 that thing is right in its place 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.970
 the same well everything seems to be the same 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.700
 but that was not like that, that was 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.530
 sticks and had three heads does not matter 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.530
 I think it's better to stay that way 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.790
 the rare church is the same 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.390
 they are going I found I was not already you will see that 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.390
 has that chest inside 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.989
 it's written 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.069
 the god wakes up every 100 years in this 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.620
 year awakened when God 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.569
 wake up will be the end of the world unless 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.280
 of a brave warrior facing 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.280
 to this god and monkey to kill 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.870
 but what is this perhaps that thing that I said 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.330
 that he was a god and was a god 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.170
 well I imagine that this is what 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.170
 I must fight 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:54.360
 but also 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.360
 I'm ready for whatever comes 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.350
 but that has already awakened the god I have 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.730
 that stopping this will kill everything 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.730
 come for him 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.460
 you can not let them destroy the 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.770
 you can not help it 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.950
 I'm friends from hell and I'm 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:22.560
 more powerful than you like that does not matter 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.690
 I will defend my land like a ha road 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.730
 ha ha ha ha but how naive you are already 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.010
 you will see that the state at the moment as 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.139
 and your world will be forced to leave 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.300
 of 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:37.360
 not that not be the case that will be 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.360
 forced to make clear that no 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:44.689
 I'm defeating you'll be nothing more than 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:47.060
 Bones I'm weak but you do not defeat me 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:51.180
 wahaha ha ha ha ha ha ha you will not go and no 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:55.639
 you will return to this world and be born 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.639
 It can not be that you're going to kill me 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.620
 but what have I done if I gave saved from 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.930

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.390
