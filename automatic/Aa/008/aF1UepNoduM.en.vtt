00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.110 
to have a lot of new features hopefully
they're<00:02:23.950> going<00:02:24.070> to<00:02:24.130> put<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.340> bit<00:02:24.580> of<00:02:24.610> ecology

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
they're going to put a bit of ecology

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.300 
they're going to put a bit of ecology
for<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.570> modern<00:02:25.810> war<00:02:26.020> her<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.410> in<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.770> together<00:02:26.920> I

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
for a modern war her to in it together I

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.030 
for a modern war her to in it together I
think<00:02:27.550> both<00:02:28.209> games<00:02:28.540> have<00:02:28.810> their<00:02:29.290> own<00:02:29.320> bad

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
think both games have their own bad

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.400 
think both games have their own bad
points<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.060> think<00:02:31.330> that<00:02:31.600> call<00:02:31.990> of<00:02:32.110> duty

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
points and I think that call of duty

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.580 
points and I think that call of duty
black<00:02:32.440> ops<00:02:32.830> will<00:02:33.160> be<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.670> whole<00:02:34.630> new<00:02:35.290> game

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
black ops will be a whole new game

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.590 
black ops will be a whole new game
really<00:02:36.040> compared<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.880> modern<00:02:37.060> warfare<00:02:37.180> 2<00:02:37.569> I

may be completely wrong but I hope I'm

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.750 
may be completely wrong but I hope I'm
not<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:39.900> did<00:02:40.900> choose<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.950> skip<00:02:42.130> modern<00:02:42.610> warfare

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760
