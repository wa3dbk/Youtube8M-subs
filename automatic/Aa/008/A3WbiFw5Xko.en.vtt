00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
some weed through love and they are

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.390 
some weed through love and they are
facing<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> Dallas<00:01:16.500> Cowboys<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> road

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
facing the Dallas Cowboys on the road

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.490 
facing the Dallas Cowboys on the road
they<00:01:17.549> opened<00:01:17.909> as<00:01:18.060> plus<00:01:18.330> eight<00:01:18.570> underdogs<00:01:19.320> on

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
they opened as plus eight underdogs on

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.749 
they opened as plus eight underdogs on
the<00:01:19.590> road<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.950> now<00:01:20.070> they've<00:01:20.310> moved<00:01:20.490> down<00:01:20.729> to

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the road and now they've moved down to

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.300 
the road and now they've moved down to
plus<00:01:21.119> seven<00:01:21.540> already<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.470> think<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.159> is

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
plus seven already and I I think that is

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.160 
plus seven already and I I think that is
also<00:01:23.520> due<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.850> how<00:01:24.119> bad<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.570> cowboys<00:01:24.930> played

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
also due to how bad the cowboys played

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.690 
also due to how bad the cowboys played
and<00:01:25.439> how<00:01:25.590> well<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> Bucs<00:01:26.130> played<00:01:26.340> against<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
and how well the Bucs played against the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.910 
and how well the Bucs played against the
