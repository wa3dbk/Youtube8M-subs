hijack TDM but I also got a brand new
gaming<00:00:09.840> computer<00:00:10.260> it<00:00:10.380> has<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.590> i7<00:00:10.830> core<00:00:11.750> until<00:00:12.750> I

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
gaming computer it has a i7 core until I

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.420 
gaming computer it has a i7 core until I
7<00:00:13.440> yes<00:00:14.219> with<00:00:14.460> 47<00:00:14.880> mq<00:00:15.179> quad<00:00:15.480> core<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.250> one

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
7 yes with 47 mq quad core and it is one

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.700 
7 yes with 47 mq quad core and it is one
of<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.609> nicer<00:00:18.090> i7<00:00:18.750> well<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.260> one<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.529> low

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
of the nicer i7 well the one of the low

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.189 
of the nicer i7 well the one of the low
end<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:20.490> guess<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.390> sevens<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:21.930> can<00:00:22.050> get

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
end I guess I sevens that you can get

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.740 
end I guess I sevens that you can get
but<00:00:22.949> still<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.490> really<00:00:23.820> beastly<00:00:24.240> computer<00:00:24.600> with

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
but still a really beastly computer with

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.120 
but still a really beastly computer with
a<00:00:24.779> need<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.140> video<00:00:25.410> graphics<00:00:25.890> card

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
a need in the video graphics card

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.859 
a need in the video graphics card
achieve<00:00:26.519> 740<00:00:27.180> which<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> mid-range

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
achieve 740 which is a mid-range

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.599 
achieve 740 which is a mid-range
graphics<00:00:28.320> card<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:28.800> not<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.400> best

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
graphics card so it's not the best

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.919 
graphics card so it's not the best
graphics<00:00:30.029> card<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.300> can<00:00:30.420> get<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:30.720> about<00:00:30.900> a

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
graphics card you can get it's about a

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.959 
graphics card you can get it's about a
mid-range<00:00:31.289> one<00:00:31.529> I've<00:00:32.099> 8<00:00:32.309> gigabytes<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.759> ram

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
shock charge bouncing better combo

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.219 
shock charge bouncing better combo
because<00:01:09.090> if<00:01:09.360> that's<00:01:09.510> not<00:01:09.720> charged<00:01:09.960> doesn't

screen just going to get pwned because

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.330 
screen just going to get pwned because
you're<00:01:17.939> new<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.630> i'm<00:01:18.930> not<00:01:19.110> i'm<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:20.159> boss

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
you're new and i'm not i'm just a boss

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.580 
you're new and i'm not i'm just a boss
I've<00:01:20.700> noticed<00:01:21.479> one<00:01:21.659> thing<00:01:21.689> about<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
I've noticed one thing about this is the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.160 
I've noticed one thing about this is the
lags<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.950> lot<00:01:23.100> less<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.299> can<00:01:24.780> play<00:01:24.960> at<00:01:25.140> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
lags a lot less so I can play at a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.950 
lags a lot less so I can play at a
higher<00:01:25.380> level<00:01:25.409> which<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.040> cool<00:01:26.400> because<00:01:27.030> if

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
higher level which is cool because if

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.510 
higher level which is cool because if
it's<00:01:28.170> not<00:01:28.229> constant<00:01:28.799> lagging<00:01:29.189> when<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> go<00:01:29.490> to

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
it's not constant lagging when I go to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.160 
it's not constant lagging when I go to
shoot<00:01:29.880> or<00:01:30.210> i'm<00:01:30.479> lagging<00:01:30.689> because<00:01:30.930> i'm

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
shoot or i'm lagging because i'm

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.289 
shoot or i'm lagging because i'm
recording<00:01:31.619> or<00:01:31.740> something<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.130> i<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.880> can
