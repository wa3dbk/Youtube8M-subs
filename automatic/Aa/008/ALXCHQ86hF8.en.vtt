00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.380
 well all guys are order 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.000
 welcome back here on the canal with a new one 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.500
 video today we are someone who weighed the 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.420
 live with viewfinder how he sees he is using 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.570
 he slams it but you have asked in many of 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.070
 use proust or even knowing that is 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.630
 i 'm not yet knowing scene has not 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.849
 yet discovered the reason why 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.759
 many of you want to see me play 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.079
 with this weapon simply in 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.270
 comments from the last video both from 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.190
 first episode in three four dates thu 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.320
 use the diamond svad and with the selector of 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.550
 fire i obviously is since the videos 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.260
 I do them for you I can't do that 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.670
 satisfy what you want to see 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:49.300
 then your needs and then 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.679
 here I put the selector of 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.719
 fire and I want to clarify first 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.719
 which really sucks as a weapon 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:04.850
 the emptying used only with 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:07.670
 the burst fire of three because it is a lot 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:12.910
 precise as a one shot weapon sometimes there is 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.910
 a burst and the opponent dies instead 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.470
 let us thank heaven that this war 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.760
 a retard who has shed for three 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.070
 quarter of an hour I was on the stairs not 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.590
 I could catch myself with the 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.869
 fire selector weapon ten is 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:38.229
 very much to recoil if the weapon recoils 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:38.229
 really shit 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:49.930
 dies the asshole speaks and then how 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.930
 you can see I'm not using away 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.860
 I 'm not using the usual strix 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.130
 ie wav 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.409
 when there was perhaps a swarm of saccans 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.030
 for the simple fact that having 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.190
 used in the last video wanted 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.390
 use some of the alternative series 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.280
 in this I am now one from you 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.989
 so let's not shit and take it 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.459
 surely it was kajol visa or cazz o 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.900
 also the stock trend the problem 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.200
 now it comes because we have the lab the 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.730
 activated disorder so I'm playing 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.760
 a pretty quiet game I want 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.260
 dogs and a bis would be very much 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.260
 but much simpler 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.280
 here our face and die perfect 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.700
 now ours can start well 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.070
 game because I really want to see 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.770
 now that I have the design how many 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.600
 14 0 and will be able to fight me 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.090
 I am a 1 from dogs I must succeed in 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.980
 pull them if not ok dogs well now the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.510
 game yes that really starts to be done 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.920
 interesting though guys if you want 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.700
 use a streak in my opinion 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.410
 bestial put the spare drone 19 0 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.820
 put the spare drone in mine 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.530
 opinion really has the most streak 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:11.030
 devastating because obviously I speak to the 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.730
 out of the swarm dogs than those 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:20.959
 it is well known that they are quite sick 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:23.090
 and dog save me and well 20 21 are dead 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.320
 pretty stupid anyway 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.610
 we continue the game without making ourselves 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.650
 conditioning from a stupid death 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.150
 let's try to redo the strips 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.660
 the problem madonna that camper the 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.790
 problem is that kids from dogs 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.950
 27 1 beautiful problem is that I'm not 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.750
 using places and new ones maybe I had 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.000
 already read in some videos I don't know about 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.530
 deathmatch and not fundamental more 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.840
 because because obviously the sponsors 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.310
 random and know where they were born if from 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.709
 one part or the other really a lot but 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.480
 very useful we are 29 1 we try to 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.280
 manage well as the team 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.440
 on 46 maybe redo the strips 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.440
 it could really be a good thing 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.700
 there is obviously to be counted the fact that 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.780
 he's playing with a shitty weapon 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.150
 very rarely like the henin one 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.830
 game like this on nuclear or something 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.540
 ass up 50 more came out of it 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.950
 unfortunately I'm not using the n 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.200
 however I am a little short of the vis then 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.200
 let's manage the area for a moment here 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:22.980
 die perfecto let's see if we can 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.930
 take one here that was born if it was born 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.430
 no hans was born with his companions 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.550
 however you can redo the strips 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.050
 for a second time lavina arrival 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.580
 great companion we come from here and 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.260
 I'm at one of the faces I could do the 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.260
 second would be really great 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:48.090
 let's go get the drone by killing the two 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:50.550
 don't turn around don't turn around very good ok 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.580
 escort drones 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.000
 okay i threw myself down enough to 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:00.000
 suicide 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.320
 ok 38 1 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.990
 let's hope he makes the last quince 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.060
 fidanzi lasko to double the dogs and it 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.190
 swarm there I was joking only skis and alone 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.229
 canine the companion did the multi e 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.669
 so now it becomes more difficult 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.990
 indeed it becomes almost impossible I want 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.450
 get to 40 pounds on hopefully the 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.320
 drone kill 1 before the game gets 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.700
 turn to term ok guys 41 1 match 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.660
 in my opinion very good also for 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.330
 the weapon you gave enough 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.130
 little more 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.539
 41 of times I have so I can't that 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.340
 be glad i hope i am 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:30.840
 liked many of you but in the case of 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.640
 make a second game but I think it is 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.380
 better so that the matches 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.160
 they are more concise and fun to 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.320
 to watch 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.150
 long and to increase the wait for a 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.500
 next episode here the boys let me 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.270
 know with karma you want me to play 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.190
 really next episodes of the body 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.210
 minimally strong for today as a viewfinder 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.210
 everything is beautiful
