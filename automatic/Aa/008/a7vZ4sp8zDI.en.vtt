from it now in black and white too so

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.030 
from it now in black and white too so
the<00:05:46.930> ones<00:05:47.110> that<00:05:47.320> we<00:05:47.410> find<00:05:47.650> will<00:05:47.920> have

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
the ones that we find will have

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.770 
the ones that we find will have
overworld<00:05:48.550> sprites<00:05:48.850> in<00:05:49.000> the<00:05:49.090> entry<00:05:49.390> link<00:05:49.600> I

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
overworld sprites in the entry link I

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.570 
overworld sprites in the entry link I
know<00:05:50.020> it<00:05:50.230> isn't<00:05:50.500> the<00:05:50.560> biggest<00:05:50.830> feature<00:05:51.160> but<00:05:51.490> it

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
know it isn't the biggest feature but it

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.790 
know it isn't the biggest feature but it
was<00:05:51.670> a<00:05:51.700> really<00:05:51.940> nice<00:05:52.210> one<00:05:52.420> to<00:05:52.540> have<00:05:52.750> also<00:05:53.410> the

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
was a really nice one to have also the

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.860 
was a really nice one to have also the
Wi-Fi<00:05:54.190> system<00:05:54.610> for<00:05:54.790> battling<00:05:55.150> is<00:05:55.420> still

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
Wi-Fi system for battling is still

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.020 
Wi-Fi system for battling is still
pretty<00:05:56.290> bad<00:05:56.530> but<00:05:57.100> that's<00:05:57.250> more<00:05:57.430> the<00:05:57.610> DSS

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
pretty bad but that's more the DSS

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.610 
pretty bad but that's more the DSS
hardware's<00:05:58.480> fault<00:05:58.780> rather<00:05:59.110> than<00:05:59.320> the<00:05:59.410> games

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
hardware's fault rather than the games

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.190 
hardware's fault rather than the games
themselves<00:06:00.250> also<00:06:00.700> The<00:06:01.030> Seeker<00:06:01.390> is<00:06:01.540> cool<00:06:01.810> but

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
themselves also The Seeker is cool but

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.170 
themselves also The Seeker is cool but
honestly<00:06:02.650> I<00:06:02.770> kind<00:06:03.130> of<00:06:03.190> find<00:06:03.370> it<00:06:03.460> useless<00:06:03.940> I

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
honestly I kind of find it useless I

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.550 
honestly I kind of find it useless I
think<00:06:04.570> it's<00:06:04.660> great<00:06:04.780> how<00:06:04.960> you<00:06:04.990> could<00:06:05.170> set<00:06:05.380> up<00:06:05.410> a

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
think it's great how you could set up a

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.050 
think it's great how you could set up a
battle<00:06:05.860> and<00:06:06.010> trade<00:06:06.220> with<00:06:06.370> friends<00:06:06.730> right<00:06:06.910> on

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
battle and trade with friends right on

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.120 
battle and trade with friends right on
the<00:06:07.150> spot<00:06:07.390> but<00:06:08.140> in<00:06:08.260> terms<00:06:08.470> of<00:06:08.590> functionality

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
the spot but in terms of functionality

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.610 
the spot but in terms of functionality
as<00:06:09.520> far<00:06:10.000> as<00:06:10.090> sleep<00:06:10.360> mode<00:06:10.540> goes<00:06:10.810> it's<00:06:11.110> not<00:06:11.230> very

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
as far as sleep mode goes it's not very

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.110 
as far as sleep mode goes it's not very
good<00:06:11.830> I<00:06:12.040> wish<00:06:12.340> there<00:06:12.550> was<00:06:12.610> an<00:06:12.760> option<00:06:13.090> to

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
good I wish there was an option to

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.790 
good I wish there was an option to
change<00:06:13.420> the<00:06:13.690> bottom<00:06:14.020> screen<00:06:14.260> to<00:06:14.320> display<00:06:14.590> the

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
change the bottom screen to display the

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.650 
change the bottom screen to display the
menu<00:06:14.950> like<00:06:15.430> HeartGold<00:06:15.850> and<00:06:15.880> SoulSilver<00:06:15.970> did

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
menu like HeartGold and SoulSilver did

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.420
