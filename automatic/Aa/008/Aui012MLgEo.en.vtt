a Zodiac that lives right where we're

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.689 
a Zodiac that lives right where we're
standing<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:15.269> zodiac<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.350> ROV<00:00:16.890> zodiac

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
standing that zodiac is the ROV zodiac

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.080 
standing that zodiac is the ROV zodiac
and<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.449> carries<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.230> console<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.520> has<00:00:20.789> the

and it carries this console this has the

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.620 
and it carries this console this has the
generator<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.279> the<00:00:23.279> operators<00:00:24.029> console

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
joystick control panel for the ROV so

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.730 
joystick control panel for the ROV so
that<00:00:30.150> sits<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.660> zodiac<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.260> sit<00:00:31.560> in

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
that sits in the zodiac and I sit in

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.910 
that sits in the zodiac and I sit in
that<00:00:31.980> they<00:00:32.640> were<00:00:32.669> down<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.090> 40<00:00:33.540> meters<00:00:33.899> now<00:00:34.170> and

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
that they were down to 40 meters now and

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.959 
that they were down to 40 meters now and
right<00:00:35.520> over<00:00:35.730> here<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.260> ROV<00:00:37.590> itself<00:00:38.219> she's

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
right over here is the ROV itself she's

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.490 
right over here is the ROV itself she's
as<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.450> see<00:00:39.600> just<00:00:39.809> about<00:00:39.899> three<00:00:40.260> feet

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
as you can see just about three feet

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.100 
as you can see just about three feet
long<00:00:40.559> weighs<00:00:41.280> about<00:00:41.460> 100<00:00:42.090> pounds<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:43.050> two

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
long weighs about 100 pounds so two

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.840 
long weighs about 100 pounds so two
people<00:00:43.500> can<00:00:43.770> easily<00:00:43.980> pick<00:00:44.370> her<00:00:44.489> up<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.789> put

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
people can easily pick her up and put

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.209 
people can easily pick her up and put
her<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> water<00:00:45.390> manually<00:00:45.960> she's<00:00:46.890> sitting

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
her in the water manually she's sitting

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.979 
her in the water manually she's sitting
on<00:00:47.340> top<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.610> her<00:00:47.820> cable<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.510> have<00:00:48.600> three

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
on top of her cable we have three

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.560 
on top of her cable we have three
sections<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.620> cable<00:00:50.010> totaling<00:00:50.610> about<00:00:50.700> 900

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
sections of cable totaling about 900

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.920 
sections of cable totaling about 900
feet<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.440> she<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.770> go<00:00:52.890> down<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.309> 500<00:00:53.640> feet<00:00:54.420> so

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
feet and she can go down to 500 feet so

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.020 
feet and she can go down to 500 feet so
about<00:00:55.170> three<00:00:55.649> times<00:00:55.890> at<00:00:56.160> least<00:00:56.399> three<00:00:56.789> times

about three times at least three times

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.090 
about three times at least three times
deeper<00:00:57.570> than<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.079> safe<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:58.469> scuba<00:00:58.770> divers

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
deeper than it's safe for scuba divers

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.709 
deeper than it's safe for scuba divers
to<00:00:59.219> go<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.699> regular<00:01:00.210> air<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.870> cable<00:01:01.829> carries

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
to go on regular air the cable carries

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.840 
to go on regular air the cable carries
commands<00:01:03.719> from<00:01:04.460> console<00:01:05.460> which<00:01:05.700> has

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
commands from console which has

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.060 
commands from console which has
joysticks<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.689> toggle<00:01:07.170> switches<00:01:07.439> you

thrusters there are five individual
thrusters<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.170> machines<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.710> she<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:14.010> move

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
thrusters and machines so she can move

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.270 
thrusters and machines so she can move

camera is slung there on the front and

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.149 
camera is slung there on the front and
the<00:01:21.600> cable<00:01:21.930> carries<00:01:22.229> all<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.409> signals<00:01:22.890> down

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
the cable carries all the signals down

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.460 
the cable carries all the signals down
and<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:24.060> carries<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.540> video<00:01:24.810> signal<00:01:25.049> back

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
and then carries the video signal back

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.070 
and then carries the video signal back
to<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.070> zodiac<00:01:26.430> where<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:26.820> recorded<00:01:27.450> my

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
to the zodiac where we recorded my

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.899 
to the zodiac where we recorded my
favorite<00:01:28.619> piece<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.860> technology<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> ROV

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
favorite piece of technology is the ROV

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.420 
favorite piece of technology is the ROV
no<00:01:30.720> doubt<00:01:30.930> because<00:01:31.939> it<00:01:32.939> increases<00:01:33.780> our

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
no doubt because it increases our

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.370 
no doubt because it increases our
ability<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.460> sense<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.360> marine<00:01:36.720> world<00:01:36.960> so

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
ability to sense the marine world so

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.249 
ability to sense the marine world so
dramatically<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.280> really<00:01:39.150> enjoyed<00:01:39.259> diving

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
dramatically I really enjoyed diving

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.580 
dramatically I really enjoyed diving
with<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.740> handheld<00:01:41.310> camera<00:01:41.790> and

sharing that kind of footage with the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.349 
sharing that kind of footage with the
guests<00:01:45.020> but<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.619> ROV<00:01:45.950> takes<00:01:46.460> me<00:01:46.729> into<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:47.030> world
