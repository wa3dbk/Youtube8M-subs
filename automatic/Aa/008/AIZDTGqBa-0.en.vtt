that's<00:01:49.380> what<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:50.009> do<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.430> to

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
that's what you have to do you have to

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.609 
that's what you have to do you have to
get<00:01:50.909> something<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.600> if<00:01:51.869> you're<00:01:52.590> not

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
get something like that if you're not

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.350 
get something like that if you're not
there<00:01:53.040> that's<00:01:53.340> one<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.939> reasons<00:01:54.240> where

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
there that's one of the reasons where

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.420 
there that's one of the reasons where
you're<00:01:54.509> not<00:01:54.600> seeing<00:01:54.840> results<00:01:55.310> that's<00:01:56.310> why

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
you're not seeing results that's why

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.709 
you're not seeing results that's why
you're<00:01:56.579> not<00:01:56.700> building<00:01:57.030> muscle<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.540> losing

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
you're not building muscle and losing

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.600 
you're not building muscle and losing
the<00:01:57.899> fat<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.350> possible<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.100> build<00:01:59.250> muscle

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
the fat it is possible to build muscle

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.310 
the fat it is possible to build muscle
in<00:01:59.700> fat<00:01:59.939> at<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.090> same<00:02:00.149> time<00:02:00.509> but<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.170> only

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
in fat at the same time but that only

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.319 
in fat at the same time but that only
happens<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.159> first<00:02:02.460> or<00:02:02.790> second<00:02:03.180> year

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
happens in the first or second year

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.060 
happens in the first or second year
after<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.960> becomes<00:02:04.290> very<00:02:04.380> very

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
after that it becomes very very

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.819 
after that it becomes very very
difficult<00:02:06.290> so<00:02:07.290> take<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.680> as<00:02:07.799> a

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
difficult so take that as a

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.609 
difficult so take that as a
consideration<00:02:08.220> look<00:02:08.670> at<00:02:08.789> your<00:02:08.879> macros<00:02:09.300> and

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
consideration look at your macros and

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.350 
consideration look at your macros and
there<00:02:10.619> are<00:02:10.770> calculators<00:02:11.370> online<00:02:11.760> they<00:02:12.120> can<00:02:12.270> do

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
there are calculators online they can do

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.690 
there are calculators online they can do

your<00:02:57.019> most<00:02:57.200> what<00:02:57.350> is<00:02:57.500> possible<00:02:58.100> it's<00:02:58.580> not<00:02:58.760> very

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
your most what is possible it's not very

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.610 
your most what is possible it's not very
easy<00:02:59.060> but<00:02:59.600> it's<00:02:59.750> possible<00:03:01.150> but<00:03:02.150> anyways

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
easy but it's possible but anyways

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.420 
easy but it's possible but anyways
another<00:03:03.620> thing<00:03:03.830> you<00:03:03.920> have<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.130> take<00:03:04.280> into

day<00:03:20.780> doing<00:03:21.320> workouts<00:03:21.799> and<00:03:22.040> training<00:03:22.609> and<00:03:22.760> it

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
day doing workouts and training and it

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.930
