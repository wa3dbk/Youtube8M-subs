00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.190
 reduction super atmosphere of madness 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.010

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.750

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:49.460

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.909

 julie hello tacot you will not guess 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.060
 never the super rangers came out in 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.800
 store yes that's why I call 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.300
 there are a lot of people coming to the 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.680
 toy shop but among them 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.780
 some do not borrow the passage 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.090
 pedestrian if we do not do anything he goes there 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.250
 to have an accident thank you we come 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.250

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.170
 we go to the shop that I would have first 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.610
 okay but as long as yours 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.770
 promise that you can wear irrigates in 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.630
 last June there remains only one 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.940
 only good mom of the faults of the most 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:03:01.420
 dear to the kevin went to the pedestrian crossing 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:03.900
 that we cross a pedestrian crossing but he 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.900
 is too far 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.960
 why we should cross at 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:14.250
 pedestrian crossing and not him 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.250
 the entv nathan what for he is for me 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.670
 you saw I have to stop 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.150
 the 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.140
 luckily kevin is doing well and 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.489
 except 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.019
 it's not only dangerous to 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.280
 cross outside pedestrian crossings 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.159
 but in addition it is illegal 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.540
 I do not know where my head was when 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.340
 children see other adults 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.110
 opponents or in the cloud they think 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.090
 that they can do it and it's like 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.720
 that two accidents happen as to 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.609
 you to kevin 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.530
 if you have to cross the street either 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.480
 smart borrows a pedestrian crossing 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.099
 a walkway or underpass 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.810
 and always truth that the little man 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.370
 and green but what am I doing on 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.959
 a pedestrian crossing is really very far 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.530
 the only thing that matters is the 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.389
 security 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.820
 even if you're in a hurry and you're in 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.830
 delay your balloon crossing the street 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.600
 or that someone you call he 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.949
 Never cross outside 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.020
 nails i agree 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.910
 yet I held her hand but a 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.900
 he escaped me that happens more often 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.090
 we think 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.220
 but there is a good way to avoid it a 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.080
 child escapes easily trust the 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.820
 hand for more security 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.039
 better to take it by the rice wrist 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.820
 thank you I am very grateful to you 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:47.430
 both and me too 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.660
 hold the net for you I am 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.789
 sure it's your retirees the 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.370
 tastes so nice to you but I have a good 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:56.010
 bigger heroes than super kroger or 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:02.250
 bigger than if bell rogers way 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:05.550
 now my true thrash but I have 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.360
 afraid of not being for sale then so much 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.360
 worse for the reduction 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.670
 did not cross anywhere look 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.970
 always if there is a pedestrian crossing at the 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.970
 next
