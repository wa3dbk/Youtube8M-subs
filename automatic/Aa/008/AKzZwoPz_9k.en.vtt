00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
tangles so I'm gonna start with a small

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.390 
tangles so I'm gonna start with a small
section<00:00:22.730> right<00:00:23.730> on<00:00:23.939> her<00:00:24.119> part<00:00:24.830> I'm<00:00:25.830> gonna

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
section right on her part I'm gonna

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.550 
section right on her part I'm gonna
split<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.820> into<00:00:27.420> three<00:00:27.779> I'm<00:00:28.050> gonna<00:00:28.289> take

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
split that into three I'm gonna take

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.169 
split that into three I'm gonna take
these<00:00:28.740> start<00:00:29.160> them<00:00:29.250> off<00:00:29.340> just<00:00:29.640> like<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.820> normal

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
these start them off just like a normal

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.030 
these start them off just like a normal
French<00:00:30.420> braid<00:00:30.689> rather<00:00:31.170> than<00:00:31.380> traveling<00:00:31.800> down

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
French braid rather than traveling down

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.900 
French braid rather than traveling down
the<00:00:32.160> back<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.550> head

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
the back of the head

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.940 
the back of the head
traveling<00:00:33.540> all<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.110> way<00:00:34.230> around<00:00:34.680> hence

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
traveling all the way around hence

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.770 
traveling all the way around hence
around<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> world<00:00:35.610> braid<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.600> only

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
around the world braid and the only

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.660 
around the world braid and the only
variation<00:00:37.290> other<00:00:37.680> than<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> French<00:00:38.190> braid<00:00:38.399> is

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
variation other than a French braid is

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.180 
variation other than a French braid is
that<00:00:39.090> for<00:00:39.960> me<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.350> find<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.070> more

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
that for me I find that it's more

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.220 
that for me I find that it's more
versatile<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.700> easier<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.360> just<00:00:42.750> grab<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
versatile and easier to just grab and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.040 
versatile and easier to just grab and
add<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:44.010> one<00:00:44.700> side<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.450> once<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.780> get<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
add to one side and once you get the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.200 
add to one side and once you get the
rhythm<00:00:46.230> going<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.309> you're<00:00:47.610> holding<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.969> little

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
rhythm going and you're holding a little

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.299 
rhythm going and you're holding a little
bit<00:00:48.360> more<00:00:48.539> hair<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.930> definitely<00:00:49.500> gets<00:00:49.649> easier

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
bit more hair it definitely gets easier

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.279 
bit more hair it definitely gets easier
when<00:00:50.879> you're<00:00:51.030> adding<00:00:51.210> from<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:51.809> side<00:00:52.050> it

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
when you're adding from one side it

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.020 
when you're adding from one side it
leads<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.800> braid<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> little<00:00:53.160> bit<00:00:53.520> more<00:00:53.730> loose

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
leads the braid a little bit more loose

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.029 
leads the braid a little bit more loose
obviously<00:00:54.719> because<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.989> have<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.590> free

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
obviously because you have this in free

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.040 
obviously because you have this in free
and<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:56.850> find<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.090> that's<00:00:57.270> makes<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.960> a

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
and I just find that that's makes it a

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.990 
and I just find that that's makes it a
lot<00:00:58.199> more<00:00:58.309> malleable<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.370> way<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.760> can

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
lot more malleable that way you can

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.360 
lot more malleable that way you can
either<00:01:00.120> turn<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.600> up<00:01:00.809> or<00:01:01.079> flip<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.590> down<00:01:01.770> great

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
either turn it up or flip it down great

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.759 
either turn it up or flip it down great
hair<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:03.059> hot<00:01:03.300> summer<00:01:03.600> days<00:01:03.899> weekends

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
hair for like hot summer days weekends

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.010 
hair for like hot summer days weekends
at<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.890> beach<00:01:05.220> cuz<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> great<00:01:06.689> look<00:01:06.900> to

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
at the beach cuz this is a great look to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.050 
at the beach cuz this is a great look to
wear<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.439> even<00:01:07.770> like<00:01:07.979> two<00:01:08.340> three<00:01:08.580> days<00:01:08.670> at<00:01:09.000> a

wear for even like two three days at a
time

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
time

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.070 
time
let<00:01:10.110> me<00:01:10.170> braid<00:01:10.439> all<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.770> way<00:01:11.040> down<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:12.750> very

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
let me braid all the way down the very

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.510 
let me braid all the way down the very
end<00:01:13.970> and<00:01:14.970> go<00:01:15.119> ahead<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.450> use<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> small<00:01:16.520> clear

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
end and go ahead and use a small clear

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.030 
end and go ahead and use a small clear
plastic<00:01:17.790> rubber<00:01:18.240> band<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.320> now<00:01:19.680> would<00:01:19.830> be<00:01:19.860> at

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
plastic rubber band and now would be at

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.490 
plastic rubber band and now would be at
a<00:01:20.100> time<00:01:20.340> if<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:21.180> want<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.450> go<00:01:21.570> ahead<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.140> kind

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
a time if you want to go ahead and kind

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.410 
a time if you want to go ahead and kind
of<00:01:22.619> get<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> jump<00:01:23.430> start<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.970> looser

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
of get a jump start on that looser

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.219 
of get a jump start on that looser
texture<00:01:24.960> moving<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.740> around<00:01:25.830> maybe<00:01:26.670> even

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
texture moving it around maybe even

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.050 
texture moving it around maybe even
clean<00:01:28.229> apart<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.619> couple<00:01:28.770> bits<00:01:29.159> once<00:01:29.880> I'm

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
clean apart a couple bits once I'm

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.760 
clean apart a couple bits once I'm
finished<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.869> satisfied<00:01:31.350> with<00:01:31.470> where<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
finished it satisfied with where the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.069 
finished it satisfied with where the
nest<00:01:31.979> enos<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> braid<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.880> sitting<00:01:33.210> you
