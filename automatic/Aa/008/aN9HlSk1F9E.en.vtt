00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:10.610
 and what wave 2 speaks to them mark mex and ones 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.620
 guys welcome to a new video of 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.290
 meet and ghost and first of all a 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.630
 great apology for not uploading videos 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.520
 the last days because let's say that in 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.070
 my computer I already said it on twitter and 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.660
 by facebook those who follow me as they are 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.369
 they learned to see why but basically 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.710
 what happened was that my computer was 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.029
 decomposed and can not make videos like this 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.340
 how good already changing the subject 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.399
 totally that is not the issue before 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.010
 to start I tell you about the game is 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.239
 a very very fast game in big or 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.210
 hectic 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.070
 the result is not super spectacular 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.870
 for the same reason that it is very very fast 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.489
 departure but still me and I was made a 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.010
 pretty pretty entertaining departure and 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.260
 I quite liked one staff so 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.179
 good to see if the subject likes and that has 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.100
 seemed like these two weeks leading 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:57.289
 out the game before exceeding 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.149
 August I have to say guys that do not 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.219
 I was as excited as with others with 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.199
 the doris that we say as in wordpress 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.580
 3 I was super excited when I was going to 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.320
 leave with targets or was very 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.500
 excited but with the likes because 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.110
 but I did not feel like superior 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.740
 what was already super expected because 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.810
 come out and for example extension that 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.210
 let's say it's like new zombies from 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.070
 this call of duty ghosts I did not find 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.460
 personally very funny indeed not 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.990
 He entertained me for nothing because I do not know if 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.000
 is new is innovative but good 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.600
 I do not know how I did not call the 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.729
 attention for nothing and the campaign the 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.950
 the truth is a hoot I ended up on a 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.140
 day in veteran difficulty which is the 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.270
 maximum difficulty I liked very much 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.360
 but very much it was very very well made 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.340
 and I say I liked it a lot about the 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.170
 multiplayer that is obviously the most 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.229
 important of these games leaves 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.240
 very much to be desired for several things and 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.160
 I'm not saying it 's bad that I do not 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.660
 like because in fact it's this game 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.300
 multiplayer I like quite a lot 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.280
 that it has some faults and so on 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.560
 example the failures are the fÃ©lix pons 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.840
 As you know they are super super 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.850
 super bad facts if in the blow 3 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.720
 they were badly done here in this by 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.780
 freebox are a thousand times worse 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.990
 also the game for the same thing lends itself 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.950
 there are many many many covers 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.900
 because for example you move 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.910
 excessively fast so obviously 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.480
 you have to go I do not know how to take care of you 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:30.430
 lives and so on and that makes the game 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.220
 pay that every time and also that there 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.350
 some but that help head that 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.660
 you are totally invisible in the mini 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.970
 maps and that part I do not like 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.440
 a lot in is exaggerating the amount of 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.390
 people 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.400
 that change and others that I have found 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.310
 in this color and ghost and that how can 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.260
 see the stabs there's command but without 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.030
 have just a park for that 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
 that is something that I dislike 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.120
 quite and it goes on a pretty streak 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.150
 good and I find last blade 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.720
 as if nothing like that is the value that does not 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.720
 I like it for nothing 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.499
 the streak of assault too and say that 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.870
 they disappoint me a lot because it does not kill 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:10.120
 it is not said that it is a streak of 15 that is 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.670
 just the maxim that is the crazy and not 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.769
 kill almost nothing is very very difficult 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.049
 you kill with that streak and also with the 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.439
 helicopter with the pilot of the 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:22.209
 helicopter and good the hacks too 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.040
 completely spoil the game 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.790
 because it enters several hacked games 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.049
 and the hack stayed permanently 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.819
 here it is not seen but because it is no longer 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.980
 has the hack but let's say that for every 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.469
 low assistance capture anything 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.540
 that bm of points I also give a point 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:39.430
 of squadron so of squats or of 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.599
 pennant so wearing something very 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.629
 annoyed because every time he is giving me 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.609
 a squash point and something that is a 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.290
 the point of saying guys is the connection 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.870
 I do not know how on earth this new 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.849
 connection system but it's already 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.819
 quite compensated besides the departures 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:57.010
 I met many, many, many 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.889
 of you practically in every game 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.480
 what game do I meet with a writer and 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.219
 In general, I find many 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.340
 players that I know and I like that 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:08.050
 Pretty and infinity ward in conclusion 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.810
 he makes excellent campaigns 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.430
 multiplayer is really bad so it's the 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.680
 true a game that I like but like 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.239
 I 've always said if you 're not a fan of 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.950
 call of duty the truth you do not buy it 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.630
 because you're going to end up hating call of 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.010
 duty is that nothing guys I hope you 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.230
 have liked this little video I myself 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.910
 dismissal I'm brand next and see you in the 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.910
 next video goodbye
