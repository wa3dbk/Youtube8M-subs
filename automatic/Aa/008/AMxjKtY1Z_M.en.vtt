and<00:00:07.049> what<00:00:07.230> I've<00:00:07.350> done<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.799> I've<00:00:08.010> run<00:00:08.220> it<00:00:08.340> in<00:00:08.490> a

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
and what I've done is I've run it in a

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.030 
and what I've done is I've run it in a
little<00:00:09.750> test<00:00:09.990> rig<00:00:10.200> similar<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.679> have<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.830> cup

that<00:00:11.509> so<00:00:12.509> I'm<00:00:12.660> gonna<00:00:13.070> do<00:00:14.070> she<00:00:14.309> writes<00:00:15.440> it's

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
that so I'm gonna do she writes it's

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.040 
that so I'm gonna do she writes it's
flat<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.279> we've<00:00:17.430> got<00:00:19.550> no<00:00:20.550> response<00:00:20.910> at<00:00:21.150> all<00:00:21.330> so

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
flat so we've got no response at all so

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.660 
flat so we've got no response at all so
you<00:00:22.109> you've<00:00:22.769> been<00:00:23.010> playing<00:00:23.310> you've<00:00:23.550> been

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
you you've been playing you've been

you you've been playing you've been
flying<00:00:24.439> took<00:00:25.439> too<00:00:25.710> far<00:00:25.949> another<00:00:26.189> helicopter

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
flying took too far another helicopter

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.000 
flying took too far another helicopter
one<00:00:26.789> tip<00:00:27.029> off<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:28.189> the<00:00:29.189> battery<00:00:30.590> to<00:00:31.590> test<00:00:31.859> it

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
one tip off so the battery to test it

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.200 
one tip off so the battery to test it
it's<00:00:35.010> too<00:00:35.309> low<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.610> show<00:00:35.790> up<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.180> on<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.750> testa

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
it's too low to show up on on the testa

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
it's too low to show up on on the testa
so<00:00:39.410> it's<00:00:40.410> more<00:00:40.620> or<00:00:40.680> less<00:00:40.710> flat<00:00:41.040> well<00:00:41.760> below<00:00:42.090> its

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
so it's more or less flat well below its

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.950 
so it's more or less flat well below its
