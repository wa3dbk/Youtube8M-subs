when<00:00:28.180> I<00:00:28.210> was<00:00:28.450> flicking<00:00:28.720> it<00:00:28.960> down<00:00:29.200> I<00:00:29.590> left<00:00:29.919> out

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
when I was flicking it down I left out

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.020 
when I was flicking it down I left out
two<00:00:30.460> little<00:00:30.880> pieces<00:00:31.090> of<00:00:31.270> hair<00:00:31.599> on<00:00:31.869> the<00:00:32.140> top<00:00:32.169> and

two little pieces of hair on the top and

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.670 
two little pieces of hair on the top and
they're<00:00:34.030> very<00:00:34.329> thin<00:00:34.809> there's<00:00:35.110> not<00:00:35.260> much<00:00:35.410> hair

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680

on<00:00:35.800> each<00:00:35.950> one<00:00:36.219> and<00:00:36.550> then<00:00:36.610> I've<00:00:36.760> wet<00:00:37.000> them<00:00:37.239> down

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
on each one and then I've wet them down

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.990 
on each one and then I've wet them down
with<00:00:37.809> a<00:00:38.140> lot<00:00:38.649> of<00:00:38.710> water<00:00:39.070> it's<00:00:39.370> got<00:00:39.520> to<00:00:39.670> be<00:00:39.790> wet

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
with a lot of water it's got to be wet

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.330 
with a lot of water it's got to be wet
to<00:00:40.270> do<00:00:40.420> this<00:00:40.680> but<00:00:41.680> you<00:00:41.800> just<00:00:42.010> start<00:00:42.280> by

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
to do this but you just start by

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.330 
to do this but you just start by
crossing<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.210> two<00:00:43.570> pieces<00:00:43.810> of<00:00:43.960> hair<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:44.650> then

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
crossing the two pieces of hair and then

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.280 
crossing the two pieces of hair and then
bringing<00:00:45.730> one<00:00:46.210> side<00:00:46.540> up<00:00:46.750> through<00:00:46.990> the<00:00:47.079> middle

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
bringing one side up through the middle

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.310 
bringing one side up through the middle
just<00:00:47.650> like<00:00:47.770> you're<00:00:47.980> tying<00:00:48.370> a<00:00:48.550> knot<00:00:48.730> and<00:00:49.210> then

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
just like you're tying a knot and then

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.160 
just like you're tying a knot and then
bring<00:00:50.320> it<00:00:50.350> right<00:00:50.500> down<00:00:50.920> to<00:00:51.160> her<00:00:51.370> scalp<00:00:51.730> and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
bring it right down to her scalp and

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.380 
bring it right down to her scalp and
then<00:00:53.170> you're<00:00:53.320> going<00:00:53.530> to<00:00:53.620> do<00:00:53.800> that<00:00:53.980> again<00:00:54.390> only

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
then you're going to do that again only

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.970 
then you're going to do that again only
this<00:00:55.660> time<00:00:55.720> don't<00:00:56.260> bring<00:00:56.470> it<00:00:56.650> all<00:00:56.800> the<00:00:56.829> way

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
this time don't bring it all the way

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.760 
this time don't bring it all the way
down<00:00:57.100> leave<00:00:57.820> it<00:00:57.850> loose<00:00:58.270> to<00:00:58.660> let<00:00:59.079> it<00:00:59.170> form<00:00:59.440> a

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
down leave it loose to let it form a

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.570 
down leave it loose to let it form a
circle<00:01:00.760> like<00:01:01.180> that<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:02.500> then<00:01:03.399> do<00:01:03.579> it<00:01:03.670> again

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
circle like that and then do it again

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.030 
circle like that and then do it again
and<00:01:06.000> try<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.570> get<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.930> little<00:01:07.170> length<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
and try and get the little length of the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.060 
and try and get the little length of the
chain<00:01:08.310> about<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.000> same<00:01:09.480> width<00:01:10.230> apart<00:01:10.410> all<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
chain about the same width apart all the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.990 
chain about the same width apart all the
way<00:01:11.190> down<00:01:11.370> so<00:01:11.730> that<00:01:11.760> they're<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.120> same<00:01:12.150> size

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
way down so that they're the same size

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.250 
way down so that they're the same size
you<00:01:15.000> really<00:01:15.330> do<00:01:15.510> need<00:01:15.660> to<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.080> hair

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260
