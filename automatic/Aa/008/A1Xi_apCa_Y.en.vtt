00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
the time so my name stuck I look at some

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.969 
the time so my name stuck I look at some
of<00:01:41.120> the<00:01:41.330> older<00:01:41.690> work<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.260> I<00:01:42.500> like<00:01:42.800> the

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
of the older work and I like the

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.380 
of the older work and I like the
concepts<00:01:43.760> I<00:01:43.940> could<00:01:44.300> tell<00:01:44.570> that<00:01:44.840> I<00:01:45.680> was<00:01:46.390> driving

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
concepts I could tell that I was driving

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.499 
concepts I could tell that I was driving
cab<00:01:47.630> and<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:49.190> work<00:01:49.430> wasn't<00:01:49.670> real<00:01:50.000> polished

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
cab and the work wasn't real polished

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.020 
cab and the work wasn't real polished
but<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:51.020> concept<00:01:51.770> came<00:01:52.009> through<00:01:52.340> real<00:01:52.580> good<00:01:52.850> I

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
but the concept came through real good I

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.660 
but the concept came through real good I
think<00:01:56.030> drying<00:01:56.530> that's<00:01:57.530> what<00:01:57.740> I<00:01:57.770> started<00:01:58.190> to<00:01:58.490> do

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
think drying that's what I started to do

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.499 
think drying that's what I started to do
first<00:01:59.030> was<00:01:59.240> draw<00:02:00.729> help<00:02:01.729> me<00:02:01.910> as<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.090> child

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
first was draw help me as a child

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.440 
first was draw help me as a child
probably<00:02:03.050> to<00:02:03.410> deal<00:02:03.649> with<00:02:03.830> my<00:02:04.009> problems<00:02:04.450> I'm

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
probably to deal with my problems I'm

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.870 
probably to deal with my problems I'm
not<00:02:05.660> out<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:05.899> shock<00:02:06.350> people<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.369> I<00:02:07.580> think

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
not out to shock people and I think

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.580 
not out to shock people and I think
that's<00:02:08.060> already<00:02:08.330> been<00:02:08.600> done<00:02:08.869> by<00:02:09.140> everybody

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
that's already been done by everybody

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.580 
that's already been done by everybody
else<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:11.000> just<00:02:11.239> wake<00:02:11.420> up<00:02:11.450> in<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.930> morning<00:02:12.410> and

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
else and just wake up in the morning and

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.240 
else and just wake up in the morning and
I<00:02:12.680> feel<00:02:12.950> inspired<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:14.110> think<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.230> have<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.650> paint

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
I feel inspired I think I have to paint

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.850 
I feel inspired I think I have to paint
and<00:02:16.489> draw<00:02:16.670> every<00:02:17.150> day<00:02:17.360> through<00:02:18.320> one<00:02:18.560> of<00:02:18.590> them

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
and draw every day through one of them

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.900 
and draw every day through one of them
or<00:02:19.790> I'll<00:02:19.940> say<00:02:20.299> I<00:02:21.430> get<00:02:22.430> restless<00:02:22.700> or<00:02:23.269> it<00:02:24.910> calms

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
or I'll say I get restless or it calms

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.430 
or I'll say I get restless or it calms
me<00:02:26.209> down<00:02:26.239> a<00:02:26.480> lot

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
me down a lot

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.140 
me down a lot
without<00:02:28.100> it<00:02:28.370> I'd<00:02:29.269> probably<00:02:29.570> be<00:02:29.870> lost
