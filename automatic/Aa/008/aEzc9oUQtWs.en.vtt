00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
the SVU sniper rifle just as long as you

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.640 
the SVU sniper rifle just as long as you
hit<00:01:12.689> them<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:12.960> head<00:01:13.020> or<00:01:13.350> if<00:01:13.500> you're

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
hit them in the head or if you're

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.560 
hit them in the head or if you're
playing<00:01:13.799> hardcore<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:14.909> my<00:01:15.030> opinion<00:01:15.119> I

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
playing hardcore but in my opinion I

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.660 
playing hardcore but in my opinion I
think<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:16.020> sniper<00:01:16.259> rifles<00:01:16.770> are<00:01:16.920> probably<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
think the sniper rifles are probably the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.730 
think the sniper rifles are probably the
most<00:01:17.880> balanced<00:01:18.450> guns<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> game<00:01:19.170> back<00:01:19.710> in

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
most balanced guns in the game back in

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.950 
most balanced guns in the game back in
mw3<00:01:20.369> they<00:01:20.729> were<00:01:20.790> pretty<00:01:21.060> balanced<00:01:21.600> back<00:01:21.780> in

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
mw3 they were pretty balanced back in

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.350 
mw3 they were pretty balanced back in
black<00:01:22.140> ops<00:01:22.409> 1<00:01:22.530> they<00:01:23.159> were<00:01:23.220> not<00:01:23.640> balanced<00:01:24.240> at

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
black ops 1 they were not balanced at

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.660 
black ops 1 they were not balanced at
all<00:01:24.540> black<00:01:24.869> ops<00:01:25.110> 1<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.710> sniper<00:01:26.009> rifles<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.549> my

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
all black ops 1 the sniper rifles in my

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.399 
all black ops 1 the sniper rifles in my

like<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.180> if<00:03:00.240> they<00:03:00.300> have<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.540> for<00:03:00.840> sniper

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
like it if they have it for sniper

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.600 
like it if they have it for sniper
rifles<00:03:01.440> but<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.770> my<00:03:01.890> opinion<00:03:02.010> that's<00:03:02.310> probably

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
rifles but in my opinion that's probably

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.580 
rifles but in my opinion that's probably
a<00:03:02.670> little<00:03:02.820> be<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.180> little<00:03:03.420> bit<00:03:03.570> overpowered<00:03:04.230> but

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
a little be a little bit overpowered but

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.140 
a little be a little bit overpowered but
really<00:03:04.860> guys<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.220> snipers<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.670> black<00:03:05.940> ops

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
really guys the snipers and black ops

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.150 
really guys the snipers and black ops

really loving them alrighty so I

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.840 
really loving them alrighty so I
definitely<00:03:10.380> suggest<00:03:10.650> sniping<00:03:11.340> in<00:03:11.430> black<00:03:11.610> ops

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
definitely suggest sniping in black ops

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.700 
definitely suggest sniping in black ops
2<00:03:12.030> it's<00:03:12.330> just<00:03:12.540> really<00:03:12.720> good<00:03:13.050> thing<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.320> switch

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
2 it's just really good thing to switch

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.260 
2 it's just really good thing to switch
up<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:13.920> pace<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.370> know<00:03:14.490> try<00:03:14.730> out<00:03:14.820> something<00:03:15.090> a

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
up the pace you know try out something a

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.580 
up the pace you know try out something a
little<00:03:15.390> bit<00:03:15.630> different<00:03:15.960> than<00:03:16.050> constantly

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
little bit different than constantly

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.410 
little bit different than constantly
always<00:03:17.070> using<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.490> assault<00:03:17.820> rifles<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.330> the

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
always using the assault rifles and the

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.180 
always using the assault rifles and the
submachine<00:03:18.750> guns<00:03:19.170> definitely<00:03:19.830> go<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.040> try

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
submachine guns definitely go and try

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.980 
submachine guns definitely go and try
that<00:03:20.370> out<00:03:20.430> my<00:03:20.820> opinion<00:03:21.180> sniping<00:03:21.600> is<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.720> lot<00:03:21.870> of

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
that out my opinion sniping is a lot of

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.480 
that out my opinion sniping is a lot of
fun<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.620> can<00:03:22.770> see<00:03:22.920> right<00:03:22.950> there<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.280> get

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
fun and you can see right there I get

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.130 
fun and you can see right there I get
the<00:03:23.610> relentless<00:03:24.180> medal<00:03:24.510> in<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.660> gameplay

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
the relentless medal in the gameplay

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.200 
the relentless medal in the gameplay
which<00:03:25.530> means<00:03:25.740> I'm<00:03:25.890> on<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.040> 20<00:03:26.550> gunstreak<00:03:27.000> with

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
which means I'm on a 20 gunstreak with

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.430 
which means I'm on a 20 gunstreak with
the<00:03:27.330> ballista<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:27.780> was<00:03:27.960> really<00:03:28.290> really

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
the ballista I was really really

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.900 
the ballista I was really really
surprised<00:03:28.890> that<00:03:28.980> I<00:03:29.100> was<00:03:29.220> able<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.580> pull<00:03:29.760> that

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
surprised that I was able to pull that

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.270 
surprised that I was able to pull that
off<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.360> die<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.840> believe<00:03:31.380> three<00:03:31.770> or<00:03:31.920> four<00:03:32.130> off

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
off I die to believe three or four off

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.650 
off I die to believe three or four off
the<00:03:32.310> nuclear<00:03:32.820> which<00:03:32.970> in<00:03:33.120> my<00:03:33.240> opinion<00:03:33.330> would

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
the nuclear which in my opinion would

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.330 
the nuclear which in my opinion would
have<00:03:33.780> been<00:03:33.900> even<00:03:34.050> more<00:03:34.230> impressive<00:03:34.860> if<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:35.100> was

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
have been even more impressive if I was

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.310 
have been even more impressive if I was
