00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:07.500
 this video is for an article that is 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:09.760
 publishes in mercadolibre colombia and is the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.059
 If I sell my feet 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.050
 magellan explores 100 that is in very 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:19.050
 good conditions the gps works 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.050
 perfectly 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.110
 everything turns on the screen works 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.830
 the backlighting though right now with 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.610
 the light does not look pretty has two 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.620
 levels as you can see 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.890
 we have the power button on this 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.890
 side 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.290
 and this other side we have the button that 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.079
 will control the light the recrimination we see 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.820
 the screen where it shows the way 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.990
 we have the screen that indicates the 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.310
 satellites 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:58.600
 latitude longitude battery lift 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.600
 odometer date and time 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.479
 we have the compass that works 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.490
 only with GPS signal sgps does not have 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.390
 nor barometric altimeter in the group the 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.390
 integrated delivery 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.920
 and that's basically what the gps has 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.740
 is are quite basic functions 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.320
 they are perfect, well, I would not see 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.549
 perfect conditions has its uses 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.020
 it has another padding on the screen but 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.020
 that put this protective film 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.909
 to avoid that the ray has scratched it are 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.909
 tiny ones and then in the camera you can not see 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.840
 on the other hand 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.840
 I'm the batteries 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.590
 that is, it is paid ready 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.460
 we have the battery compartment 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.410
 when it was it has its original packaging 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.410
 also waterproof 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.420
 and if I remove the batteries 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:07.569
 here we put this black cap that reveals 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.610
 the connection port for the computer 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:14.390
 there are two types of cables alcoa and cables 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.260
 generics that do serial conversion to 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.510
 USB cables that have use of 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.959
 serial communication this case be the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.050
 232 root protocol and there 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.450
 adapters to convert rs 232 to 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.680
 usb then you can get them in 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.350
 ebay for around 30 orals in total 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.209
 generics between 30 and 20 dollars and 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.430
 the originals of maggie land or also 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.610
 generic for networks is 232 they will be 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.280
 for the same between 20 and 30 dollars only 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.799
 that requires a special adapter that 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.510
 it is 9 pins to usb which is the converter 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.510
 from serial to usb 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.310
 basically that's the whole stage 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.030
 adjust here 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.890
 screw does not have a ring for it can be 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.840
 use to hang things or just 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.200
 with what you end up liking the 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.200
 drums 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.180
 The whole outer part is rubber for 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.040
 make it easier to grab 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.590
 and has this 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.719
 those two highs to hold a strap 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.840
 and hang the neck backpack with a 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:29.209
 hook 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.879
 it's very good gps and it's quite economical 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.660
 you do not get many there are not many in 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.550
 the market and in good condition 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:42.580
 but this is a that is the equivalent 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:44.710
 del garmin and tracks h that is a 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.890
 already old version today the 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.720
 replaces electric being electric 10 is 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.650
 the competition of the garmin ex iter 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:57.060
 it's the magellan express 10 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.579
 has a 14-channel receiver gps and has 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:05.010
 is enabled with w 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:07.110
 s efe ns is a system for correcting 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.970
 the condition of the satellites which is going 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.580
 to give him the gps 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.530
 in about three meters of 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.720
 precision in places where the system 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.220
 is enabled as usa europe or 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.340
 mexico costa rica 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:25.790
 Colombia and other South American countries 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:28.340
 they work except if not 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.560
 in Colombia and in Europe up to double 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:36.110
 that is double 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:39.470
 that is for us and the axis is not us 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.590
 for europe then if they are 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.630
 interested under the video I will publish 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.100
 the link for them in Colombia that 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.100
 are interested in seeing it thanks
