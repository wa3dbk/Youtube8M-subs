going<00:02:10.819> to<00:02:11.030> show<00:02:11.270> you<00:02:11.330> how<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:11.780> make<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.500> server

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
going to show you how to make a server

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.080 
going to show you how to make a server
it's<00:02:13.730> very<00:02:14.540> simple<00:02:15.430> really<00:02:16.430> it's<00:02:16.580> only<00:02:16.880> a

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
it's very simple really it's only a

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:24.250 
it's very simple really it's only a
couple<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:17.630> steps<00:02:22.450> just<00:02:23.450> we<00:02:23.780> don't<00:02:23.930> need<00:02:24.080> this

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
couple of steps just we don't need this

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.259 
couple of steps just we don't need this
stuff<00:02:24.500> okay<00:02:25.220> or<00:02:25.550> not<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:28.580> we'll<00:02:29.000> just<00:02:29.120> let

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
stuff okay or not and we'll just let

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.699 
stuff okay or not and we'll just let
that<00:02:29.450> load<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.880> it's<00:02:31.880> very<00:02:32.150> simple<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:32.989> create

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
that load and it's very simple to create

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.729 
that load and it's very simple to create
a<00:02:34.340> server<00:02:34.700> now<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.600> you<00:02:35.690> port<00:02:36.110> forwarded

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
a server now that you port forwarded

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:43.800 
a server now that you port forwarded
your<00:02:36.890> Apple<00:02:37.400> extreme<00:02:38.000> for<00:02:38.780> Windows<00:02:39.080> 7

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.720 

now<00:02:44.810> that<00:02:44.989> you've<00:02:45.110> port<00:02:45.380> forwarded<00:02:45.950> you're

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
now that you've port forwarded you're

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.839 
now that you've port forwarded you're
going<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.150> want<00:02:47.330> to<00:02:47.390> go<00:02:47.599> to<00:02:48.610> you're<00:02:49.610> going<00:02:49.760> to
