00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.480 
and then for shoes I wanted to go really
colorful<00:01:44.200> so<00:01:44.349> the<00:01:44.500> shoes<00:01:44.740> are<00:01:45.009> more<00:01:45.160> expensive

than the other pieces in the outfit

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.650 
than the other pieces in the outfit
similar<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.039> the<00:01:48.130> price<00:01:48.310> of<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.550> bag<00:01:48.729> but<00:01:49.420> I

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
similar to the price of the bag but I

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.510

expensive and the bag and shoes

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.910 
expensive and the bag and shoes
emphasize<00:01:54.160> more<00:01:54.399> accessories<00:01:55.030> I<00:01:55.060> guess

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
emphasize more accessories I guess

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.440

invest in so I wanted a pop of color and
I<00:02:04.810> went<00:02:04.989> for<00:02:05.170> these<00:02:05.319> green<00:02:05.619> Python<00:02:06.250> pumps

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
I went for these green Python pumps

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.400 
I went for these green Python pumps
they're<00:02:06.970> really<00:02:07.149> comfortable<00:02:07.450> they<00:02:08.380> don't

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
they're really comfortable they don't

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.260 
they're really comfortable they don't
show<00:02:08.800> too<00:02:08.830> much<00:02:09.130> toe<00:02:09.399> cleavage<00:02:09.789> and<00:02:10.060> they<00:02:10.149> have

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
show too much toe cleavage and they have

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.809 
show too much toe cleavage and they have
a<00:02:10.300> platform<00:02:10.630> so<00:02:11.620> shoes<00:02:12.160> with<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.400> platform

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
a platform so shoes with the platform

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.220 
a platform so shoes with the platform
are<00:02:12.940> always<00:02:13.239> more<00:02:13.420> comfortable<00:02:13.690> than<00:02:14.050> shoes

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
are always more comfortable than shoes

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.410 
are always more comfortable than shoes
without<00:02:14.410> platforms<00:02:15.130> I<00:02:15.370> have<00:02:15.879> a<00:02:15.940> lot<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.120> shoes

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
without platforms I have a lot of shoes

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.210 
without platforms I have a lot of shoes
without<00:02:16.720> platforms<00:02:17.290> as<00:02:17.410> well<00:02:17.620> but<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:17.980> just

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
without platforms as well but I just

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.220 
without platforms as well but I just
always<00:02:18.550> have<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.120> lot<00:02:19.360> more<00:02:19.540> trouble<00:02:19.690> walking

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
always have a lot more trouble walking

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.960 
always have a lot more trouble walking
in<00:02:20.379> them

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
in them

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.060 
in them
they're<00:02:21.720> not<00:02:21.900> comfortable<00:02:22.350> for<00:02:22.410> long<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:23.040> I

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
they're not comfortable for long so I

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.950 
they're not comfortable for long so I
much<00:02:23.580> prefer<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.060> platform<00:02:24.540> even<00:02:24.750> though

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
much prefer the platform even though

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.130 
much prefer the platform even though
right<00:02:25.230> now<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:27.090> non<00:02:27.270> platform<00:02:27.870> shoes

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
right now the non platform shoes

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.660

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
especially the pointy toe pumps are

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.640 
especially the pointy toe pumps are
really<00:02:29.970> in<00:02:30.060> style<00:02:30.420> but<00:02:30.810> these<00:02:31.200> are<00:02:31.440> still

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
really in style but these are still

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.530 
really in style but these are still
light<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:32.490> these<00:02:32.610> are<00:02:32.760> great<00:02:32.850> for<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.180> pop<00:02:33.330> of
