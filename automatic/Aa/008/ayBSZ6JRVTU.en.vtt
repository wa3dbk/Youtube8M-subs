of zip on it we did switch it over to a

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.390 
of zip on it we did switch it over to a
12-volt<00:03:09.270> system<00:03:09.660> so<00:03:10.080> it<00:03:10.170> starts<00:03:10.530> really<00:03:11.100> fast

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
12-volt system so it starts really fast

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.330 
12-volt system so it starts really fast
makes<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.330> really<00:03:12.510> easy<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.020> operate<00:03:13.340> this

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
makes it really easy to operate this

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.160 
makes it really easy to operate this
