00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.130 

thankfully<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.239> engine<00:00:33.600> turned<00:00:33.840> out<00:00:34.020> to

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
thankfully this engine turned out to

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.310 
thankfully this engine turned out to
have<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.260> pretty<00:00:34.710> good<00:00:34.910> compression<00:00:36.320> and

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
have a pretty good compression and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.220 
have a pretty good compression and
pretty<00:00:37.590> even<00:00:37.890> across<00:00:37.949> all<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.430> cylinders<00:00:39.230> so

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230
