 "Hello everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley 

00:00:01.741 --> 00:00:03.935
 and first I want to thank you for sharing 

00:00:03.935 --> 00:00:05.357
 of my time for me. 

00:00:05.357 --> 00:00:08.019
 These few minutes will be for us. 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.031
 Only for us. 

00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:12.062
 Second I want to tell you, 

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:14.643
 that you seem amazing today. 

00:00:14.643 --> 00:00:18.360
 And thirdly, I asked you to send me challenges, 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.002
 and I challenge you to watch this video. 

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:21.997
 Let's start. 

00:00:21.997 --> 00:00:24.699
 Daria says, "Show us the Troy album" 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:25.837
 All right. 

00:00:25.837 --> 00:00:27.239
 Troy can get angry with me. 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:28.339
 You know Troy Sivan. 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:29.941
 He does great music. 

00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:32.846
 But do you want to hear something from his album? 

00:00:32.846 --> 00:00:34.065
 I did not ask him for permission, 

00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:36.118
 but I will let you hear. 

00:00:36.118 --> 00:00:37.154
 Do you want? 

00:00:37.154 --> 00:00:38.474
 Hold it. 

00:00:38.474 --> 00:00:40.018
 Are you ready? 

00:00:40.018 --> 00:00:40.811
 He could kill me. 

00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:42.550
 Troy, do not kill me, but here you go. 

00:00:43.506 --> 00:00:48.506
 ("Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley) 

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:56.625
 Man, Troy, that sounds great. 

00:00:56.942 --> 00:01:00.018
 Sid wants to show you part of "Merry Christmas". 

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:03.716
 In fact, I just got the first paper copy 

00:01:03.716 --> 00:01:05.362
 of the book I wrote, 

00:01:05.362 --> 00:01:06.196
 it is called "Veselie". 

00:01:06.196 --> 00:01:09.283
 This is literally the first edition of my book. 

00:01:09.283 --> 00:01:10.766
 And I will read every page, 

00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.269
 to decide what 

00:01:12.269 --> 00:01:13.123
 must be moved, 

00:01:13.123 --> 00:01:14.484
 whichever is bigger, 

00:01:14.484 --> 00:01:16.597
 which photo needs more, 

00:01:16.597 --> 00:01:17.430
 to add something nice. 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.015
 That's why I'm currently reviewing the book. 

00:01:19.015 --> 00:01:20.620
 I'm reviewing her page by page. 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.509
 This is the biggest and tense thing, 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:23.505
 over which I have worked. 

00:01:23.505 --> 00:01:24.907
 If you have not ordered it yet, 

00:01:24.907 --> 00:01:25.841
 is currently at half price. 

00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:26.938
 Go to tyleroakleybook.com. 

00:01:26.938 --> 00:01:28.178
 But this is my book. 

00:01:28.178 --> 00:01:30.006
 You wanted a small piece, 

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:31.103
 and I show you all. 

00:01:31.103 --> 00:01:32.383
 This is my book. 

00:01:32.383 --> 00:01:33.541
 It's terribly heavy. 

00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:35.532
 And I'm very excited to read it. 

00:01:35.532 --> 00:01:38.885
 Last night I watched with Joey Grassa 

00:01:38.885 --> 00:01:40.754
 and we looked at the chapters 

00:01:40.754 --> 00:01:42.623
 and he literally shouted some pictures 

00:01:42.623 --> 00:01:44.492
 and the headings of some chapters. 

00:01:44.492 --> 00:01:45.752
 And sometimes he told me: 

00:01:45.752 --> 00:01:47.763
 "You can not write about it." 

00:01:47.763 --> 00:01:50.201
 And I said, "Why not?" 

00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:52.883
 Crustyokaley challenges me to advertise Audible. 

00:01:52.883 --> 00:01:54.061
 All right. 

00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:56.134
 As you know, I recommend a new book every month 

00:01:56.134 --> 00:01:59.242
 and this month I recommend you to audible.com, 

00:01:59.242 --> 00:02:00.888
 if you use audible.com/tyleroakley, 

00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:02.107
 you get your first book for free. 

00:02:02.107 --> 00:02:04.606
 This month I recommend "Intimate idiot" 

00:02:04.606 --> 00:02:06.902
 I have a paper copy of the book, a minute, 

00:02:06.902 --> 00:02:07.775
 here it is. 

00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:09.015
 Book is from Isaac Oliver. 

00:02:09.015 --> 00:02:11.453
 I read it and I liked it very much. 

00:02:11.453 --> 00:02:14.378
 On the cover, Ken, who has screwed his head through a hole. 

00:02:14.378 --> 00:02:15.557
 It's very funny. 

00:02:15.557 --> 00:02:16.918
 I loved it. 

00:02:16.918 --> 00:02:18.279
 And you know when you read a book, 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:20.454
 you say it would be much better, 

00:02:20.454 --> 00:02:22.728
 if you hear it from the author. 

00:02:22.728 --> 00:02:24.495
 I think this book would be ideal for listening 

00:02:24.495 --> 00:02:25.207
 as an audio book, 

00:02:25.207 --> 00:02:26.934
 So if you want this book or any other, 

00:02:26.934 --> 00:02:29.169
 they have 200,000 titles, 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:30.712
 you can go to audible.com/tyleroakley 

00:02:30.712 --> 00:02:32.602
 and get your first book for free. 

00:02:32.602 --> 00:02:35.141
 For the next challenge I need someone in the room. 

00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:37.600
 Corry, come here. 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.619
 - They've brought me to hug you. 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:40.734
 Come and hug me. 

00:02:41.874 --> 00:02:43.317
 - I was doing-- 

00:02:43.317 --> 00:02:44.211
 - And I hit you slap! 

00:02:45.552 --> 00:02:47.096
 - Are you serious? 

00:02:47.096 --> 00:02:48.985
 - Yes, "I challenge you to hug someone and then to slaughter them." 

00:02:48.985 --> 00:02:50.188
 - This is very rude! 

00:02:50.188 --> 00:02:51.550
 - God, go away! 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.484
 - Who's the bitch? 

00:02:52.484 --> 00:02:53.277
 Andrea. 

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:54.821
 "You can not say that to Andrea. 

00:02:54.821 --> 00:02:56.264
 "She shed me for her sake. 

00:02:56.264 --> 00:02:57.503
 - We love you, Andrea. 

00:02:57.503 --> 00:02:59.148
 - That's a bad challenge. 

00:02:59.148 --> 00:03:00.389
 - I'm sorry. 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.944
 Gillian challenges me to joke on the phone with Ben J. Pierce. 

00:03:03.944 --> 00:03:05.568
 Alright, I will do it. 

00:03:05.568 --> 00:03:06.726
 I never did. 

00:03:06.726 --> 00:03:08.474
 And I hate when others are kidding with me, 

00:03:08.474 --> 00:03:10.871
 so I feel very hypocritical at the moment, 

00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:12.192
 but I'll call him. 

00:03:13.412 --> 00:03:14.724
 What to say? 

00:03:16.134 --> 00:03:18.876
 I'll get him to delete the video, 

00:03:18.876 --> 00:03:20.989
 you will see in a moment. 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:23.594
 - Hello? 

00:03:23.594 --> 00:03:26.215
 - Benny, hi! 

00:03:26.215 --> 00:03:28.110
 - Hi, are you busy? 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.538
 "I'm free, what is it?" 

00:03:31.538 --> 00:03:36.028
 - Let me tell you that I'm making video with challenges today. 

00:03:36.028 --> 00:03:38.974
 I was going to ask you, I'll call you back then, 

00:03:38.974 --> 00:03:40.681
 I can joke with you then. 

00:03:40.681 --> 00:03:41.798
 Is that fine? 

00:03:41.798 --> 00:03:43.364
 - Yes yes OK. 

00:03:43.364 --> 00:03:46.902
 "But while on the phone, I wanted to ask you, 

00:03:46.902 --> 00:03:50.637
 there is one hour of the video you upload. 

00:03:51.717 --> 00:03:52.749
 - Hmmm. 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:55.898
 - There's a part where 

00:03:55.898 --> 00:03:57.279
 little is stupid-- 

00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:59.637
 - All right. 

00:03:59.637 --> 00:04:02.432
 - I think it's not very good, 

00:04:02.432 --> 00:04:05.400
 the angle is bad. 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.654
 Can it sound dumb, 

00:04:07.654 --> 00:04:09.584
 because I just saw gullies in Timber 

00:04:09.584 --> 00:04:12.002
 and there it looked very bad. 

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:14.399
 Can you delete it, 

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:16.855
 edit it and upload it again? 

00:04:18.645 --> 00:04:21.490
 I will send you what to delete. 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.354
 - Yes, that is, 

00:04:24.354 --> 00:04:26.102
 no problem, 

00:04:26.102 --> 00:04:28.743
 I can copy it and fix it. 

00:04:30.093 --> 00:04:32.705
 - All right, it's only a minute. 

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:33.782
 Is that fine? 

00:04:33.782 --> 00:04:35.610
 - Yes, yes, absolutely. 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.585
 Just send it to me. 

00:04:36.585 --> 00:04:38.129
 I will do it. 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:40.878
 "Okay, I'll call you back then, 

00:04:40.878 --> 00:04:42.477
 I think that during--, 

00:04:42.477 --> 00:04:44.103
 I'll call you before I get you, 

00:04:44.103 --> 00:04:45.992
 to know when, is it? 

00:04:45.992 --> 00:04:48.471
 - Going well. 

00:04:48.471 --> 00:04:49.649
 - Thanks. 

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:51.945
 - Bye. 

00:04:51.945 --> 00:04:53.754
 "Wait, Ben, I'm kidding. 

00:04:53.754 --> 00:04:54.811
 It was the joke. 

00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:58.671
 - Oh! 

00:04:58.671 --> 00:04:59.625
 Bye. 

00:04:59.625 --> 00:05:01.983
 "God, he was so kind. 

00:05:01.983 --> 00:05:04.988
 We have just made a collaboration for his channel. 

00:05:04.988 --> 00:05:08.178
 Marie says, "Kiss the closest thing to you." 

00:05:08.178 --> 00:05:10.433
 In addition to the book I showed you, 

00:05:10.433 --> 00:05:13.156
 I guess just, 

00:05:13.156 --> 00:05:15.370
 do not ask me why I still keep it 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.525
 and why he is in my living room. 

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:19.558
 But hello. 

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:24.919
 He wants me to drink a shrimp with lemon juice. 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.910
 I do not have lemon juice, but I have lime juice. 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.613
 I'm a little worried because she's gone 

00:05:29.613 --> 00:05:32.335
 expiration date, no year, 

00:05:32.335 --> 00:05:34.347
 and I have been living here for a few years, 

00:05:34.347 --> 00:05:35.687
 that's why I do not know. 

00:05:35.687 --> 00:05:38.044
 Writing January 14th, is this next year, 

00:05:38.044 --> 00:05:39.565
 this year or the previous one? 

00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:41.759
 We will see. 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:46.480
 God, wait. 

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:52.721
 I'm not kidding, this thing is disgusting. 

00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:54.124
 I think I bite my tongue 

00:05:54.124 --> 00:05:56.236
 and the wound bleeds. 

00:05:56.236 --> 00:05:56.927
 I `m not joking. 

00:05:56.927 --> 00:05:58.979
 I can cry. 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.579
 Stevie challenges me to hit a hot dog. 

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:04.126
 This is very in the style of "Naughty Girls", but. 

00:06:05.236 --> 00:06:08.020
 Do not look at me, Corey. 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.478
 It's intimate. 

00:06:10.458 --> 00:06:12.225
 Get out! 

00:06:12.225 --> 00:06:14.359
 "I'll look at your channel. 

00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:15.720
 - Oh thank you, 

00:06:18.991 --> 00:06:20.349
 With a tongue? 

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:22.181
 No! 

00:06:24.781 --> 00:06:26.264
 I can not! 

00:06:26.264 --> 00:06:28.511
 Perhaps the hot dog would be the language. 

00:06:32.603 --> 00:06:36.955
 There is too much language!

 Peace. 

00:06:58.366 --> 00:07:00.742
 Dirty, dirty boy. 

00:07:02.693 --> 00:07:03.627
 It hurts. 

00:07:03.627 --> 00:07:04.238
 - I believe you. 

00:07:04.238 --> 00:07:04.846
 - You hurt me. 

00:07:04.846 --> 00:07:05.740
 - I have painkillers. 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.825
 Will not do it. 

00:07:07.935 --> 00:07:09.953
 I will not do it, you can not make me.
