00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
person here between the LG l90 versus

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.210 
person here between the LG l90 versus
the<00:00:05.790> Sony<00:00:06.120> Xperia<00:00:06.569> e<00:00:06.930> one<00:00:07.290> it's<00:00:07.740> pretty<00:00:07.950> fine

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
the Sony Xperia e one it's pretty fine

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.240 
the Sony Xperia e one it's pretty fine
because<00:00:08.550> I<00:00:09.120> mean<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:10.260> L<00:00:10.380> might<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.800> gonna<00:00:10.980> cost

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
because I mean the L might is gonna cost

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.660 
because I mean the L might is gonna cost
you<00:00:11.519> around<00:00:11.610> twice<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:13.139> price<00:00:13.460> most<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.610> the

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
you around twice the price most of the

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.599 
you around twice the price most of the
times<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.800> it's<00:00:16.800> it's<00:00:17.130> pretty<00:00:17.430> logical

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
times and it's it's pretty logical

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.519 
times and it's it's pretty logical
actually<00:00:18.390> why<00:00:18.600> it's<00:00:19.020> going<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.410> do<00:00:19.500> that

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
actually why it's going to do that

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.200 
actually why it's going to do that
because<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:20.220> want<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.730> take<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> look<00:00:21.060> at<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
because I want to take a look at the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.630 
because I want to take a look at the
specs<00:00:21.510> here<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.350> we<00:00:22.650> can<00:00:22.800> see<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.100> we<00:00:23.250> do<00:00:23.400> get

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
specs here and we can see that we do get

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.939

that<00:00:48.420> I'm<00:00:48.570> pretty<00:00:48.809> sure<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.010> mean<00:00:50.250> there's<00:00:50.460> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that I'm pretty sure so I mean there's a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.310 
that I'm pretty sure so I mean there's a
difference<00:00:50.610> there<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> big<00:00:51.809> difference<00:00:51.960> I

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
difference there is a big difference I

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.889 
difference there is a big difference I
would<00:00:52.559> also<00:00:52.680> say<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.160> display<00:00:53.809> kind<00:00:54.809> of

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
would also say that to display kind of

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.520 
would also say that to display kind of
like<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> display<00:00:55.320> quality<00:00:55.789> is<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.850> big<00:00:57.149> deal

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
like the display quality is a big deal

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.770 
like the display quality is a big deal
the<00:00:58.530> problem<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.399> device<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.149> e<00:01:00.180> one

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the problem with this device the e one

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.870 
the problem with this device the e one
is<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.320> only<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:02.359> you<00:01:03.359> only<00:01:03.600> get<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.880> 2

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
is that you only get you only get like 2

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.090 
is that you only get you only get like 2
gigabytes<00:01:06.330> well<00:01:06.540> Bo<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:07.170> half<00:01:07.439> gigabyte<00:01:07.890> to

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
gigabytes well Bo one half gigabyte to

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.100 
gigabytes well Bo one half gigabyte to
install<00:01:08.430> games<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.880> stuff<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.689> one<00:01:09.900> I

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
install games and stuff on this one I

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.130 
install games and stuff on this one I
think<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.409> almost<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:10.680> 4<00:01:11.159> gigabytes<00:01:12.140> just

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
think it's almost like 4 gigabytes just

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.560 
think it's almost like 4 gigabytes just
a<00:01:13.260> little<00:01:13.470> bit<00:01:13.590> more<00:01:13.770> intense<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:15.420> can

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
a little bit more intense and you can

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.999 
a little bit more intense and you can
see<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> cool<00:01:16.259> thing<00:01:16.500> there<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.770> you

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
see here the cool thing there that you

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.780 
see here the cool thing there that you
can<00:01:17.159> unlock<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.610> devices<00:01:18.119> by<00:01:18.299> tapping<00:01:19.790> and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
can unlock the devices by tapping and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.359 
can unlock the devices by tapping and
then<00:01:21.229> we<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.380> also<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.830> thing<00:01:23.100> with<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
then we have also this thing with the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.050 
then we have also this thing with the
camera<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:25.530> camera<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:28.189> L<00:01:29.189> 90<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.759> pretty

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
camera the camera on the L 90 is pretty

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.210 
camera the camera on the L 90 is pretty
nice<00:01:30.180> actually<00:01:30.479> for<00:01:31.200> first<00:01:31.500> prize<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.920> mean<00:01:32.070> a

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
nice actually for first prize I mean a

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.190 
nice actually for first prize I mean a
three-episode<00:01:32.460> camera<00:01:33.180> takes<00:01:33.810> pictures

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
three-episode camera takes pictures

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.080 
three-episode camera takes pictures
pretty<00:01:34.500> quick<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.479> in<00:01:36.479> those<00:01:36.750> good<00:01:37.020> things

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
pretty quick and in those good things

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.310 
pretty quick and in those good things
but<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.210> problem<00:01:39.360> with<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:42.229> problem<00:01:43.229> with

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
but the problem with the problem with

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.899 
but the problem with the problem with
this<00:01:43.409> one<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.130> only<00:01:44.220> has<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> three

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
this one is that it only has a three

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.319 
this one is that it only has a three
minute<00:01:45.149> pixel<00:01:45.540> camera<00:01:46.700> even<00:01:47.700> though<00:01:47.939> for<00:01:48.210> its

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
minute pixel camera even though for its

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.539 
minute pixel camera even though for its
price<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:49.259> should<00:01:49.530> probably<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> little

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
price it should probably have a little

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.340 
price it should probably have a little
bit<00:01:50.759> better<00:01:51.030> at<00:01:51.270> least<00:01:51.450> like<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.689> 5<00:01:52.079> megapixel

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
bit better at least like a 5 megapixel

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.740 
bit better at least like a 5 megapixel
camera<00:01:52.619> mean<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> 3<00:01:53.790> megapixel<00:01:54.119> camera

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
camera mean like a 3 megapixel camera

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.109 
camera mean like a 3 megapixel camera
selfie<00:01:55.619> thought<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.820> even<00:01:57.090> more

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
selfie thought it and it's even more

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.910 
selfie thought it and it's even more
retarded<00:01:57.719> when<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.049> try<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.320> use<00:01:58.500> this

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
retarded when you try to use this

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.280 
retarded when you try to use this
actually<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.790> you<00:02:00.420> can<00:02:00.450> see<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.780> can't<00:02:01.140> even

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
actually and you can see I can't even

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.440 
actually and you can see I can't even
have<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.979> focus

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
have to focus

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
I still do believe here that Sony has a

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.600 
I still do believe here that Sony has a
little<00:02:41.120> bit<00:02:41.180> of<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:42.110> better-looking<00:02:42.440> UI<00:02:42.980> it

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
little bit of a better-looking UI it

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.100 
little bit of a better-looking UI it
does<00:02:44.240> look<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:44.720> little<00:02:44.990> bit<00:02:45.230> newer<00:02:45.800> more<00:02:46.520> fresh

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
does look a little bit newer more fresh

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.900
