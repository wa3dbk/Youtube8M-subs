00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
same pretty much as he used to except

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.219 
same pretty much as he used to except
now<00:01:20.250> these<00:01:20.430> buttons<00:01:20.790> are<00:01:20.939> make<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.080> this

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
now these buttons are make on this

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.890

clicky<00:01:22.770> sound<00:01:23.040> when<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.460> use<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.790> which<00:01:24.750> i

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
clicky sound when you use it which i

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.469 
clicky sound when you use it which i
think<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.170> nice<00:01:25.430> so<00:01:28.280> yeah<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.490> inventory<00:01:30.000> is

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
think is nice so yeah the inventory is

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.719 
think is nice so yeah the inventory is
virtually<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.290> same<00:01:31.320> except<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.520> can

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
virtually the same except that you can

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.910 
virtually the same except that you can
now<00:01:33.329> drag<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.869> around<00:01:33.960> because<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.740> knew<00:01:34.890> that

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
now drag it around because I knew that

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.560 
now drag it around because I knew that
in<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.579> past<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.180> was<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.390> big

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.670 

I<00:01:39.630> don't<00:01:40.440> know<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.740> word<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.070> hindrance<00:01:41.850> to

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
I don't know the word is hindrance to

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.310 
I don't know the word is hindrance to
have<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:43.890> your<00:01:44.250> way<00:01:44.580> all<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.880> time<00:01:45.290> so<00:01:46.290> I

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
have it in your way all the time so I

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.920 
have it in your way all the time so I
allowed<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.430> move<00:01:47.910> it<00:01:48.090> along<00:01:48.240> with<00:01:48.390> every

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
allowed you to move it along with every

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.040 
allowed you to move it along with every
other<00:01:50.210> GOI<00:01:51.500> but<00:01:52.850> now<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.910> have<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.390> stock

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
other GOI but now you have to stock

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:02.090 
other GOI but now you have to stock
would<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:58.110> craft<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.340> into<00:02:00.650> whatever<00:02:01.650> and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
would you can craft it into whatever and

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.920 
would you can craft it into whatever and
the<00:02:02.369> craft<00:02:02.610> tool<00:02:02.790> works<00:02:02.970> pretty<00:02:03.720> much<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
the craft tool works pretty much the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.050 
the craft tool works pretty much the
same<00:02:04.320> except<00:02:04.800> i<00:02:04.890> removed<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.250> Billboard<00:02:05.790> GOI

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
same except i removed the Billboard GOI

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.540 
same except i removed the Billboard GOI
which<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.780> kind<00:02:07.050> of<00:02:07.110> annoying<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:08.280> we're<00:02:08.490> going

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
which is kind of annoying so we're going

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.930 
which is kind of annoying so we're going
to<00:02:08.670> make<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.820> craft<00:02:09.149> or<00:02:09.380> forger<00:02:10.380> yeah<00:02:10.679> forge<00:02:11.039> one

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
to make a craft or forger yeah forge one

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.460 
to make a craft or forger yeah forge one
thing<00:02:12.120> about<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.330> craft<00:02:12.540> feel<00:02:12.780> now<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.020> that

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
thing about the craft feel now is that

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.740 
thing about the craft feel now is that
you<00:02:13.650> can<00:02:13.860> actually<00:02:14.330> craft<00:02:15.330> in<00:02:15.540> any

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
you can actually craft in any

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.360 
you can actually craft in any
combination<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:16.739> let's<00:02:16.890> say<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.070> want<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.280> click

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
combination so let's say I want to click

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.870 
combination so let's say I want to click
on<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.820> scrap<00:02:18.450> metal<00:02:18.690> first<00:02:19.070> one<00:02:20.070> stock<00:02:20.610> wood

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
on the scrap metal first one stock wood

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.350 
on the scrap metal first one stock wood
and<00:02:21.239> one<00:02:22.020> brick<00:02:22.520> another<00:02:23.520> stock<00:02:23.940> would<00:02:24.180> in

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
and one brick another stock would in

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.650 
and one brick another stock would in
another<00:02:24.690> brick<00:02:25.350> but<00:02:26.100> create<00:02:26.459> tool<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:27.000> can<00:02:27.330> make

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
another brick but create tool I can make

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.310 
another brick but create tool I can make
the<00:02:27.780> Forge<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:30.410> here's<00:02:31.410> where<00:02:31.680> there's<00:02:32.070> a
