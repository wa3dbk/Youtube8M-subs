00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:03.380 
yeah hey guys this is metal stash again

yeah hey guys this is metal stash again
this<00:00:04.380> video<00:00:04.710> I'm<00:00:05.100> going<00:00:05.790> over<00:00:07.040> my<00:00:09.260> more

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
this video I'm going over my more

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.039 
this video I'm going over my more
complex<00:00:11.130> unit<00:00:11.759> movement<00:00:12.330> let<00:00:12.570> me<00:00:12.660> move<00:00:12.840> this

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
complex unit movement let me move this

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.760 
complex unit movement let me move this
recorder<00:00:13.620> out<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.920> way<00:00:14.040> real<00:00:14.219> quick<00:00:16.910> the

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
recorder out of the way real quick the

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.310 
recorder out of the way real quick the
video<00:00:19.770> before<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.840> kind<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.900> put<00:00:22.140> these

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
video before this I kind of put these

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.380 
video before this I kind of put these
out<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.680> order<00:00:23.070> but<00:00:25.670> neither<00:00:26.670> one<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.000> them<00:00:27.210> was

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
out of order but neither one of them was

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.019 
out of order but neither one of them was
really<00:00:27.779> more<00:00:28.529> important<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.010> do<00:00:29.160> versus<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
really more important to do versus the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.069 
really more important to do versus the
other<00:00:30.179> i<00:00:30.710> dun't<00:00:31.710> unit<00:00:32.070> avoidance<00:00:32.550> before<00:00:33.180> my

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
other i dun't unit avoidance before my

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.310 
other i dun't unit avoidance before my
more<00:00:34.469> complex<00:00:34.980> movement<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:35.820> either<00:00:36.750> one<00:00:37.140> it

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
more complex movement but either one it

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.310 
more complex movement but either one it
doesn't<00:00:37.469> really<00:00:37.649> matter<00:00:37.969> so<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.660> get<00:00:39.899> into<00:00:40.170> it

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
doesn't really matter so to get into it

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.940 
doesn't really matter so to get into it
it's<00:00:41.250> not<00:00:41.340> really<00:00:41.579> much<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:42.570> go<00:00:42.780> into<00:00:43.260> my<00:00:43.620> unit

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
it's not really much to go into my unit

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.900 
it's not really much to go into my unit
itself<00:00:45.590> because<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.710> had<00:00:46.800> gotten<00:00:47.039> into<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.640> in

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
itself because I had gotten into that in

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.040 
itself because I had gotten into that in
my<00:00:48.360> unit<00:00:48.690> avoidance<00:00:49.140> video<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.989> lot<00:00:51.989> of

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
my unit avoidance video and a lot of

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.150 
my unit avoidance video and a lot of
that<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:53.539> changing<00:00:54.539> over<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> custom

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
that is just changing over to a custom

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.770 
that is just changing over to a custom
script<00:00:56.550> instead<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.360> character

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
script instead of the character

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.639 
script instead of the character
controller<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:59.010> going<00:00:59.219> into<00:00:59.460> my<00:00:59.579> code<00:01:00.410> most<00:01:01.410> of

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
controller so going into my code most of

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.660 
controller so going into my code most of
it<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.690> changed<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.799> player<00:01:05.189> controller

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
it I changed in the player controller

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.490 
it I changed in the player controller
itself<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:08.610> player<00:01:09.180> controllers<00:01:09.869> movement

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
itself the player controllers movement

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.460 
itself the player controllers movement
command<00:01:11.130> which<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.119> right<00:01:12.439> mouse<00:01:13.439> button

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
command which is the right mouse button

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.090 
command which is the right mouse button
I<00:01:14.210> has<00:01:15.210> had<00:01:15.869> most<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> change<00:01:16.970> where<00:01:17.970> I've

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
I has had most of the change where I've

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.810 
I has had most of the change where I've
implemented<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.250> flocking<00:01:20.759> system<00:01:21.299> where<00:01:22.200> I

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
implemented a flocking system where I

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.969 
implemented a flocking system where I
need<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.970> send<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.659> center<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:26.820> squad

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
need to send the center of the squad

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.280 
need to send the center of the squad
which<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.579> center<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.689> selected

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
which is the center of the selected

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.319 
which is the center of the selected
units<00:01:31.970> by<00:01:33.470> position<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.680> each<00:01:34.860> unit<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.880> just

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
units by position to each unit so I just

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.870 
units by position to each unit so I just
add<00:01:36.509> up<00:01:36.570> all<00:01:36.990> their<00:01:37.229> positions<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.430> then

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
add up all their positions and then

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.740 
add up all their positions and then
divide<00:01:39.210> by<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.509> number<00:01:41.090> of<00:01:42.090> them<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.570> there

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
divide by the number of them that there

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.810 
divide by the number of them that there
are<00:01:43.790> then<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:46.740> tell<00:01:47.009> if<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:49.070> if<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.579> want

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
are then I to tell if the I if I want

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.330 
are then I to tell if the I if I want
the<00:01:50.970> squad<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.810> flock<00:01:52.200> which<00:01:52.590> means<00:01:52.860> they<00:01:53.100> just

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
the squad to flock which means they just

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.560 
the squad to flock which means they just
come<00:01:54.149> together<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:55.729> randomly<00:01:56.729> instead<00:01:57.420> of

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
come together I randomly instead of

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.450 
come together I randomly instead of
moving<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> relative<00:01:59.040> position<00:01:59.670> I<00:02:01.460> check

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
moving to a relative position I check

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.469 
moving to a relative position I check
the<00:02:02.700> mouse<00:02:02.939> position

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
the mouse position

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.360 
the mouse position
which<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.799> the<00:02:07.799> hit<00:02:08.069> command<00:02:09.410> to<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.890> center

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
which is the hit command to the center

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.850 
which is the hit command to the center
of<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.519> squad<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.360> if<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.290> distance<00:02:13.530> is

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
of the squad and if that distance is

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.410 
of the squad and if that distance is
less<00:02:13.920> than<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:16.230> distance<00:02:16.580> from<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:18.030> center

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
less than the distance from the center

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.910 
less than the distance from the center
to<00:02:18.629> any<00:02:19.379> of<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:19.980> units<00:02:20.480> then<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:22.440> clique<00:02:22.739> is

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
to any of the units then the clique is

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.830 
to any of the units then the clique is
inside<00:02:23.459> of<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.910> units<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:25.580> range<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:27.420> they<00:02:27.629> need

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
inside of the units I range so they need

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.470 
inside of the units I range so they need
to<00:02:27.930> flock<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:28.890> they<00:02:29.069> come<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:30.000> more<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.360> a

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
to flock so that they come to more of a

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.170 
to flock so that they come to more of a
circular<00:02:30.930> mass<00:02:32.780> then<00:02:34.730> this<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.940> where<00:02:36.150> I

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
circular mass then this is where I

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.110 
circular mass then this is where I
really<00:02:36.900> tell<00:02:37.140> them<00:02:37.379> the<00:02:37.980> units<00:02:38.519> what<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.940> do

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
really tell them the units what to do

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.990 
really tell them the units what to do
that<00:02:39.989> if<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.650> if<00:02:41.040> if<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.569> want<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.840> flock<00:02:43.170> then

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
that if it if if you want a flock then

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.720 
that if it if if you want a flock then
send<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.060> message<00:02:45.390> flock<00:02:45.750> true<00:02:46.290> else<00:02:46.799> it's

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
send a message flock true else it's

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.069 
send a message flock true else it's
false<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.390> then<00:02:49.260> also<00:02:49.769> send<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.750> center<00:02:51.750> of

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
false and then also send the center of

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.910 
false and then also send the center of
the<00:02:52.769> squad<00:02:53.180> value<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.660> unit<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.200> then

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
the squad value to the unit and then

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.830 
the squad value to the unit and then
finally<00:02:56.400> command<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.690> unit<00:02:58.049> at<00:02:58.590> that<00:02:58.650> point

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
finally command the unit at that point

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.390 
finally command the unit at that point
so<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.870> see<00:03:01.170> how<00:03:01.319> that<00:03:01.500> comes<00:03:01.709> out<00:03:01.859> over<00:03:02.160> here

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
so to see how that comes out over here

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.589 
so to see how that comes out over here
the<00:03:03.390> send<00:03:03.690> message<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:04.260> just<00:03:04.290> basically<00:03:05.599> it

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
the send message is just basically it

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.220 
the send message is just basically it
sends<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.049> message<00:03:07.079> over<00:03:07.950> all<00:03:08.220> its<00:03:08.489> children

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
sends the message over all its children

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.990 
sends the message over all its children
you<00:03:10.230> could<00:03:10.470> just<00:03:10.709> call<00:03:10.889> the<00:03:11.040> function<00:03:11.519> but<00:03:11.819> I

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
you could just call the function but I

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.370 
you could just call the function but I
kind<00:03:12.239> of<00:03:12.269> like<00:03:12.420> send<00:03:12.690> message<00:03:13.049> a<00:03:13.139> little

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
kind of like send message a little

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.479 
kind of like send message a little
better<00:03:13.530> because<00:03:13.799> it's<00:03:13.950> more<00:03:14.239> semantic<00:03:16.400> so<00:03:17.400> you

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
better because it's more semantic so you

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.430 
better because it's more semantic so you
get<00:03:17.579> the<00:03:17.670> relative<00:03:17.910> center<00:03:18.329> here<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.900> saved

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
get the relative center here I saved

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.309 
get the relative center here I saved
that<00:03:19.560> squad<00:03:20.069> center<00:03:20.549> I<00:03:20.730> got<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.319> flocking

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
that squad center I got a flocking

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.089 
that squad center I got a flocking
variable<00:03:22.769> here<00:03:23.130> so<00:03:24.060> if<00:03:24.209> it's<00:03:24.359> flocking<00:03:25.099> it

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
variable here so if it's flocking it

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.930 
variable here so if it's flocking it
knows<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.329> needs<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.780> flock<00:03:28.049> so<00:03:29.010> that

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
knows that it needs to flock so that

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.470 
knows that it needs to flock so that
comes<00:03:30.239> into<00:03:30.450> play<00:03:30.660> when<00:03:31.019> it<00:03:31.530> needs<00:03:31.859> to<00:03:32.069> move<00:03:35.480> so

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
comes into play when it needs to move so

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.620 
comes into play when it needs to move so
if<00:03:36.870> it's<00:03:37.349> not<00:03:38.130> flocking<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:39.150> means<00:03:39.389> it's

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
if it's not flocking that means it's

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.550 
if it's not flocking that means it's
just<00:03:39.840> moving<00:03:40.260> too<00:03:41.720> it's<00:03:42.720> like<00:03:42.989> are<00:03:43.260> there

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
just moving too it's like are there

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.970 
just moving too it's like are there
already<00:03:43.739> a<00:03:43.859> squad<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:45.139> they<00:03:46.139> need<00:03:46.349> to<00:03:46.470> move<00:03:46.680> to

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
already a squad and they need to move to

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.330 
already a squad and they need to move to
a<00:03:47.010> point<00:03:47.569> somewhere<00:03:48.569> on<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.989> map<00:03:49.169> so<00:03:49.889> what<00:03:50.310> I

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
a point somewhere on the map so what I

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.420 
a point somewhere on the map so what I
do<00:03:50.489> is<00:03:50.849> I<00:03:51.690> get<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:52.500> offset<00:03:54.319> which<00:03:55.319> is<00:03:55.590> the

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
do is I get the offset which is the

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.180 
do is I get the offset which is the
position<00:03:59.540> difference<00:04:00.540> between<00:04:01.079> its<00:04:01.620> position

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
position difference between its position

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.879 
position difference between its position
and<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.519> squad<00:04:02.819> center<00:04:03.269> then<00:04:04.200> I<00:04:04.620> take<00:04:05.489> the

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
and the squad center then I take the

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.190 
and the squad center then I take the
point<00:04:07.889> where<00:04:08.190> it's<00:04:08.940> been<00:04:09.180> told<00:04:09.450> to<00:04:09.660> move<00:04:09.870> to

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
point where it's been told to move to

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.090 
point where it's been told to move to
and<00:04:10.470> add<00:04:11.099> that<00:04:11.459> offset<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.419> it<00:04:12.630> so<00:04:13.139> that<00:04:13.350> it's

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
and add that offset to it so that it's

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.670 
and add that offset to it so that it's
basically<00:04:14.400> just

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
basically just

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.830 
basically just
moving<00:04:16.130> on<00:04:16.430> a<00:04:17.709> path<00:04:18.709> where<00:04:19.370> it'll<00:04:20.150> end<00:04:20.359> up<00:04:20.570> in

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
moving on a path where it'll end up in

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.990 
moving on a path where it'll end up in
the<00:04:21.199> same<00:04:21.440> position<00:04:21.680> relative<00:04:22.280> to<00:04:22.580> where<00:04:22.880> it

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
the same position relative to where it

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.379 
the same position relative to where it
started<00:04:24.009> is<00:04:25.009> so<00:04:25.550> I<00:04:25.580> calculate<00:04:26.150> that<00:04:26.180> path<00:04:27.490> and

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.240 

that's<00:04:32.389> about<00:04:32.539> it<00:04:33.050> for<00:04:33.169> that<00:04:33.590> I<00:04:33.889> mean<00:04:34.009> there

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
that's about it for that I mean there

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.580 
that's about it for that I mean there
really<00:04:34.280> isn't<00:04:34.669> much<00:04:35.030> to<00:04:35.870> it<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.139> just<00:04:36.229> kind<00:04:36.500> of

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
really isn't much to it I just kind of

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.310 
really isn't much to it I just kind of
wanted<00:04:36.830> to<00:04:36.949> go<00:04:37.070> over<00:04:37.370> that<00:04:37.520> with<00:04:37.759> you<00:04:37.910> guys<00:04:38.320> to

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
wanted to go over that with you guys to

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.450 
wanted to go over that with you guys to
see<00:04:39.530> how<00:04:39.740> it<00:04:39.919> happens<00:04:40.340> I<00:04:41.919> can<00:04:42.919> select<00:04:43.220> all

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
see how it happens I can select all

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.650 
see how it happens I can select all
these<00:04:43.669> units<00:04:44.680> and<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:46.340> can<00:04:46.520> tell<00:04:46.729> them<00:04:46.850> to<00:04:46.880> move

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
these units and I can tell them to move

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.870 
these units and I can tell them to move
down<00:04:47.930> this<00:04:48.169> way<00:04:48.410> and<00:04:48.710> you<00:04:49.190> see<00:04:49.370> how<00:04:49.520> they<00:04:49.669> move

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
down this way and you see how they move

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.999 
down this way and you see how they move
kind<00:04:50.479> of<00:04:50.570> in<00:04:50.690> a<00:04:50.750> relative<00:04:51.169> position<00:04:51.650> to

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:52.009 
kind of in a relative position to

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.089 
kind of in a relative position to
there's<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:53.300> center<00:04:53.990> of<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.199> squad<00:04:54.710> so

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
there's the center of the squad so

00:04:55.099 --> 00:05:00.279 
there's the center of the squad so
they're<00:04:55.250> always<00:04:57.400> moving<00:04:58.400> like<00:04:58.759> that<00:04:58.940> now<00:04:59.750> if<00:05:00.110> I

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
they're always moving like that now if I

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.200 
they're always moving like that now if I
move<00:05:00.919> them<00:05:01.250> to<00:05:01.490> a<00:05:01.520> point<00:05:01.849> that<00:05:02.030> is<00:05:02.509> less<00:05:03.320> than

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
move them to a point that is less than

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.999 
move them to a point that is less than
any<00:05:05.210> of<00:05:05.479> these<00:05:07.360> distances<00:05:08.360> then<00:05:08.990> every<00:05:09.710> unit

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
any of these distances then every unit

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:11.439 
any of these distances then every unit
will<00:05:10.130> move<00:05:10.340> to<00:05:10.520> that<00:05:10.610> position<00:05:10.970> and<00:05:11.360> then

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
will move to that position and then

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.640 
will move to that position and then
flock<00:05:13.330> and<00:05:14.330> then<00:05:14.660> if<00:05:14.780> I<00:05:14.900> move<00:05:15.080> them<00:05:15.259> are<00:05:15.380> here

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
flock and then if I move them are here

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.430 
flock and then if I move them are here
they're<00:05:16.460> going<00:05:16.820> to<00:05:17.090> move<00:05:17.330> as<00:05:17.660> a<00:05:17.720> relative

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
they're going to move as a relative

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:26.529 
they're going to move as a relative
squad<00:05:19.160> I<00:05:24.370> know<00:05:25.370> this<00:05:25.580> is<00:05:25.729> kind<00:05:25.970> of<00:05:26.030> shorter

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
squad I know this is kind of shorter

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.450 
squad I know this is kind of shorter
than<00:05:26.720> most<00:05:27.139> of<00:05:27.320> my<00:05:27.380> videos<00:05:27.530> guys<00:05:27.889> but<00:05:28.280> it

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
than most of my videos guys but it

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.310 
than most of my videos guys but it
really<00:05:28.610> wasn't<00:05:28.880> that<00:05:29.030> big<00:05:29.300> of<00:05:29.419> a<00:05:29.510> subject<00:05:29.990> but

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
really wasn't that big of a subject but

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.420 
really wasn't that big of a subject but
I<00:05:30.560> think<00:05:31.130> it<00:05:31.330> it's<00:05:32.330> a<00:05:32.860> cool<00:05:33.860> thing<00:05:33.889> to<00:05:34.190> look<00:05:34.280> at

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
I think it it's a cool thing to look at

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.850 
I think it it's a cool thing to look at
just<00:05:34.699> because<00:05:35.000> it's<00:05:35.690> pretty<00:05:36.260> simple<00:05:36.710> to

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
just because it's pretty simple to

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.570 
just because it's pretty simple to
implement<00:05:37.130> and<00:05:37.580> I<00:05:38.000> kind<00:05:38.510> of<00:05:38.570> noticed<00:05:39.020> it<00:05:39.199> from
