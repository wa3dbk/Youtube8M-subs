to<00:01:07.240> avoid<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:07.780> crabs<00:01:08.080> even<00:01:08.770> posting<00:01:09.220> signs

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
to avoid the crabs even posting signs

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.060 
to avoid the crabs even posting signs
like<00:01:09.940> this<00:01:10.210> one<00:01:10.450> some<00:01:11.350> perhaps<00:01:11.500> even<00:01:11.890> break

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
like this one some perhaps even break

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.880 
like this one some perhaps even break
the<00:01:12.100> tires<00:01:12.490> or<00:01:12.820> like<00:01:13.600> like<00:01:13.899> on<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.680> golf

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
the tires or like like on the golf

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.830 
the tires or like like on the golf
course<00:01:15.160> which<00:01:15.850> is<00:01:16.000> on<00:01:16.149> the<00:01:16.240> migration<00:01:16.509> route

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
course which is on the migration route

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.740 
course which is on the migration route
when<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.500> during<00:01:18.399> the<00:01:18.430> migration<00:01:18.640> there<00:01:19.539> they

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
when the during the migration there they

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.320 
when the during the migration there they
have<00:01:19.869> a<00:01:19.899> special<00:01:20.350> rule<00:01:21.039> so<00:01:21.490> that<00:01:21.520> means<00:01:21.880> the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
have a special rule so that means the

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.060 
have a special rule so that means the
animals<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.930> crabs<00:01:23.200> belong<00:01:23.560> to<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.890> game

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
animals the crabs belong to the game

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.880 
animals the crabs belong to the game
which<00:01:24.700> means<00:01:24.940> if<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:25.869> crab<00:01:26.110> pushes<00:01:26.590> a<00:01:26.619> ball

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
which means if the crab pushes a ball

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.029 
which means if the crab pushes a ball
into<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.340> hole<00:01:27.460> it's<00:01:27.970> in<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:29.560> if<00:01:29.649> you<00:01:29.770> think

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
into the hole it's in but if you think

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:36.990 
into the hole it's in but if you think
this<00:01:30.250> is<00:01:30.459> bad<00:01:30.670> it<00:01:31.030> gets<00:01:31.600> even<00:01:31.959> worse<00:01:35.819> since<00:01:36.819> the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
this is bad it gets even worse since the

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.999 
this is bad it gets even worse since the
whole<00:01:37.240> point<00:01:37.569> of<00:01:37.690> this<00:01:37.810> migration<00:01:38.289> is<00:01:38.649> that

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
whole point of this migration is that

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.249 
whole point of this migration is that
it's<00:01:39.160> mating<00:01:39.640> season<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.240> island<00:01:40.990> is<00:01:41.110> about
