00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.049
 Yes Leon channel is here to introduce today Masked rider Takeshi 3d card 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.320
 It is all six kinds of seals 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.770
 I bought this at Seven Eleven 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.339
 The like are entered in the 3 d card is Yoroibu 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:20.080
 A feeling of size is big, isn't it about a power machine ? 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:23.980
 The lineup is about all six types 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:27.150
 Majority 4 people + fine and chestnut and clocario are not there 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.150
 Then I will open it soon 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.240
 At first glance this looks like a sharp queen but 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:41.190
 Because I made 315 yen, it is quite expensive 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:44.050
 But I think the minute that contains the surely good card 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.630
 Of course it is Avalon to aim at 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.800
 It is something that is huge 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:54.560
 To go 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.950
 The Data Baron Teller 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:05.480
 It was amazing again Baron 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:09.140
 I'm surprised I'm almost always a system that I do not know this kind of relationship nowadays 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:14.550
 This will increase my Baron collection again 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:18.870
 I think it's hard to understand if it is a video, but there is a tremendous depth here now 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:24.630
 There is a baron I do not know I do not think I do not do 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:30.630
 Baron is here, and the kite is 3d from any great angle. 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:33.450
 Looking at the video and I'd think that two types of Baron looked look in my eyes is this two provinces 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.540
 I'm look three-dimensional combine 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.630
 300 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:41.579
 It is not 15 yen Date 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.310
 In the back side is a seal and inside is a seal 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.200
 There are six types 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:53.320
 I think it is a very difficult skill to draw the most requested baron 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.039
 I feel something destiny and this Banspear is around here 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.960
 I do not know 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:03.300
 There is a banaspear here right now, there's depth like that 3ds ds 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:07.710
 Not here but here it is here 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:12.390
 I do not know that there was Baron now 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.640
 If you look at it too much, your eyes will hurt, but you can enjoy this impression for a little while 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.320
 Because I want it, it sells for 300 yen 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:23.290
 Please try to buy a bit for luck try there Baron there 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:27.609
 It looks like you've turned it sideways 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.090
 We introduced Cameras Takeshi 3d card seal in that it was good that baron came out 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:33.849
 Was 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:36.909
 300 yen is a little higher I actually see if their favorite in the 3 d feeling in something 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:41.939
 I think more than the writer is quite excited If the ball lands 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:41.939
