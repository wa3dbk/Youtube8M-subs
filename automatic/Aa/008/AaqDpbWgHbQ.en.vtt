are actually damaging the car it's not
always<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.089> same<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.450> each<00:00:15.570> car<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:15.929> you

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
always the same of each car and you

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.240 
always the same of each car and you
might<00:00:16.109> have<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.320> experiment<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.890> little<00:00:16.920> bit

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
might have to experiment a little bit

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.040 
might have to experiment a little bit
but<00:00:17.550> just<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.119> demonstrate<00:00:18.300> I'll<00:00:18.810> be<00:00:18.930> using

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
but just to demonstrate I'll be using

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.900 
but just to demonstrate I'll be using
the<00:00:19.320> ruler<00:00:19.680> for<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.279> then<00:00:20.400> I'll<00:00:20.670> show

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
the ruler for this and then I'll show

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.130 
the ruler for this and then I'll show
you<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.090> bungee<00:00:21.420> as<00:00:21.510> well<00:00:21.660> because<00:00:21.960> that's

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
you the bungee as well because that's

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.790 
you the bungee as well because that's
somewhat<00:00:22.949> different<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.400> most<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.480> cars

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
somewhat different to most of the cars

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.779 
somewhat different to most of the cars
so<00:00:25.800> what<00:00:25.980> you'll<00:00:26.099> need<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.250> do<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.760> a

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
so what you'll need to do this is a

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.210 
so what you'll need to do this is a
suppressed<00:00:27.240> sniper<00:00:27.480> rifle<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.170> try<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:28.980> use

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
suppressed sniper rifle so try to use

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.290 
suppressed sniper rifle so try to use
that<00:00:29.340> instead<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.760> heavy<00:00:29.910> sniper<00:00:30.210> because

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
that instead of the heavy sniper because

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.150 
that instead of the heavy sniper because
the<00:00:30.570> heavy<00:00:30.750> sniper<00:00:31.050> might<00:00:31.320> do<00:00:31.769> too<00:00:32.009> much

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the heavy sniper might do too much

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.299 
the heavy sniper might do too much
damage<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.550> your<00:00:32.730> car<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:34.160> remember<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.219> have

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
damage to your car and remember to have

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.889 
damage to your car and remember to have
a<00:00:35.340> suppressor<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.120> not<00:00:36.420> attract<00:00:36.719> any

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
a suppressor on it to not attract any

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.389 
a suppressor on it to not attract any
unwanted<00:00:37.140> attention<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:37.890> cops<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.309> stuff

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
unwanted attention like cops and stuff

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.430 
unwanted attention like cops and stuff
all<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.270> want<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.540> do<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.809> just<00:00:39.960> shoot<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.320> in

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
all you want to do is just shoot it in

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.010 
all you want to do is just shoot it in
the<00:00:40.559> top<00:00:40.739> corner<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> hood<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:42.570> wait

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
the top corner of the hood and you wait

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.510 
the top corner of the hood and you wait
for<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.260> pop<00:00:43.530> one<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.070> go<00:00:44.190> around<00:00:44.250> to

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
for it to pop one so you go around to

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.880 
for it to pop one so you go around to
the<00:00:44.640> other<00:00:44.700> side<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.149> car<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.739> shoot<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the other side of the car and shoot the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.920 
the other side of the car and shoot the
hood<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.340> other<00:00:47.640> corner<00:00:47.850> but<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.690> doesn't

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
hood in the other corner but it doesn't

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:49.910 
hood in the other corner but it doesn't
always<00:00:49.020> work<00:00:49.110> like<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.530> might<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.829> to

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
always work like that you might have to

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.560 
always work like that you might have to
shoot<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.370> different<00:00:50.850> locations<00:00:51.329> but

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
shoot it in different locations but

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.930 
shoot it in different locations but
around<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:52.079> general<00:00:52.530> area<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.100> then<00:00:53.820> it

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
around that general area and then it

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.910 
around that general area and then it
should<00:00:54.059> eventually<00:00:54.149> pop<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.960> second<00:00:55.500> time<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
should eventually pop a second time and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.920 
should eventually pop a second time and
then<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:56.820> drive<00:00:57.000> your<00:00:57.180> car<00:00:57.329> forward<00:00:57.660> and

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
then just drive your car forward and

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.170 
then just drive your car forward and
your<00:00:58.020> Hodel<00:00:58.260> rays<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:59.250> try<00:00:59.430> not<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.640> break<00:00:59.910> too

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
your Hodel rays but try not to break too

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.510 
your Hodel rays but try not to break too
suddenly<00:01:00.780> because<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.289> way<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.739> auto<00:01:02.160> just

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
suddenly because that way the auto just

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.709 
suddenly because that way the auto just
slumped<00:01:02.789> short<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.210> you'll<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.539> shoot

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
slumped short and you'll have to shoot

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.750 
slumped short and you'll have to shoot
it<00:01:03.870> again<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.229> get<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.379> open<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.519> what<00:01:05.670> you

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
it again to get it open but what you

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.190 
it again to get it open but what you
want<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.180> if<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.869> want<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> actually

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
want to do if you want to actually

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.500 
want to do if you want to actually
remove<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> hold<00:01:07.830> completely<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:09.240> drive

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
remove the hold completely is just drive

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.240 
remove the hold completely is just drive
off<00:01:09.720> really<00:01:10.170> fast<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.740> then<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.950> hole<00:01:11.100> should

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
off really fast and then the hole should

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.000 
off really fast and then the hole should
eventually<00:01:11.700> just<00:01:11.820> fly<00:01:12.090> off<00:01:12.299> like<00:01:12.619> I<00:01:13.619> mentioned

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
eventually just fly off like I mentioned

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.710 
eventually just fly off like I mentioned
earlier<00:01:14.100> isn't<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.640> same<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.970> every<00:01:15.210> car<00:01:15.420> so

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
earlier isn't the same of every car so

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.910 
earlier isn't the same of every car so
I'm<00:01:15.869> just<00:01:16.049> going<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.259> use<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.439> Banshee<00:01:16.740> as<00:01:16.830> an

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
I'm just going to use the Banshee as an

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.100 
I'm just going to use the Banshee as an
example<00:01:17.400> like<00:01:18.060> you've<00:01:18.330> got<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.630> shoot<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
example like you've got to shoot the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.560 
example like you've got to shoot the
side<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> hood<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.729> car<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.240> then

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
side of the hood on this car and then

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.390 
side of the hood on this car and then
shoot<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.170> opposite<00:01:22.500> side<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.950> car<00:01:23.130> in

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
shoot the opposite side of the car in

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.170 
shoot the opposite side of the car in
the<00:01:23.729> same<00:01:23.939> place<00:01:24.500> but<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:26.310> Banshee<00:01:26.700> doesn't

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
the same place but the Banshee doesn't

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.420 
the same place but the Banshee doesn't
have<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> hinges<00:01:27.780> on<00:01:27.990> each<00:01:28.710> side<00:01:28.979> as<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
have the hinges on each side as the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.580 
have the hinges on each side as the
hinges<00:01:29.729> at<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.939> front<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> car<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.780> it

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
hinges at the front of the car so it

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.740 
hinges at the front of the car so it
opens<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> opposite<00:01:32.430> direction<00:01:32.750> so

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
opens in the opposite direction so

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.569 
opens in the opposite direction so
instead<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.049> driving<00:01:34.350> forward<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.070> lift<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
instead of driving forward to lift the

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.069 
instead of driving forward to lift the
hood<00:01:35.700> up<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.970> have<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.119> reverse<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.810> lift<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
hood up you have to reverse to lift the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.170 
hood up you have to reverse to lift the
hood<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:38.070> same<00:01:38.250> applies<00:01:38.579> for<00:01:38.610> remove<00:01:39.060> in

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
hood and the same applies for remove in

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.480 
hood and the same applies for remove in
the<00:01:39.210> hood<00:01:39.390> as<00:01:39.540> well<00:01:39.570> now<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.920> also<00:01:41.070> open

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the hood as well now you can also open

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.039 
the hood as well now you can also open
the<00:01:41.640> boots<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.150> cars<00:01:42.360> if<00:01:42.659> that's

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the boots of the cars if that's

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.080 
the boots of the cars if that's
something<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.439> want<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.619> do<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:44.790> with<00:01:44.939> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
something you want to do like with the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.539 
something you want to do like with the
cavalcade<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:46.110> has<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> cool<00:01:46.829> stereo

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
cavalcade that has like a cool stereo

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.920 
cavalcade that has like a cool stereo
system<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.060> back<00:01:48.240> if<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.479> want<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.840> open

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
system in the back if you want to open

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.780 
system in the back if you want to open
that<00:01:49.110> well<00:01:49.920> I'll<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:50.220> show<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.399> how<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.579> do

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
that well I'll just show you how to do

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.219 
that well I'll just show you how to do
it<00:01:50.850> with<00:01:50.939> my<00:01:51.090> bunchy<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.780> basically<00:01:52.140> just

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
it with my bunchy so basically just

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.780 
it with my bunchy so basically just
shoot<00:01:52.590> each<00:01:52.740> corner<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.280> trunk<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.700> then

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
shoot each corner of the trunk and then

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.109 
shoot each corner of the trunk and then
it<00:01:53.939> should<00:01:54.090> pop<00:01:54.270> open<00:01:54.710> once<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.860> each<00:01:55.950> side<00:01:56.250> you

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
it should pop open once on each side you

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.399 
it should pop open once on each side you
can't<00:01:57.329> actually<00:01:57.450> remove<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.960> trunk<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
can't actually remove the trunk of the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.020 
can't actually remove the trunk of the
bunch<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.740> about<00:01:58.979> actually<00:01:59.430> doing<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.909> by

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
bunch of about actually doing it by

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.819 
bunch of about actually doing it by
force<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.479> what<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.840> had<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.110> do<00:02:01.259> was<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.560> had<00:02:01.590> to

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
force so what I had to do was I had to

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.850 
force so what I had to do was I had to
reverse<00:02:02.700> into<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> pole<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.570> knock<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.869> off<00:02:03.990> then

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
reverse into a pole to knock it off then

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.200 
reverse into a pole to knock it off then
actually<00:02:05.159> damage<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> car<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.820> much<00:02:05.969> lesser

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
actually damage to a car is much lesser

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.700 
actually damage to a car is much lesser
for<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.540> will<00:02:06.689> by<00:02:06.840> doing<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.530> you'll<00:02:07.680> just

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
for it will by doing that so you'll just

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.010 
for it will by doing that so you'll just
have<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.129> find<00:02:08.310> ways<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.700> removing<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.810> trunk

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
have to find ways of removing the trunk

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.890 
have to find ways of removing the trunk
yourself<00:02:10.349> about<00:02:10.649> actually<00:02:10.920> damaging<00:02:11.310> it

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
yourself about actually damaging it

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.479 
yourself about actually damaging it
and<00:02:11.989> one<00:02:12.590> last<00:02:12.709> thing<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:13.010> want<00:02:13.159> to<00:02:13.220> show<00:02:13.400> you

and one last thing I want to show you

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:14.830 
and one last thing I want to show you
which<00:02:13.640> probably<00:02:13.970> most<00:02:14.269> of<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.540> probably<00:02:14.629> know

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
which probably most of you probably know

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.050 
which probably most of you probably know
is<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.680> can<00:02:15.830> also<00:02:15.950> remove<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.459> doors<00:02:16.670> by

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
is you can also remove the doors by

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.820 
is you can also remove the doors by
force<00:02:17.360> if<00:02:17.599> you<00:02:17.690> just<00:02:17.870> leave<00:02:18.080> them<00:02:18.260> open<00:02:18.409> you

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
force if you just leave them open you

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.789 
force if you just leave them open you
jump<00:02:19.730> in<00:02:19.879> the<00:02:20.000> car<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:21.049> you<00:02:21.140> just<00:02:21.319> reverse<00:02:21.650> the

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
jump in the car and you just reverse the

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.440 
jump in the car and you just reverse the
door<00:02:21.980> again<00:02:22.280> some<00:02:22.549> finish<00:02:22.909> and<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.299> should

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
door again some finish and it should

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.750 
door again some finish and it should
fall<00:02:23.750> off<00:02:23.780> now<00:02:24.170> I'm<00:02:25.069> not<00:02:25.220> actually<00:02:25.280> sure<00:02:25.610> how

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
fall off now I'm not actually sure how

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.399 
fall off now I'm not actually sure how
