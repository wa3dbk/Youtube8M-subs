00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
imbalances that exist so the reason that

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.259 
imbalances that exist so the reason that
urban<00:01:03.830> agriculture<00:01:04.460> is<00:01:04.580> such<00:01:04.820> an<00:01:04.970> amazing

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
urban agriculture is such an amazing

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.960 
urban agriculture is such an amazing
tool<00:01:06.200> to<00:01:06.590> kind<00:01:06.950> of<00:01:07.100> challenge<00:01:07.610> these

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
tool to kind of challenge these

specifically<00:01:10.850> around<00:01:10.970> physical<00:01:11.600> space<00:01:11.810> and

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
specifically around physical space and

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.490 
specifically around physical space and
land<00:01:12.260> is<00:01:12.500> because<00:01:13.310> it<00:01:13.610> is<00:01:13.670> a<00:01:13.970> very<00:01:14.659> easy<00:01:14.810> way<00:01:15.440> to

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
land is because it is a very easy way to

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.100 
land is because it is a very easy way to
turn<00:01:15.920> land<00:01:16.220> into<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.610> productive<00:01:17.119> space<00:01:17.450> I<00:01:17.690> can

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
turn land into a productive space I can

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.200 
turn land into a productive space I can
fill<00:01:18.380> a<00:01:18.409> need<00:01:18.710> in<00:01:18.890> our<00:01:19.010> society<00:01:19.580> like<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.000> need

able to create a different reality there

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.330 
able to create a different reality there
is<00:01:37.240> no<00:01:37.510> demand<00:01:37.900> and<00:01:38.200> our<00:01:38.290> action<00:01:38.740> in<00:01:38.860> fact<00:01:39.130> our

action is the demand we are being

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.560 
action is the demand we are being
proactive<00:01:41.440> in<00:01:41.890> creating<00:01:42.340> it<00:01:42.460> and<00:01:42.580> so<00:01:43.240> urban

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
proactive in creating it and so urban

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.840 
proactive in creating it and so urban
agriculture<00:01:44.440> specifically<00:01:45.340> when<00:01:45.580> it<00:01:45.700> is

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
agriculture specifically when it is

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.620 
agriculture specifically when it is
taking<00:01:46.330> spaces<00:01:47.140> that<00:01:47.710> are<00:01:47.880> are<00:01:48.880> not<00:01:49.360> being

used<00:01:50.050> for<00:01:50.380> community<00:01:51.130> benefit<00:01:51.580> I'm<00:01:51.790> can

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
used for community benefit I'm can

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.359 
used for community benefit I'm can
highlight<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.229> lot<00:01:53.500> of<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.740> issues<00:01:54.159> around

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
highlight a lot of the issues around

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:01.380 
highlight a lot of the issues around
societal<00:01:55.270> equitable<00:01:56.190> equity<00:01:57.190> and<00:01:57.399> justice

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.190 

well<00:02:02.110> I<00:02:02.140> think<00:02:03.240> unused<00:02:04.240> an<00:02:04.450> underutilized

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
well I think unused an underutilized

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.690 
well I think unused an underutilized
land<00:02:06.070> is<00:02:08.670> necessary<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:09.759> be<00:02:10.240> used<00:02:11.230> now<00:02:11.700> and

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
land is necessary to be used now and

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.380 
land is necessary to be used now and
specifically<00:02:13.209> when<00:02:13.540> there's<00:02:15.150> those<00:02:16.150> people

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
specifically when there's those people

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.540 
specifically when there's those people
who<00:02:16.480> are<00:02:16.600> willing<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.959> actually<00:02:17.430> put<00:02:18.430> an

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
who are willing to actually put an

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.180 
who are willing to actually put an
effort<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.060> make<00:02:19.570> the<00:02:19.750> land<00:02:19.990> of<00:02:20.650> resource<00:02:21.070> a

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
effort and make the land of resource a

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.130 
effort and make the land of resource a
community<00:02:21.610> resource<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:22.270> think<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.050> should

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
community resource I think that should

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.530 
community resource I think that should
be<00:02:23.200> allowed<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.470> do<00:02:23.709> so<00:02:23.970> right<00:02:24.970> now<00:02:25.000> within<00:02:25.420> the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
be allowed to do so right now within the

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.830 
be allowed to do so right now within the
current<00:02:26.140> system<00:02:26.459> it's<00:02:27.600> incredibly<00:02:28.600> difficult

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
current system it's incredibly difficult

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.570 
current system it's incredibly difficult
for<00:02:29.230> people<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.470> be<00:02:29.590> able<00:02:29.739> to<00:02:29.950> have<00:02:30.100> land<00:02:30.400> and

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
for people to be able to have land and

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.360 
for people to be able to have land and
especially<00:02:30.880> in<00:02:31.750> areas<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:32.140> are<00:02:32.709> dense<00:02:33.160> urban

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
especially in areas that are dense urban

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.830 
especially in areas that are dense urban

centers which paradoxically is exactly

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.220 
centers which paradoxically is exactly

where food needs to actually be grown
more<00:02:41.620> food<00:02:41.830> needs<00:02:42.070> to<00:02:42.160> be<00:02:42.250> grown<00:02:44.250> at<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.340> free

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
more food needs to be grown at the free

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.509 
more food needs to be grown at the free
farm<00:02:45.730> in<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:45.940> city<00:02:46.200> they<00:02:47.200> had<00:02:47.440> work<00:02:48.280> days

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
farm in the city they had work days

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.880 
farm in the city they had work days
twice<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.060> week<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.600> would<00:02:50.320> distribute<00:02:50.650> the

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
twice a week and would distribute the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.280 
twice a week and would distribute the
food<00:02:51.040> at<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.640> free<00:02:51.790> farm<00:02:52.000> stand<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:53.200> would

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
food at the free farm stand and it would

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.540 
food at the free farm stand and it would
also<00:02:53.440> be<00:02:53.560> among<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:53.950> people<00:02:54.160> who<00:02:54.250> worked<00:02:54.430> the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
also be among the people who worked the

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.820 
also be among the people who worked the
land<00:02:54.730> so<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:56.080> think<00:02:56.200> that's<00:02:56.410> a<00:02:56.560> really<00:02:56.739> great

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
land so I think that's a really great

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.170 
land so I think that's a really great
model<00:02:57.750> at<00:02:58.750> occupied<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.410> farm<00:02:59.650> we<00:03:00.130> had<00:03:00.820> 40

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
model at occupied the farm we had 40

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.729 
model at occupied the farm we had 40
rows<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:01.570> weaker<00:03:01.780> over<00:03:01.810> a<00:03:02.050> ton<00:03:02.260> of<00:03:02.290> food<00:03:02.500> and

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
rows and weaker over a ton of food and

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.070 
rows and weaker over a ton of food and
we<00:03:02.800> gave<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:02.950> all<00:03:03.100> away<00:03:03.209> we<00:03:04.209> did<00:03:04.360> sell<00:03:04.540> one<00:03:04.720> one

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
we gave it all away we did sell one one

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.630 
we gave it all away we did sell one one
bit<00:03:05.260> of<00:03:05.290> it<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.950> know<00:03:06.040> we<00:03:06.220> didn't<00:03:06.400> even<00:03:06.459> ask

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
bit of it you know we didn't even ask

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.510 
bit of it you know we didn't even ask
for<00:03:06.820> donations<00:03:07.209> won't<00:03:07.450> give<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.630> away

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.030 

so<00:03:13.150> it's<00:03:13.300> actually<00:03:13.480> really<00:03:14.200> surprisingly

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
so it's actually really surprisingly

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.100 
so it's actually really surprisingly
easy<00:03:15.460> to<00:03:15.940> convert<00:03:16.330> a<00:03:16.390> space<00:03:16.720> into<00:03:17.080> a

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
easy to convert a space into a

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.050 
easy to convert a space into a
productive<00:03:17.620> space<00:03:17.920> really<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.610> need<00:03:18.760> time

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
productive space really you need time

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.780 
productive space really you need time
and<00:03:19.480> dedication<00:03:20.280> but<00:03:21.280> outside<00:03:21.640> of<00:03:21.670> that

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
and dedication but outside of that

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.580 
and dedication but outside of that
obviously<00:03:22.420> there's<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.840> tools<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.560> the

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
obviously there's the tools and the

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.400 
obviously there's the tools and the
seeds<00:03:23.950> but<00:03:24.760> I<00:03:25.030> mean<00:03:25.180> urban<00:03:25.480> agriculture<00:03:26.200> is

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
seeds but I mean urban agriculture is

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.640 
seeds but I mean urban agriculture is
ties<00:03:27.130> into<00:03:27.520> a<00:03:27.960> historical<00:03:28.960> kind<00:03:29.170> of<00:03:29.260> cultural

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
ties into a historical kind of cultural

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.590 
ties into a historical kind of cultural
practice<00:03:30.100> that<00:03:30.640> no<00:03:30.790> matter<00:03:30.940> who<00:03:31.390> you<00:03:31.450> are

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
practice that no matter who you are

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.840 
practice that no matter who you are
where<00:03:32.080> you're<00:03:32.260> from<00:03:32.320> you<00:03:33.280> at<00:03:33.550> some<00:03:33.580> point

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
where you're from you at some point

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.720 
where you're from you at some point
we're<00:03:34.600> tapped<00:03:34.810> into<00:03:35.020> like<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:35.620> there's<00:03:36.100> no

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
we're tapped into like you there's no

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.060 
we're tapped into like you there's no
matter<00:03:36.910> where<00:03:37.360> you<00:03:37.390> come<00:03:37.810> from<00:03:38.070> generations

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
matter where you come from generations

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.010 
matter where you come from generations
before<00:03:39.280> you<00:03:39.670> have<00:03:39.910> practice<00:03:40.150> department<00:03:40.900> and

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
before you have practice department and

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.260 
before you have practice department and
so<00:03:41.320> there<00:03:41.890> is<00:03:42.070> there's<00:03:42.430> an<00:03:42.580> eight<00:03:42.790> knowledge

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
so there is there's an eight knowledge

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.000 
so there is there's an eight knowledge
and<00:03:43.450> a<00:03:43.510> lot<00:03:43.690> of<00:03:43.810> us<00:03:43.930> are<00:03:44.170> related<00:03:44.650> to<00:03:44.680> kind<00:03:44.950> of

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
and a lot of us are related to kind of

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.340 
and a lot of us are related to kind of
how<00:03:45.130> to<00:03:45.190> care<00:03:45.520> for<00:03:45.550> natural<00:03:46.120> spaces<00:03:46.360> that<00:03:47.110> when

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
how to care for natural spaces that when

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.290 
how to care for natural spaces that when
we're<00:03:47.530> doing<00:03:47.710> urban<00:03:48.190> farming<00:03:48.580> we<00:03:48.820> tap<00:03:49.030> into

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
we're doing urban farming we tap into

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.210 
we're doing urban farming we tap into
and<00:03:49.630> so<00:03:49.960> it's<00:03:50.110> kind<00:03:50.290> of<00:03:50.320> just<00:03:50.470> reminding<00:03:51.100> of

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
and so it's kind of just reminding of

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.670 
and so it's kind of just reminding of
people<00:03:51.610> of<00:03:51.820> a<00:03:52.240> past<00:03:52.510> that<00:03:52.690> they<00:03:52.900> used<00:03:53.110> to<00:03:53.320> kind

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
people of a past that they used to kind

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:03.190 
people of a past that they used to kind
of<00:03:53.800> enjoy

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.860 

so<00:04:03.980> I<00:04:04.010> think<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.550> most<00:04:04.790> powerful<00:04:05.420> thing<00:04:05.629> about

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
so I think the most powerful thing about

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.390 
so I think the most powerful thing about
this<00:04:06.050> movement<00:04:06.349> is<00:04:06.620> that<00:04:06.800> anyone<00:04:07.250> can

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
this movement is that anyone can

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.390 
this movement is that anyone can
participate<00:04:07.780> whether<00:04:08.780> young<00:04:09.290> old<00:04:09.680> rich<00:04:10.129> or

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
participate whether young old rich or

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.059 
participate whether young old rich or
poor<00:04:10.670> you<00:04:10.910> can<00:04:11.090> participate<00:04:11.750> in<00:04:12.019> kind<00:04:12.950> of

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
poor you can participate in kind of

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.460 
poor you can participate in kind of
redistributing<00:04:13.690> resources<00:04:14.690> in<00:04:14.810> our<00:04:14.900> society

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
redistributing resources in our society

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.520 
redistributing resources in our society
of<00:04:15.620> creating<00:04:16.220> spaces<00:04:16.519> that<00:04:16.940> are<00:04:17.000> at<00:04:17.780> one<00:04:18.290> point

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
of creating spaces that are at one point

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.969 
of creating spaces that are at one point
restorative<00:04:19.190> but<00:04:19.549> also<00:04:20.019> productive<00:04:21.019> and<00:04:21.440> so

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
restorative but also productive and so

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.000 
restorative but also productive and so
for<00:04:22.790> I<00:04:23.000> think<00:04:23.570> anyone<00:04:24.229> can<00:04:24.470> identify<00:04:24.710> open

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
for I think anyone can identify open

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.300 
for I think anyone can identify open
space<00:04:25.639> in<00:04:25.669> their<00:04:25.940> community<00:04:26.419> and<00:04:27.310> plant

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
space in their community and plant

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.490 
space in their community and plant
something<00:04:28.580> and<00:04:28.880> that's<00:04:29.660> all<00:04:29.870> you<00:04:30.050> have<00:04:30.200> to<00:04:30.350> do

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
something and that's all you have to do

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.920 
something and that's all you have to do
and<00:04:30.830> after<00:04:31.190> you<00:04:31.280> plant<00:04:31.460> something<00:04:31.790> reach<00:04:32.750> out

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
and after you plant something reach out

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.600 
and after you plant something reach out
to<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.200> community<00:04:33.229> around<00:04:33.800> their<00:04:34.160> plant

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
to the community around their plant

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.969 
to the community around their plant
something<00:04:34.910> close<00:04:35.360> to<00:04:35.389> you<00:04:35.750> right<00:04:36.139> maybe<00:04:36.770> it's

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
something close to you right maybe it's

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.070 
something close to you right maybe it's
outside<00:04:37.460> on<00:04:37.820> your<00:04:37.970> front<00:04:38.180> lawn<00:04:38.300> maybe<00:04:38.780> it's<00:04:38.990> a

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
outside on your front lawn maybe it's a

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.600 
outside on your front lawn maybe it's a
median<00:04:39.530> on<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:39.770> street<00:04:40.040> that<00:04:40.070> you<00:04:40.340> live<00:04:40.580> in

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
median on the street that you live in

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.150 
median on the street that you live in
the<00:04:41.240> plant<00:04:41.600> it<00:04:41.810> out<00:04:41.960> and<00:04:42.229> then<00:04:42.350> integrate<00:04:43.010> it

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
the plant it out and then integrate it
