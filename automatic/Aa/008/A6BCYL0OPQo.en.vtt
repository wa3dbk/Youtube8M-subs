00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:10.349
 and there ended 40 Olympic talking the video 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.190
 of today on itil mario how to treat and 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.190
 how to prevent 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.540
 it was the first thing what itil week is 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.140
 Uncle he is nothing more than a parasite. 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.970
 He allied himself with some fish and he 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.950
 entered our device generally 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.880
 when we do not make a relative 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.960
 inadequate 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.970
 That's why we give so much 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.660
 importance for you to have a flour of 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.550
 quarantine or have the system in the samp 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.739
 space to quarantine this fish 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.450
 as good as it works 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.430
 usually when he's already in your 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.160
 System you already put a kiss that has 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.019
 such a litigation has a few steps 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.920
 for you to try to heal this fish 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:58.379
 asking why to try the following for the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.360
 has a big problem when 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.180
 You treat fish you finish. 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.480
 damaging the coral to protect the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.830
 efficient quarantine system 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.030
 possibly also not to have a 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.700
 the hospital 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.710
 So what's the biggest problem if people 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.140
 to treat the kiss we will end 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.670
 damaging some corals for example 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.159
 what are the types of treatment that the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.250
 people have to picchu in this case that the 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.890
 saltwater itil I do not know if it's 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.600
 inform the same rhythm but the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.370
 treatment is very 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.320
 like the difference is that different 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.130
 when we do the water treatment 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.260
 candy 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.700
 we are hypersensitive and 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
 when we do the water treatment 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.390
 salted there possibility 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.060
 I do not know if the same parasite is 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.340
 possibly in the blog form I 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.490
 infamous with a description of researching 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.320
 very brown makes there almost a guy who 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.600
 we may be treating and repeated 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.140
 in our system in our picture imagine 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.330
 has the right temperature rise 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.760
 when we take the temperature to the 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:05.640
 house of 26 gives up to one of 0 to 29 degrees 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.830
 our corals will feel right but 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.250
 to kill to end the hit you have 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.709
 that take from 29 and 32 degrees Celsius in a 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.690
 party has any kind of decorating the 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.310
 corals will suffer from this the temperature 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.190
 is the heart very sensitive to 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.290
 good temperature else has to 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.700
 responsibility we will lower the 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.060
 quality our court 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.330
 usually our system is in 1024 and 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.790
 We'll find him right up to 1009. 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.959
 doing this what happens the corals 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.330
 will also suffer 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.220
 I'm not even going to tell you to put medicine. 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.319
 certain copper base they are super 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.330
 efficient to leave that usually six days 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.050
 Medication based on drug 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.970
 covers the fish are all the books the 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.030
 corals did not have any resistance 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.090
 then charge what we do the first 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.160
 thing if you do not have one for 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.560
 hospital a place reserved for 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.799
 working this fish is the first thing 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.330
 What do you have to do? 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.150
 how you treat the garbage so 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.090
 efficiently without damaging their 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.100
 corals not having hospital now 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.080
 the first thing you have to understand 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.790
 You already made a mistake when you brought 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.160
 this quarantined fish 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.130
 Whether or not your father has been 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.720
 such that will make will put this fish 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.150
 and one to the hospital and use one 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.530
 copper-based medicine is good - 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.080
 medicinal products which are based on copper 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.150
 today in the market they make a mistake 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.489
 totally taken off your fish 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.489
 in about seven days 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.320
 Okay, it 's a quick top dosage. 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.299
 to make one for the hospital today you 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.579
 will not spend almost nothing is good to have only 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.340
 certain flour depends on the prices 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.709
 you have an option from about 40 1 100 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.100
 liters more or less may have a filter 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.989
 It 's just for moving around in a 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.970
 filter yields and another went after 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.310
 a failure in the ski Lesser Sea within 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.889
 one for the same is just to treat 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.450
 that your kiss is something else when 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.859
 price is with the parasite 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.590
 he gets very low immunity 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:06.780
 So what do we ask to do it? 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.670
 try to overcome fish feed you 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.470
 feed twice in the day try 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.760
 feed him at least four 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.639
 times in the day 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.739
 It's worth noting that you have not announced your 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:19.739
 system leaving not fall success 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.359
 more it is necessary to have chemical or 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.020
 something else is fine 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.139
 but still has some modifications 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.349
 but not the factions that have base of garlic and 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.500
 oil helps fish to improve their 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:34.150
 quality then the following has 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.090
 daily and daily ration 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.069
 Which is more efficient and a civilian people? 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.259
 use our appliances here 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:43.419
 people rode is also used 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.250
 daily supplementation is 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.229
 supplementation area has a man in the 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.909
 market that you then ask the 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:51.699
 description we end up forming another 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:53.949
 very cool video is agent of 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.650
 supplementation when speaking to the 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.900
 and we're supplementation for 20 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.960
 days that happens people get more 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.389
 strong ones feed more and then they can 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.370
 making rather a copper treatment that is 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.169
 a treatment that is already heavy equal to 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.280
 inability to fish stress 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.440
 But not charge while in 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.430
 impossible to remember that none of the 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.349
 two can do with corals on the board 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.940
 because you have a problem with corals with 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:20.860
 if estressarem just dropping a 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.919
 substance in water that will harm 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.219
 even more fish is good otherwise it is 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:29.650
 the world's life cycle the parasite in the 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:32.050
 pace in case is 60 days 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.750
 so what happens in 60 days he 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.639
 got all the mobile marketing system 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.039
 so it's cool for you to take your fish 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.650
 do the right treatment for them and if 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:43.900
 has spread in the system filtering will 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.740
 end up using most environmental 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.300
 But it's cool for you to wait 60 days. 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.310
 continues feeding corals continue 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.440
 doing the whole normal process gave 60 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.539
 days to wait another two days there 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.120
 you can turn your fish in an area that 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:00.340
 No problem, too. 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.860
 recalling the irresponsibility of 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:06.009
 elevation and treatment with 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.830
 copper base can not in corals of 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:11.169
 no kind is always hard eyes 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.630
 can not have any problem you 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.340
 have in relation to i that the egg a 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.139
 doubt in this video you can be 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.539
