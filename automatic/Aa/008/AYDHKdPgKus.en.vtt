00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
powerful tablet so that you can pretty

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.910 
powerful tablet so that you can pretty
much<00:02:52.150> it<00:02:53.150> doesn't<00:02:53.360> matter<00:02:53.600> how<00:02:53.900> high<00:02:54.410> spec<00:02:54.769> the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
much it doesn't matter how high spec the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.559 
much it doesn't matter how high spec the
game<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.459> could<00:02:55.760> play<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.150> on<00:02:56.269> a<00:02:56.299> TV

game it is you could play it on a TV
full<00:02:56.959> 1080p<00:02:57.440> so<00:02:58.190> it's<00:02:58.580> a<00:02:58.730> quad-core<00:02:59.209> 1.6

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
full 1080p so it's a quad-core 1.6

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.100 
full 1080p so it's a quad-core 1.6
gigahertz<00:03:00.290> processor<00:03:00.970> with<00:03:01.970> a<00:03:02.000> separate<00:03:02.510> Mali

gigahertz processor with a separate Mali

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.039 
gigahertz processor with a separate Mali
400<00:03:03.799> quad-core<00:03:03.980> GPU<00:03:04.430> so<00:03:05.390> it<00:03:05.480> means<00:03:05.630> that<00:03:05.750> any

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
400 quad-core GPU so it means that any

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.920 
400 quad-core GPU so it means that any
