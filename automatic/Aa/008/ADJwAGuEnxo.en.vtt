the civil war happens to coincide with
it<00:00:18.540> with<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.800> technology<00:00:19.800> change<00:00:20.160> in

photography pre Civil War most images

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.820 
photography pre Civil War most images
would<00:00:23.970> have<00:00:24.119> been<00:00:24.240> daguerreotype<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
would have been daguerreotype the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.350 
would have been daguerreotype the
photographer's<00:00:26.430> used<00:00:26.670> what<00:00:26.880> was<00:00:26.970> called<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
photographer's used what was called the

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.450 
photographer's used what was called the
wet<00:00:27.509> plate<00:00:27.720> process<00:00:27.750> has<00:00:28.529> called<00:00:28.860> that<00:00:29.070> due<00:00:29.430> to

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
wet plate process has called that due to

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.980 
wet plate process has called that due to
the<00:00:29.640> fact<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.210> plates<00:00:30.480> had<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.840> be

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
the fact that the plates had to be

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.070 
the fact that the plates had to be
exposed<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.949> processed<00:00:32.669> well<00:00:32.850> still<00:00:33.180> wet<00:00:33.510> and

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.080 
exposed and processed well still wet and

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.180 
exposed and processed well still wet and
the<00:00:34.230> interesting<00:00:34.680> thing<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
the interesting thing is the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.860 
the interesting thing is the
photographers<00:00:35.760> actually<00:00:35.940> would<00:00:36.390> have<00:00:36.480> had<00:00:36.540> to

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
photographers actually would have had to

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.930 
photographers actually would have had to
follow<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.559> encampments<00:00:38.550> they<00:00:38.610> would<00:00:38.730> have

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
follow the encampments they would have

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.880 
follow the encampments they would have
made<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> portraits<00:00:39.660> right<00:00:40.170> at<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.650> sites

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
made the portraits right at the sites

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.799 
made the portraits right at the sites
and<00:00:41.220> so<00:00:41.400> what<00:00:41.519> we<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:41.850> here<00:00:42.030> are<00:00:42.150> two<00:00:42.180> studio

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
and so what we have here are two studio

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.020 
and so what we have here are two studio
cameras<00:00:43.290> from<00:00:43.470> the<00:00:43.559> Civil<00:00:43.860> War<00:00:43.890> era<00:00:44.190> there's<00:00:44.940> a

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
cameras from the Civil War era there's a

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.170 
cameras from the Civil War era there's a
louis<00:00:45.330> wet<00:00:46.199> plate<00:00:46.469> camera<00:00:46.980> which<00:00:47.790> would<00:00:47.969> be

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
louis wet plate camera which would be

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.959 
louis wet plate camera which would be
probably<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.140> most<00:00:49.290> common<00:00:49.800> workhorse<00:00:50.610> type

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
probably the most common workhorse type

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.970 
probably the most common workhorse type
camera<00:00:51.390> from<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.750> era<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.379> Civil<00:00:52.950> War

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
camera from that era the Civil War

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.799 
camera from that era the Civil War
portraits<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.790> see<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.390> most<00:00:54.420> part

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
portraits that you see for the most part

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.270 
portraits that you see for the most part
would<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:54.989> been<00:00:55.290> made<00:00:55.469> with<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> camera<00:00:56.070> like

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
would have been made with a camera like

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.340 
would have been made with a camera like
this<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:57.450> interesting<00:00:57.899> thing<00:00:58.050> about<00:00:58.110> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
this the interesting thing about the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.229 
this the interesting thing about the
camera<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.890> has<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> repeating<00:00:59.489> back<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.149> you

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
camera is it has a repeating back so you

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.450 
camera is it has a repeating back so you
can<00:01:00.360> actually<00:01:00.539> make<00:01:00.870> multiple<00:01:01.410> images<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.129> one

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
can actually make multiple images on one

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.870 
can actually make multiple images on one
plate<00:01:03.470> it<00:01:04.470> lowers<00:01:04.800> the<00:01:04.949> cost<00:01:05.190> of<00:01:05.489> portraiture

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
plate it lowers the cost of portraiture

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.900 
plate it lowers the cost of portraiture
is<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.360> makes<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.140> more<00:01:08.009> affordable<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
is it makes it more affordable for the

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.520 
is it makes it more affordable for the
various<00:01:09.210> soldiers<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.810> have<00:01:09.930> their<00:01:10.080> portraits

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
various soldiers to have their portraits

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.200 
various soldiers to have their portraits
done<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:10.950> they<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.220> send<00:01:11.430> them<00:01:11.580> back<00:01:11.700> home<00:01:11.759> to

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
done so they can send them back home to

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.960 
done so they can send them back home to
their<00:01:12.330> families<00:01:12.920> on<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.550> back<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
their families on the back of the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.790 
their families on the back of the
cameras<00:01:15.300> are<00:01:15.479> some<00:01:15.690> grey<00:01:15.960> stains<00:01:16.380> which<00:01:16.649> is

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
cameras are some grey stains which is

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.890 
cameras are some grey stains which is
caused<00:01:17.039> by<00:01:17.250> silver<00:01:17.700> nitrate<00:01:17.910> so<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.720> this

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
caused by silver nitrate so you can this

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.899 
caused by silver nitrate so you can this
also<00:01:19.140> helps<00:01:19.590> identify<00:01:20.130> them<00:01:20.340> as<00:01:20.490> wet<00:01:20.670> plate

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
also helps identify them as wet plate

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.760 
also helps identify them as wet plate
cameras<00:01:21.330> all<00:01:21.510> wet<00:01:21.869> plate<00:01:22.080> cameras<00:01:22.439> will<00:01:22.590> have

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
cameras all wet plate cameras will have

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.980 
cameras all wet plate cameras will have
dark<00:01:23.130> stains<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:24.119> they<00:01:24.270> were<00:01:24.360> used<00:01:26.510> the<00:01:27.510> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
dark stains on if they were used the the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.929 
dark stains on if they were used the the
stereo<00:01:28.350> camera<00:01:28.830> has<00:01:28.979> affiliations<00:01:29.820> with

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
stereo camera has affiliations with

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.160 
stereo camera has affiliations with
Mathew<00:01:30.420> Brady's<00:01:30.750> studio<00:01:31.170> Brady<00:01:32.810> took<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.900> upon

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
Mathew Brady's studio Brady took it upon

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.679 
Mathew Brady's studio Brady took it upon
himself<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.650> document<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.150> whole<00:01:36.299> Civil

himself to document the the whole Civil

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.480 
himself to document the the whole Civil
War<00:01:36.900> basically<00:01:37.560> paid<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.100> out<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.250> his

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
War basically paid for it out of his

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.130 
War basically paid for it out of his
pocket<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> cameras<00:01:40.110> that

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
pocket this is one of the cameras that

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.499 
pocket this is one of the cameras that
belong<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.860> studio<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.790> ground<00:01:42.030> glass<00:01:42.180> is

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
belong to the studio the ground glass is

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.630 
belong to the studio the ground glass is
hinged<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.290> actually<00:01:43.500> would<00:01:43.770> lower<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
hinged so you actually would lower the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.340 
hinged so you actually would lower the
ground<00:01:44.880> glass<00:01:45.150> you<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.450> see<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.780> septum<00:01:46.200> and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
ground glass you can see the septum and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.730 
ground glass you can see the septum and
the<00:01:46.530> plate<00:01:46.740> would<00:01:46.890> go<00:01:47.310> down<00:01:47.490> right<00:01:47.729> up<00:01:47.850> here

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
the plate would go down right up here

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.289 
the plate would go down right up here
with<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.799> stereo<00:01:50.310> camera<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.909> need<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.150> have

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
with a stereo camera you need to have

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.359 
with a stereo camera you need to have
something<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.500> called<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.829> septum<00:01:53.220> that

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
something it's called a septum that

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.950 
something it's called a septum that
actually<00:01:53.729> separates<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.420> two<00:01:54.570> images

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
actually separates the two images

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.539 
actually separates the two images
otherwise<00:01:55.439> they<00:01:55.650> would<00:01:55.770> overlap<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.400> this

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
otherwise they would overlap so this

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.100 
otherwise they would overlap so this
gives<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.820> two<00:01:57.060> distinct<00:01:57.570> images<00:01:59.689> the<00:02:00.689> stereo

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
gives you two distinct images the stereo

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.340 
gives you two distinct images the stereo
camera<00:02:01.500> also<00:02:02.450> would<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.540> been<00:02:03.600> used<00:02:03.930> either

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
camera also would have been used either
