gasket and the transmission filter

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.709 
gasket and the transmission filter
there's<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.670> old<00:00:44.820> transmission<00:00:45.420> fluid

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
there's the old transmission fluid

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.990 
there's the old transmission fluid
really<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.110> fluid<00:00:46.469> didn't<00:00:46.649> look<00:00:46.770> bad<00:00:47.219> there

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
really the fluid didn't look bad there

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.819

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.920 
better shot of it there that's the $450
Oh<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.340> focus<00:02:20.030> cx-5<00:02:21.519> what<00:02:22.519> I<00:02:22.550> did<00:02:22.819> notice<00:02:23.030> is

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
Oh to focus cx-5 what I did notice is

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:34.130 
Oh to focus cx-5 what I did notice is
that<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.230> exhaust<00:02:24.590> pipe

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.449 

I'm<00:02:35.140> sure<00:02:35.319> by<00:02:35.530> now<00:02:35.560> everybody<00:02:36.099> knows<00:02:36.280> what

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
I'm sure by now everybody knows what

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.170 
I'm sure by now everybody knows what
that<00:02:36.489> means

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.960 

definite<00:02:40.180> sign<00:02:40.390> of<00:02:40.629> a

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
definite sign of a

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.300 
definite sign of a
leaking<00:02:42.750> head<00:02:42.900> gasket<00:02:43.350> there<00:02:43.710> is<00:02:43.800> no<00:02:44.010> water<00:02:44.190> in

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
leaking head gasket there is no water in

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.950 
leaking head gasket there is no water in
the<00:02:44.490> oil<00:02:45.350> so<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.470> oil<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.710> not<00:02:46.860> contaminated

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
the oil so the oil is not contaminated

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:56.300 
the oil so the oil is not contaminated
there's<00:02:48.960> no<00:02:49.110> oil<00:02:49.350> in<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.740> coolant

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.420 

so<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.480> think<00:02:57.810> it's<00:02:57.959> got<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.140> very<00:02:58.500> very<00:02:58.650> slightly

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
so I think it's got a very very slightly

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.160 
so I think it's got a very very slightly
leaking<00:02:59.910> head<00:03:00.060> gasket<00:03:00.480> it's<00:03:00.600> not<00:03:00.750> too<00:03:00.990> bad

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
leaking head gasket it's not too bad

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.230 
leaking head gasket it's not too bad
it's<00:03:01.410> only<00:03:01.740> seeming<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.430> affect<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:02.940> at<00:03:03.090> an

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
it's only seeming to affect it at an

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.420 
it's only seeming to affect it at an
idle<00:03:03.660> like<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.680> said<00:03:04.890> shouldn't<00:03:05.100> you<00:03:05.220> get<00:03:05.310> the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
idle like I said shouldn't you get the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.699 
idle like I said shouldn't you get the
gas<00:03:05.580> take<00:03:05.910> off<00:03:06.090> she<00:03:06.330> runs<00:03:06.540> great<00:03:06.930> drives

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
gas take off she runs great drives

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.100 
gas take off she runs great drives
perfectly<00:03:08.190> smooth<00:03:09.319> so<00:03:10.520> what<00:03:11.520> I<00:03:11.550> did<00:03:12.110> being

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
perfectly smooth so what I did being

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.830 
perfectly smooth so what I did being
that<00:03:13.260> I'm<00:03:13.380> a<00:03:13.410> mechanic<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.130> I<00:03:14.510> do<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:15.720> stuff

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
that I'm a mechanic and I do this stuff

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.780 
that I'm a mechanic and I do this stuff
all<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.230> time<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:18.720> know<00:03:18.840> for<00:03:19.040> $450<00:03:20.040> it's<00:03:20.610> not

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
all the time you know for $450 it's not

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.710 
all the time you know for $450 it's not
a<00:03:20.819> bad<00:03:21.060> deal<00:03:21.239> I<00:03:21.620> probably<00:03:22.620> got<00:03:22.950> another<00:03:23.540> $70<00:03:24.540> or

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
a bad deal I probably got another $70 or

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.949 
a bad deal I probably got another $70 or
so<00:03:24.900> into<00:03:25.110> it<00:03:25.410> in<00:03:26.010> parts<00:03:26.370> right<00:03:26.550> now<00:03:26.870> but<00:03:27.870> I've

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
Devils sitting around that I haven't

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.000 
Devils sitting around that I haven't
been<00:03:34.500> using<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:36.590> you<00:03:37.590> know<00:03:37.650> I<00:03:37.709> don't<00:03:37.830> want<00:03:37.950> to

put too much money into this car and the
head<00:03:39.630> gaskets<00:03:40.050> not<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.530> bad<00:03:40.739> so<00:03:40.980> I'm<00:03:41.040> pretty

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
head gaskets not that bad so I'm pretty

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.660 
head gaskets not that bad so I'm pretty
sure<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.489> this<00:03:41.790> should<00:03:42.090> seal<00:03:43.050> it<00:03:43.080> up<00:03:43.319> it<00:03:44.310> says

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
sure that this should seal it up it says

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.530 
sure that this should seal it up it says
to<00:03:44.910> use<00:03:45.090> half<00:03:45.450> of<00:03:45.569> a<00:03:45.660> bottle<00:03:47.030> for<00:03:48.030> three

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
gallons and this system actually only

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.100 
gallons and this system actually only
holds<00:03:51.480> a<00:03:52.340> gallon<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.730> half<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:54.600> went<00:03:55.050> ahead

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110

holds a gallon and a half I went ahead
and<00:03:55.350> used<00:03:55.560> half<00:03:55.920> a<00:03:56.010> bottle<00:03:56.190> anyway<00:03:56.640> I<00:03:56.880> should

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
and used half a bottle anyway I should

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.240 
and used half a bottle anyway I should
have<00:03:57.300> used<00:03:57.420> a<00:03:57.540> quarter<00:03:57.830> so<00:03:58.830> I<00:03:58.860> gave<00:03:59.069> it<00:03:59.190> a

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
have used a quarter so I gave it a

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.720 
have used a quarter so I gave it a
little<00:03:59.310> bit<00:03:59.519> extra<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:01.260> it's<00:04:01.620> been<00:04:01.799> sitting

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
little bit extra and it's been sitting

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.929 
little bit extra and it's been sitting
here<00:04:02.760> idling<00:04:03.269> for<00:04:03.420> maybe<00:04:03.600> ten<00:04:03.959> minutes<00:04:04.079> or<00:04:05.040> so

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:07.939 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:09.580 

bottle<00:04:08.420> says<00:04:08.599> to<00:04:08.750> run<00:04:08.870> it<00:04:08.959> for<00:04:09.079> about<00:04:09.109> 50

I do

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.060 
I do
I<00:04:14.239> typically<00:04:14.959> let<00:04:15.140> it<00:04:15.230> run<00:04:15.409> for<00:04:15.620> about<00:04:15.709> three

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
I typically let it run for about three

I typically let it run for about three
hours<00:04:16.900> I<00:04:19.600> want<00:04:20.600> to<00:04:20.660> make<00:04:20.780> sure<00:04:20.810> it<00:04:21.079> gets<00:04:21.199> done

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.320 
hours I want to make sure it gets done
and<00:04:21.769> that<00:04:22.280> it<00:04:22.400> doesn't<00:04:22.550> have<00:04:22.669> problems<00:04:23.150> later

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.110 
and that it doesn't have problems later
on<00:04:23.449> so<00:04:23.900> instead<00:04:24.889> of<00:04:24.949> the<00:04:25.220> recommended<00:04:25.789> 50

minutes on the bottle I let it run for
about<00:04:28.100> three<00:04:28.490> hours<00:04:29.380> you<00:04:30.380> know<00:04:30.500> I'll<00:04:30.620> go<00:04:30.740> run

24<00:04:37.910> hours<00:04:38.419> before<00:04:38.900> you<00:04:39.199> even<00:04:39.590> attempt<00:04:39.889> to

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
24 hours before you even attempt to

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:40.810 
24 hours before you even attempt to
start<00:04:40.130> it<00:04:40.250> back<00:04:40.370> up<00:04:40.550> again

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
start it back up again

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.969 
start it back up again
but<00:04:41.479> typically<00:04:41.900> within<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.229> first<00:04:42.440> hour<00:04:42.680> to

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
but typically within the first hour to

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.219 
but typically within the first hour to
two<00:04:43.130> hours<00:04:43.160> you'll<00:04:43.940> notice<00:04:44.300> that<00:04:44.509> the<00:04:44.720> idle

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
two hours you'll notice that the idle

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.779 
two hours you'll notice that the idle
will<00:04:45.380> smooth<00:04:45.650> out<00:04:45.860> and<00:04:47.949> that<00:04:48.949> water<00:04:49.280> spent<00:04:49.699> now

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
will smooth out and that water spent now

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.100 
will smooth out and that water spent now
the<00:04:49.849> tailpipe<00:04:50.620> will<00:04:51.620> clear<00:04:52.220> up<00:04:52.430> dramatically

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
the tailpipe will clear up dramatically

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.900 
the tailpipe will clear up dramatically
it<00:04:54.110> probably<00:04:55.099> will<00:04:55.250> be<00:04:55.340> completely<00:04:55.669> gone

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
it probably will be completely gone

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.029 
it probably will be completely gone
within<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.360> first<00:04:56.570> hour<00:04:56.810> you<00:04:57.800> can<00:04:57.889> see<00:04:58.009> a

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
within the first hour you can see a

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:59.950 
within the first hour you can see a
little<00:04:58.220> bit<00:04:58.370> of<00:04:58.430> steam<00:04:59.300> coming<00:04:59.660> out<00:04:59.720> of<00:04:59.780> there

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
little bit of steam coming out of there

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.300 
little bit of steam coming out of there
also

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.310

but I will I will update this video or
post<00:05:10.130> another<00:05:10.400> video<00:05:10.780> I'll<00:05:11.780> figure<00:05:11.930> that<00:05:12.020> out

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
post another video I'll figure that out

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.840 
post another video I'll figure that out
later<00:05:12.820> with<00:05:13.820> some<00:05:14.770> some<00:05:15.770> results<00:05:16.220> on<00:05:16.400> whether

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
later with some some results on whether

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.570 
later with some some results on whether
this<00:05:17.060> worked<00:05:17.690> or<00:05:17.810> not<00:05:17.900> for<00:05:18.020> this<00:05:18.170> Ford<00:05:18.380> Focus
