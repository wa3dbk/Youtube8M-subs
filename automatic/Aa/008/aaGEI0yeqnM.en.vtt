00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
there you're going to end up dying so

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.000 
there you're going to end up dying so
destruction<00:03:22.150> actually<00:03:22.480> stays<00:03:22.720> alive<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:23.709> lot

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
destruction actually stays alive a lot

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.390 
destruction actually stays alive a lot
longer<00:03:24.069> and<00:03:24.549> they're<00:03:25.590> better<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:26.889> way<00:03:27.069> but

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
longer and they're better that way but

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.080 
longer and they're better that way but
if<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:29.230> can't<00:03:29.560> get<00:03:29.769> something<00:03:30.160> lined<00:03:30.609> up<00:03:30.819> with

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
if you can't get something lined up with

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.379 
if you can't get something lined up with
with<00:03:32.019> destruction<00:03:32.549> you<00:03:33.549> know<00:03:33.669> if<00:03:34.180> you're

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
with destruction you know if you're

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.119 
with destruction you know if you're
getting<00:03:34.540> hit<00:03:34.810> by<00:03:34.840> chaos<00:03:35.319> bolt<00:03:35.560> it's<00:03:35.829> going<00:03:36.069> to

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
getting hit by chaos bolt it's going to

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.280 
getting hit by chaos bolt it's going to
do<00:03:36.220> a<00:03:36.250> lot<00:03:36.519> of<00:03:36.549> damage<00:03:36.819> but<00:03:37.569> as<00:03:37.720> affliction

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
do a lot of damage but as affliction

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.440 
do a lot of damage but as affliction
there's<00:03:38.530> a<00:03:38.590> lot<00:03:38.980> of<00:03:39.010> insta<00:03:39.519> castings<00:03:40.299> and

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
there's a lot of insta castings and

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.390 
there's a lot of insta castings and
those<00:03:40.690> dots<00:03:40.989> start<00:03:41.290> adding<00:03:41.470> up<00:03:41.680> really<00:03:42.069> fast

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
those dots start adding up really fast

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.819 
those dots start adding up really fast
so<00:03:42.819> it's<00:03:43.480> kind<00:03:43.780> of<00:03:43.870> it's<00:03:44.349> kind<00:03:44.590> of<00:03:44.680> an

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
so it's kind of it's kind of an

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.750 
so it's kind of it's kind of an
interesting<00:03:45.010> subject<00:03:45.730> their<00:03:46.410> sum<00:03:47.410> over<00:03:48.400> all<00:03:48.430> I

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
interesting subject their sum over all I

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.860 
interesting subject their sum over all I
have<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.480> say<00:03:50.069> affliction<00:03:51.069> is<00:03:51.250> better<00:03:51.870> than

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
have to say affliction is better than

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.189 
have to say affliction is better than
destruction<00:03:54.209> sixty<00:03:55.209> percent<00:03:55.389> to<00:03:55.840> forty

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
destruction sixty percent to forty

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:00.059 
destruction sixty percent to forty
percent<00:03:56.590> so<00:03:57.400> if<00:03:57.549> you're<00:03:57.730> 180<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.269> do<00:03:58.449> PvE<00:03:59.069> I'd

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
percent so if you're 180 to do PvE I'd

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.710 
percent so if you're 180 to do PvE I'd
say<00:04:00.489> overall<00:04:00.790> a<00:04:01.599> great<00:04:02.019> class<00:04:02.379> overall<00:04:02.829> is

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
say overall a great class overall is

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.710 
say overall a great class overall is
destruction<00:04:04.720> if<00:04:05.169> you're<00:04:05.349> wanting<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.650> do<00:04:05.889> pvp

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
destruction if you're wanting to do pvp

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.210 
destruction if you're wanting to do pvp
overall<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.989> affliction<00:04:08.560> warlock<00:04:08.739> is

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
overall the affliction warlock is

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.539 
overall the affliction warlock is
probably<00:04:09.760> a<00:04:09.879> little<00:04:10.060> bit<00:04:10.269> better<00:04:10.419> from<00:04:10.810> that

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
probably a little bit better from that

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.309 
probably a little bit better from that
remember<00:04:12.549> though<00:04:12.699> it<00:04:12.940> depends<00:04:13.900> on<00:04:14.049> the<00:04:14.139> type
