00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:02.740
 at the 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.740
 was 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.290
 Hello, I welcome you 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.459
 because Sacred home improvement TV 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.669
 in the next few minutes I'll show you how it's done with Brad Pitt 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.989
 Franconia 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:29.649
 this video is about laying embarrassed and shifted one's way 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.910
 Finally, here, for example, often occurs in times of crisis 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.300
 they see in five steps how the underground is judged first and then 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.490
 is prepared 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.900
 then applied the tile adhesive and sealed the joints 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.700
 become 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.700
 The first step is about the underground 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.270
 You can see four simple tests 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.670
 whether the substrate is suitable 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.920
 first test 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.110
 the knocking of the old underground with a small hammer 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.519
 at higher Bornholdt places or a fall off loose parts 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.020
 The substrate must first be repaired at these places 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.119
 second test 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.020
 For example, the strength of the substrate can be achieved with a carpet knife 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.470
 being checked 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.280
 if the ground crumbles and breaks when scored 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.260
 none will not be closed 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.710
 as the third canister Haug behavior of the subsoil with a water bottle 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.260
 be checked 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.399
 when the water penetrates the underground more quickly 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.090
 a primer must be applied 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.640
 but if it is from receipt 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.620
 a primer must be applied 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.880
 Filter test of the ground must not chalk because otherwise the following 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.210
 Tile adhesive has no liability 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.700
 Just swipe your hand over the wall 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.170
 did you have to see Kanner on her finger to clean and clean the surface 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.310
 then be primed 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.889
 All in all, the substrate must be firmly dry and stable 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.670
 Loose parts soiling dust or old coatings 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.450
 must be removed 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.869
 In addition, the substrate must have the necessary slip maturity 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.719
 this is the time 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:16.369
 as of when a good reason for example in the form of a new plastered with a 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:19.049
 new tile flooring may be laid 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.939
 we can start now 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:24.389
 The next step is to apply the primer 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:27.899
 this war is recommended universal primer 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:33.429
 The primer is fully applied with a roller or brush 

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:36.539
 link to this only clean work shows 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:38.959
 when applying is to pay attention 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.689
 that only so much material is applied 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.559
 how the underground absorbs 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:47.499
 It is important that the primer shown here schematically 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.939
 into the underground 1-victory 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.650
 and does not stop as a learned layer 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.549
 Adding education is also to be avoided 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.279
 then the substrate must dry sufficiently at least one 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:01.419
 Day 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:02.730
 as a next step 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.479
 the ground is balanced the wait until i keep Ben are present 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:10.739
 For this purpose, the Secret Talents way scraper is used 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.870
 and applied with a spatula or eaves height remains us 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.870
 warped 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:27.029
 in the fourth step, the wall tiles are laid 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:31.269
 For this purpose, the tile adhesive Sacred v + v is suitable 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.209
 or the Sacred Dispersion Glue 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.369
 after the required amount has been mixed according to packaging information 

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:41.949
 is the tile adhesive with a corresponding numbers eaves height 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:47.009
 Evenly applied and open space I will fight on this 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:51.799
 kept slightly oblique is important that no bubbles form 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.859
 use only so much glue 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.099
 how to lay tiles within about 20 minutes 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.889
 This will easily push the movements into the fresh glue world 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:07.199
 pressed in and aligned briefly to ensure that all distances 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:11.940
 their tiles are evenly used they necessarily have joints crossed 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.080
 These should be available in different sizes in the hardware store 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.189
 Tile adhesive out of the joints Remove it carefully 

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:24.789
 lay tiles and plates in our per pupil 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.199
 Drink a detailed description 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.710
 where and with what tiles they start the best and in which direction they are 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.009
 embarrass them 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:34.840
 then we come to the 5 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.580
 then and last step 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.909
 the closing of all sparks 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:44.499
 the advantage of Sacred v + Faro is that this universal market is not just for 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:47.729
 stick but can also be used to spark 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:52.229
 So we do not have to wait until the tile adhesive has dried 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.600
 but can survive the use of the material for grouting 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.040
 So you need to stick together and have only one material left 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.460
 the grout sets with a suitable folk already diagonal to 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.690
 Surface flooded in the joints 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.490
 After that should be about standing material on the nasty immediately with the airfield 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.500
 The whole thing will be removed so often until all joints are closed 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.830
 after the grout has been applied, the tiles or 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.010
 Plates with a clean sponge Britta washed off the slender device 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.830
 should be cleaned in between times with clean water smaller 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:32.800
 Tip her 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.210
 do not use too moist or too much water otherwise they will leave the joints 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.600
 Merkel out again 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.600
 Finally, the tiles or plates are once more with a switch 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.960
 and clean Max damp sponge washed after 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.210
 they are also the tile mirror executed before installing the kitchen 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.750
 will or subsequently 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.040
 for example, in the context of renovation 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.820
 Then the connection joints in the transition from the worktop to the wall 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.720
 locked 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.979
 Staff is suitable for this purpose 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.449
 Sealed silicone tightly before marriage 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:09.169
 This is climbed for example with a bird leaves from the hardware store 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.500
 in practice this is envy also a rubber glove coated and 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:14.509
 moistened 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:17.189
 and then subtracted the gap 

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:20.979
 please note that the animated ones shown here are 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:22.280
 processing steps 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.349
 and the layer structure is a schematic representation 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:27.840
 before processing 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.960
 Be sure to read the technical data sheets and notes on the 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.960
 Pay attention to packaging 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.860
 the couple 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.139
 The assorted range is available in every well-stocked hardware store 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.320
 Further helpful information on this topic can be found in the 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.250
 Brochure Tiles and plates are also laid on our homepage 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:52.930
 Point home improvement point there crowds points marriage 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.930
 I wish him every success in their projects 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:00.919
 but 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.710
 Pomeranian 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.449
 Bohemian
