00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.770

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.500
 with minced meat takes cheese also and 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.210
 onion we have adapted it to 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.449
 our dukan diet so from 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.250
 potatoes we will use pumpkin of course 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.180
 that this is for if you are already in the stage 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.060
 cruise and the days that 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.530
 what do you eat proteins and vegetables and I 'm going 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.360
 to say then what are the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.560
 ingredients that we need here 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.440
 We have 400 grams of minced meat 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.970
 and sautÃ©ed with two onions could be 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.450
 explain how to do it 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:04.140
 and 600 grams of boiled pumpkin and 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:08.400
 tread and we will also use the cheese 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.850
 with grated low-fat cheese 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.800
 for minced meat hash for 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.470
 not having to use oil what I do 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.930
 is first put in the pan the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.930
 minced meat and then start to start 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.590
 your own juices and in that juice together 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.790
 with the minced meat you put the onion 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.830
 very finite 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.620
 and then you're frying it and not 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.170
 you need to use oil the salt you want 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.020
 and I have also put him as 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.000
 only seasoning the pumpkin good for 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.890
 Of course you put them in water 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.170
 boil with a little bit of going out 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.020
 We have dark and this cheese I have used 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.690
 cheeses before the cheese sabanitas before 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.310
 that you put them in the freezer for a while 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.770
 to tell them that you can download them 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.469
 then I had developers 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.140
 we are going to put together the cake of 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:00.119
 Pumpkin so you can see how it's done 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.570
 it's very easy we just put the 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.570
 mince 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.060
 so 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.680
 then now let's put the cheese 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.680
 this is another recipe as I said it is very 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.920
 good and really 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.659
 you'll see that almost everyone likes 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.700
 family members when they are not 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:32.810
 doing a diet 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.200
 and then then we cover with the 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.200
 the puree 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.659
 ah 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.659
 for you 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.200
 this we take a little while to the oven more 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:50.239
 that nothing for what 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.950
 is that that is golden is a little bit to the 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.660
 top of the mash because everything 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.319
 others is cooked and so that the 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.319
 quesito be 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.760
 what I do is with a 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.380
 with a fork 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.380
 then do something like that to make it 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.200
 as if it were an ornament 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.670
 well then now we bring you some 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.900
 five minutes to the oven so that it is 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.900
 little gold and we're back 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.319

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.560
