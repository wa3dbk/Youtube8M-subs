00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
what was the difference I think between

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.899

the<00:01:18.210> team<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.860> 2010<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.340> year<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.759> I

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
the team in 2010 and this year and I

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.210 
the team in 2010 and this year and I
think<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.360> year<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.750> everyone<00:01:22.740> understood

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
think this year is everyone understood

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.340 
think this year is everyone understood
the<00:01:23.430> concept<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.270> buying<00:01:24.509> into<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.869> team<00:01:25.080> game

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
the concept of buying into the team game

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.710 
the concept of buying into the team game
and<00:01:25.380> doing<00:01:26.070> whatever<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.670> took<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.150> win<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.659> I

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
and doing whatever it took to win and I

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.030 
and doing whatever it took to win and I
think<00:01:27.750> that's<00:01:28.140> why<00:01:28.290> we<00:01:28.409> had<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> great

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
think that's why we had a great

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.969 
think that's why we had a great
regular-season<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.110> that's<00:01:31.110> why<00:01:31.259> we<00:01:31.409> had<00:01:31.590> all

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
regular-season and that's why we had all

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.740 
regular-season and that's why we had all
that<00:01:32.250> success<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.939> playoff<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.509> we<00:01:33.630> had

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
that success in the playoff so we had

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.740 
that success in the playoff so we had
some<00:01:33.960> tough<00:01:34.470> moments<00:01:34.790> being<00:01:35.790> down<00:01:36.000> 3-1<00:01:36.390> to

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
some tough moments being down 3-1 to

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.780 
some tough moments being down 3-1 to
Detroit<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.500> know<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.710> doesn't<00:01:38.040> look<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.340> good
