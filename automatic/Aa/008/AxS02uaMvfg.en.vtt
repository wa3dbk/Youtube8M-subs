opportunity to show people that the
functional<00:00:36.040> movement<00:00:36.400> screen<00:00:36.430> isn't<00:00:36.850> as

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
functional movement screen isn't as

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.210 
functional movement screen isn't as
complicated<00:00:37.210> as<00:00:37.750> they<00:00:37.870> might<00:00:38.080> think<00:00:38.320> a<00:00:38.650> lot<00:00:39.130> of

complicated as they might think a lot of

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.470 
complicated as they might think a lot of
people<00:00:39.460> take<00:00:39.640> a<00:00:39.670> functional<00:00:40.150> movement<00:00:40.450> screen

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
people take a functional movement screen

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.020 
people take a functional movement screen
workshop<00:00:41.200> and<00:00:41.500> and<00:00:42.220> they<00:00:42.400> learn<00:00:42.640> how<00:00:42.790> to<00:00:42.850> do

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
workshop and and they learn how to do

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.430 
workshop and and they learn how to do
the<00:00:43.150> screen<00:00:43.480> but<00:00:43.810> then<00:00:43.930> when<00:00:44.080> they<00:00:44.170> get<00:00:44.320> the

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.960 
screen on the scoresheet you literally
have<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.450> power<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:14.320> program<00:01:14.800> somebody<00:01:15.280> based

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
have the power to program somebody based

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.000 
have the power to program somebody based
on<00:01:16.210> their<00:01:16.390> movement<00:01:16.840> profile<00:01:17.260> this<00:01:17.740> is<00:01:17.860> going

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
on their movement profile this is going

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.830 
on their movement profile this is going
to<00:01:18.070> be<00:01:18.159> exciting<00:01:18.729> it's<00:01:19.000> unrehearsed<00:01:19.420> and

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
you're gonna get to see how we interact

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.630 
you're gonna get to see how we interact
with<00:01:28.510> multiple<00:01:29.290> age<00:01:29.440> groups<00:01:29.470> multiple<00:01:30.130> sports

with multiple age groups multiple sports
body<00:01:31.090> types<00:01:31.420> everything<00:01:31.960> because<00:01:32.590> the

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
body types everything because the

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.100 
body types everything because the
movement<00:01:33.130> screen<00:01:33.369> is<00:01:33.610> not<00:01:34.090> sports<00:01:34.539> specific

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
movement screen is not sports specific

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.469 
movement screen is not sports specific
or<00:01:35.229> activity<00:01:35.680> specific<00:01:36.219> it's<00:01:36.880> species

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
or activity specific it's species

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:38.730 
or activity specific it's species
specific<00:01:37.689> and<00:01:38.170> that's<00:01:38.289> what<00:01:38.439> we're<00:01:38.590> working

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
specific and that's what we're working

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.980 
specific and that's what we're working
with<00:01:38.920> we're<00:01:39.280> all<00:01:39.430> humans<00:01:39.880> we<00:01:40.270> all<00:01:40.450> got<00:01:40.630> to<00:01:40.780> move

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
with we're all humans we all got to move

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.020 
with we're all humans we all got to move
we<00:01:41.500> just<00:01:41.530> got<00:01:41.829> to<00:01:41.979> profile<00:01:42.430> our<00:01:42.460> movement

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
we just got to profile our movement

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.510 
we just got to profile our movement
patterns<00:01:43.390> if<00:01:43.539> we're<00:01:44.020> going<00:01:44.170> to<00:01:44.259> make

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
patterns if we're going to make

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.219 
patterns if we're going to make
conditioning<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:45.640> exercise<00:01:46.030> programs<00:01:46.509> so<00:01:47.200> I

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
conditioning and exercise programs so I

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.569 
conditioning and exercise programs so I
hope<00:01:47.409> you<00:01:47.560> enjoy<00:01:47.829> this<00:01:50.009> back<00:01:51.009> to<00:01:51.159> the<00:01:51.250> movement

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
hope you enjoy this back to the movement

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.120 
hope you enjoy this back to the movement
screen<00:01:51.789> I<00:01:52.469> want<00:01:53.469> you<00:01:53.619> to<00:01:53.710> see<00:01:53.829> the<00:01:53.950> low-hanging

shouldn't do that or do that I'm sure
you<00:02:15.690> can<00:02:15.870> find<00:02:16.080> someone<00:02:16.590> but<00:02:16.830> in<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.400> majority

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
you can find someone but in a majority

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.510 
you can find someone but in a majority
can<00:02:18.390> 90%<00:02:19.020> of<00:02:19.080> your<00:02:19.230> clientele<00:02:19.710> lay<00:02:20.130> on<00:02:20.340> their

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
back and lift a leg can they do this and

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.490 
back and lift a leg can they do this and
if<00:02:26.220> so<00:02:26.580> we<00:02:27.480> need<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.720> do<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:27.990> you<00:02:28.200> know<00:02:28.320> why

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
if so we need to do that you know why

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.260 
if so we need to do that you know why
because<00:02:29.220> that's<00:02:29.370> more<00:02:29.700> than<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:29.850> hamstring
