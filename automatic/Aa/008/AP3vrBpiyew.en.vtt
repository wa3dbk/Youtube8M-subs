is next to the tank with the oil in now
you've<00:00:37.680> got<00:00:37.829> your<00:00:37.860> refinery<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.520> middle

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
you've got your refinery in the middle

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.600 
you've got your refinery in the middle
this<00:00:39.239> needs<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.719> be<00:00:39.809> powered<00:00:40.370> ideally<00:00:41.370> by

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
this needs to be powered ideally by

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.200 
this needs to be powered ideally by
something<00:00:42.030> best<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.750> redstone<00:00:43.079> ng<00:00:43.620> but<00:00:44.210> you

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
something best and redstone ng but you

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.000 
something best and redstone ng but you
know<00:00:45.329> that's<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:45.660> that's<00:00:46.500> up<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.950> guys

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010

know that's just that's up to you guys
it<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:48.239> rather<00:00:48.629> slow<00:00:48.989> if<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.260> don't<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.969> I

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
it just rather slow if you don't and I

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.610 
it just rather slow if you don't and I
know<00:00:51.120> people<00:00:51.420> argue<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.260> should<00:00:52.440> come

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
know people argue that it should come

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.700 
know people argue that it should come
out<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.890> floods<00:00:53.390> though<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.930> fairness<00:00:54.989> it

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
out the floods though in fairness it

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.220 
out the floods though in fairness it
doesn't<00:00:56.070> actually<00:00:56.309> matter<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.780> can<00:00:57.930> pump<00:00:58.140> it

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
doesn't actually matter you can pump it

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.130 
doesn't actually matter you can pump it
out<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.469> side<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.270> it<00:01:00.270> makes<00:01:00.510> no<00:01:01.109> difference

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
out the side and it makes no difference

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.660 
out the side and it makes no difference
whatsoever<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:03.979> finish<00:01:04.979> product<00:01:05.339> came<00:01:05.549> out

here each wooden pipe weather regular or
waterproof<00:01:10.140> does<00:01:11.100> need<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.430> be<00:01:11.960> powered<00:01:12.960> and

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
waterproof does need to be powered and

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.670 
waterproof does need to be powered and
the<00:01:14.310> thick<00:01:14.520> end<00:01:14.549> should<00:01:14.909> always<00:01:15.450> be<00:01:15.900> next<00:01:16.500> to

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
the thick end should always be next to

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.749 
the thick end should always be next to
the<00:01:16.860> actually<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> pumping<00:01:17.670> out<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:18.710> so<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:20.400> this

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the actually a pumping out of so in this

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.590 
the actually a pumping out of so in this
case<00:01:21.110> refinery<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.790> in<00:01:23.790> my<00:01:24.090> hand<00:01:24.360> at<00:01:24.540> the

moment is the wrench that you will need
and<00:01:27.000> also<00:01:27.119> change<00:01:27.479> direction<00:01:27.869> or<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.080> pipe<00:01:28.350> so

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
and also change direction or a pipe so

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.520 
and also change direction or a pipe so
that<00:01:30.140> as<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.259> see

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
to wear to have one of those also change

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.080 
to wear to have one of those also change
directions<00:01:54.350> of<00:01:54.590> your<00:01:54.710> pipes<00:01:54.950> now<00:01:55.729> obviously

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
directions of your pipes now obviously

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.700 
directions of your pipes now obviously
i'm<00:01:56.450> not<00:01:56.479> using<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.899> same<00:01:57.049> texture<00:01:57.440> pack<00:01:57.560> as

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
i'm not using the same texture pack as

i'm not using the same texture pack as
user<00:01:57.890> hopefully<00:01:58.460> let's<00:01:59.180> see<00:01:59.540> and<00:01:59.659> understand

moment<00:02:03.979> you<00:02:04.759> can<00:02:04.909> tell<00:02:05.119> how<00:02:05.690> slowly<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.700> final

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
moment you can tell how slowly the final

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.790 
moment you can tell how slowly the final
needs<00:02:07.850> going<00:02:08.239> it's<00:02:08.840> currently<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.320> powered<00:02:09.619> by

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
needs going it's currently a powered by

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.320 
needs going it's currently a powered by
three<00:02:10.459> redstone<00:02:11.060> engines<00:02:11.830> now<00:02:13.150> yeah<00:02:16.239> as<00:02:17.239> you

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
three redstone engines now yeah as you

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.440 
three redstone engines now yeah as you
can<00:02:17.450> see<00:02:17.690> that's<00:02:18.260> how<00:02:18.350> it's<00:02:18.560> supposed<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.950> be

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
can see that's how it's supposed to be

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.900 
can see that's how it's supposed to be
just<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:20.569> I'd<00:02:20.690> get<00:02:20.900> this<00:02:21.050> in<00:02:21.230> there<00:02:21.440> before<00:02:21.910> get

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
just so I'd get this in there before get

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.550 
just so I'd get this in there before get
an<00:02:23.000> odd<00:02:23.150> gone<00:02:23.420> people<00:02:23.720> getting<00:02:23.870> angry<00:02:24.290> at<00:02:24.380> you
