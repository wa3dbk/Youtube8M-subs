00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.939 

one<00:00:00.989> of<00:00:01.079> the<00:00:01.170> difficulties<00:00:01.740> of<00:00:01.770> playing

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
one of the difficulties of playing

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.730 
one of the difficulties of playing
without<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.520> shoulder<00:00:02.939> rest<00:00:03.179> is<00:00:03.500> shifting<00:00:04.500> and

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
without a shoulder rest is shifting and

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.780 
without a shoulder rest is shifting and
I<00:00:05.549> wanted<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.819> talk<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.060> little<00:00:06.359> bit<00:00:06.569> about<00:00:06.600> that

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:07.790 
I wanted to talk a little bit about that

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.280 
I wanted to talk a little bit about that
probably<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.910> biggest<00:00:09.120> problem<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.780> shifting

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
probably the biggest problem is shifting

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.940 
probably the biggest problem is shifting
down<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:12.240> reason<00:00:12.570> for<00:00:12.750> that<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:13.230> that<00:00:13.469> as

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
down and the reason for that is that as

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.599 
down and the reason for that is that as
your<00:00:14.219> hand<00:00:14.519> as<00:00:15.150> your<00:00:15.389> hand<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.900> shifting<00:00:16.350> down

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
your hand as your hand is shifting down

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.710 
your hand as your hand is shifting down
well<00:00:17.609> you've<00:00:17.789> got<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.090> friction<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.690> the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
well you've got the friction of the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.050 
well you've got the friction of the
instruments<00:00:19.350> on<00:00:19.650> your<00:00:19.920> hand<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.490> that's

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
instruments on your hand and that's

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.109 
instruments on your hand and that's
tending<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.689> pull<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.170> instrument<00:00:22.680> away<00:00:23.220> from

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
tending to pull the instrument away from

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.880 
tending to pull the instrument away from
your<00:00:24.330> body<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.990> need<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.320> put<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> little

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
your body so you need to put a little

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.460 
your body so you need to put a little
bit<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.369> pressure<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.750> chin<00:00:27.990> rest<00:00:28.230> with

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
bit of pressure on the chin rest with

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.380 
bit of pressure on the chin rest with
this<00:00:28.590> cat<00:00:28.859> pad<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.279> helps<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.609> lot<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.820> need<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.150> lot

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
this cat pad it helps a lot I need a lot

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.670 
this cat pad it helps a lot I need a lot
less<00:00:30.689> pressure<00:00:31.369> and<00:00:32.369> then<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.000> just<00:00:33.530> on<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
less pressure and then so just on the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.190 
less pressure and then so just on the
downshift<00:00:35.270> particularly<00:00:36.270> between<00:00:36.660> say<00:00:36.930> third

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
downshift particularly between say third

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.709 
downshift particularly between say third
position<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.860> first<00:00:38.070> position<00:00:38.280> your<00:00:39.270> you

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
position and first position your you

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.270 
position and first position your you
need<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.020> put<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> little<00:00:40.379> bit<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.710> pressure<00:00:40.950> if

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
need to put a little bit of pressure if

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.069 
need to put a little bit of pressure if
you<00:00:41.340> go<00:00:41.700> up<00:00:41.790> into<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.120> really<00:00:42.329> high<00:00:42.510> positions

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
you go up into the really high positions

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.720 
you go up into the really high positions
that<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.800> actually<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> little<00:00:44.579> bit<00:00:44.700> of

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
that you actually have a little bit of

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.260 
that you actually have a little bit of
contact<00:00:45.329> here<00:00:45.780> between<00:00:46.020> your<00:00:46.379> palm<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.270> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
contact here between your palm and the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.139 
contact here between your palm and the
body<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.870> instrument<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.670> that

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
body of the instrument here so that

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.330 
body of the instrument here so that
allows<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.780> sort<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.800> keep<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
allows you to sort of keep the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.819 
allows you to sort of keep the
instrument<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.030> place<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.629> do<00:00:55.020> your<00:00:55.170> shift<00:00:55.410> so

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
instrument in place and do your shift so

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.430 
instrument in place and do your shift so
the<00:00:56.309> problem<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.000> really<00:00:57.239> going<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.079> say<00:00:58.230> from

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
the problem is really going to say from

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.939 
the problem is really going to say from
third<00:00:58.710> position<00:00:59.989> third<00:01:00.989> position<00:01:01.020> down<00:01:01.649> to

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
third position third position down to

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.510 
third position third position down to
first<00:01:02.280> position

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.969 

so<00:01:07.509> when<00:01:07.689> I<00:01:07.780> shift<00:01:08.020> it<00:01:08.170> down<00:01:08.200> you<00:01:08.710> may<00:01:08.860> have

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
so when I shift it down you may have

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.429 
so when I shift it down you may have
noticed<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.729> thumb<00:01:10.000> kind<00:01:10.270> of<00:01:10.479> does<00:01:11.170> a<00:01:11.200> little

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
noticed the thumb kind of does a little

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.160 
noticed the thumb kind of does a little
release<00:01:11.860> because<00:01:12.850> otherwise<00:01:13.540> you<00:01:13.899> kind<00:01:14.110> of

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
release because otherwise you kind of

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.840 
release because otherwise you kind of
have<00:01:14.259> all<00:01:14.290> this<00:01:14.530> friction<00:01:15.159> in<00:01:15.340> between<00:01:15.670> you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
have all this friction in between you

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.490 
have all this friction in between you
kind<00:01:16.030> of<00:01:16.060> have<00:01:16.210> to<00:01:16.360> sort<00:01:16.630> of<00:01:16.659> release<00:01:17.470> the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
kind of have to sort of release the

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.070 
kind of have to sort of release the
thumb<00:01:17.860> a<00:01:17.920> little<00:01:18.280> bit<00:01:18.539> some<00:01:19.539> people<00:01:19.780> say<00:01:19.930> the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
thumb a little bit some people say the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.940 
thumb a little bit some people say the
thumb<00:01:20.289> should<00:01:20.320> go<00:01:20.590> first<00:01:21.539> and<00:01:22.539> I<00:01:23.380> think<00:01:23.590> that

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
thumb should go first and I think that

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.830 
thumb should go first and I think that
that<00:01:24.130> for<00:01:24.520> me<00:01:24.700> that<00:01:25.000> more<00:01:25.210> or<00:01:25.270> less<00:01:25.299> happened

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
that for me that more or less happened

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.359 
that for me that more or less happened
just<00:01:26.020> naturally<00:01:26.590> I<00:01:26.619> didn't<00:01:26.920> really<00:01:27.100> have<00:01:27.189> to

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
just naturally I didn't really have to

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.999 
just naturally I didn't really have to
think<00:01:27.399> about<00:01:27.759> it<00:01:28.060> my<00:01:29.020> body<00:01:29.259> just<00:01:29.380> naturally

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
think about it my body just naturally

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.710 
think about it my body just naturally
did<00:01:30.189> what<00:01:30.369> it<00:01:30.460> needed<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.820> to<00:01:31.240> make<00:01:31.390> this

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
did what it needed to to make this

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.399 
did what it needed to to make this
happen<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:37.090> that's<00:01:37.240> one<00:01:37.539> that's<00:01:37.840> one<00:01:38.110> problem

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
happen so that's one that's one problem

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.289 
happen so that's one that's one problem
with<00:01:38.709> shifting<00:01:39.310> now<00:01:39.429> the<00:01:39.490> other<00:01:39.729> problem<00:01:40.209> I

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
with shifting now the other problem I

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.570 
with shifting now the other problem I
had<00:01:40.509> with<00:01:40.810> shifting<00:01:41.350> which<00:01:42.039> is<00:01:42.190> something<00:01:42.369> I

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
had with shifting which is something I

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.399 
had with shifting which is something I
actually<00:01:42.789> had<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.209> put<00:01:43.630> some<00:01:43.959> conscious

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
actually had to put some conscious

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.820 
actually had to put some conscious
effort<00:01:44.709> into<00:01:45.009> too<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:46.149> correct<00:01:46.539> with<00:01:47.350> shifting

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
effort into too to correct with shifting

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.440 
effort into too to correct with shifting
into<00:01:48.039> high<00:01:48.069> positions<00:01:48.759> and<00:01:48.909> in<00:01:49.060> particular

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
into high positions and in particular

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.169 
into high positions and in particular
shifting<00:01:50.170> say<00:01:50.409> from<00:01:50.770> third<00:01:51.520> position<00:01:51.729> to

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
shifting say from third position to

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:54.600 
shifting say from third position to
fifth<00:01:52.450> position<00:01:52.600> so<00:01:53.170> like<00:01:53.770> on<00:01:53.950> a<00:01:53.979> let's<00:01:54.459> say<00:01:54.580> a

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
fifth position so like on a let's say a

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.389 
fifth position so like on a let's say a
three<00:01:54.909> octave<00:01:55.060> D<00:01:55.390> major<00:01:55.569> scale

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.789 

now<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.850> may<00:02:03.000> have<00:02:03.030> noticed<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.689> when<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.439> did

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
now you may have noticed that when I did

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.559 
now you may have noticed that when I did
this<00:02:05.009> shift<00:02:05.399> here<00:02:06.119> from<00:02:06.509> third<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.810> fifth<00:02:08.569> when

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
this shift here from third to fifth when

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.619 
this shift here from third to fifth when
I<00:02:09.599> made<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.989> string<00:02:10.800> change<00:02:11.160> even<00:02:12.090> before<00:02:12.599> I

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
I made the string change even before I

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.930 
I made the string change even before I
shifted<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.470> had<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.980> bring<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.340> thumb

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
shifted I had to bring the thumb

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.880 
shifted I had to bring the thumb
bring<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.269> thumb<00:02:15.300> around<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.440> under<00:02:16.769> the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
bring the thumb around and under the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.540 
bring the thumb around and under the
instrument

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.360 

so<00:02:21.450> my<00:02:21.660> thumb<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.080> ready<00:02:22.350> now<00:02:22.590> if<00:02:22.710> I<00:02:22.800> did<00:02:23.010> if<00:02:23.220> I

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
so my thumb is ready now if I did if I

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.670 
so my thumb is ready now if I did if I
didn't<00:02:23.670> if<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:23.940> don't<00:02:24.120> make<00:02:24.330> this<00:02:24.510> motion<00:02:25.050> here

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
didn't if I don't make this motion here

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.220 
didn't if I don't make this motion here
bring<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.310> thumb<00:02:26.340> under<00:02:26.940> what<00:02:27.540> happens<00:02:27.990> is

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
bring the thumb under what happens is

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.390 
bring the thumb under what happens is
this<00:02:29.040> joint<00:02:29.550> on<00:02:29.760> my<00:02:29.970> thumb<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:31.590> joint<00:02:32.010> gets

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
this joint on my thumb that joint gets

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.650 
this joint on my thumb that joint gets
stuck<00:02:32.940> on<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.840> button<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.730> violin<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:36.510> let

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
stuck on the button of the violin so let

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.820 
stuck on the button of the violin so let
me<00:02:36.720> show<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:36.870> what<00:02:37.080> happens<00:02:37.380> if<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.590> don't

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
me show you what happens if I don't

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.290 
me show you what happens if I don't
bring<00:02:38.010> my<00:02:38.160> thumb<00:02:38.400> around<00:02:38.430> this<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.210> the

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
bring my thumb around this is the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.090 
bring my thumb around this is the
problem<00:02:39.570> that<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.840> was<00:02:39.990> having<00:02:42.500> now<00:02:43.500> my<00:02:43.800> thumb

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
problem that I was having now my thumb

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.270 
problem that I was having now my thumb
is<00:02:44.430> stuck<00:02:44.970> on<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.840> button<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.350> if<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:46.890> try<00:02:47.250> to

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
is stuck on the button and if I try to

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.330 
is stuck on the button and if I try to
move<00:02:48.210> it<00:02:48.420> around<00:02:48.510> while<00:02:49.110> I'm<00:02:49.290> shifting<00:02:49.590> then

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
move it around while I'm shifting then

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.070 
move it around while I'm shifting then
the<00:02:50.580> instrument<00:02:50.970> moves<00:02:51.150> around<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.780> you

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
the instrument moves around and you

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.390 
the instrument moves around and you
usually<00:02:52.350> don't<00:02:52.590> get<00:02:52.740> it<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.040> sound<00:02:53.250> that

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
usually don't get it the sound that

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.210 
usually don't get it the sound that
you're<00:02:53.820> shooting<00:02:54.000> for<00:02:54.360> so<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.410> shift<00:02:55.710> going

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
you're shooting for so the shift going

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.820 
you're shooting for so the shift going
up<00:02:56.550> in<00:02:56.790> third<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.060> fifth<00:02:57.360> position<00:02:57.600> this<00:02:58.440> thumb

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
up in third to fifth position this thumb

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.130 
up in third to fifth position this thumb
really<00:02:59.250> has<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.760> come<00:02:59.970> around<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.630> be<00:03:00.690> ready

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
really has to come around and be ready

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.940 
really has to come around and be ready
before<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:02.010> shift<00:03:02.220> happens<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:04.560> right<00:03:04.800> as

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
before the shift happens so right as

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.290 
before the shift happens so right as
soon<00:03:05.130> as<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.310> get<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.670> e<00:03:05.700> string<00:03:06.030> I'm<00:03:06.150> not

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
soon as I get to the e string I'm not

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.700 
soon as I get to the e string I'm not
shifting<00:03:06.720> up<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.050> I'm<00:03:07.110> bringing<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.470> thumb

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
shifting up and I'm bringing the thumb

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:14.080 
shifting up and I'm bringing the thumb
under<00:03:08.810> now<00:03:09.810> I'm<00:03:10.020> ready<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.350> go<00:03:10.470> up

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.700 

so<00:03:15.090> those<00:03:15.300> are<00:03:15.420> pretty<00:03:15.570> much<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.990> two<00:03:16.020> issues

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
so those are pretty much the two issues

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.020 
so those are pretty much the two issues
that<00:03:16.740> I<00:03:16.890> had<00:03:17.390> as<00:03:18.390> far<00:03:18.630> as<00:03:18.780> shifting<00:03:19.760> now<00:03:20.760> some

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
that I had as far as shifting now some

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.810 
that I had as far as shifting now some
people<00:03:21.330> sort<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.870> contend<00:03:22.770> that<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:23.160> sort<00:03:23.730> of

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
people sort of contend that you sort of

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.270 
people sort of contend that you sort of
lift<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.350> violin<00:03:25.350> up<00:03:25.590> when<00:03:25.860> you're<00:03:26.010> shifting

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
lift the violin up when you're shifting

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.820 
lift the violin up when you're shifting
or<00:03:27.000> down<00:03:27.480> when<00:03:27.840> you're<00:03:27.960> shifting<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.560> up<00:03:28.650> and

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
or down when you're shifting and up and

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.940 
or down when you're shifting and up and
down<00:03:31.850> I<00:03:33.200> personally<00:03:34.200> don't<00:03:34.410> really<00:03:34.560> feel<00:03:34.890> like

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
down I personally don't really feel like

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.520 
down I personally don't really feel like
that's<00:03:35.670> um<00:03:36.120> something<00:03:36.750> that<00:03:36.870> works<00:03:37.080> for<00:03:37.200> me<00:03:37.500> I

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
that's um something that works for me I

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.680 
that's um something that works for me I
think<00:03:37.950> particularly<00:03:38.670> if<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.240> have<00:03:39.360> a<00:03:39.390> fast

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
think particularly if you have a fast

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.310 
think particularly if you have a fast
passage<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.440> you're<00:03:40.560> shifting<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:43.140> don't

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
passage and you're shifting you don't

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.080 
passage and you're shifting you don't
really<00:03:43.440> have<00:03:43.650> time<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:43.950> be<00:03:44.190> moving<00:03:45.000> the

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
really have time to be moving the

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.780 
really have time to be moving the
instrument<00:03:45.480> up<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:45.750> down<00:03:45.930> so<00:03:46.460> the<00:03:47.460> way<00:03:47.580> that

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
instrument up and down so the way that

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.220 
instrument up and down so the way that
I've<00:03:47.850> been<00:03:48.030> trying<00:03:48.270> to<00:03:48.450> shift<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:48.870> also<00:03:49.080> the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
I've been trying to shift and also the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.110 
I've been trying to shift and also the
way<00:03:49.320> that<00:03:49.530> I'm<00:03:50.190> getting<00:03:50.550> my<00:03:50.640> teacher<00:03:50.880> is

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
way that I'm getting my teacher is

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.490 
way that I'm getting my teacher is
trying<00:03:51.240> to<00:03:51.420> get<00:03:51.510> me<00:03:51.630> a<00:03:51.660> shift<00:03:51.960> is<00:03:52.170> to<00:03:52.320> really

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
trying to get me a shift is to really

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
trying to get me a shift is to really
keep<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.430> hand<00:03:54.380> as<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.440> unit<00:03:55.950> with<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.370> whole

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
keep the hand as a unit with the whole

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.500 
keep the hand as a unit with the whole
hand<00:03:56.790> as<00:03:56.970> a<00:03:57.000> unit<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:58.640> so<00:03:59.640> if<00:03:59.970> you<00:04:00.090> have<00:04:00.210> a<00:04:00.240> fast

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
hand as a unit and so if you have a fast

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:08.500 
hand as a unit and so if you have a fast
passage<00:04:01.050> like<00:04:02.810> one<00:04:03.810> on<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.200> Box<00:04:04.410> you<00:04:04.530> come

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.229 

you<00:04:09.230> really<00:04:09.500> don't<00:04:09.620> have<00:04:09.830> time<00:04:10.099> to<00:04:10.400> be<00:04:10.580> moving

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
you really don't have time to be moving

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.110 
you really don't have time to be moving
the<00:04:11.480> instrument<00:04:12.080> up<00:04:12.230> and<00:04:12.439> down<00:04:12.620> or<00:04:13.220> doing

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
the instrument up and down or doing

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.819 
the instrument up and down or doing
anything<00:04:14.360> with<00:04:14.689> a<00:04:14.720> wrist<00:04:15.049> you<00:04:15.290> really<00:04:15.530> have<00:04:15.680> to

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
anything with a wrist you really have to
