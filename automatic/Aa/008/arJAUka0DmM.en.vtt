ring<00:00:10.620> properly<00:00:11.750> what<00:00:12.750> we're<00:00:12.929> working<00:00:13.139> with

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
ring properly what we're working with

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.810 
ring properly what we're working with
here<00:00:13.530> today<00:00:14.130> these<00:00:14.639> are<00:00:15.059> 12<00:00:15.599> millimeter<00:00:16.820> open

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
here today these are 12 millimeter open

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.910 
here today these are 12 millimeter open
jump<00:00:18.119> rings<00:00:18.980> in<00:00:19.980> an<00:00:20.100> 18<00:00:20.520> gauge<00:00:21.470> an<00:00:22.470> open<00:00:22.890> jump

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
jump rings in an 18 gauge an open jump

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.429 
jump rings in an 18 gauge an open jump
ring<00:00:23.490> will<00:00:24.359> have<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:25.289> join<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.660> closed<00:00:27.660> jump<00:00:28.109> ring

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
ring will have a join a closed jump ring

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.179 
ring will have a join a closed jump ring
is<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> jump<00:00:29.099> ring<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:30.050> is<00:00:31.050> salted<00:00:31.619> closed<00:00:31.920> so

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
is a jump ring that is salted closed so

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.420 
is a jump ring that is salted closed so
you<00:00:32.250> can't<00:00:32.550> open<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.230> now<00:00:34.230> when<00:00:34.590> opening<00:00:35.100> jump

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
you can't open it now when opening jump

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.760 
you can't open it now when opening jump
rings<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.420> most<00:00:36.630> important<00:00:37.200> thing<00:00:37.469> is

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
rings and the most important thing is

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.430
