00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.830
 relog no matter the evening always the 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.170
 same supports detachment evening and 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.940
 smokers smoke cigarettes etc for 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.410
 this extremely relevant idea of 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.650
 put their cigarette centers in the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.449
 beers me I'm not too careful about 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.100
 my beer on the table so it happens to me 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.680
 perpetually this situation 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.330
 rather pleasant dies while for 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.750
 there are plenty of ashtrays but that's theirs 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.750
 past 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.149
 after there is a guy is laying in front 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.550
 the computer and that changes the music of the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.420
 evening on the internet so he's kidding 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.030
 not with music 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.070
 the choice of songs is something 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.590
 seriously I know it's a matter of 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.960
 family and if you have the nerve to want 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.390
 propose a piece excuse me is this 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.559
 after that I can be a piece to myself 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.989
 no it's dead after this one manages my 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.969
 eyes and after I still have one and after 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.350
 never again in an oasis is a 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.480
 piece that moves well and every day 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:05.159
 they'll be happy or you'll calm down 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:07.770
 I'm already ok internet after the friend a 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.510
 little excited kind that will fight show 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.740
 who dances like a phew and who does too much 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.729
 noise and when you ask him to 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.260
 to make a little less noise because 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.760
 that the neighbors will disembark and 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.240
 this sentence that solves all 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.060
 problems 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.500
 oh that's okay what the guy thinks 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.939
 really that this argument is going to be 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.140
 convincing in time but that you will 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.280
 to do just a little bit less 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.439
