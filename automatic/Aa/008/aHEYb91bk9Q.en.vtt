very<00:02:04.460> well<00:02:04.820> but<00:02:05.450> more<00:02:05.600> importantly<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.350> moon

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
very well but more importantly the moon

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.120 
very well but more importantly the moon
is<00:02:06.680> going<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:06.920> square<00:02:07.189> neptune<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:09.440> i<00:02:09.859> think

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
is going to square neptune and i think

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.430 
is going to square neptune and i think
this<00:02:10.280> is<00:02:10.429> going<00:02:10.579> to<00:02:10.640> really<00:02:11.170> test<00:02:12.170> your

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
this is going to really test your

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.009 
this is going to really test your
ability<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.760> make<00:02:13.940> sure<00:02:14.209> that<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.630> can<00:02:14.870> go

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
with the flow emotionally and that

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.729 
with the flow emotionally and that
you're<00:02:16.760> not<00:02:16.910> over<00:02:17.329> processing<00:02:18.140> but<00:02:18.440> i<00:02:18.500> think

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
you're not over processing but i think

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.979 
you're not over processing but i think
more<00:02:18.890> importantly<00:02:18.980> it's<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.820> listen<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.870> the

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
more importantly it's to listen to the

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.550 
more importantly it's to listen to the
signs<00:02:21.320> and<00:02:21.769> for<00:02:22.310> your<00:02:22.840> feelings<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:24.079> mentally

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
signs and for your feelings to mentally

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.940 
signs and for your feelings to mentally
process<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:26.060> flow<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.200> ability<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.769> let

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
process the flow and the ability to let

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.150 
process the flow and the ability to let
go<00:02:28.250> when<00:02:28.549> the<00:02:28.730> ability<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.359> trust<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.500> spirit

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
go when the ability to trust and spirit

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.580 
go when the ability to trust and spirit
i<00:02:31.430> think<00:02:32.000> that<00:02:32.180> we're<00:02:32.840> really<00:02:33.019> stepping<00:02:33.290> into

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
i think that we're really stepping into

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.129 
i think that we're really stepping into
some<00:02:33.799> powerful<00:02:34.070> waters<00:02:34.669> as<00:02:34.900> Saturn<00:02:35.900> in<00:02:36.049> the

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:36.139 
some powerful waters as Saturn in the

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.730 
some powerful waters as Saturn in the
North<00:02:36.350> node<00:02:36.650> are<00:02:36.829> still<00:02:37.100> conjunct<00:02:37.760> in<00:02:37.930> Scorpio

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
North node are still conjunct in Scorpio

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.290 
North node are still conjunct in Scorpio
and<00:02:39.800> we've<00:02:39.920> got<00:02:40.070> Venus<00:02:40.580> now<00:02:40.760> starting<00:02:41.180> to

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
and we've got Venus now starting to

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.230 
and we've got Venus now starting to
square<00:02:41.690> Mars<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.590> this<00:02:43.490> is<00:02:43.670> really<00:02:43.940> powerful

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
square Mars and this is really powerful

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.810 
square Mars and this is really powerful
creativity<00:02:45.230> energy<00:02:45.890> I<00:02:45.950> mean<00:02:46.130> this<00:02:46.250> is<00:02:46.460> really

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
creativity energy I mean this is really

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.990 
creativity energy I mean this is really
intense<00:02:47.360> but<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.620> keep<00:02:48.890> it<00:02:49.100> maintained<00:02:49.670> can<00:02:49.880> be

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
intense but to keep it maintained can be

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.760 
intense but to keep it maintained can be
maybe<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.300> little<00:02:50.480> difficult<00:02:50.990> it<00:02:51.200> is<00:02:51.530> the

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
maybe a little difficult it is the

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.070 
maybe a little difficult it is the
pressure<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.340> think<00:02:52.670> in<00:02:52.760> our<00:02:52.850> lives<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.900> move

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
pressure I think in our lives to to move

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.140 
pressure I think in our lives to to move
forward<00:02:54.560> in<00:02:54.680> ways<00:02:54.890> and<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.280> step<00:02:55.490> more<00:02:55.820> into

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
forward in ways and to step more into

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.870 
forward in ways and to step more into
our<00:02:56.300> value<00:02:56.720> systems<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.220> test<00:02:58.490> whether<00:02:58.670> or

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
our value systems and to test whether or

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.100 
our value systems and to test whether or
not<00:02:58.940> you're<00:02:59.120> really<00:02:59.150> living<00:02:59.480> in<00:02:59.690> those<00:02:59.810> value

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
not you're really living in those value

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.260 
not you're really living in those value
systems<00:03:00.530> right<00:03:00.740> i<00:03:00.770> mean<00:03:00.920> as<00:03:01.190> Mars<00:03:01.880> squares

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
systems right i mean as Mars squares

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.180 
systems right i mean as Mars squares
Venus<00:03:02.660> it<00:03:02.840> kind<00:03:03.050> of<00:03:03.110> puts<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.740> feminine

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
Venus it kind of puts the feminine

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.680 
Venus it kind of puts the feminine
energy<00:03:04.490> to<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:04.670> test<00:03:05.030> with<00:03:05.240> some<00:03:05.390> masculine

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
energy to a test with some masculine

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.360 
energy to a test with some masculine
energy<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.290> then<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.470> feminine<00:03:06.860> energy<00:03:07.190> puts

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
energy and then the feminine energy puts

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.810 
energy and then the feminine energy puts
the<00:03:07.490> masculine<00:03:07.940> energy<00:03:08.360> to<00:03:08.510> a<00:03:08.540> test<00:03:09.580> and<00:03:10.580> it's

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
the masculine energy to a test and it's

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.100 
the masculine energy to a test and it's
both<00:03:11.060> these<00:03:11.240> sides<00:03:11.570> that<00:03:11.780> we<00:03:11.840> have<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:11.990> learn

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
both these sides that we have to learn

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.170 
both these sides that we have to learn
to<00:03:12.170> work<00:03:12.410> out<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:12.980> that<00:03:13.010> can<00:03:13.520> bring<00:03:13.730> for<00:03:13.760> some

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
to work out and that can bring for some

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.740 
to work out and that can bring for some
really<00:03:15.110> hot<00:03:15.380> passionate<00:03:16.040> sex<00:03:16.100> or<00:03:16.880> connection

really hot passionate sex or connection
or<00:03:17.930> hook<00:03:18.140> up<00:03:18.320> but<00:03:19.160> sometimes<00:03:19.280> maybe<00:03:19.760> the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
or hook up but sometimes maybe the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.640 
or hook up but sometimes maybe the
timing<00:03:20.360> can<00:03:20.510> be<00:03:20.540> off<00:03:20.780> so<00:03:21.050> this<00:03:21.200> can<00:03:21.350> be<00:03:21.440> very

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
timing can be off so this can be very

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.400 
timing can be off so this can be very
weird<00:03:21.920> times<00:03:22.280> as<00:03:22.550> you<00:03:23.390> know<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:23.930> get<00:03:24.170> to<00:03:24.320> the

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
passion to get to the nucleus to get to

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.420 
passion to get to the nucleus to get to
the<00:03:26.420> fire<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.990> get<00:03:27.110> to<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.440> intensity<00:03:28.040> in<00:03:28.280> our

think that's the slogan of Saturn and
North<00:03:34.520> node<00:03:34.790> meaning<00:03:35.150> up<00:03:35.270> here<00:03:35.450> in<00:03:35.540> Scorpio

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.530 
get to maybe caught up in the mind but
to<00:04:00.590> weigh<00:04:00.770> things<00:04:00.830> out<00:04:01.340> and<00:04:01.610> tonight<00:04:02.150> again

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
to weigh things out and tonight again

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.220 
to weigh things out and tonight again
maybe<00:04:02.780> too<00:04:03.140> indecisive<00:04:03.590> as<00:04:03.980> Mars<00:04:04.310> and<00:04:04.610> Leo<00:04:04.760> is

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.860 
maybe too indecisive as Mars and Leo is
very<00:04:06.640> decisive<00:04:07.640> it<00:04:07.880> really<00:04:08.240> knows<00:04:08.540> what<00:04:08.750> it

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
very decisive it really knows what it

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
bring up it's going to be really hot and

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.650 
bring up it's going to be really hot and
intense<00:04:33.290> if<00:04:33.830> you're<00:04:34.400> really<00:04:34.580> going<00:04:34.970> for<00:04:35.360> that

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
intense if you're really going for that

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.200 
intense if you're really going for that
deep<00:04:36.050> desire<00:04:36.590> and<00:04:36.860> that<00:04:36.890> deep<00:04:37.160> intensity<00:04:37.880> and

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
deep desire and that deep intensity and

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.240 
deep desire and that deep intensity and
sometimes<00:04:39.170> baby<00:04:39.380> can<00:04:39.620> be<00:04:39.770> hard<00:04:39.980> to<00:04:40.040> find

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
sometimes baby can be hard to find

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.130 
sometimes baby can be hard to find
somebody<00:04:40.550> that<00:04:40.850> has<00:04:41.060> that<00:04:41.090> same<00:04:41.570> intensity<00:04:42.020> as

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
somebody that has that same intensity as

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.800 
somebody that has that same intensity as
you<00:04:42.460> but<00:04:43.460> in<00:04:43.580> many<00:04:43.760> ways<00:04:43.970> because<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:44.300> Sun<00:04:44.630> is

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
you but in many ways because the Sun is

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.960 
you but in many ways because the Sun is
in<00:04:45.200> Libra<00:04:45.590> through<00:04:45.860> this<00:04:46.040> Mars<00:04:46.370> Venus<00:04:46.670> transit

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
in Libra through this Mars Venus transit

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.430 
in Libra through this Mars Venus transit
that's<00:04:47.360> starting<00:04:47.660> to<00:04:47.690> build<00:04:47.900> I<00:04:48.140> think<00:04:48.380> that

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
that's starting to build I think that

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.080 
that's starting to build I think that
there<00:04:48.740> are<00:04:48.770> some<00:04:49.070> really<00:04:49.729> powerful

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
there are some really powerful

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.240 
there are some really powerful
relationships<00:04:50.900> building<00:04:51.320> and<00:04:51.680> I<00:04:51.950> think<00:04:52.130> that

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
relationships building and I think that

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.380 
relationships building and I think that
it's<00:04:52.370> important<00:04:52.790> to<00:04:52.910> note

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
it's important to note

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.210 
it's important to note
that<00:04:53.810> mercury<00:04:54.080> is<00:04:54.290> finishing<00:04:54.710> up<00:04:54.920> here<00:04:55.100> in

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
that mercury is finishing up here in

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.550 
that mercury is finishing up here in
Libra<00:04:55.550> and<00:04:55.760> it's<00:04:56.300> going<00:04:56.510> really<00:04:56.660> fast<00:04:56.930> now<00:04:57.260> and

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
Libra and it's going really fast now and

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.980 
Libra and it's going really fast now and
I<00:04:57.980> think<00:04:58.400> that<00:04:58.550> it's<00:04:58.670> important<00:04:59.120> to<00:04:59.180> really

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
I think that it's important to really

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.740 
I think that it's important to really
find<00:05:00.980> people<00:05:01.340> on<00:05:01.400> an<00:05:01.580> intellectual<00:05:02.000> level<00:05:02.270> and

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
find people on an intellectual level and

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.740 
find people on an intellectual level and
to<00:05:02.990> take<00:05:03.890> the<00:05:04.070> time<00:05:04.280> to<00:05:04.460> speak<00:05:04.700> before<00:05:05.390> you

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
to take the time to speak before you

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.600 
to take the time to speak before you
just<00:05:05.930> rush<00:05:06.170> into<00:05:06.380> anything<00:05:06.620> right<00:05:06.950> now<00:05:06.980> you

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
just rush into anything right now you

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.730 
just rush into anything right now you
know<00:05:07.730> the<00:05:08.000> longer<00:05:08.240> the<00:05:08.450> conversation<00:05:09.170> the

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
know the longer the conversation the

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.410 
know the longer the conversation the
more<00:05:09.770> you<00:05:10.190> can<00:05:10.340> start<00:05:10.610> to<00:05:10.790> really<00:05:10.970> figure<00:05:11.270> out

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
more you can start to really figure out

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.540 
more you can start to really figure out
whether<00:05:11.780> or<00:05:11.900> not<00:05:12.110> you<00:05:12.650> want<00:05:12.830> to<00:05:12.950> be<00:05:13.070> in<00:05:13.190> this<00:05:13.340> or

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
whether or not you want to be in this or

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.690 
whether or not you want to be in this or
not<00:05:13.700> and<00:05:14.090> I<00:05:14.660> think<00:05:14.750> quick<00:05:15.650> runs<00:05:16.010> into<00:05:16.430> things

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
not and I think quick runs into things

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.650 
not and I think quick runs into things
without<00:05:16.910> much<00:05:17.540> thought<00:05:18.010> into<00:05:19.010> it<00:05:19.580> can<00:05:20.390> lead

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
without much thought into it can lead

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.870 
without much thought into it can lead
toward<00:05:21.080> a<00:05:21.520> misunderstanding<00:05:22.520> or<00:05:22.670> more

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
toward a misunderstanding or more

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.070 
toward a misunderstanding or more
importantly<00:05:22.940> an<00:05:24.280> action<00:05:25.280> taken<00:05:25.820> into<00:05:26.480> not

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
importantly an action taken into not

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.400 
importantly an action taken into not
only<00:05:27.110> a<00:05:27.560> person<00:05:28.250> but<00:05:28.490> into<00:05:28.880> an<00:05:29.300> activity<00:05:30.230> of

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
only a person but into an activity of

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.470 
only a person but into an activity of
life<00:05:30.680> that<00:05:31.340> might<00:05:31.580> not<00:05:31.760> give<00:05:31.940> you<00:05:32.030> the<00:05:32.090> return

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.480 
life that might not give you the return

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.510 
life that might not give you the return
you<00:05:32.600> were<00:05:32.720> looking<00:05:33.020> for<00:05:33.290> without<00:05:33.890> really

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
you were looking for without really

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.040 
you were looking for without really
processing<00:05:35.300> and<00:05:35.420> making<00:05:35.660> sure<00:05:35.780> that's<00:05:35.960> what

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
processing and making sure that's what

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.140 
processing and making sure that's what
you<00:05:36.110> want<00:05:36.230> and<00:05:36.710> going<00:05:37.400> through<00:05:37.430> the<00:05:37.670> test<00:05:37.940> to

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
you want and going through the test to

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.460 
you want and going through the test to
make<00:05:38.240> sure<00:05:38.300> that<00:05:38.660> it<00:05:38.780> really<00:05:39.020> is<00:05:39.200> what<00:05:39.380> you

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
make sure that it really is what you

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.170 
make sure that it really is what you
want<00:05:39.710> and<00:05:39.980> today<00:05:40.460> I<00:05:40.490> think<00:05:40.760> we<00:05:40.850> start<00:05:41.090> to

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
want and today I think we start to

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.090 
want and today I think we start to
understand<00:05:41.720> that<00:05:41.930> as<00:05:42.080> we<00:05:42.650> need<00:05:42.800> to<00:05:42.860> process

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
understand that as we need to process
