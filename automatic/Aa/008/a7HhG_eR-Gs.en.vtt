00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.260
 Hello my name is Fedor Krasyuk I 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.120
 glad to welcome you on my channel and 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:20.300
 today our lesson will be dedicated 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.300
 an element called the hatchet and coffin 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.629
 first performance 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.679
 items will be given to you with difficulty and 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:41.429
 since you will be just scared and so 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:44.649
 how to get rid of the fear itself 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:46.089
 the first step you should take 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.539
 get it 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:51.369
 reliable assistant to be yours 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:55.769
 guardian angel when performing these 

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:59.140
 elements of happiness, I already have one 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:02.439
 so get a helper and that won't 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.950
 understand that they are not paid for the work 

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:09.310
 have start performing element on 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:14.319
 horizontal bar relatively low in 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.600
 avoid injury when failed 

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:20.190
 executions of this element can 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.319
 be a kind of different falls and 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.659
 falls I personally learned to perform this 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.369
 element in a soft-coated room 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.420
 but since we are on 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.939
 the street where the coatings are a little bit soft 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.959
 even a little bit soft of yours 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.500
 faithful assistant will be your friend so 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:40.379
 move on 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.509
 initially directly to execution 

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:48.940
 coffin coffin performed with the buildup and 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:54.300
 later at the right point you lower 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.300
 feet and land successfully 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:04.470
 text 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:08.070
 a slight buildup of total times and you 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.250
 land on the ground despite all 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.770
 ease of execution of the initial buildup 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.900
 anyway there are a number of errors and now 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.209
 I will show the most common 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.850
 as an ordinary person hangs on the bar 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.770
 but instead will gain on the buildup that is, you 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.520
 take move cutting do like this 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.880
 that is, your body must reach 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.070
 almost horizontal with horizontal bar 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.959
 there is likely to reverse that is, 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.320
 man starts u so how to wave 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.630
 with your body soar no swing 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.580
 unnecessary beneficial lowering matter legs 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.890
 may be here on the raw and dirty 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:52.560
 earth as mentioned earlier 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.480
 your body should go almost to 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.190
 one horizontal with horizontal bar 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:03.360
 this way when you release your legs 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.280
 will land clearly on the ground and now we 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.560
 We begin to study and what is the hatchet 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.320
 it is different from the coffin case that 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.600
 hatchet does not carry any buildup you 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.700
 can not perform it with any 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.200
 Absolutely position is important to you 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.070
 landed on their feet on the ground intact 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.070
 unscathed 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.520
 there is also an improvement 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:35.010
 hatchet is doing it with a turn 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.070
 at various degrees up 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.520
 to 540 so it will be called hatchet with 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.520
 interception 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.310
 the coffin and the hatchet will not cause you 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.440
 no trouble after you 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.110
 get rid of fear and just be them 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.940
 daily trainings but for now train 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.220
 swing subscribe to new videos 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.220
 with you was Fedor Krasyuk bye 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.150
