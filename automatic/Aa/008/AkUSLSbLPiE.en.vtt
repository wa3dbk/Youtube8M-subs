00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
let's see what we get here again really

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.350 
let's see what we get here again really
realistic<00:01:16.460> like<00:01:16.640> as<00:01:16.790> if<00:01:16.939> you're<00:01:17.090> scratching

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
realistic like as if you're scratching

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.570 
realistic like as if you're scratching
with<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.750> coin<00:01:17.960> except<00:01:18.920> without<00:01:19.040> all<00:01:19.400> the

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
with the coin except without all the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.510 
with the coin except without all the
dust<00:01:20.210> going<00:01:20.479> around<00:01:20.750> everywhere<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:21.860> let's

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
dust going around everywhere so let's

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.819 
dust going around everywhere so let's
see<00:01:22.759> we<00:01:23.030> got<00:01:23.180> four<00:01:23.420> six<00:01:23.720> twelve<00:01:24.110> I<00:01:24.470> don't<00:01:24.680> think

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
see we got four six twelve I don't think

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.319 
see we got four six twelve I don't think
this<00:01:24.890> is<00:01:25.040> a<00:01:25.070> winner<00:01:25.310> either<00:01:25.549> so<00:01:25.820> we<00:01:25.970> got<00:01:26.150> no

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
this is a winner either so we got no

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.719 
this is a winner either so we got no
winners<00:01:26.659> here<00:01:26.689> okay<00:01:27.650> and<00:01:27.890> this<00:01:28.340> is<00:01:28.520> really

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
winners here okay and this is really

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.340 
winners here okay and this is really
realistic<00:01:29.390> more<00:01:29.540> even<00:01:29.869> more<00:01:30.020> realistic

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
realistic more even more realistic

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.469 
realistic more even more realistic
because<00:01:30.680> you<00:01:30.950> don't<00:01:31.100> actually<00:01:31.250> win<00:01:31.850> too<00:01:32.060> often

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
because you don't actually win too often

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.499 
because you don't actually win too often
with<00:01:32.600> scratchers<00:01:33.110> at<00:01:33.530> least<00:01:33.770> I<00:01:33.890> don't<00:01:34.100> so<00:01:34.340> 17<00:01:35.210> 1

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
with scratchers at least I don't so 17 1

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.289 
with scratchers at least I don't so 17 1
and<00:01:35.780> 12<00:01:36.400> let's<00:01:37.400> see<00:01:37.640> it<00:01:37.759> doesn't<00:01:37.970> look<00:01:38.149> like

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299
