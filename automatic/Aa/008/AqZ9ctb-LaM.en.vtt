00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.670
 Hello you got there for the second 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.529
 release of my project secret code so 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.480
 let's start puzzles from the previous release 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.250
 as expected and cracked enough 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.400
 quickly the first was if i'm not mistaken 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.110
 Sasha from the ring and why was enough 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.939
 simple though most of you are not 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.040
 I did it anyway 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.570
 the essence and how it was necessary not to look 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.360
 first you need to abstract 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.070
 today is necessary because the task is easy 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.500
 you hardly need to look for the meaning of music 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.880
 drag in some objects and the very 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.100
 parchment on which everything is 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.670
 most likely to the riddle of the relationship is not 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.370
 It has 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.730
 we have three elements left inscription march 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.400
 tour and the cryptogram we start 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.320
 interesting and program the first thing 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.810
 striking is the word that 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.730
 mirrored known doing 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.980
 horizontal reflection and we get 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.710
 familiar to us Russian letters but still 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.320
 yet they do not mean anything and so far all 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.630
 more we can not squeeze out of it too 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.060
 need more information source and need 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.640
 get from remaining items 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.470
 fool well everyone understands that this is Caesar well 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.899
 or use the Internet and find out who 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.939
 it is with a laurel wreath on the head in the same way 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.860
 we have the word march which may have 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.350
 attitude to spring and also this friction 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.689
 month of the year more specifics from March 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.320
 the easy version of the task is not expected 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.580
 what we have we have cryptograms 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.530
 Similarly, you need to spend on it 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.920
 some kind of conversion to get 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.350
 password 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.210
 what kind of transformation do we have to 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.250
 suggest other elements this is march 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.450
 essences and accordingly even if you 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.000
 haven't heard of him before 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.179
 using google just knit in loops 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.899
 transform and 3 and immediately get 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.299
 Caesar cipher 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.429
 she's a classic shift cipher by silence 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.899
 Caesar cipher shift by three positions i 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.750
 wanted to put another month from the beginning 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.030
 that you came to Caesar and the size of the shift 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.610
 it was different there may for example 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.710
 Further, but in the end I simplified everything 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.200
 easy way just talk 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.450
 hacked this ciphertext this time 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.459
 I was asked to kind of more difficult but for now 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.310
 decided not to complicate things very much but simply 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.980
 do everything wrong block last time was 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.290
 all right ciphertext color well actually 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.600
 and break my head and needs but I will continue 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.640
 more abstract speaking generalized 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.780
 although I am sure that this mystery to you 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.910
 there will also be food 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.069
 by the way now to download the archive to you 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.900
 also need a password password will be 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.690
 the same on the archive and on the very 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.400
 the jump also many last time could 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.260
 enter the archive because they entered the password 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.480
 Letâ€™s make a big letter. 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.230
 no matter how many words and in whatever language 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.300
 there was a password 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.160
 but will always reduce only small 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.290
 letters although there may be numbers 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.130
 Of course, but if letters are twerked letters 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.290
 lower case 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.290
 plan let's finally get rid of the riddles 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.260
 again a few elements 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.930
 Charging appendix deed let's give a maximum 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.150
 2 where I'm sure you can avoid 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.139
 earlier the main thing to speculate and all with 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.139
 get luck
