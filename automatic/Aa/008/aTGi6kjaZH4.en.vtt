00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
this is the first station of solid which

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.070 
this is the first station of solid which
is<00:00:46.559> very<00:00:46.769> originally<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.750> very

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
is very originally and it's very

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.960 
is very originally and it's very
different<00:00:49.290> than<00:00:49.589> this<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.610> typical

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
different than this of the typical

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.609 
different than this of the typical
station<00:00:51.869> today<00:00:52.049> aw<00:00:52.670> straight<00:00:53.670> or<00:00:54.350> Germany<00:00:55.350> I

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:55.619 
station today aw straight or Germany I

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:58.729 
station today aw straight or Germany I

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
think that it's it's similar than the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:07.090 
think that it's it's similar than the
Gothic<00:00:59.339> architecture
