00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.490
 Europa League is perhaps a bit 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:07.899
 started slowly 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.429
 opponents Friday from that can 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.710
 we believed that tomorrow night there 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:14.840
 a real grower is on the program 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.450
 yes at least a German top team 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.760
 comes to visit and after the results of 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.200
 last week we don't stand a chance 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.140
 we can have a nice evening here tomorrow morning 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.689
 make it a full stadium like it too 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.860
 hear a rash in hamburg yes that 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.380
 perspective but also that 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.570
 it will be awfully hard what will you be 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.450
 starting tomorrow because it can limp 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.390
 on two thoughts we are only one 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.920
 thought that is by coming and then it 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.750
 with a new extension to 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.870
 penalties or an order after extension or 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.399
 or 3142 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.460
 they are unrealistic results 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.219
 maybe in advance as your goal 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.760
 you know you have to make the three 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:57.079
 and we will see it tomorrow 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.149
 you never know the result in advance and we 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:03.339
 hope doramin as a you a week 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.339
 have become wiser in hamburg 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.010
 well that there are indeed opportunities 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.200
 lie 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.540
 we had such good things last week 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.360
 that we played by European standards 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.140
 have created enough opportunity and a pity 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.149
 that the booming went and hopefully that there 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.060
 a ball roll tomorrow and that 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.530
 we defend the know-how after the 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.750
 match and hamburg next there it is 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.540
 here against sparta a downer and cons 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.770
 a disappointment is that disappointment 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.770
 that dip has been processed 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.990
 you have to do is not otherwise 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.439
 We are a new contest for weather 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.850
 the door and gloomy evening knocked 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.750
 Monday too, but it is already again 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.149
 Wednesday 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.619
 now everything is focused on tomorrow psv 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.869
 This season they had times 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.789
 can be thought invincible 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.860
 that we are now a slightly different mentally 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.409
 situation is 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.630
 well that nonsense is we invincible 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.420
 don't have lore from sparta anyway 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.880
 he smiles but yes no 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.469
 we encourage saying the it's one 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.560
 something has gone the last few weeks and 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.349
 have 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.290
 result achieved and only the only one 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.120
 real damper that was indeed only 92 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.090
 minute and 50 seconds according to me 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.620
 breeches pump remains a 0 then it is 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.170
 nicely done and fantastic good 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.930
 played and keep 0 and now that is 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.390
 immerse yourself there in the injury time 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.019
 yes it has already been forgotten 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.000
 because competition does not count European and 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.380
 in terms of competition, we can only say what 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.819
 that has meant 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.750
 in a few weeks it will be west 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.420
 maybe against her shoulder 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.040
 Keeping crucial means enormous 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.430
 boost means to be turned off 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.430
 a new tip 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.430
 so good that we're moral life 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.049
 and then and then sunny weather and only then can 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.330
 tell you more about it 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.310
 your role tomorrow evening 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.709
 yes that is the same that I will go tomorrow 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.090
 I know that is not what is called 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.530
 idea today have been told that 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.910
 you start tomorrow 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.040
 well I heard nothing but the 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.750
 see those vests and see you over to 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.680
 you put on but finally 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.590
 changed 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.690
 the sat 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.849
 it says nothing yet it will be a feeling 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.590
 are from the trainer tomorrow with which 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.819
 people's humor is starting and there is still 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.069
 no clarity at all 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.090
 to one if I still start then I do 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.860
 my best to say to me very simply 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.390
 and if I start nobody and have to film 9 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.650
 then I also do my best and that 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.849
 or a Danny Koevermans contest 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.870
 and it says where the 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.430
 must be scored in which the 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.200
 probably played offensive 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.830
 full stadium 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.090
 yes that's nice we hope we have finished now 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.470
 Danny Koeverman's goals and like this on 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.470
 danny koevermans competitions are then 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.269
 would it be nice if i may start and 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.690
 can be of value tomorrow success tomorrow 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.690
 all right
