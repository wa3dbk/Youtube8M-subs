00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
I guess what so once we trigger this

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.260 
I guess what so once we trigger this
thingamajigger<00:01:01.070> we<00:01:02.070> will<00:01:02.609> go<00:01:02.760> out<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.149> this

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.920 
there and just shoot down the the
helicopters<00:02:04.320> that's<00:02:04.860> one<00:02:05.070> way<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.460> just

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
helicopters that's one way to just

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.190 
helicopters that's one way to just
you<00:02:07.560> know<00:02:07.680> move<00:02:08.280> along<00:02:08.399> real<00:02:08.759> quickly<00:02:09.000> but

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.750 

this<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.350> probably<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.740> safest<00:02:14.040> way<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.430> just

real good shot you're going to have to

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.600 
real good shot you're going to have to
do<00:02:23.670> some<00:02:23.910> peeking<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:25.260> just<00:02:25.470> jump<00:02:25.709> up<00:02:25.860> squat

up<00:02:32.880> with<00:02:33.150> somebody<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:34.020> shoot<00:02:34.230> them<00:02:36.110> so

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
up with somebody to to shoot them so

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.620 
up with somebody to to shoot them so
once<00:02:38.130> we<00:02:38.280> cleared<00:02:38.520> out<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:38.910> they're<00:02:39.480> going

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
once we cleared out this they're going

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.010
