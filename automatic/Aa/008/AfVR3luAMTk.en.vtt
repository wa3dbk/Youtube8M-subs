dollars<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:02.309> produce<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:03.180> know<00:01:03.210> but<00:01:03.510> you

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
dollars to produce you know but you

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.820 
dollars to produce you know but you
would<00:01:03.899> really<00:01:04.049> think<00:01:04.320> would<00:01:04.500> take<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> few

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
would really think would take a few

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.410 
would really think would take a few
thousand<00:01:05.189> dollars<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.519> equipment<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.180> pull

off<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.720> kind<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.990> photo<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:08.850> first<00:01:09.090> step<00:01:09.420> is

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
off this kind of photo the first step is

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.660 
off this kind of photo the first step is
just<00:01:09.630> picking<00:01:10.260> where<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.920> stick<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.130> aircraft

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
just picking where to stick the aircraft

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.789 
just picking where to stick the aircraft
weighing<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.420> risks<00:01:12.810> what<00:01:13.470> are<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.619> hazards

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
weighing the risks what are the hazards

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.800 
weighing the risks what are the hazards
slot<00:01:14.369> rooftops<00:01:14.850> might<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.330> thing<00:01:15.479> get<00:01:15.600> stuck

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810

on<00:01:15.960> for<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> month<00:01:16.380> once<00:01:17.009> I'm<00:01:17.130> flying<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.580> I've

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
on for a month once I'm flying and I've

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.760 
on for a month once I'm flying and I've
got<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.000> copter<00:01:18.780> about<00:01:19.020> where<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.259> don't<00:01:19.650> think

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
got the copter about where I don't think

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.880 
got the copter about where I don't think
that<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.310> camera<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.700> looking<00:01:20.790> into<00:01:21.090> then<00:01:21.360> I

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
that the camera is looking into then I

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.890 
that the camera is looking into then I
do<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> slow<00:01:23.189> pirouette<00:01:23.460> back<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.030> forth<00:01:24.240> so

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
do a slow pirouette back and forth so

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.230 
do a slow pirouette back and forth so
that's<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.530> camera<00:01:26.009> has<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> chance<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.820> do

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
that's the camera has a chance to do

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.179 
that's the camera has a chance to do
it's<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.720> lot<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.140> white<00:01:28.290> balance<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.979> do<00:01:29.070> its

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
it's a lot of white balance to do its

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.940 
it's a lot of white balance to do its
automatic<00:01:29.430> exposure<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.259> try<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.409> from<00:01:31.650> a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
automatic exposure and try that from a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.560 
automatic exposure and try that from a
few<00:01:32.130> different<00:01:32.430> points<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.729> view<00:01:32.880> because<00:01:33.119> you

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
few different points of view because you

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.179 
few different points of view because you
don't<00:01:33.750> know<00:01:33.869> exactly<00:01:34.020> where<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.860> camera<00:01:35.009> is

going for them for taking these

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.649 
going for them for taking these
panoramic<00:01:49.920> photos<00:01:51.200> primarily<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.649> risk

panoramic photos primarily it's risk

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.670 
panoramic photos primarily it's risk
secondarily<00:01:54.659> I'd<00:01:54.899> say<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.350> they're<00:01:55.500> cheap

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
secondarily I'd say that they're cheap

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.889 
secondarily I'd say that they're cheap
and<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.250> don't<00:01:56.399> have<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.850> be<00:01:57.240> upset<00:01:57.630> if

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
and you don't have to be upset if

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.929 
and you don't have to be upset if
they're<00:01:58.200> damaged<00:01:58.560> or<00:01:58.799> if<00:01:59.070> they<00:01:59.250> try<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.640> damage

they're damaged or if they try to damage

something else which they were

something else which they were
okay<00:02:01.480> that's<00:02:02.260> why<00:02:02.530> I<00:02:02.560> can<00:02:02.800> be<00:02:02.950> so<00:02:03.250> cavalier

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090

me fly in places that I otherwise
wouldn't<00:02:19.780> dare<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:24.420> once<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.540> copters<00:02:25.870> landed

wouldn't dare to once the copters landed

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.920 
wouldn't dare to once the copters landed
and<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:27.550> take<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.150> little<00:02:28.330> camera<00:02:28.480> card<00:02:28.780> out

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
and I take the little camera card out

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.480 
and I take the little camera card out
and<00:02:28.990> stick<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.260> into<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.470> computer<00:02:29.620> then<00:02:30.160> I've

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
and stick it into the computer then I've

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.970 
and stick it into the computer then I've
got<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.640> video<00:02:30.940> file<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.209> I<00:02:31.450> can<00:02:31.600> look<00:02:31.720> at<00:02:31.980> with

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
got a video file that I can look at with

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.270 
got a video file that I can look at with
the<00:02:33.130> final<00:02:33.580> video<00:02:33.850> what<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.810> do<00:02:34.870> is<00:02:35.290> extract<00:02:35.830> all

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
the final video what I do is extract all

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.880 
the final video what I do is extract all
these<00:02:36.850> steel<00:02:37.060> frames<00:02:37.390> out<00:02:38.020> of<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:38.620> segment

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
these steel frames out of that segment

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.430 
these steel frames out of that segment
of<00:02:39.130> video<00:02:39.300> this<00:02:40.300> one<00:02:40.480> shoots<00:02:40.750> 60<00:02:41.080> frames<00:02:41.290> of

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
panorama the overall layout it depends

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.500 
panorama the overall layout it depends
on<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:51.100> motion<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.489> camera<00:02:51.670> if<00:02:52.180> it's<00:02:52.450> a

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
on the motion of the camera if it's a

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.479 
on the motion of the camera if it's a
nice<00:02:52.660> calm<00:02:52.930> day<00:02:53.020> and<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:53.650> can<00:02:53.830> just<00:02:53.980> you<00:02:54.190> know<00:02:54.280> do

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
nice calm day and I can just you know do

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.850 
nice calm day and I can just you know do
that<00:02:54.989> then<00:02:55.989> you<00:02:56.230> know<00:02:56.320> you<00:02:56.380> could<00:02:56.560> get<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.709> nice

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
that then you know you could get a nice

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.690 
that then you know you could get a nice
rectangle<00:02:57.459> out<00:02:57.580> of<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:59.010> if<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.190> camera<00:03:00.550> was

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700

rectangle out of that if the camera was
you<00:03:01.090> know<00:03:01.180> actually<00:03:01.810> doing<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.260> then<00:03:02.980> you'll

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
you know actually doing that then you'll

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.699 
you know actually doing that then you'll
end<00:03:03.850> up<00:03:03.910> with<00:03:04.060> something<00:03:04.209> more<00:03:04.450> of<00:03:05.220> distortion

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
end up with something more of distortion

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.620 
end up with something more of distortion
there<00:03:08.709> are<00:03:08.769> several<00:03:08.920> artifacts<00:03:09.430> that's<00:03:09.940> come

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
there are several artifacts that's come

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.150 
there are several artifacts that's come
because<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.260> camera<00:03:11.590> is<00:03:11.650> such<00:03:11.830> low<00:03:12.010> quality
