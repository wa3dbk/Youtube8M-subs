00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.250
 hi guys i am for the master is 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.470
 this is a gameplay of oblivion 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.030
 I chose to show you this game 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.650
 because many gamers have 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.599
 started playing the elder saga 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.549
 scrolls starting from skyrim 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.630
 so I decided to show them the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.140
 gameplay mechanics of this 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.820
 wonderful game but I will not analyze them 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.160
 mechanical gameplay of oblivion for 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.150
 explain why the main topic 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.289
 this video is not the game itself 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.060
 definitely looking at the gameplay there 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.309
 something will immediately be noticed 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.320
 strange if you haven't done it yet 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.710
 in case you look carefully what is going on 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.899
 riding my character is a 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.850
 cheerful feathery yellow named chocobo 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.450
 taken directly from the final saga 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.460
 fantasy of which I am a big fan 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.020
 obviously this is a mod like this 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.750
 as will be other elements that 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.879
 you will see soon but above all 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.449
 you need to have a clear idea of ​​what it is 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.610
 a mod 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.010
 the concept of motion is perhaps not 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.600
 familiar to everyone maybe because you are there 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.969
 recently overlooking the PC world 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.750
 gaming or maybe because it has played on 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.060
 console where fashions are absent fashions is 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.159
 the abbreviation of modification ie 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.689
 partial or total modification of several 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.540
 elements of a game by 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.659
 external developers now some fashions 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.890
 add new elements to a game 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.049
 such as those you are seeing 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.330
 right now while other fashions 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.310
 modify existing elements 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.320
 just to give you an example in grand 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.270
 theft auto fashions not cars 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.159
 new vehicles join those already 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.540
 existing but replace them 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.640
 completely the fashions are made by hunger 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.650
 therefore they are almost all amateur but 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.180
 however developed by people who have 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.060
 of competences in the field of 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.009
 programming is almost never a 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.960
 profit -making except when they come 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.420
 purchased by the manufacturers for 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.130
 resell them as dlc as happened 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.799
 just in oblivion with the expansion 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.570
 knights of the nine that it was 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.700
 a package in the ways he hates 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.530
 he had bought the rights 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.259
 this risky move turned out to be 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.240
 wrong in the field of gaming PCs because 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.039
 no player on PC would ever spend 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.569
 money for fashions when on sites 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.599
 specialized ones if you find hundreds 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.410
 even better done while he had a 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.200
 discreet 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.670
 in the world of consoles justified 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.200
 from the lack of a support to the fashions 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.180
 some manufacturers have noticed 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.190
 the enormous potential of fashions and for 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.190
 incentivize their programming to us 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.390
 left software development kits 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.340
 that is, the programs that have the function 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.690
 to make it easier to develop one 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.700
 mod 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.830
 yes because developing a mod is a lot 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.720
 complex and even more difficult 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.230
 it was done without a team because 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.820
 means having to think about everything yourself 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.710
 normally developing a mod a un 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.230
 respectful team to envy 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.390
 also to the software houses these teams 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.220
 not only do they work for free in theirs 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.110
 free time but also try to 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.060
 please all the fans of their work 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.890
 and in the end they manage to create babies 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.920
 masterpieces able to overcome even the 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.990
 beauty of the starting game 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.450
 unfortunately the only limitation of fashions 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.040
 which are never stand alone and therefore 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.160
 they always need a game which 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.320
 look out for this to be played 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.330
 limitation was however exceeded by 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.160
 some total conversions they have 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.110
 need a starting game only for 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.820
 the period of their development 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.790
 but once completed and become gods 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.370
 real games in their own right one 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.170
 total conversion is a mammoth mod 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.090
 which is born with the presupposition of creating 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.850
 something completely different from the 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.800
 game from which we started the world of 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.050
 motorcycle is very varied there are ways of 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.550
 any genre almost for every game and 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.080
 the enormous availability of them 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.450
 helps make games like 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.220
 practically endless oblivion that 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.580
 otherwise, once finished, they would end up 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.989
 to take dust on a shelf a 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.670
 my advice, however, is not to make you 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.230
 get carried away too much because 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.230
 install too many way risks 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.910
 really distort the game too much 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.160
 do it only after you have finished it at least 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.360
 one time 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.650
 I hope this video was there 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.720
 useful to learn more 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.390
 this side is not known to all of gaming 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.280
 on PC and I bet this is over 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.000
 video you will follow to look for some 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.220
 way to your favorite game 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.989
 well i think that's all so there 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.530
 see you at my next video bye 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.530
 boys
