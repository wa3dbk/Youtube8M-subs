00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.350
 grandson wounds disney menu but it doesn't seem 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.410
 on the modern technological world 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.630
 who you expect to see around here 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.629
 no technical innovations 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.580
 this room is more like a pottery 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.770
 workshop 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.530
 but thanks to geometric analysis 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.129
 widely used in mining in 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.420
 Russia can be obtained from this stone 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.210
 microscopic but valuable nuggets 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.180
 gold and without this method the fireplace is just 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.339
 would throw 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.989
 golden east vast territory almost 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.360
 twice as big as australia 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.739
 here is more than 11 percent 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.739
 world gold reserves 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.080
 but most of the mines were long 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.799
 abandoned now work there trying 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.930
 resume 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.030
 Director of the Research Institute of Geology and Geophysics 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.500
 minerals told us how it is 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.520
 going on at first we have a number 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.320
 enterprises that will produce 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.390
 This equipment including ours 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.900
 enterprises institute of irkutsk physics 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.380
 second we begin we are more well how 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.080
 say the most fully know 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.700
 opportunities in the Kursk region in their 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.130
 time work was carried out we know where 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.500
 how its heaps lie how many are they 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.240
 so we, as a minister, are still 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.030
 profile geological find out where in 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.430
 the first place to apply them so 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.530
 way Irkutsk is experiencing a new wave 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.780
 gold rush and it will render 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.270
 positive impact not only on mines 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.580
 10 years ago left the field 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.240
 worked took a ton there two or three took 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.470
 gone before 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.080
 people don't work there 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.810
 the village is in poor condition 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.460
 and accumulated a huge number of dumps 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.380
 if with our help it starts there 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.720
 working out these old dumps here 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.700
 of course you come back school people 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.980
 I earn in kindergartens there and people 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.720
 will start at least another 10 15 years will be 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.720
 working there of course is extremely important 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.770
 and hajj and goldinga in 2012 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.230
 Irkutsk region was found a piece 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.700
 gold heart shape afterwards and 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.100
 local and foreign investors 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.440
 tried to access this 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.630
 gold vein but many of them remain 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.720
 only with envy look away 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.060
 Irkutsk museum to you 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.650
 to bump nations from irkutsk in search 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.650
 gold specifically for rt
