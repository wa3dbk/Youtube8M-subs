over the new features of the user

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.380 
over the new features of the user
created<00:01:26.930> standards<00:01:27.730> the<00:01:28.730> first<00:01:28.970> new<00:01:29.150> feature

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
created standards the first new feature

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.480 
created standards the first new feature
is<00:01:29.690> the<00:01:29.750> ability<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.560> process<00:01:30.800> variables

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
is the ability to process variables

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.420 
is the ability to process variables
during<00:01:31.850> condition<00:01:32.300> evaluation<00:01:32.960> now<00:01:33.890> what

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
during condition evaluation now what

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.150 
during condition evaluation now what
does<00:01:34.490> that<00:01:34.640> mean<00:01:34.960> well<00:01:35.960> let's<00:01:36.350> take<00:01:36.620> a<00:01:36.650> sample

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
does that mean well let's take a sample

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.510 
does that mean well let's take a sample
UCS<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:37.880> figure<00:01:38.210> that<00:01:38.390> out<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:40.070> first<00:01:40.310> thing

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
UCS and figure that out the first thing

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.130 
UCS and figure that out the first thing
we<00:01:40.610> will<00:01:40.760> look<00:01:40.850> at<00:01:41.030> is<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.630> for<00:01:41.960> each

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
we will look at is the for each

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.590 
we will look at is the for each
statement<00:01:42.470> this<00:01:43.370> line<00:01:43.640> is<00:01:43.670> telling<00:01:44.090> us<00:01:44.210> that

statement this line is telling us that

statement this line is telling us that
the<00:01:45.080> UCS<00:01:45.620> should<00:01:45.860> only<00:01:46.040> apply<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:46.460> a<00:01:46.700> s<00:01:47.060> or

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
the UCS should only apply to a s or

the UCS should only apply to a s or
adjustable<00:01:48.170> shelf<00:01:48.530> parts<00:01:49.990> next<00:01:50.990> we're<00:01:51.290> going

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
adjustable shelf parts next we're going

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.320 
adjustable shelf parts next we're going
to<00:01:51.590> look<00:01:51.710> at<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:51.950> variable<00:01:52.430> declarations<00:01:53.090> in

look<00:02:08.989> at<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.349> while<00:02:09.649> loop<00:02:09.920> this<00:02:10.819> is<00:02:11.000> where<00:02:11.209> the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
look at the while loop this is where the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.110 
look at the while loop this is where the
new<00:02:11.569> feature<00:02:11.810> comes<00:02:12.110> into<00:02:12.319> play<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:13.550> loop<00:02:13.970> is

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
new feature comes into play the loop is

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.690 
new feature comes into play the loop is
looking<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:15.080> cabinets<00:02:15.769> interior

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
looking to the cabinets interior

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.020 
looking to the cabinets interior

now<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:23.080> may<00:02:23.290> be<00:02:23.319> wondering<00:02:23.440> how<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:23.980> got<00:02:24.099> all

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
now you may be wondering how I got all

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.699 
now you may be wondering how I got all
that<00:02:24.550> information<00:02:24.760> from<00:02:25.360> what's<00:02:25.569> here<00:02:25.870> well

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
that information from what's here well

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.550 
that information from what's here well
let<00:02:26.950> me<00:02:27.040> take<00:02:27.190> a<00:02:27.220> moment<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.640> explain<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.560> the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
let me take a moment to explain it the

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.440 
let me take a moment to explain it the
breakdown<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.160> path<00:02:30.459> that's<00:02:30.730> given<00:02:31.060> here

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
breakdown of the path that's given here

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.050 
breakdown of the path that's given here
is<00:02:31.569> as<00:02:31.959> follows<00:02:32.790> cabinet<00:02:34.170> interior
