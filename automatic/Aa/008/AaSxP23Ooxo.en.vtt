00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.089
 good day here is bunnymen her again 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.160
 in today's video it's about 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.769
 a new fan control but moment 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.509
 I said fan control that is 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.650
 not quite right then the inclined one 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.180
 spectator has already seen that here 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.539
 controller also on the pack too 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.359
 The whole is possible through 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:33.710
 the fact that the controller pro 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:37.770
 channel 30 watts of power provides that is 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.510
 you may want to pump any current 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.180
 then it sounds funny though 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.280
 but it is as good as it gets 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.329
 Of course, something interesting is always interesting too 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.940
 is included 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.550
 of course the controller itself here 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.230
 to see the picture 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.710
 then let's have a look at which cables 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:03.300
 can be seen in the middle 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:05.549
 connection cable to the 4 pole molex with 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.390
 appropriate cable connection to the 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.110
 control itself left in the picture four 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.090
 Cable for the individual channels 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.770
 There you can fan accordingly 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.790
 connect 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.850
 and last but not least a lot of temps sensors 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:27.140
 you can choose anywhere in the housing 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:32.939
 can accommodate as you can see in the picture 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:37.079
 okay the tasted pc control costs 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.990
 30 euro so a pretty attractive price 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.409
 if you do that with the controllers of the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.409
 I compare the competitors 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.270
 Control already connected 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.869
 You see how she works here 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.180
 nice blue lights you can say 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.880
 the display can be fine 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.079
 read off 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.689
 also diagonally from above or below 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.299
 it is also in sunlight 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.009
 No problem I already tested and 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.420
 this aspect is not at all 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.409
 Controllers have given it here 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.280
 certainly also myself 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.880
 detected 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.660
 over the years is could give 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.430
 or from many manufacturers while on 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.740
 the first look may look good though 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.370
 you look at it from the side or from 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.430
 below 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.870
 then you can not read that well 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.030
 is not the same with this controller 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.970
 case 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.370
 the numbers themselves the display very wise 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.710
 sufficiently large clear 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.880
 really structured at first 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.250
 look well readable looks stylish 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.990
 with the blue 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.140
 okay still a few words to the 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.960
 individual functions 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.740
 you see her left tim display ads 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.020
 of which two are currently active that is 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:59.480
 I have air in a first channel 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:03.320
 the speed is controlled here and here 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:09.440
 Above you can see a cool master iceberg 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:10.790
 water cooling komplettset like the 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.900
 Both fans at the control 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:19.190
 here hang a geforce titan graphic 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:22.310
 just that is not involved and to 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.370
 I have the pump from the demonstration 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.690
 iceberg control the cable goes here 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:33.230
 down to the tax system connected 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.300
 on the second channel it wanted to 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.020
 illustrate the pump is running 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:42.050
 usually up to about 3600 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:45.170
 turns and here I have something 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:50.780
 regulated down would go further 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:53.630
 should now be down to 2,700 down here 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.470
 both channels are zero because there 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:00.459
 nothing is connected on the right 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.310
 side we see four more fields 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.900
 there is one there I have one 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:11.450
 temperature sensors closed 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:14.270
 since the room temperature and the 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.209
 frame is made of aluminum the routes 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.530
 running with the vw logo also looks 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.510
 quite noble 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.310
 So I would say one in total 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:30.810
 Round package price goes well too 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.580
 and would say worth a recommendation 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.310
 if you are looking for such a 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.720
 device shows where you as well four 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.419
 For example, fans can be used afterwards 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.419
 if you now have a big radiator off 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.800
 like the nova or moral where you still are 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.240
 connect a fan or more 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.340
 can 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:51.780
 there one has with many controllers that 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:54.630
 problem that you do not have nine per channel 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.730
 may operate due to the 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.410
 low performance and that's just that 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.230
 not the case could be further 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.260
 There is also a rap to get through 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:07.220
 in the trade for example at haka tuning 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.390
 say from molex 1 to 9 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.450
 docter and then just might completely 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:15.990
 all the fans hang on a canal 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.639
 still three more channels free and 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.169
 could all pumps there as well or two 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.419
 also connect other devices 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.600
 that 's just the reason why a good package 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:29.220
 and the whole for 30 euros is one 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:36.090
 nice thing and if you take part 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:38.400
 wanted to order I would say makes 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.440
 it's quiet because there is money for it 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.050
 actually hardly on the market at present 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.820
 alternative 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.830
 okay that should be it again 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.120
 from my side I hope so 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.289
 video liked and still want one 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.919
 nice evening until next time 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.919
 armani mania
