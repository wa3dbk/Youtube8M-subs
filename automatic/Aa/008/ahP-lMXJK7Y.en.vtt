I've<00:00:13.290> asked<00:00:13.740> from<00:00:13.860> sonic<00:00:14.160> solutions<00:00:14.640> and

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
I've asked from sonic solutions and

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.429 
I've asked from sonic solutions and
we're<00:00:15.570> getting<00:00:15.690> ready<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.109> head<00:00:16.260> out<00:00:16.320> to

going<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.080> be<00:00:19.200> poured<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.530> diamond<00:00:19.920> da20<00:00:20.280> now

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
going to be poured a diamond da20 now

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.940 
going to be poured a diamond da20 now
all<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.780> arrangements<00:00:21.990> have<00:00:22.380> been<00:00:22.410> made<00:00:22.530> with

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
all the arrangements have been made with

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.170 
all the arrangements have been made with
the<00:00:23.730> facility<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.539> with<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.710> pilot<00:00:26.190> and<00:00:26.400> so

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
the facility and with the pilot and so

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.000 
the facility and with the pilot and so
what<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.480> have<00:00:27.600> to<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.840> plan<00:00:28.590> things<00:00:28.860> out

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
what we have to do is plan things out

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.890 
what we have to do is plan things out
like<00:00:29.220> anything<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:30.330> always<00:00:30.510> good<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.690> have<00:00:30.840> a

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
like anything it's always good to have a

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.779 
like anything it's always good to have a
good<00:00:31.170> plan<00:00:31.350> so<00:00:31.650> what<00:00:31.800> I've<00:00:31.859> done<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.340> made<00:00:32.579> a

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:32.789 
good plan so what I've done is I made a

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:36.440 
good plan so what I've done is I made a
little<00:00:33.420> sketch<00:00:33.690> up<00:00:33.899> here<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.970> the<00:00:35.970> three<00:00:36.239> view

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
little sketch up here of the three view

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.049 
little sketch up here of the three view
of<00:00:36.720> the<00:00:36.960> aircraft<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.770> I'm<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.850> do<00:00:38.940> is

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
of the aircraft and I'm going to do is

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.819 
of the aircraft and I'm going to do is
I'm<00:00:39.210> going<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.390> have<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.720> plot<00:00:40.110> out<00:00:40.350> where<00:00:40.649> i'm

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
I'm going to have to plot out where i'm

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.100 
I'm going to have to plot out where i'm
going<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.070> put<00:00:41.300> microphones<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.809> stuff<00:00:42.899> like

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
going to put microphones and stuff like

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.830 
going to put microphones and stuff like
that<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:44.640> will<00:00:44.850> help<00:00:44.970> me<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.690> will

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
that so this will help me and it will

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.979 
that so this will help me and it will
give<00:00:45.989> me<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> nice<00:00:46.890> little<00:00:47.070> equipment<00:00:47.370> list<00:00:47.989> so

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
give me a nice little equipment list so

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.650 
give me a nice little equipment list so
I<00:00:49.020> just<00:00:49.350> look<00:00:49.469> at<00:00:49.820> this<00:00:50.820> piece<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.239> paper<00:00:51.360> it's

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
I just look at this piece of paper it's

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.330 
I just look at this piece of paper it's
you<00:00:51.989> know<00:00:52.079> see<00:00:52.350> exactly<00:00:52.590> what<00:00:52.950> it<00:00:53.040> is<00:00:53.160> I'm

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
you know see exactly what it is I'm

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.619 
you know see exactly what it is I'm
taking<00:00:53.700> where<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:53.969> putting<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.360> when<00:00:54.510> i<00:00:54.540> get

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
taking where I putting it when i get

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.160 
taking where I putting it when i get
there<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.110> time<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.770> precious<00:00:57.050> all<00:00:58.050> right

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
there it is time is precious all right

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.660 
there it is time is precious all right
so<00:00:58.350> essentially<00:00:58.829> what<00:00:58.950> we've<00:00:59.100> done<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.489> we've

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
so essentially what we've done is we've

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.049 
so essentially what we've done is we've
just<00:00:59.910> kind<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.149> taken<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.780> couple<00:01:01.200> of<00:01:01.350> diagrams

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
just kind of taken a couple of diagrams

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.160 
just kind of taken a couple of diagrams
specifications<00:01:03.059> from<00:01:03.180> online<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:03.989> is

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
specifications from online so this is

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.570 
specifications from online so this is
the<00:01:04.350> three<00:01:05.070> view<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.940> DA<00:01:06.390> 20<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.460> just<00:01:08.460> got

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
the three view of the DA 20 and just got

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.730 
the three view of the DA 20 and just got
a<00:01:08.610> little<00:01:08.729> bit<00:01:08.940> of<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.090> small<00:01:10.049> list<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.470> Mike's

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
a little bit of a small list of Mike's

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.109 
a little bit of a small list of Mike's
that<00:01:10.890> I'm<00:01:10.979> taking<00:01:11.190> so<00:01:11.490> I'm<00:01:11.580> taking<00:01:11.760> two

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
that I'm taking so I'm taking two

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.840 
that I'm taking so I'm taking two
shotguns<00:01:12.690> one's<00:01:13.020> an<00:01:13.140> audio-technica<00:01:13.470> 12<00:01:14.250> jvc

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
shotguns one's an audio-technica 12 jvc

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.570 
shotguns one's an audio-technica 12 jvc
taking<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.840> PV<00:01:16.320> m520<00:01:16.860> which<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> kick<00:01:17.549> drum

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
taking a PV m520 which is a kick drum

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.060 
taking a PV m520 which is a kick drum
mic<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.299> then<00:01:19.170> I've<00:01:19.290> got<00:01:19.320> two<00:01:19.710> small

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
mic and then I've got two small

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.160 
mic and then I've got two small
diaphragm<00:01:20.400> condensers<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.900> I'm<00:01:21.990> going<00:01:22.110> to

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
diaphragm condensers that I'm going to

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.890 
diaphragm condensers that I'm going to
be<00:01:22.260> using<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.100> sixth<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:24.630> a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
be using and the sixth is going to be a

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.450 
be using and the sixth is going to be a
pressure<00:01:25.770> zone<00:01:26.130> at<00:01:26.369> microphone

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
pressure zone at microphone

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.969 
pressure zone at microphone
so<00:01:29.240> first<00:01:29.540> let's<00:01:29.900> take<00:01:30.080> our<00:01:30.260> shotguns<00:01:30.770> and

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
so first let's take our shotguns and

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.530 
so first let's take our shotguns and
let's<00:01:31.159> figure<00:01:31.640> out<00:01:31.729> where<00:01:32.000> we<00:01:32.090> want<00:01:32.240> to<00:01:32.390> place

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
let's figure out where we want to place

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.539 
let's figure out where we want to place
them<00:01:32.900> now<00:01:33.680> you<00:01:33.740> kind<00:01:33.920> of<00:01:33.950> have<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.130> think<00:01:34.430> ahead

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
them now you kind of have to think ahead

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.420 
them now you kind of have to think ahead
a<00:01:34.729> little<00:01:34.790> bit<00:01:35.770> just<00:01:36.770> trying<00:01:37.040> to<00:01:37.100> think<00:01:37.220> of<00:01:37.400> a

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
a little bit just trying to think of a

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.219 
a little bit just trying to think of a
basically<00:01:37.909> final<00:01:38.360> implementation<00:01:38.510> if<00:01:39.110> you're

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
basically final implementation if you're

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.109 
basically final implementation if you're
to<00:01:39.320> look<00:01:39.470> at<00:01:39.619> this<00:01:39.770> drawing<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:40.369> say<00:01:40.850> if<00:01:40.970> this

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
to look at this drawing and say if this

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.530 
to look at this drawing and say if this
was<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.479> sound<00:01:41.720> cone<00:01:41.990> for<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:42.290> exterior

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
was the sound cone for the exterior

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.820 
was the sound cone for the exterior
probably<00:01:44.540> what<00:01:44.720> I<00:01:44.750> definitely<00:01:45.170> will<00:01:45.380> be<00:01:45.500> doing

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
probably what I definitely will be doing

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.130 
probably what I definitely will be doing
is<00:01:46.040> I<00:01:46.159> will<00:01:46.280> be<00:01:46.430> taking<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:47.450> couple<00:01:48.080> of

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
is I will be taking a couple of

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.540 
is I will be taking a couple of
microphones<00:01:48.409> say<00:01:49.009> four<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:49.909> five<00:01:51.399> those<00:01:52.399> are

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
microphones say four and five those are

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.670 
microphones say four and five those are
the<00:01:52.580> short<00:01:53.060> demo<00:01:53.270> find<00:01:53.600> condensers<00:01:54.200> I'll<00:01:54.409> put

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
the short demo find condensers I'll put

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.520 
the short demo find condensers I'll put
those<00:01:54.830> right<00:01:55.040> there<00:01:55.310> on<00:01:55.759> stands<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:56.509> what<00:01:57.440> I'm

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
those right there on stands and what I'm
