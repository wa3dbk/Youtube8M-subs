800 x 480 but here's an xperia
it's<00:03:49.989> kind<00:03:50.319> of<00:03:50.470> hard<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.739> see<00:03:51.010> here<00:03:51.220> but<00:03:51.280> the

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
it's kind of hard to see here but the

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.180 
it's kind of hard to see here but the
Xperia<00:03:52.090> screen<00:03:52.480> is<00:03:52.690> a<00:03:52.720> lot<00:03:53.050> smaller<00:03:53.530> than<00:03:53.920> the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
Xperia screen is a lot smaller than the

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.990 
Xperia screen is a lot smaller than the
touch<00:03:54.640> pro<00:03:55.180> tues<00:03:55.950> they're<00:03:56.950> about<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.760> same

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
touch pro tues they're about the same

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.449 
touch pro tues they're about the same
thickness<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:59.019> Xperia<00:03:59.500> might<00:03:59.650> be<00:03:59.800> a<00:03:59.830> tiny<00:04:00.190> bit

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
thickness the Xperia might be a tiny bit

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.420 
thickness the Xperia might be a tiny bit
thicker<00:04:00.940> and<00:04:01.709> since<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:02.860> experience<00:04:03.370> a

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
thicker and since the experience a

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.839 
thicker and since the experience a
smaller<00:04:03.730> screen<00:04:04.060> it's<00:04:04.360> not<00:04:04.900> as<00:04:05.140> why<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:06.519> it's

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
smaller screen it's not as why and it's

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.020 
smaller screen it's not as why and it's
shorter<00:04:07.680> but<00:04:08.680> really<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.010> I<00:04:09.459> think<00:04:09.940> the

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
shorter but really the I think the

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.300 
shorter but really the I think the
Xperia<00:04:10.480> is<00:04:10.540> too<00:04:10.750> small<00:04:11.080> for<00:04:11.530> it's<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.980> screen

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
Xperia is too small for it's the screen

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.710 
Xperia is too small for it's the screen
or<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.150> screen<00:04:13.569> is<00:04:13.720> too<00:04:13.900> small<00:04:14.160> now<00:04:15.160> I<00:04:15.580> have<00:04:16.450> a

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
or the screen is too small now I have a

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.560 
or the screen is too small now I have a
Titan<00:04:17.590> to<00:04:17.829> hear<00:04:18.370> it's<00:04:18.790> actually<00:04:18.880> a<00:04:19.090> doe<00:04:19.299> pot

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
Titan to hear it's actually a doe pot

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.450 
Titan to hear it's actually a doe pot
something<00:04:20.079> or<00:04:20.200> other<00:04:20.320> but<00:04:21.330> it's<00:04:22.330> a<00:04:22.690> thicker

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
something or other but it's a thicker

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.940 
something or other but it's a thicker
shorter<00:04:24.460> and<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:26.410> screen<00:04:26.800> is<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:26.979> lot<00:04:27.310> smaller

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
shorter and the screen is a lot smaller

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.450 
shorter and the screen is a lot smaller

almost the same size but it's also lower
resolution<00:05:21.310> it's<00:05:21.610> thinner<00:05:22.060> but<00:05:22.810> of<00:05:22.960> course<00:05:23.169> it

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
resolution it's thinner but of course it

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.920 
resolution it's thinner but of course it
has<00:05:23.530> no<00:05:23.710> keyboard<00:05:23.979> and<00:05:24.520> it's<00:05:25.180> a<00:05:25.270> tiny<00:05:25.570> bit

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
has no keyboard and it's a tiny bit

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.279 
has no keyboard and it's a tiny bit
wider<00:05:26.700> really<00:05:27.700> the<00:05:27.880> touch<00:05:28.210> pro<00:05:28.479> two<00:05:28.600> isn't

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
wider really the touch pro two isn't

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.379 
wider really the touch pro two isn't
that<00:05:29.350> big<00:05:29.889> but<00:05:30.610> it<00:05:30.850> tends<00:05:31.150> to<00:05:31.270> feel<00:05:31.889> big

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
that big but it tends to feel big

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.980 
that big but it tends to feel big
especially<00:05:34.389> when<00:05:34.510> you<00:05:34.630> do<00:05:34.810> that<00:05:35.520> nice<00:05:36.520> so<00:05:37.510> i'm
