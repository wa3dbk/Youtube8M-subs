00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 what we have here is a system of 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.859
 tests that we have armed with a small 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.380
 container then here is a straw 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.810
 anyone and as we see here in there 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.560
 Water 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:18.650
 this is a physical fluid principle until 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.340
 that the liquid is not at this height 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:26.050
 gravity will keep coming out the water me 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.050
 I will try to put this here 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.170
 and if they realize 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.170
 fluid water 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.420
 rise up to this height here we are 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.980
 you can notice and you can take the camera 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.840
 but if they see I'm going to leave the mark 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.890
 he wants my finger to work and they realize 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.800
 which is practically the same as 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.840
 the fluid is at the same height as 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.970
 this fluid then 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.970
 it happens by gravity now 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.040
 I'm going to this moment mind 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.200
 this is here is a representation of 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.150
 something that we imagine we think that we 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.900
 it could be used to calculate 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.900
 indirectly 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.100
 this is a balloon assuming that the gas 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.890
 enter here 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.200
 we are going to put this 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.780
 let's do a pretty test 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.780
 simple I'm going to press here with force 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.119
 and if this were hermetically 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.770
 sealed as we can realize by 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.619
 here at some point you have to start 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.899
 to come out the liquid so we think 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.220
 that this system does not work and well this 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.530
 it's a small test a demonstration 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.470
 of what we think is going to 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.009
 to serve like this is that we're going to continue with 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.009
 the project itself
