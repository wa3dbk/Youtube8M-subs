00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 good luck and welcome to 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.279
 the editorial brings ex i'm the one 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.290
 Professor and I are happy again 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.450
 that he turned on in this 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.009
 Following, I'll show you how to do such a thing 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.940
 iron man or so iron man statue builds 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.920
 this city ​​we already have in 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.869
 our video about the castle ysl stone 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.990
 presented and I wanted you now 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.730
 just show how it is built 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.340
 what do you need so we need it 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.970
 a cobblestone wall a fence 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:35.190
 a funnel a trapdoor one 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.680
 donor the donor of the power behind 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.790
 this face stop there you have to look 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.160
 if you use other tecdax which 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.710
 blog fits in the normal texture 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.969
 pack is that too a face but at 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.890
 Some are not necessarily one 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.420
 You have to face it somehow 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.230
 Pay attention that a bit 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.320
 Facially over comes next 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.699
 we need an anvil a boiler 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:05.519
 one day light sensor, everyone is fine too 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.729
 other half or every other half blog 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.460
 but I think the taxis sensor is better 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.610
 find that the forms behind 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.619
 the crown as well as the shield or 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.600
 the signs on the side of it 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.479
 but come later 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.650
 we start with the anvil we sit 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.650
 just an ambush here 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.340
 and then on it comes a kettle now 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.320
 you wonder why a kettle why 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.760
 not a normal blog i can tell you 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.610
 that show here at the already 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.630
 finished statue of this boiler connects 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.980
 Do not mess with the cable stone wall 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.560
 So the food steinbauer connects 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.970
 not with the kettle and that is 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.640
 that's why we can do it that way 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.600
 arms do not build with the body 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.640
 connect again 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.010
 the block is the case you can 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.960
 here, too, take every other block of the 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.320
 this has the same characteristics 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.660
 I think glass otherwise I know too 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.880
 do not believe and maybe yes me 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.160
 use these traveling kettles because that is 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.200
 yes, an iron man on top of this 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.300
 tickling comes then again an anvil 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:18.520
 on it and then comes ours 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:21.730
 face so the donor in the case like that 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:28.080
 then on the dispenser comes 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:32.220
 day light sensor where right 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.600
 and on the left a sign that comes 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.900
 looks a bit like that 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.620
 wikinger helmet or no idea what 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.760
 So a little bit full of the helmet 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:47.310
 right now the poor are missing 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.220
 first placed a blog here 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.690
 under it and judge why am I doing 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.690
 this and there want to leave ours again 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.610
 tree suddenly not directly the funnel 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.060
 It's easy on you have it 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.010
 seen 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.110
 this little use here then goes 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.710
 to the right but must go down 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:09.780
 show because otherwise our arm floats in 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:11.130
 We do not want that on the air 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.600
 page is the correct you can 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.370
 Of course, here is this cable 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.720
 dams first and place 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.270
 then the funnel it looks 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.730
 We'll be fine 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.390
 here to support the shoulder 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.670
 we'll place this one here 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.160
 fall on it shoulder pad or 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.840
 shoulder armor no idea what that 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.300
 is 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.160
 since then because so here with the 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.569
 Tritten rhein can see and sees that 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.810
 the poor are hollow 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.810
 Yes 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.130
 then we place here on the right 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.600
 partly also on the left side 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.780
 page if that is a left-hander yes 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.790
 then we'll just place one more 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.600
 paving stone wall and above and 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.940
 under it comes wooden fence and 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.610
 Now you can do this in principle 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:13.610
 what you want 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:20.720
 whole dispute hermann small big dispute 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:23.680
 hammer a banner I know that one 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.680
 make banner 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:33.850
 this wool 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:36.510
 no idea are both train on the 8 banner 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.510
 created 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.600
 this looks remain all stupid out well 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.410
 So we have the dispute hammer I have 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:53.020
 shield removed 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:58.750
 Well that's what you have to do now 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:00.990
 Thinking about it I'll just do it that way 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.420
 There are also different types of these 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:09.340
 You can, for example, be iron men 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:16.240
 you either a colored carpet 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:18.370
 choose the color of the stages like the 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.800
 castle or have no idea what 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:28.450
 and place the things here on 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:31.600
 So that's a bit more colorful 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.200
 even good ones are these golden ones 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.200
 plates 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:39.219
 there 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:51.919
 I also had it once before 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:51.919
 sure skeletons heads used that way 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.220
 just as beautiful or now 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.580
 just seen how about a bit 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.610
 crooked 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.300
 that will look good too i can 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.300
 to promt so 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.160
 Yes 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.440
 then I'll do this away if yours 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.979
 iron one should only stand on the wall 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.630
 and no sword or such a hammer or 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:22.130
 to have a lance in your hand 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.960
 then you can just do this 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.460
 place wooden fences 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.870
 it looks okay so well 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.569
 We had done that too 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.880
 he pulls that a bit puny out there 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:34.590
 is he here with his big hand? 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.289
 of course, in the fight hammer a bit 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.639
 imposing but well there is just 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:39.690
 different forms here 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.180
 can use 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:46.560
 Choose this one I hope you have 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:48.020
 this little tutorial please because of that 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.919
 was nothing special now 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.970
 Maybe that has the one or the other 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:54.419
 helped others 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:56.750
 and if so then the video rated 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:07:00.569
 quiet and leave comments too 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:03.900
 so that we know how we will be in the future 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:07.550
 I should also say good bye 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.550
 me until then
