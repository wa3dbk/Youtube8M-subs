 1 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.009
 realistic forecasts yes 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.349
 and no more 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.209
 fabulous company on the roadmaps it registers a logic that this campaign 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.480
 that we filed a competition with the 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.360
 proposal 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.730
 teams without the winner of the stage of the competition 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.090
 this new campaign 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.700
 he inaugurates a new market segment and he grows it in the text 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.970
 naturis became a flag 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.100
 of beauty 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.690
 within the battle the differential of the campaign that is quite focused 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.800
 a woman 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.170
 a campaign resumes and with a woman she arrives quite tired of a day of 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.239
 work action 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.010
 next to the governor 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.030
 then the first sip with the first-hand interventions that the 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.069
 From that moment on, we begin to see with their characters that come 

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:00.069
 take care of it in this environment and 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.100
 thoughts to the characters of the show 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.720
 The good she actors does to this woman they represent the debt is 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.730
 around three days 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.770
 ef 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.770
 to carlos marta playing a mineira music 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.970
 I saw closely the choice of the actors was that they took the characters visually 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.240
 interesting 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.520
 but without sparing the prediction of what will happen in the village are Francis in the 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.820
 state of florida 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.820
 reason why it was already defined that only after we finalized his plans 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.710
 are from caricature people who made beautiful images 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.770
 entertainment force 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.580
 the nature hull we feel they have campaigned 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.260
 exactly three times a week we see in the media 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.370
 I was able to make a rather unusual proposal for the campaign 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.120
 remember that the case requires a lot of team dedication 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.039
 if each 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.190
 he has a super specific situation 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.440
 on account of all 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.440
 all the traquitanas on account of which five people in scene during the greater 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.530
 part of the movie 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.080
 We need to see what we've become, just to change the refrigerator. 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.049
 with false bottom 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.860
 needed a solution 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.230
 if yes exit them from the refrigerator you will parts you fast 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.410
 so I thought dragging them through an excellent piece this 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.410
 result the mix is ​​fun as hell 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:34.269
 the action on twitter that I think is really cool is an action that oab explores 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.529
 exactly what will become of them 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:39.639
 you will generate an account in the name of stability at 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.140
 facebook will give you tips of establishments 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.739
 of leisure offering a series of facility aware of this universe 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.170
 who is talking said to take care of the bbc that is much faster than if 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.640
 thinks
