00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:34.899 
pentascale that we're going to play for

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.069 
pentascale that we're going to play for
this<00:00:35.109> exercise<00:00:35.649> so<00:00:36.399> beginning<00:00:37.210> on<00:00:37.449> C<00:00:37.780> we're

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
this exercise so beginning on C we're

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.389 
this exercise so beginning on C we're
going<00:00:38.199> to<00:00:38.260> march<00:00:38.440> up<00:00:38.679> the<00:00:38.710> notes<00:00:38.980> and<00:00:39.309> then

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
going to march up the notes and then

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:40.590 
going to march up the notes and then
we're<00:00:39.489> going<00:00:39.579> to<00:00:39.670> march<00:00:39.850> back<00:00:40.120> down<00:00:40.390> them

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
we're going to march back down them

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.079 
we're going to march back down them
again<00:00:40.839> so<00:00:41.350> let's<00:00:41.530> turn<00:00:41.679> our<00:00:41.829> attention<00:00:42.370> to<00:00:42.399> the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.089 
again so let's turn our attention to the

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:45.029 
again so let's turn our attention to the
written<00:00:43.510> music<00:00:43.629> for<00:00:43.899> less<00:00:44.140> than<00:00:44.289> 13<00:00:44.710> and

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 
written music for less than 13 and

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.309 
written music for less than 13 and
keeping<00:00:45.909> a<00:00:45.999> steady<00:00:46.179> beat<00:00:46.510> let's<00:00:46.809> play<00:00:47.050> along

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:47.319 
keeping a steady beat let's play along

00:00:47.319 --> 00:01:10.469 
keeping a steady beat let's play along
together<00:00:47.760> ready<00:00:48.760> go<00:01:07.530> C<00:01:08.530> space<00:01:09.280> space<00:01:10.060> space

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
together ready go C space space space

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.399 
together ready go C space space space
space<00:01:11.369> hold<00:01:12.369> try

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
space hold try

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.649 
space hold try
all<00:01:15.369> right<00:01:15.490> let's<00:01:15.670> get<00:01:15.820> special<00:01:16.240> attention<00:01:16.509> to

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
all right let's get special attention to

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.080 
all right let's get special attention to
those<00:01:16.869> last<00:01:17.200> two<00:01:17.500> measures<00:01:17.680> of<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.549> exercise

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
those last two measures of the exercise

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.050 
those last two measures of the exercise
where<00:01:19.659> we're<00:01:19.840> playing<00:01:20.079> see<00:01:20.560> space<00:01:21.340> space

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
where we're playing see space space

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.649 
where we're playing see space space
space<00:01:22.450> space<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:24.490> all<00:01:24.700> of<00:01:24.850> these<00:01:24.970> notes<00:01:25.329> are<00:01:25.630> a

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
space space so all of these notes are a

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.380 
space space so all of these notes are a
skip<00:01:26.110> away<00:01:26.229> from<00:01:26.380> each<00:01:26.770> other<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:27.360> we<00:01:28.360> can

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
skip away from each other and we can

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.450 
skip away from each other and we can
tell<00:01:28.750> that<00:01:28.780> they<00:01:29.079> are<00:01:29.229> because<00:01:29.679> the<00:01:30.159> line

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
tell that they are because the line

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.190 
tell that they are because the line
notes<00:01:30.729> are<00:01:30.880> missing<00:01:31.210> and<00:01:31.450> we're<00:01:31.630> not<00:01:31.869> playing

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
notes are missing and we're not playing

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.740 
notes are missing and we're not playing
the<00:01:32.409> line<00:01:32.619> notes<00:01:32.890> so<00:01:33.429> this<00:01:33.670> is<00:01:33.850> called<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.210> triad

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
the line notes so this is called a triad

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.010 
the line notes so this is called a triad
when<00:01:35.289> we<00:01:35.380> play<00:01:35.619> it<00:01:35.740> together<00:01:36.179> and<00:01:37.179> a<00:01:37.299> triad<00:01:37.689> is

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
when we play it together and a triad is

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.319 
when we play it together and a triad is
just<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.560> series<00:01:38.979> of<00:01:39.009> three<00:01:39.579> notes<00:01:39.789> that<00:01:39.970> skip

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
just a series of three notes that skip

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:41.880 
just a series of three notes that skip
up<00:01:40.479> and<00:01:40.600> you<00:01:40.659> can<00:01:40.780> hear<00:01:40.929> the<00:01:41.020> word<00:01:41.170> try<00:01:41.500> there

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
up and you can hear the word try there

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.590 
up and you can hear the word try there
that's<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.280> prefix<00:01:42.700> for<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:42.970> number<00:01:43.210> three

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
that's the prefix for the number three

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.380 
that's the prefix for the number three
the<00:01:44.140> pentascale<00:01:45.069> used<00:01:45.369> all<00:01:45.490> five<00:01:45.759> notes<00:01:46.000> the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
the pentascale used all five notes the

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.380 
the pentascale used all five notes the
triad<00:01:47.110> only<00:01:47.560> uses<00:01:47.950> three<00:01:47.979> of<00:01:48.549> those<00:01:48.789> notes<00:01:49.060> so

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
triad only uses three of those notes so

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.050 
triad only uses three of those notes so
at<00:01:49.929> the<00:01:50.080> end<00:01:50.200> again<00:01:50.439> we<00:01:50.770> have<00:01:51.009> C<00:01:52.170> G<00:01:53.170> means<00:01:53.920> C<00:01:54.640> and

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
at the end again we have C G means C and

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.949 
at the end again we have C G means C and
then<00:01:55.420> all<00:01:56.380> three<00:01:57.390> that's<00:01:58.390> a<00:01:58.450> little<00:01:58.659> tricky

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959 
then all three that's a little tricky

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:00.630 
then all three that's a little tricky
and<00:01:59.170> you<00:01:59.259> might<00:01:59.470> have<00:01:59.619> to<00:01:59.709> practice<00:02:00.130> an<00:02:00.220> extra

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
and you might have to practice an extra

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.580 
and you might have to practice an extra
but<00:02:01.060> work<00:02:01.209> on<00:02:01.360> this<00:02:01.569> until<00:02:01.959> you<00:02:02.140> can<00:02:02.170> play<00:02:02.409> it

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
but work on this until you can play it

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.149 
but work on this until you can play it
steadily<00:02:03.069> and<00:02:03.250> without<00:02:04.179> hesitation<00:02:05.140> I<00:02:05.530> also

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
steadily and without hesitation I also
