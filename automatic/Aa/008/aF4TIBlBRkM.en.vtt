00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.269
 and so hello to you all again me and we 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.660
 shoot a new mechanism 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.429
 idle crunchy and today in release i 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.410
 lived mechanism 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:22.789
 the first one is one improved 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.330
 dynamite gun which did not think myself 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.890
 honestly but this is considered wikipedia 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.050
 Sandu hair that I honestly say 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.219
 let's see this is our first 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:41.790
 mechanism how it works 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:46.020
 take the world launch button and here's the car 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.780
 mass destruction for this organism 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.579
 let's see the second at the end show 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.850
 how is he all passion and let's but all 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.199
 thoughts make a billion bomb 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:03.180
 any absolutely anyone let's bring 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.670
 zones and an example of a zombie goes goes and for 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.820
 makita like in general can not, well, in short 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.619
 pokes zombie goes goes 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:16.760
 bypass does not intend to change and neambe 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.760
 well let's color zombies goes goes goes 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:50.250
 how to make a gun 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:58.369
 mass destruction and expose all 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.369
 blocks two times three 4 5 now we take 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:28.820
 must necessarily perform now 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:28.820
 now we need let's now hold 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:55.070
 it was impossible to puncture until the middle and and 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:14.940
 let's make curls just 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:29.100
 affix and 1 more 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:31.760
 and just keep it like this 2 and 3 and then 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.319
 one needs to be repeated or 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:41.250
 repeat repeaters should become on 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:52.620
 maximum delay the guy and again 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:59.250
 right and now we put here and here and here and 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:12.180
 the middle can not be filled here and 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:25.050
 again in the middle do and now not 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:36.409
 falls and is not very easy and it can be 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:05:08.820
 make and how is it to mine 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:05:17.070
 so also sticky pistons hope sticky 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:23.180
 Pistons and take and do not need a fence 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:23.180
 and although you can take the depth 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:40.380
 so let's see that she 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:43.990
 can go in response our tracks will do 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:48.070
 what's next to each country 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.850
 makes this coffee shop and a fashion house but you 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.090
 could 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:54.640
 supposedly shorter becomes this button here 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.360
 so preoccupied anymore i'm generally there 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:03.850
 does not believe and you can give different 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:11.860
 even just to mine and all well and 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:19.650
 such mechanisms are very high you found 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:19.650
 yourself metals went well choose yourself
