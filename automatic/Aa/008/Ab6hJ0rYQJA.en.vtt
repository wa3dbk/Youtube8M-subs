figure is actually really really cool so

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.760 
figure is actually really really cool so
we'll<00:00:52.739> come<00:00:52.980> get<00:00:53.550> come<00:00:54.090> up<00:00:54.239> here<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.809> kind<00:00:55.710> of

we'll come get come up here and kind of

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.040 
we'll come get come up here and kind of
disconnect<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.360> then<00:00:57.930> this

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
disconnect it like that and then this

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.910 
disconnect it like that and then this
whole<00:00:58.379> rear<00:00:58.980> section<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.120> cab<00:01:00.680> folds<00:01:01.680> back

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
on to the rear of the vehicle which then

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.480 
on to the rear of the vehicle which then
will<00:01:04.559> allow<00:01:04.890> us<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.479> according<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:07.470> rear<00:01:08.460> of

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
will allow us to according the rear of

I<00:01:52.259> guess<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.369> could<00:01:53.520> just<00:01:53.549> paint<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.149> but<00:01:54.420> it's

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
I guess I could just paint that but it's

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.300 
I guess I could just paint that but it's
not<00:01:55.380> really<00:01:55.619> worth<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.979> don't<00:01:56.100> know<00:01:56.159> why

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
not really worth it I don't know why

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.740 
not really worth it I don't know why
it's<00:01:56.460> blue<00:01:57.710> poseability<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.189> guy<00:01:59.340> is

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
it's blue poseability on this guy is

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.039 
it's blue poseability on this guy is
surprisingly<00:02:00.750> good<00:02:01.369> head<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.729> on<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.420> swivel

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
surprisingly good head is on a swivel

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.260 
surprisingly good head is on a swivel
joint<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:05.310> really<00:02:05.490> can't<00:02:05.790> move<00:02:05.939> side<00:02:06.240> to

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
joint and it really can't move side to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.779 
joint and it really can't move side to
side<00:02:06.649> shoulder<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:07.979> swivel<00:02:08.310> joint<00:02:08.580> that

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
side shoulder is on a swivel joint that

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.880 
side shoulder is on a swivel joint that
has<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.940> ball<00:02:09.239> joint<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.780> at<00:02:10.200> for<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.500> actual

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
has a ball joint in at for the actual

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.200 
has a ball joint in at for the actual
shoulder<00:02:11.190> then

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
shoulder then

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.510 
shoulder then
a<00:02:12.240> slider<00:02:13.230> joint<00:02:13.590> with<00:02:13.770> another<00:02:14.010> ball<00:02:14.220> joint

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
a slider joint with another ball joint

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.250 
a slider joint with another ball joint
for<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:14.880> double<00:02:15.270> elbow<00:02:17.060> legs<00:02:18.060> our<00:02:18.360> hips<00:02:18.960> are<00:02:19.140> on

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
for a double elbow legs our hips are on

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.140 
for a double elbow legs our hips are on
a<00:02:19.290> ball<00:02:19.500> joint<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:19.890> then<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.820> have<00:02:20.970> another

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
a ball joint and then you have another

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.050 
a ball joint and then you have another
sliding<00:02:21.570> joint<00:02:22.530> here<00:02:22.860> for<00:02:23.100> 90<00:02:23.400> degree<00:02:23.670> bends

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
sliding joint here for 90 degree bends

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.590 
sliding joint here for 90 degree bends
so<00:02:24.990> you<00:02:25.860> can<00:02:26.160> actually<00:02:26.580> get<00:02:27.150> some<00:02:27.420> decent

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
so you can actually get some decent

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.380 
so you can actually get some decent
poses<00:02:28.200> out<00:02:28.320> of<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:28.560> guy<00:02:28.740> it's<00:02:29.610> very<00:02:30.120> very

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
poses out of this guy it's very very

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.690 
poses out of this guy it's very very
cool<00:02:30.680> so<00:02:31.680> we're<00:02:31.920> going<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.100> take<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.340> look<00:02:32.550> at

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
cool so we're going to take a look at

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.700 
cool so we're going to take a look at
the<00:02:32.850> trailer<00:02:33.300> hitch<00:02:33.690> or<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.140> trailer<00:02:34.380> part

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
the trailer hitch or the trailer part

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.150 
the trailer hitch or the trailer part
now<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.100> this<00:02:35.760> is<00:02:36.450> equally<00:02:36.780> pretty<00:02:37.080> neat<00:02:37.260> this

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
now and this is equally pretty neat this

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.940 
now and this is equally pretty neat this
is<00:02:38.220> very<00:02:38.640> reminiscent<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.570> a<00:02:39.710> scourge<00:02:40.710> or

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
is very reminiscent of a scourge or

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.670 
is very reminiscent of a scourge or
black<00:02:41.190> convoy<00:02:41.610> from<00:02:41.790> Robots<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.270> Disguise<00:02:42.680> so

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
black convoy from Robots in Disguise so

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.380 
black convoy from Robots in Disguise so
what<00:02:43.800> we're<00:02:43.890> going<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.040> do<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.370> come<00:02:44.910> back<00:02:45.030> here

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
what we're going to do is come back here

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.570 
what we're going to do is come back here
to<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.690> rear<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.230> just<00:02:46.620> lift<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:46.920> up<00:02:47.070> and

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
to the rear and just lift that up and

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.120 
to the rear and just lift that up and
fold<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.270> out<00:02:48.360> like<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.890> then<00:02:50.040> we'll

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
fold it out like that and then we'll

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.160 
fold it out like that and then we'll
come<00:02:50.310> under<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.790> bottom<00:02:51.240> and<00:02:51.450> there<00:02:51.660> is<00:02:51.930> a

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
come under to the bottom and there is a

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.020 
come under to the bottom and there is a
little<00:02:52.500> where<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.310> trailer<00:02:53.670> hitch<00:02:53.850> is

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
little where the trailer hitch is

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.180 
little where the trailer hitch is
there's<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.420> hinge<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:55.140> allows<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.010> pull

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
there's a hinge that allows you to pull

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.260 
there's a hinge that allows you to pull
out<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.370> stabilizer<00:02:58.790> flip<00:02:59.790> out

the inset in the middle section there

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.350 
the inset in the middle section there
rotate<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.960> around<00:03:04.790> rotate<00:03:05.790> those<00:03:06.150> halves

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
rotate it around rotate those halves

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.570 
rotate it around rotate those halves
around<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.080> wheels<00:03:07.260> are<00:03:07.530> pointing<00:03:07.830> up<00:03:07.980> and

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
around so the wheels are pointing up and

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.390 
around so the wheels are pointing up and
then<00:03:09.060> come<00:03:09.660> back<00:03:09.840> here<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:10.500> deploy<00:03:10.980> some

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
then come back here and deploy some

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.400 
then come back here and deploy some

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
this guy can combine with Megatron and

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.480 
this guy can combine with Megatron and
it's<00:03:56.760> just<00:03:57.690> it's<00:03:57.960> really<00:03:58.590> kind<00:03:59.190> of<00:03:59.310> pathetic

ly<00:04:00.270> simple<00:04:00.810> honestly<00:04:01.440> so<00:04:02.130> what<00:04:02.250> we'll<00:04:02.370> do<00:04:02.520> is

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
ly simple honestly so what we'll do is

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.550 
ly simple honestly so what we'll do is
we'll<00:04:02.970> rotate<00:04:03.390> it<00:04:03.510> so<00:04:03.660> that<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.900> wheels<00:04:04.170> are

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
we'll rotate it so that the wheels are

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.170 
we'll rotate it so that the wheels are
pointing<00:04:05.370> forward

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
pointing forward

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.790 
pointing forward

bit of a kibble bit back here but that

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.469 
bit of a kibble bit back here but that
it's<00:04:53.050> kind<00:04:53.410> of<00:04:53.590> hard<00:04:54.010> to<00:04:54.070> avoid<00:04:54.520> considering

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479
