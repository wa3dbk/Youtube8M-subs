the sphere and 30,000 acre district it's
been<00:01:59.880> about<00:02:00.330> eight<00:02:00.720> years<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.260> making<00:02:01.470> and

been about eight years in the making and

there's no proven means of restoring

there's no proven means of restoring
aspen<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.490> that<00:03:25.670> area<00:03:25.880> so<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:27.320> existing

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
aspen to that area so the existing

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.800 
aspen to that area so the existing
amount<00:03:28.250> of<00:03:28.430> aspen<00:03:28.820> we<00:03:28.970> have<00:03:29.120> on<00:03:29.300> the<00:03:29.420> landscape

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
amount of aspen we have on the landscape

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.860 
amount of aspen we have on the landscape
is<00:03:29.960> basically<00:03:30.380> all<00:03:30.500> we're<00:03:30.650> going<00:03:30.770> to<00:03:30.830> have

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.440 

so<00:03:34.440> our<00:03:34.560> approach<00:03:34.739> is<00:03:35.099> to<00:03:35.519> remove<00:03:35.819> confers

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
so our approach is to remove confers

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.539 
so our approach is to remove confers
with<00:03:36.480> in<00:03:36.930> an<00:03:37.110> adjacent<00:03:37.409> to<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.920> aspen<00:03:38.280> stands

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
with in an adjacent to the aspen stands

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.410 
with in an adjacent to the aspen stands
and<00:03:39.390> we<00:03:39.780> typically<00:03:40.260> will<00:03:40.580> remove<00:03:41.580> conference

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
and we typically will remove conference

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.750 
and we typically will remove conference

the purchaser whoever buys the material
they<00:03:52.560> have<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.829> remove<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.159> small<00:03:53.549> logs<00:03:53.849> and

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
they have to remove the small logs and

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.780 
they have to remove the small logs and

the biomass in the same operation so

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.430 
the biomass in the same operation so
what<00:03:56.970> happens<00:03:57.360> is<00:03:57.450> we<00:03:57.569> have<00:03:57.690> one<00:03:57.900> entry<00:03:58.230> into

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
what happens is we have one entry into

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.979 
what happens is we have one entry into
the<00:03:58.560> stand<00:03:58.890> so<00:03:59.519> soil<00:03:59.819> compaction<00:04:00.269> is<00:04:00.540> limited

the stand so soil compaction is limited
so<00:04:01.290> that<00:04:01.560> we<00:04:01.650> don't<00:04:01.769> have<00:04:01.890> damage<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:02.400> the

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
use chips to produce the power one load

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.339 
use chips to produce the power one load

force will supply enough power for
approximately<00:04:52.050> an<00:04:52.110> hour<00:04:52.260> to<00:04:52.650> 10,000<00:04:53.460> homes<00:04:53.550> so

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
approximately an hour to 10,000 homes so

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.000 
approximately an hour to 10,000 homes so
we're<00:04:54.599> helping<00:04:54.930> to<00:04:55.139> improve<00:04:55.560> the<00:04:55.770> force

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
we're helping to improve the force

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.710 
we're helping to improve the force
health<00:04:56.310> and<00:04:56.550> we're<00:04:56.669> also<00:04:56.820> producing<00:04:57.450> green

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
health and we're also producing green

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.379 
health and we're also producing green
power<00:04:57.960> so<00:04:58.889> it's<00:04:59.039> a<00:04:59.099> win-win<00:04:59.280> situation<00:05:00.090> for<00:05:00.120> us

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
power so it's a win-win situation for us

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.000 
power so it's a win-win situation for us
aspen<00:05:03.389> management<00:05:04.050> really<00:05:04.470> isn't<00:05:04.770> about<00:05:04.949> a

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
aspen management really isn't about a

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.680 
aspen management really isn't about a
tree<00:05:05.340> it's<00:05:06.180> about<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.419> habitat<00:05:08.389> we<00:05:09.389> really<00:05:09.570> have

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
tree it's about a habitat we really have

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.210 
tree it's about a habitat we really have
to<00:05:09.720> think<00:05:09.930> about<00:05:10.020> how<00:05:10.229> we<00:05:10.260> manage<00:05:10.680> across<00:05:10.979> all

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
to think about how we manage across all

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.550 
to think about how we manage across all
the<00:05:11.940> forests<00:05:12.330> all<00:05:12.570> these<00:05:12.960> different<00:05:13.139> habitat

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
the forests all these different habitat

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.020 
the forests all these different habitat
types<00:05:13.590> and<00:05:14.070> ask<00:05:14.220> them<00:05:14.430> being<00:05:14.699> one<00:05:14.729> of<00:05:14.880> the<00:05:15.000> most

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
types and ask them being one of the most

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.670 
types and ask them being one of the most
important<00:05:15.570> ones<00:05:15.720> we<00:05:15.900> know<00:05:16.050> we've<00:05:16.199> lost<00:05:16.410> most

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
important ones we know we've lost most

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.409 
important ones we know we've lost most
of<00:05:16.830> it<00:05:16.979> we<00:05:17.340> live<00:05:17.490> in<00:05:17.520> a<00:05:17.639> conifer<00:05:18.000> see<00:05:18.180> up<00:05:18.389> here

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
of it we live in a conifer see up here

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.230 
of it we live in a conifer see up here
and<00:05:19.380> so<00:05:19.860> these<00:05:19.979> unique<00:05:20.340> habitats<00:05:20.789> are<00:05:21.000> really

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
and so these unique habitats are really

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.400 
and so these unique habitats are really
a<00:05:21.270> disproportionately<00:05:21.900> important<00:05:22.320> to

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
a disproportionately important to

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.080 
a disproportionately important to
wildlife<00:05:22.800> and<00:05:23.010> there's<00:05:23.160> such<00:05:23.280> a<00:05:23.310> small<00:05:23.699> part

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
wildlife and there's such a small part

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.450 
wildlife and there's such a small part
of<00:05:24.150> our<00:05:24.270> landscape<00:05:24.979> that's<00:05:25.979> really<00:05:26.250> where<00:05:26.370> we

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
of our landscape that's really where we

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.800 
of our landscape that's really where we
want<00:05:26.639> to<00:05:26.699> pinpoint<00:05:27.180> our<00:05:27.270> conservation

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
want to pinpoint our conservation

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
all the herbaceous material produced

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.500 
all the herbaceous material produced
provides<00:05:34.440> feed<00:05:34.889> for<00:05:35.340> hundreds<00:05:35.940> of<00:05:36.090> bugs<00:05:36.360> and

provides feed for hundreds of bugs and

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.920 
provides feed for hundreds of bugs and
insects<00:05:36.990> it's<00:05:37.590> like<00:05:37.770> a<00:05:37.800> big<00:05:38.010> lunch<00:05:38.250> counter

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.600 
insects it's like a big lunch counter
it's<00:05:39.930> probably<00:05:40.320> the<00:05:40.650> most<00:05:40.860> diverse<00:05:41.160> habitat

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
it's probably the most diverse habitat

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.969 
it's probably the most diverse habitat

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
look at is how that system functions

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.260 
look at is how that system functions
more<00:06:18.870> than<00:06:19.169> just<00:06:19.440> a<00:06:19.650> meadow<00:06:19.889> or<00:06:20.039> just<00:06:20.520> some
