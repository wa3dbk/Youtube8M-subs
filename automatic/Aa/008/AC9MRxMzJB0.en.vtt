 from here thank you to the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.330
 fascinating for 97 I do not know why but 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.800
 Well I put this game after 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.450
 that has uploaded the video and good those that 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.979
 come from your channel you will know that 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.510
 he buys a chair and now he gets 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.490
 some reading it by teams that flip 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.810
 Well, I think that is your channel, no, 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.479
 the chair because mother had put me 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.610
 play after his promotion went out 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.709
 this game that the truth after a month 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.459
 without playing I think nothing is nothing 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.840
 bad because a month without playing 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.970
 I think it will cost you to play again 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.380
 but good that I'm rolling like 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.550
 expression so I want to tell you too 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.739
 a couple of little things before I finish 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.120
 the video other than what you already 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.100
 commented that tomorrow you have to have the 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.530
 important video that good then I want 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.209
 tell you that most will start the 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.040
 next week I believe the course of the 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.470
 that bachelor voucher without that in which 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.890
 you will be everyone but I guess I guess 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.320
 you will have that faith of the majority so I 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.840
 I want to tell you that this week I start 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.640
 the university or information about 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.750
 us at the age that we have that what 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.920
 we will do in a video of questions and 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.510
 answers that I suppose there will be 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.430
 do it for all the many writers 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.600
 not for you to know something more about 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.580

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.900
 Well, we leave that video for more 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.490

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.440
 try to keep pace with the channel 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.850
 that is clear because we are very 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.680
 happy with our subscribers 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.120
 the subscribers which have been 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.180
 during these three weeks watching the 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.110
 videos explain how trying 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.940
 contact us so that 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.180
 we explain not because we upload videos 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.040
 and so and well then that we are here of 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.270
 back with this this game that I 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.920
 would record live and the grace is that 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.870
 more than still very beautiful because it is 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.610
 I tried to concentrate comment on everything 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.800
 that I think I am commenting now 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.170
 but in life you believe or it does not cost much 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.840
 comment on life and do if this killing 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.120
 not what I do and to finish the video 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.100
 how to tell us is the document no longer 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.570
 but good as me a long time without 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.510
 comment I do not even know what I 'm 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.870
 saying but good the one that now you want 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.460
 kids that we will raise during the course 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.200
 the videos are now reserved for 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.430
 September October so we're all going to 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.110
 be in class not that or we left 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.760
 all of the school but I think the 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.830
 best time to upload it is four o'clock or 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.390
 five p.m. as most do 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.850
 from the youtubers and well I think that 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.780
 it's going to come in handy for everyone so 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.280
 good me 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.370

 Now you want the videos and we're good 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.560
 more attentive to each because the truth is 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.569

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.300

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.900
 very big neither the last time and nothing 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.940
 to tell them we say goodbye how we 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.280

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.570

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.030
