00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
matter how they're made by hand but you

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.080 
matter how they're made by hand but you
know<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.660> a<00:01:06.720> factory<00:01:07.229> mostly<00:01:07.830> by<00:01:07.950> hand<00:01:08.100> they're

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090
