what<00:03:30.209> type<00:03:30.390> of<00:03:30.540> plant<00:03:30.750> would<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.049> suggest

what type of plant would you suggest

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.729 
what type of plant would you suggest
look<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.519> star<00:03:33.090> jasmine<00:03:33.390> is<00:03:33.900> probably<00:03:34.500> the

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
look the star jasmine is probably the

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.920 
look the star jasmine is probably the
most<00:03:34.860> versatile<00:03:35.519> okay<00:03:36.060> it's<00:03:36.390> it's<00:03:36.870> very

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
most versatile okay it's it's very

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.680 
most versatile okay it's it's very
easygoing<00:03:37.560> it's<00:03:38.250> quite<00:03:38.850> drought<00:03:39.150> resistant

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
easygoing it's quite drought resistant

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.370 
easygoing it's quite drought resistant
it<00:03:39.840> can<00:03:40.019> grow<00:03:40.200> in<00:03:40.350> full<00:03:40.530> Sun<00:03:40.590> or<00:03:41.190> semi<00:03:41.549> shade<00:03:42.380> it

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
it can grow in full Sun or semi shade it

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.840 
it can grow in full Sun or semi shade it
climbs<00:03:43.709> on<00:03:43.950> its<00:03:44.100> own<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:44.489> you<00:03:44.580> don't<00:03:44.730> actually

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
climbs on its own so you don't actually

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.970 
climbs on its own so you don't actually
need<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.239> train<00:03:45.630> it<00:03:45.810> it'll<00:03:46.019> it'll<00:03:46.380> find<00:03:46.739> the

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
need to train it it'll it'll find the

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.680 
need to train it it'll it'll find the
structure<00:03:47.280> it'll<00:03:47.730> actually<00:03:47.880> climb<00:03:48.239> up<00:03:48.390> on<00:03:48.540> its

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
structure it'll actually climb up on its

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.949 
structure it'll actually climb up on its
own<00:03:48.840> so<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:50.519> it<00:03:50.640> you<00:03:50.880> know<00:03:50.910> it's<00:03:51.269> water<00:03:51.660> wise

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
own so and it you know it's water wise

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.750 
own so and it you know it's water wise
it<00:03:52.170> doesn't<00:03:52.470> need<00:03:52.620> tons<00:03:52.920> of<00:03:53.130> water<00:03:53.220> so<00:03:53.610> if<00:03:53.670> you

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
it doesn't need tons of water so if you

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.490 
it doesn't need tons of water so if you
forget<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.209> watch<00:03:54.330> it<00:03:54.570> you<00:03:54.989> know<00:03:55.080> a<00:03:55.140> couple<00:03:55.440> of

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
forget to watch it you know a couple of

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.199 
forget to watch it you know a couple of
times<00:03:55.709> during<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.160> summer<00:03:56.310> it's<00:03:56.850> not<00:03:56.910> going

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
times during the summer it's not going

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.090 
times during the summer it's not going
to<00:03:57.269> die<00:03:57.450> on<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:57.780> okay<00:03:58.260> cool<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:58.620> is<00:03:58.769> it<00:03:58.920> is

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
to die on you okay cool so is it is

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.199 
to die on you okay cool so is it is
there<00:03:59.250> anything<00:03:59.459> you<00:03:59.670> need<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.820> take<00:04:00.060> into

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
there anything you need to take into

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.820 
there anything you need to take into
account<00:04:00.540> when<00:04:00.840> you<00:04:00.930> when<00:04:01.170> you<00:04:01.260> start<00:04:01.590> growing

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
account when you when you start growing

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.190 
account when you when you start growing
this<00:04:02.040> in<00:04:02.190> terms<00:04:02.370> of<00:04:02.549> when<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.180> plant<00:04:03.390> it<00:04:03.660> this

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
this in terms of when to plant it this

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.190 
this in terms of when to plant it this
is<00:04:04.320> kind<00:04:04.500> of<00:04:04.560> seasonal<00:04:04.920> look<00:04:05.790> with<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:06.930> kind

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
is kind of seasonal look with that kind

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.140 
is kind of seasonal look with that kind
of<00:04:07.290> plant<00:04:07.560> is<00:04:07.739> not<00:04:07.890> too<00:04:08.130> important<00:04:08.700> it<00:04:08.880> can<00:04:09.120> be

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
of plant is not too important it can be

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.250 
of plant is not too important it can be
planted<00:04:09.480> just<00:04:09.690> about<00:04:09.989> any<00:04:10.200> time<00:04:10.470> of<00:04:10.650> the

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
planted just about any time of the

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.380 
planted just about any time of the
and<00:04:11.349> probably<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.400> most<00:04:12.519> important<00:04:13.120> thing<00:04:13.269> is

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
and probably the most important thing is

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.420 
and probably the most important thing is
just<00:04:13.420> consider<00:04:14.230> how<00:04:14.440> much<00:04:14.620> root<00:04:14.920> space<00:04:15.220> you're

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
just consider how much root space you're

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.319 
just consider how much root space you're
going<00:04:15.459> to<00:04:15.610> give<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:15.879> plant<00:04:16.120> because

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
going to give the plant because

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.490 
going to give the plant because
obviously<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:16.660> more<00:04:16.810> each<00:04:16.989> space<00:04:17.260> you've<00:04:17.470> got

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
obviously the more each space you've got

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.620 
obviously the more each space you've got
the<00:04:17.799> more<00:04:18.549> compost<00:04:18.910> you<00:04:19.060> can<00:04:19.180> get<00:04:19.299> in<00:04:19.419> there

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
the more compost you can get in there

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.240 
the more compost you can get in there
the<00:04:19.810> faster<00:04:20.229> your<00:04:20.320> plants<00:04:20.650> going<00:04:20.769> to<00:04:20.829> grow<00:04:21.040> and

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
the faster your plants going to grow and

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.439 
the faster your plants going to grow and
the<00:04:21.340> more<00:04:21.370> it's<00:04:21.609> going<00:04:21.729> to<00:04:21.820> thrive<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.300> this

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
the more it's going to thrive and this

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:23.460 
the more it's going to thrive and this
is<00:04:22.570> beautiful<00:04:22.690> I<00:04:22.930> think<00:04:22.990> you<00:04:23.139> can<00:04:23.260> really

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
is beautiful I think you can really

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.170 
is beautiful I think you can really
creative<00:04:24.130> with<00:04:24.250> your<00:04:24.280> structures<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:25.090> then

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
creative with your structures and then

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.790 
creative with your structures and then
really<00:04:25.449> training<00:04:25.720> these<00:04:25.930> plants<00:04:26.290> yeah<00:04:26.470> and

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
really training these plants yeah and

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.740 
really training these plants yeah and
don't<00:04:26.979> be<00:04:27.190> afraid<00:04:27.430> to<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:28.000> to<00:04:28.240> mix<00:04:28.510> two

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
don't be afraid to to to mix two

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.930 
don't be afraid to to to mix two
different<00:04:29.229> species<00:04:29.440> together<00:04:29.979> so<00:04:30.550> you<00:04:30.729> get

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
different species together so you get

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.159 
different species together so you get
then<00:04:31.150> you<00:04:31.240> get<00:04:31.360> two<00:04:31.630> different<00:04:31.960> flowering

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
then you get two different flowering

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.379 
then you get two different flowering
