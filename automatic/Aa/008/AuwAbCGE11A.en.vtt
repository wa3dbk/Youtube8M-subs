now usually an engine were to move from
side<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.890> side<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:06.280> turn<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.640> boat<00:03:06.849> and

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
side to side to turn the boat and

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
side to side to turn the boat and
surprisingly<00:03:09.160> enough<00:03:09.489> it<00:03:09.730> does<00:03:09.940> have<00:03:10.150> a

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
surprisingly enough it does have a

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.289 
surprisingly enough it does have a
steering<00:03:10.569> wheel<00:03:11.220> although<00:03:12.220> this<00:03:12.910> is<00:03:13.120> what

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
steering wheel although this is what

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.140 
steering wheel although this is what
happens<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:15.720> boats<00:03:16.720> don't<00:03:17.019> do<00:03:17.260> that<00:03:17.530> well

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
happens and boats don't do that well

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.960 
happens and boats don't do that well
they<00:03:19.150> kind<00:03:19.390> of<00:03:19.480> do<00:03:19.720> but<00:03:20.049> only<00:03:20.200> when<00:03:20.590> if<00:03:21.549> they're

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
they kind of do but only when if they're

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.460 
they kind of do but only when if they're
part<00:03:22.180> took<00:03:22.390> that<00:03:22.599> you'll<00:03:22.870> have<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.170> like<00:03:23.319> that

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
part took that you'll have it like that

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.930 
part took that you'll have it like that
and<00:03:23.530> then<00:03:23.829> when<00:03:24.010> you<00:03:24.129> in<00:03:24.280> water<00:03:24.519> you'll<00:03:24.790> have

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
and then when you in water you'll have

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.539 
and then when you in water you'll have
it<00:03:25.090> like<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.390> but<00:03:25.989> it<00:03:26.140> does<00:03:26.319> not<00:03:26.590> turn<00:03:26.890> unless

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
it like that but it does not turn unless

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.039 
it like that but it does not turn unless
you<00:03:28.200> kind<00:03:29.200> of<00:03:29.319> put<00:03:30.220> at<00:03:30.370> an<00:03:30.489> angle<00:03:30.910> dare<00:03:31.120> but

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
you kind of put at an angle dare but

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.330 
you kind of put at an angle dare but
then<00:03:32.200> it's<00:03:32.380> quite<00:03:33.010> likely<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.670> come<00:03:34.480> off<00:03:35.340> so

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
then it's quite likely to come off so

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:43.470 
then it's quite likely to come off so
we're<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:37.329> know<00:03:38.579> yeah<00:03:39.989> not<00:03:40.989> a<00:03:41.049> good<00:03:41.109> idea<00:03:42.480> so

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
we're you know yeah not a good idea so

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.050 
we're you know yeah not a good idea so
bit<00:03:44.260> disappointed<00:03:45.130> in<00:03:45.250> doubt<00:03:45.459> but<00:03:45.639> you<00:03:45.700> do<00:03:45.849> get

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
bit disappointed in doubt but you do get

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.770

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
this is a 2011 set by the way if you

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.770 
this is a 2011 set by the way if you
didn't<00:04:17.650> already<00:04:17.769> know<00:04:18.070> I<00:04:18.489> think<00:04:19.209> most<00:04:19.419> people

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
didn't already know I think most people

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.219 
didn't already know I think most people
did<00:04:19.959> so<00:04:20.380> there's<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:20.950> front<00:04:21.190> of<00:04:21.340> it<00:04:22.110> even<00:04:23.110> if

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
did so there's the front of it even if

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:32.040 
did so there's the front of it even if
it<00:04:23.349> go<00:04:23.470> on<00:04:23.590> top

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.330 

and<00:04:33.050> then<00:04:33.910> inception<00:04:34.910> put<00:04:35.840> you<00:04:36.050> in<00:04:36.289> here<00:04:36.590> and

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
and then inception put you in here and

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.860 
and then inception put you in here and
then<00:04:37.550> just<00:04:37.789> break<00:04:38.270> up<00:04:38.560> this<00:04:39.560> play<00:04:40.630> and<00:04:41.630> you've

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
then just break up this play and you've

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.540 
then just break up this play and you've
just<00:04:41.900> based<00:04:42.590> as<00:04:43.250> fun<00:04:43.720> as<00:04:44.720> that<00:04:45.310> screaming<00:04:46.310> kid

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550
