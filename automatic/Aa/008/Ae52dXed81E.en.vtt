00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.490
 it seems that classical dance is not my thing 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.289
 the truth above 100 is patricia 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.779
 but good today we came to the study of 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.520
 dances eugenia morÃ¡n then to know that we 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:25.230
 tell about this beautiful discipline 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.230
 which is called classical dance 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.340
 the 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.110
 dance has incorporated the essence of 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.140
 whether human or from the beginning 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.150
 of the cdl exists the human being there exists the 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.110
 dance and the school of classical dances 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:53.230
 born as a school in the court of 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.850
 Medici who they are the first to be 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.910
 clarify florence that are the first 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.370
 in establishing the classical school by 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.430
 Of course, in Santiago there is a 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.140
 very long history of classical dances in 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.600
 the first story let's say schools 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.880
 Classical dances was about some sisters 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.740
 I remembered the name they taught 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.410
 which all the teachers emerged 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.350
 who are today for many years studied the 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:21.340
 famous lady julieta cortes of which 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.190
 my teacher also emerged clear that was 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.290
 christina ortubÃ© from christina's aunt 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.479
 I got it and well and that's how we came up 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.610
 all in santiago there are several schools to 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.340
 how many years it is recommended that a 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.130
 boy can learn in these seven years 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.229
 six for seven years is the ideal 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.430
 reality before the guys are not 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.180
 prepared for what is the discipline 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.490
 of the classic 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.190
 unconsciously they fix a frustration 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.160
 because they can not comply with the 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.470
 technical demands how to make 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.870
 understand a child deporting clear that 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.250
 the difficulty is not in your ability 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.250
 but in its lack of maturity 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.260
 to 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.119
 and you have been touched by Pablo to teach 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.400
 taken out this also serves for students 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.830
 for rehabilitation for children with 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.319
 motor disability health could serve 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.390
 yes of course because the good thing that 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.180
 has the classical dance of technique is 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.030
 that helps you correct the problems 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.650
 posturals to strengthen muscles that 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.890
 there they do not normally work with 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.420
 some sports or with other activities 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.050
 then it is indispensable for 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.060
 just be physically well as well 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.100
 in children especially that they are 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.489
 developing that are growing 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.239
 helps to train physically well and not 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.680
 out there grow with others for example if 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.870
 they do not do anything that out there they can 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.500
 understand I do not say to gain weight but yes 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.150
 not as they would like to develop all 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.580
 the girls and guys who do classics 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.130
 usually have some for more than after 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.030
 are dedicated to dance usually grow with 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.500
 a physicist with whom they are satisfied 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.840
 Many people believe that discipline is 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.030
 almost female no and I think that really 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.200
 what of what suffers say 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.569
 santiago and very 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.180
 the places is a bit of lack of 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.340
 culture exactly do not I do not want it to 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.280
 misunderstand this is logical that 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.110
 santiago have little culture because others 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.780
 is here with the conversion to bring in 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.550
 the good sense of majesty explain that 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.200
 we have had times where many things 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.800
 they have not been done and they have not been seen in 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.690
 Santiago 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.459
 that is the lack of culture that does not have 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.620
 nothing to do with education that is not 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.890
 misunderstand me if people think that 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.160
 only female is not like that until more 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.440
 the ballet emerged and was born for men and 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.660
 a lot of the technique of the class of 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.730
 ballet is made for man 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.280
 we are the daring ones that we do 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.069
 what men have to do but 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.319
 is configured for man the 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.569
 dexterity that has the classic is the 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.819
 dexterity of an acrobat who makes it 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.819
 better the man when he starts it in 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.920
 large slope in long hoop develop the 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.920
 elongation that is the main thing for this 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.440
 I believe that at 6 years old at 50 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.170
 70 the 80 while we're all alive 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.760
 we have the same capabilities each 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.850
 It has its pros but it is not the same 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.579
 It is not the same as what happens there is a great 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.530
 difference the boys are bold the 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.990
 guys are not afraid then they learn 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.080
 fast because they say for example like this 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.970
 year and do everything upside down and it does not matter and 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.630
 that makes them learn adults 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.330
 we have the inhibition say to and it will come out 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.430
 wrong to ridicule then we put on 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.790
 conditions that do not exist we 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.650
 we limit we limit being limited 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.990
 the only difference the child does not have 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.530
 conscience the ridiculous then learn 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.530
 faster
