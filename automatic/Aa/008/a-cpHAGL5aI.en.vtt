this season I think that for our players
is<00:00:32.489> not<00:00:32.820> only<00:00:33.030> Chelsea<00:00:33.770> victims<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:35.130> all<00:00:35.280> know

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489

exactly<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.840> same<00:01:49.020> goal<00:01:49.200> she's<00:01:50.040> not<00:01:50.130> easy<00:01:50.340> for

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
exactly the same goal she's not easy for

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.550 
exactly the same goal she's not easy for
even<00:01:50.700> know<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.030> took<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.630> shoot<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.170> way<00:01:52.380> this

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
even know it took to shoot the way this

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.580 
even know it took to shoot the way this
is<00:01:52.740> she<00:01:52.950> shoot<00:01:53.189> with<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.549> left<00:01:53.850> leg<00:01:54.110> but<00:01:55.110> he

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
is she shoot with the left leg but he

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.039 
is she shoot with the left leg but he
didn't<00:01:56.009> he<00:01:56.820> didn't<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.360> there<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.780> game

didn't he didn't in there in that game

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.469 
didn't he didn't in there in that game
but<00:01:58.710> before<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.250> we<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.729> two<00:02:00.360> or<00:02:00.450> three

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
but before that we have two or three

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.420 
but before that we have two or three
clear<00:02:00.780> chance<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.290> may<00:02:01.439> be<00:02:01.500> which<00:02:01.799> go<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.100> move

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
clear chance it may be which go to move

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.450 
clear chance it may be which go to move
first<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:04.110> doctor<00:02:04.380> was<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.740> same<00:02:04.950> may<00:02:05.399> be

that match Chelsey hit the post three

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.580 
that match Chelsey hit the post three

exactly the way that Chelsea attacks on

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
the way they defend I think that's more

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.560 
the way they defend I think that's more
important<00:03:15.000> for<00:03:15.299> me<00:03:15.360> to<00:03:16.160> score<00:03:17.160> goals<00:03:17.390> if<00:03:18.390> we

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
important for me to score goals if we

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.509 
important for me to score goals if we
score<00:03:18.780> one<00:03:18.959> goal<00:03:18.989> with<00:03:19.320> Jordan<00:03:19.650> game<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.370> we

score one goal with Jordan game and we

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.150 
score one goal with Jordan game and we
score<00:03:20.760> another<00:03:21.000> goal<00:03:21.120> against<00:03:21.720> Norwich<00:03:22.019> we<00:03:22.440> we

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
score another goal against Norwich we we

record<00:03:35.160> against<00:03:35.459> Mourinho<00:03:35.940> is<00:03:36.150> not<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.780> best

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
record against Mourinho is not the best

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.289 
record against Mourinho is not the best
I<00:03:37.049> think<00:03:37.200> it's<00:03:37.319> one<00:03:37.470> winning<00:03:37.890> nine<00:03:38.190> what<00:03:39.000> what

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
I think it's one winning nine what what

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.670 
I think it's one winning nine what what
is<00:03:39.390> it<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:39.540> makes<00:03:39.750> his<00:03:39.989> teams<00:03:40.260> in<00:03:40.380> particular

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
is it that makes his teams in particular

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.770 
is it that makes his teams in particular
so<00:03:41.130> difficult<00:03:41.549> for<00:03:41.670> a<00:03:41.790> manager<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.180> play

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
so difficult for a manager to play

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.210 
so difficult for a manager to play
against<00:03:43.049> I<00:03:43.230> think<00:03:43.440> strikes<00:03:43.650> Ferg's<00:03:43.889> and<00:03:44.100> had<00:03:44.190> a

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
against I think strikes Ferg's and had a

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.960 
against I think strikes Ferg's and had a
similarly<00:03:44.609> difficult<00:03:45.120> record<00:03:45.540> against<00:03:45.870> him

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
similarly difficult record against him

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.280

play a little bit is

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.540 
play a little bit is
just<00:06:35.880> think<00:06:36.509> is<00:06:36.720> when<00:06:36.930> the<00:06:37.460> doctor<00:06:38.460> on<00:06:38.490> the

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
just think is when the doctor on the

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.210 
just think is when the doctor on the
physiotherapy<00:06:39.509> to<00:06:39.690> say<00:06:39.870> that<00:06:40.050> the<00:06:40.190> play<00:06:41.190> is

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220
