to Palmeiro's in the liga de brazil
which<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.220> obviously<00:01:14.640> not<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.150> FIFA<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.689> there

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
which is obviously not in FIFA so there

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.480 
which is obviously not in FIFA so there
was<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> chance<00:01:16.290> he<00:01:16.439> will<00:01:16.619> get<00:01:17.009> out<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.310> pécs

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
was a chance he will get out of pécs

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.399 
was a chance he will get out of pécs
very<00:01:17.729> very<00:01:18.000> soon<00:01:18.180> which<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> shame<00:01:18.689> but

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
very very soon which is a shame but

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.320 
got two goals for them so I figured I
would<00:02:27.280> try<00:02:27.310> them<00:02:27.610> out<00:02:27.700> in<00:02:27.880> a<00:02:27.970> different

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
would try them out in a different

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.270 
would try them out in a different
position<00:02:28.420> since<00:02:29.020> he<00:02:29.620> wasn't<00:02:29.950> really<00:02:30.070> the

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
apart from the apart from the way one I

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.980 
apart from the apart from the way one I
think<00:03:06.430> that<00:03:06.730> one<00:03:06.910> went<00:03:07.120> like<00:03:07.360> for<00:03:07.600> 2k<00:03:07.960> or

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
think that one went like for 2k or

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.050 
think that one went like for 2k or
something<00:03:08.470> but<00:03:08.650> anyway<00:03:09.190> we<00:03:09.670> go<00:03:09.790> into<00:03:09.940> the

through<00:03:32.860> his<00:03:32.950> defender<00:03:33.400> selects<00:03:33.730> but<00:03:33.940> anyway

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
through his defender selects but anyway

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.729 
through his defender selects but anyway
we<00:03:34.360> make<00:03:34.510> it<00:03:34.630> one<00:03:34.810> nil<00:03:34.989> and<00:03:35.350> then<00:03:35.500> on<00:03:35.620> the

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
we make it one nil and then on the

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.380 
we make it one nil and then on the
counter<00:03:36.100> he<00:03:36.220> got<00:03:36.400> through<00:03:36.610> with<00:03:36.730> boney<00:03:37.030> some
