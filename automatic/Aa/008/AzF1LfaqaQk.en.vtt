00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.930 
devices I figured out you can use go

what<00:00:49.739> you'll<00:00:49.860> need<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.460> go<00:00:51.030> keyboard<00:00:53.390> see

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390

how<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.660> thing<00:00:54.719> sucks<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.469> don't<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.739> any

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
how this thing sucks I don't have any

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.010 
how this thing sucks I don't have any
feet<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.520> find<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:57.719> type

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
feet that I find that you can type

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.170 
feet that I find that you can type
faster<00:00:58.260> if<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.309> right<00:00:59.609> sound<00:00:59.969> and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
faster if you have the right sound and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.970 
faster if you have the right sound and
the<00:01:00.420> right<00:01:00.600> vibration<00:01:01.230> which<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.590> not<00:01:01.739> too

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the right vibration which is not too

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.579 
the right vibration which is not too
long<00:01:02.160> but<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:03.120> do<00:01:03.300> with<00:01:03.510> go<00:01:04.140> keyboard

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
long but you can do with go keyboard

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.940 
long but you can do with go keyboard
because<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.979> lets<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.549> customize<00:01:06.619> the<00:01:07.619> sound

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
because it lets you customize the sound

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.490 
because it lets you customize the sound
of<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.549> keyboard<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.090> also<00:01:09.420> how<00:01:09.840> long<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
of the keyboard and also how long the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.740 
of the keyboard and also how long the
vibrates<00:01:11.220> for<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.729> found<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.210> magic<00:01:12.570> number

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
vibrates for and I found a magic number

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.870 
vibrates for and I found a magic number
that<00:01:13.280> corresponds<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:15.090> keyboard<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
that corresponds to the keyboard on the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.179 
that corresponds to the keyboard on the
galaxy<00:01:17.880> s<00:01:18.000> 2<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.570> also<00:01:20.180> my<00:01:21.180> optimus<00:01:21.659> 2x<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:22.439> find

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
galaxy s 2 and also my optimus 2x I find

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.859 
galaxy s 2 and also my optimus 2x I find
this<00:01:23.340> one<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> little<00:01:23.820> bit<00:01:23.970> better<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.450> Galaxy

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
this one a little bit better the Galaxy

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.219 
this one a little bit better the Galaxy
s2<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.229> think<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:25.799> just<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.340> perfect<00:01:26.580> keyboard

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
s2 I think it's just a perfect keyboard

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.960 
s2 I think it's just a perfect keyboard
but<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.259> can<00:01:28.530> pretty<00:01:28.799> much<00:01:28.890> get<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.490> exact

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
but I can pretty much get this exact

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.350 
but I can pretty much get this exact
same<00:01:30.290> combo<00:01:31.290> with<00:01:31.680> go<00:01:31.920> keyboard<00:01:32.400> up<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:33.210> go

same combo with go keyboard up so go

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.310

yeah<00:06:22.310> look<00:06:22.610> at<00:06:22.730> that<00:06:22.760> it's<00:06:23.620> what<00:06:24.620> I<00:06:24.650> did<00:06:24.920> is<00:06:25.040> I

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 
yeah look at that it's what I did is I

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.290 
yeah look at that it's what I did is I
my<00:06:26.600> original<00:06:27.050> kernel<00:06:27.410> had<00:06:27.760> it<00:06:28.760> was<00:06:28.910> actually

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
my original kernel had it was actually

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.720 
my original kernel had it was actually
over<00:06:29.480> voltage<00:06:30.140> so<00:06:30.740> it<00:06:30.860> was<00:06:30.980> draining<00:06:31.310> a<00:06:31.460> lot<00:06:31.610> of

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:31.730 
over voltage so it was draining a lot of

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.480 
over voltage so it was draining a lot of
battery<00:06:32.000> so<00:06:32.900> I<00:06:32.930> actually<00:06:33.170> under<00:06:33.800> bolted<00:06:34.190> it<00:06:34.280> as

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
battery so I actually under bolted it as

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.240 
battery so I actually under bolted it as
much<00:06:34.730> as<00:06:34.910> possible<00:06:35.120> and<00:06:35.660> now<00:06:36.380> the<00:06:36.860> battery

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
much as possible and now the battery

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.730 
much as possible and now the battery
should<00:06:37.280> last<00:06:37.720> actually<00:06:38.720> like<00:06:38.900> 20-30<00:06:39.500> percent

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
should last actually like 20-30 percent

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.250 
should last actually like 20-30 percent
longer<00:06:40.460> than<00:06:40.540> stock<00:06:41.540> at<00:06:43.690> set<00:06:44.690> with<00:06:44.960> SEP<00:06:45.170> the

longer than stock at set with SEP the

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 
CPU at 1.2 gigahertz and also at one

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.620 
CPU at 1.2 gigahertz and also at one
point<00:06:50.330> 4<00:06:50.750> gigahertz<00:06:51.520> at<00:06:52.520> 1.5<00:06:53.210> you're<00:06:53.510> gonna

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:53.630 
point 4 gigahertz at 1.5 you're gonna

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.140 
point 4 gigahertz at 1.5 you're gonna
start<00:06:54.020> maybe<00:06:54.830> it's<00:06:55.400> gonna<00:06:55.520> be<00:06:55.670> about<00:06:55.760> the

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150 
start maybe it's gonna be about the

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.350 
start maybe it's gonna be about the
stock<00:06:56.840> so<00:06:57.260> I<00:06:57.320> would<00:06:57.740> say<00:06:57.890> the<00:06:58.040> optimal<00:06:58.550> is<00:06:58.700> 1.4

00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 
stock so I would say the optimal is 1.4

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.990 
stock so I would say the optimal is 1.4

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.060

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.070 
should have testing of this complete by

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.550 
should have testing of this complete by
tomorrow<00:07:05.000> because<00:07:05.450> I<00:07:05.570> need<00:07:05.750> like<00:07:05.990> a<00:07:06.230> day<00:07:06.530> to

tomorrow because I need like a day to

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.060 
tomorrow because I need like a day to
actually<00:07:07.010> test<00:07:07.520> out<00:07:07.730> the<00:07:08.600> battery<00:07:08.930> light<00:07:09.110> but

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.070 
actually test out the battery light but

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.610 
actually test out the battery light but
in<00:07:10.670> theory<00:07:11.030> is<00:07:11.420> supposed<00:07:11.780> to<00:07:11.930> give<00:07:12.080> me<00:07:12.110> twenty

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:12.620 
in theory is supposed to give me twenty

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.920 
in theory is supposed to give me twenty
thirty<00:07:12.830> percent<00:07:13.250> more<00:07:13.490> but<00:07:14.300> I'm<00:07:14.390> gonna<00:07:14.600> test

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:14.930 
thirty percent more but I'm gonna test

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.740 
thirty percent more but I'm gonna test
