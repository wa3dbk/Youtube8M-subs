they're off in june they get bored and
they<00:01:54.550> are<00:01:54.640> ready<00:01:54.849> to<00:01:55.030> go<00:01:55.149> back<00:01:55.300> to<00:01:55.509> the

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
they are ready to go back to the

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.089 

I<00:02:07.040> think<00:02:07.670> it's<00:02:07.759> a<00:02:07.820> great<00:02:07.850> dramatic<00:02:08.750> way<00:02:09.619> to

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
I think it's a great dramatic way to

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.410 
I think it's a great dramatic way to
force<00:02:10.340> change<00:02:10.610> on<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:10.880> students<00:02:11.270> the

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
force change on the students the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.030 
force change on the students the
teachers<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:11.989> administration<00:02:12.410> and<00:02:12.680> the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
teachers and the administration and the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.520
