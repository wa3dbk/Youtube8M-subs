00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:17.180
 The story I think the call started 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.759
 in a hospital room in belo horizonte 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.849
 where I did not have much more 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:27.140
 life expectancy and health was 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:30.740
 very fragile and my parents 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:39.550
 so kneeling on the side of the bed prayed 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:42.800
 Giving me back to God and speaking is South. 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.800
 developing you gave me but not giving 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.289
 More candles if in this situation aline 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.309
 was just a three year old 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:55.489
 when I was disillusioned by the doctors 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:58.609
 But God had plans for her and with a 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.750
 miracle that established the health of that 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.120
 little boy 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.910
 I'm sure it was there that God 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.899
 talked to my parents and from then on 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:11.270
 He talked to me and aline grew up. 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.939
 feeling that the creator had a dream 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.840
 special for her but did not know what 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:20.390
 exactly at the end of adolescence 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.450
 chose to take advertising and 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.310
 wondered how he could serve God 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.640
 in that graduation 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.380
 I went to college and then went to college 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.420
 I started watching tv 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.100
 I was saying that maybe this is the 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:41.240
 opportunity to work, right? 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.390
 thus fully attended many 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.390
 family offices found a lot of cash 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.979
 music connection in the search for 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.049
 truthfulness of the problems that 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.270
 it happens live right? 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.290
 I think it 's very difficult at all 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.689
 programs providentially in 2008 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.600
 aline delivered your resume to a friend 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:06.289
 who worked in the new time and waited 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.200
 In God the answer I made to college 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.329
 the whole year I entered a process 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.980
 the media group of the Rio de 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:17.190
 January and I went to work in 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.010
 agency 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.070
 and always accompany a new time to 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.530
 where aline started his career was 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.160
 dpz one of the largest on the market 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.850
 Brazilian advertising in 2011 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.350
 aline received the invitation of the new time 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.600
 it was one day I was working 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.190
 usually my phone rang a number 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.700
 unknown 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:46.410
 I attended was barbada manager of rh here 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.930
 at the time in the new time calling and wanted 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.680
 to know if I was interested in a vacancy 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.450
 so that time I had been finished 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.280
 to be hired 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.620
 I was fine in my job I never had 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.810
 problem with Saturday I never had 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.680
 problem so nothing here comes that part 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.490
 human 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.440
 finally there are strong people I 'm here in 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.700
 Agency, I'm fine, fine, no problem. 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.580
 with nothing 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:20.880
 I'm already a media assistant and now I'm going 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:25.459
 tv secretary but funny that this 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:29.340
 It happened to me so I said I'm not going to read it 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:32.280
 because it was not an issue as soon as 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.680
 I could question or not understand that 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.890
 That's where God wanted me to be. 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.340
 work understood but I saw there a 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.080
 opportunity of that desire always 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.980
 stimulated by my mother for my 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.440
 parents 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.810
 Look, you're a person who was returned. 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.150
 for god so you have a purpose 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.160
 different like this 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.090
 so I grew a lot with this 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.090
 because I had to 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:04.879
 of my talents and no one me 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:06.019
 100 fully deliver and align 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.659
 delivered 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:12.469
 he gave up his career at the agency and 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:14.500
 relied on God's dream came I got 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:20.269
 here on July 27 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:22.940
 and I started to have many two surprises 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.690
 and then I went through another step that 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:33.710
 was production assistant 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:35.810
 I went one year and two months 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.199
 production assistant 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:42.080
 programs were the programs that 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.539
 I watched at home maybe it was the 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:48.470
 programs that strengthened me 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:51.229
 way while I was still half 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.880
 lost thus questioning me 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.009
 problems that I watched later 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.190
 programs that helped produce the 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:00.169
 programs I was there every day 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.830
 they made and they make a difference in my 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.009
 life 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.139
 and it's there at that moment of the game 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:11.389
 happening 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:16.939
 the return of people is thus a 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:23.300
 feeling that my parents are not 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:24.729
 wrong when they put the 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.789
 idea that I had to work 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:32.409
 wholly for God and even far 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:36.199
 the motivation of the family continues to 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:39.969
 strengthen aline day by day on the way 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:44.860
 who follows in God's footsteps 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:52.389
 they are a key part of my life 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:52.389
 my parents rise everything my brother I go 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:57.129
 that's where the base comes from. 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.870
 without them we are not much 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.520
 so that's always the way 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:12.260
 feeling of gratitude because they 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.610
 they believed in my 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.520
 right decision 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:19.030
 and today the line is the talents and 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.860
 academic training in endomarketing 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:25.300
 responsible for the entire 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:29.770
 internal network communication new time 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:33.920
 perhaps change and transformation or 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:36.010
 communicated their contribution to the 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.880
 others out there and everything 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:41.660
 Maybe today God is giving me the 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.130
 opportunity to communicate in a way 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.430
 different 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:48.710
 we who are in here she is that 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:52.100
 that I had to communicate in the other 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:54.800
 thing is a product was not a brand was 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.860
 this was the key message the 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.410
 word the desire of the eternal to our 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.060
 Life was what I had to 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.340
 contribute to this by making people 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.360
 need to know that people know 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.360
 need to know 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.210
 ah
