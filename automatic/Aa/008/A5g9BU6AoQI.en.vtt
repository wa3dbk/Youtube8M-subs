hey<00:00:13.430> guys<00:00:13.700> another<00:00:14.180> JDP<00:00:15.170> practical<00:00:16.040> useful

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:16.790 
hey guys another JDP practical useful

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.970 
hey guys another JDP practical useful
tips<00:00:17.440> here<00:00:18.440> we<00:00:18.590> are<00:00:18.940> down<00:00:19.940> on<00:00:20.680> Lake<00:00:21.680> Macquarie

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
tips here we are down on Lake Macquarie

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.100 
tips here we are down on Lake Macquarie
and<00:00:24.460> they're<00:00:25.460> just<00:00:26.090> doing<00:00:26.270> a<00:00:26.420> long<00:00:26.630> exposure

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
and they're just doing a long exposure

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.280 
and they're just doing a long exposure
now<00:00:27.529> it's<00:00:28.070> middle<00:00:28.580> of<00:00:28.640> the<00:00:28.730> day<00:00:28.940> pretty<00:00:29.870> cloudy

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.290 
now it's middle of the day pretty cloudy

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.840 
now it's middle of the day pretty cloudy
so<00:00:30.910> it's<00:00:31.910> a<00:00:32.500> red<00:00:33.500> leaf<00:00:33.710> a<00:00:33.980> shot<00:00:34.309> at<00:00:34.430> the<00:00:34.520> moment

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
so it's a red leaf a shot at the moment

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.330 
so it's a red leaf a shot at the moment
only<00:00:34.940> had<00:00:35.180> one<00:00:35.390> hundred<00:00:35.510> is<00:00:35.900> our<00:00:36.110> f<00:00:36.290> 11<00:00:36.650> I'm

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
only had one hundred is our f 11 I'm

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.570 
only had one hundred is our f 11 I'm
shooting<00:00:37.820> at<00:00:37.910> about<00:00:38.180> a<00:00:38.210> 40th<00:00:38.840> of<00:00:39.020> a<00:00:39.110> second<00:00:39.620> now

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
shooting at about a 40th of a second now

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.490 
shooting at about a 40th of a second now
to<00:00:40.760> get<00:00:41.000> the<00:00:41.150> long<00:00:41.300> exposure<00:00:41.840> I'm<00:00:42.110> putting<00:00:42.440> a

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
to get the long exposure I'm putting a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.850 
to get the long exposure I'm putting a
ten<00:00:42.830> stop<00:00:43.220> Ali<00:00:43.550> fills<00:00:44.000> a<00:00:44.239> 10<00:00:44.930> stop<00:00:45.260> builder<00:00:45.710> on

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
ten stop Ali fills a 10 stop builder on

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.350 
ten stop Ali fills a 10 stop builder on
there<00:00:46.300> like<00:00:47.300> a<00:00:47.330> big<00:00:47.570> stopper<00:00:47.900> and<00:00:49.180> that's<00:00:50.180> it

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
there like a big stopper and that's it

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.630 
there like a big stopper and that's it
there<00:00:50.800> ok<00:00:51.820> so<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:53.449> process<00:00:53.659> is<00:00:54.309> set<00:00:55.309> up<00:00:55.460> your

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
there ok so the process is set up your

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.560 
there ok so the process is set up your
shot<00:00:55.839> take<00:00:56.839> a<00:00:56.870> normally<00:00:57.409> exposed<00:00:57.979> shot<00:00:58.510> ok<00:00:59.510> in

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
shot take a normally exposed shot ok in

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.950 
shot take a normally exposed shot ok in
this<00:00:59.750> case<00:01:00.019> f11<00:01:00.710> is<00:01:00.979> a<00:01:01.129> hundred<00:01:01.729> a<00:01:01.970> 40th<00:01:02.690> of<00:01:02.870> a

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
this case f11 is a hundred a 40th of a

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.250 
this case f11 is a hundred a 40th of a
second<00:01:03.850> what<00:01:04.850> happened<00:01:05.239> is<00:01:05.360> that<00:01:05.630> years<00:01:05.960> ago<00:01:06.200> I

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
second what happened is that years ago I

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.039 
second what happened is that years ago I
was<00:01:06.500> fighting<00:01:06.799> with<00:01:07.159> a<00:01:07.640> view<00:01:08.030> camera<00:01:08.450> I<00:01:08.630> had<00:01:08.870> no

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
was fighting with a view camera I had no

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.500 
was fighting with a view camera I had no
feedback<00:01:09.430> so<00:01:10.430> i<00:01:10.460> had<00:01:10.610> to<00:01:10.700> work<00:01:10.880> out<00:01:11.030> a<00:01:11.150> formula

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
feedback so i had to work out a formula

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.039 
feedback so i had to work out a formula
i<00:01:11.659> worked<00:01:11.990> at<00:01:12.140> a<00:01:12.170> formula<00:01:12.680> basically<00:01:13.250> based<00:01:13.580> on

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
i worked at a formula basically based on

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.770 
i worked at a formula basically based on
1000<00:01:15.049> so<00:01:15.490> take<00:01:16.490> your<00:01:16.640> normal<00:01:16.820> shutter<00:01:17.390> speed

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
1000 so take your normal shutter speed

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.920 
1000 so take your normal shutter speed
and<00:01:18.140> divide<00:01:18.950> it<00:01:18.979> into<00:01:19.340> a<00:01:19.520> thousand<00:01:20.240> will<00:01:20.630> give

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
and divide it into a thousand will give

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.420 
and divide it into a thousand will give
you<00:01:21.140> a<00:01:21.170> 10<00:01:21.649> stop<00:01:22.780> at<00:01:23.780> n<00:01:24.079> stop<00:01:24.380> exposure<00:01:24.950> in

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
you a 10 stop at n stop exposure in

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.899 
you a 10 stop at n stop exposure in
seconds<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:26.270> if<00:01:26.960> you<00:01:27.200> shooting<00:01:27.920> at<00:01:28.039> a<00:01:28.159> 40<00:01:28.640> of<00:01:28.820> a

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
seconds so if you shooting at a 40 of a

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.630 
seconds so if you shooting at a 40 of a
second<00:01:29.359> divided<00:01:29.689> 40<00:01:30.170> into<00:01:30.409> a<00:01:30.439> thousand<00:01:31.219> it's

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
second divided 40 into a thousand it's

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.649 
second divided 40 into a thousand it's
25<00:01:32.359> so<00:01:32.689> 25<00:01:33.259> seconds<00:01:33.920> that's<00:01:34.520> your<00:01:34.909> 10<00:01:35.180> stop

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
25 so 25 seconds that's your 10 stop

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.200 
25 so 25 seconds that's your 10 stop
exposure<00:01:36.320> very<00:01:37.219> simple<00:01:37.759> if<00:01:37.939> you're<00:01:38.060> shooting

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
exposure very simple if you're shooting

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.690 
exposure very simple if you're shooting
at<00:01:38.509> a<00:01:38.570> hundred<00:01:38.869> a<00:01:39.380> hundredth<00:01:40.039> of<00:01:40.130> a<00:01:40.250> second

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
at a hundred a hundredth of a second

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.590 
at a hundred a hundredth of a second
divided<00:01:41.450> a<00:01:41.479> hundred<00:01:41.960> into<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.200> thousand<00:01:43.009> and<00:01:43.600> it

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
divided a hundred into a thousand and it

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.069 
divided a hundred into a thousand and it
gives<00:01:44.929> you<00:01:45.109> 10<00:01:45.409> seconds<00:01:46.100> ok<00:01:46.579> very<00:01:46.909> simple<00:01:47.479> if

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
gives you 10 seconds ok very simple if

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.749 
gives you 10 seconds ok very simple if
it's<00:01:48.259> a<00:01:48.320> five<00:01:48.560> hundredth<00:01:49.039> of<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.250> second

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
it's a five hundredth of a second

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.630 
it's a five hundredth of a second
divided<00:01:50.119> 500<00:01:50.840> into<00:01:51.049> a<00:01:51.079> thousand<00:01:51.740> two<00:01:51.979> seconds

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
divided 500 into a thousand two seconds

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.139 
divided 500 into a thousand two seconds
so<00:01:53.390> simple<00:01:53.780> mathematics<00:01:54.499> it's<00:01:54.770> not<00:01:55.159> absolute

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
so simple mathematics it's not absolute

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.359 
so simple mathematics it's not absolute
perfect<00:01:56.749> if<00:01:57.079> you<00:01:57.109> want<00:01:57.200> perfect<00:01:57.619> divide<00:01:58.159> the

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
perfect if you want perfect divide the

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.340 
perfect if you want perfect divide the
shutter<00:01:58.640> into<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.119> thousand<00:01:59.659> and<00:01:59.810> twenty<00:01:59.990> four

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
shutter into a thousand and twenty four

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.639 
shutter into a thousand and twenty four
but<00:02:01.340> just<00:02:02.030> round<00:02:02.390> it<00:02:02.539> off<00:02:02.719> with<00:02:02.929> a<00:02:03.049> thousand

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
but just round it off with a thousand

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.700 
but just round it off with a thousand
you'll<00:02:04.100> be<00:02:04.310> very<00:02:04.880> very<00:02:05.060> close<00:02:05.810> if<00:02:06.109> not<00:02:06.140> spot-on

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
you'll be very very close if not spot-on

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.160 
you'll be very very close if not spot-on
ok<00:02:07.490> so<00:02:08.090> just<00:02:08.390> remember<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:09.440> rule<00:02:09.649> of<00:02:09.679> ten<00:02:10.160> it's

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
ok so just remember the rule of ten it's

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.890 
ok so just remember the rule of ten it's
take<00:02:12.170> your<00:02:12.380> normal<00:02:12.560> exposure<00:02:13.190> shot

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
take your normal exposure shot

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.069 
take your normal exposure shot
speed<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.409> divide<00:02:15.099> that<00:02:15.129> into<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:15.970> thousand<00:02:16.689> if

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
speed and divide that into a thousand if

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.110 
speed and divide that into a thousand if
your<00:02:17.200> normal<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.590> shutter<00:02:17.860> speed<00:02:17.950> is<00:02:18.430> like<00:02:18.790> more

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
your normal a shutter speed is like more

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.050 
your normal a shutter speed is like more
than<00:02:19.269> a<00:02:19.390> second<00:02:19.900> or<00:02:20.110> second<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:21.060> effectively

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
than a second or second and effectively

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.300 
than a second or second and effectively
you're<00:02:22.840> dividing<00:02:23.260> one<00:02:23.439> second<00:02:23.860> into<00:02:24.040> what<00:02:24.189> the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
you're dividing one second into what the

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.490 
you're dividing one second into what the
house<00:02:24.459> in<00:02:24.700> which<00:02:24.730> is<00:02:24.939> a<00:02:24.970> thousand<00:02:25.659> seconds<00:02:26.170> so

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
house in which is a thousand seconds so

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.699 
house in which is a thousand seconds so
in<00:02:27.220> effect<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:28.209> actually<00:02:28.599> multiply<00:02:29.260> as<00:02:29.500> soon

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
in effect you actually multiply as soon

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:30.720 
in effect you actually multiply as soon
as<00:02:29.799> you<00:02:29.860> get<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.129> a<00:02:30.159> second<00:02:30.579> you're
