00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:16.610
 good the sea in the background is an effect like 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:20.750
 your name you say that is a force like 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:23.810
 a wave that comes that you do not see 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.110
 like sea boba call you if you see a 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.470
 wave light and on the surface but that 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.500
 has a lot of strength this is not like a 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.160
 wave is normal that we are used to 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:42.080
 to see on the beach that the one who does the 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:45.530
 wave then and bust in this case this is 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.200
 generated by the wind action that 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.800
 it is constantly blowing, striking 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.620
 on a direction and a force to 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.750
 great strength then it goes worth those of 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.590
 mind that begins to push the sea 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.830
 and waves are generated, now that 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.910
 the hours are radiating are going away 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.440
 driving and can travel kilometers 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.440
 miles then 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.020
 is what could be done similar 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.040
 when there is an effect of one of a 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.690
 farc eruption or a tremor that generates a 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.570
 tsunami 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:31.300
 exact the tsunami you do not see it this is 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.510
 a ball that comes as pushing 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.210
 the action that the earth does 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.630
 the force that the energy that brings out 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:44.539
 the earth 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:47.299
 what makes the sea throw what moves it 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:51.159
 because it makes a push is that force that 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:54.230
 energy is a push and the wave is going 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.970
 is going projected is going 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.000
 projecting then asia 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.390
 and let's say in a circle it's going 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.740
 projecting and you do not see on the surface 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.200
 you do not see 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.410
 a ball that is bursting the soul is 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.069
 it looks like a ripple but that's a 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.349
 very tremendous force that travels kilometers 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.900
 then that is what we might call 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.790
 We do not see a swell if we do not 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:26.439
 it lasts 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.930
 since duration is the effect of 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:32.980
 energy that is producing those 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.140
 couples and it ends like this is in this case 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.409
 in this case everything is all this 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.170
 activity that generates this now yes that 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:46.170
 the convective nuclei that form 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:49.890
 a cyclonic system this one 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.730
 it lasts until the end cyclone or 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.980
 the storm or the effect does not 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.400
 But I tell you many times what 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.190
 we live now we have a 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.220
 system is already a tropical storm 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.610
 called grass but this one is very, very 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:12.920
 retired almost to the 200 km 2000 code 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:15.709
 kilometers southwest of cabo san lucas 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.349
 then it practically never affected us 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.930
 and we do not have any, there are no affectations 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.420
 for any the coast of the country without 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.799
 But now we have another system 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.900
 bitter a tropical wave that has then 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.060
 also very very little chance of 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.329
 cyclonic development but that's what we 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.290
 this is pulling all the activity 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.290
 of convective nuclei 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.880
 and that's why we have almost all 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.800
 the cloudy these but the effects of 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.240
 sea ​​of ​​background for us already it happened 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.970
 here on these coasts of 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.910
 how do you say acapulco all this 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.510
 of warrior yes, because there is almost 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.010
 always where all this is generated 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.530
 sea of background 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.920
 this phenomenon was accompanied until 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.920
 rains 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:14.939
 is not this these generate by the let's say 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.979
 the cyclonic systems that are here in 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:19.769
 the peaceful but there is no storm 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.570
 communal not the storm that we have you 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.250
 I say it's fausto but it's very very very 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:30.180
 well almost two thousand two thousand 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.190
 miles of the affections here very 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.790
 good we had affectations the end of 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.060
 this week yesterday 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.310
 because the effect swell that is 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:48.300
 this year 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:50.540
 the stars almost always reflected 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.070
 for example you come by and through 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.070
 let's say of the thing the house of the sailor 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.320
 out there all that and there are times that he is 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.680
 that the wave is bursting up 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:05.420
 for the walk down the street no no no no 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.250
 it would be no no definite should we 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.480
 We precautionaryly suspend it for the 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.880
 boats that make routes 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.670
 Tourist yesterday yesterday nothing 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.230
 now we have very good weather 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.800
 even if you go to the beach and see 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.420
 this because no no no no trip 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.580
 this one we have pretty good 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.880
 that's why we already raise that 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.880
 caution 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.560
 yes yes today it is very calm and dawned 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.990
 without 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.820
 without force then to the sea we can say so 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.570
 that is, the effect of the sea in the background and 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.570
 finished 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:45.340
 if we do not have the port open to everything 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.930
 type of boats all that 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.960
 they provide nautical tourism service are 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.660
 operating we do not have anything now what 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.510
 Only the cloudy is not the cloudy 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.220
 we have but but good away from 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.310
 harm us I think we benefit 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:03.580
 because it 's like this these past weeks 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:06.580
 the heat was tremendous then 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.100
 now it's magnetic and with 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:12.750
 odds that it rains all the 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.750
 During the late evening
