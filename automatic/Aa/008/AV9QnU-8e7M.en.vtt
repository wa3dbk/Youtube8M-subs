00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.710
 hi friends from youtube i'm enderson 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:09.230
 vizcaíno and this time I bring you a 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.960
 new video tutorial teaching them to 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.080
 optimize your windows 7 to go more 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.050
 quick for those who when they are 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.689
 browsing the internet or now in several 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.550
 programs you're locked then I'm going to 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.190
 teach how to make them go more 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.800
 Quick 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.920
 yes you when you install some 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.890
 program or anything else comes out 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:38.260
 a small window notifying you 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:40.690
 that file is unsafe then that 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.330
 that window takes resources away from 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.670
 our computer then what are we going 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:50.170
 to do is go to start control panel 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.629
 and here once in the control panel 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.629
 we are going to give user accounts 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.680
 and once here we go where it says 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.800
 change control settings 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.950
 user accounts we opened 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.820
 and here some will appear who says 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.770
 always notify you that a 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.350
 program try to install software or 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.000
 make change in the team we qualify 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.570
 in the windows configuration when 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.759
 some program does one of these two that 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.340
 they mention here windows right away 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.130
 notify that the place that the file or 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.350
 the program is potentially unsafe 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.380
 then what we are going to do is download 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.100
 this bar where it says not notify me 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.770
 never so that our windows go more 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.190
 fast and do not stay there notifying that 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.660
 the program is potentially unsafe 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.230
 then once here we give you here in 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.810
 to accept 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.500
 and automatically the 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.050
 account control 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.030
 Now what we are going to do is clean 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.850
 clean our versions of any 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.979
 computer garbage whatever the 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.160
 cookies that are stored in our 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.010
 computer when surfing the internet what 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.679
 what are we going to do is Iraqi start and in 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:13.930
 the bar of this we will write percent 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:17.600
 have percent the teacher and we were 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.230
 a window like this will appear 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.390
 to one will appear will be split 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.830
 as it is how we can see all your 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.530
 files are temporary files 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.980
 which is stored in our computer and 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:37.200
 they make windows go slower what 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.200
 let's do is sink control 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:49.220
 we can copy it all and give delete 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.220
 or just suppress and we give yes 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.610
 I get everything because this is a 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:57.450
 qantas file already then I give it 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.569
 omit omit 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.590
 and these are the temporary files that 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.590
 I am using now 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.629
 good and another another step to do that 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.629
 windows go faster 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.739
 we deactivate what is the preview 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.650
 as you can see and the bar 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:25.060
 tools what we're going to do is go 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:28.069
 at the beginning the team gives control this 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.010
 we click right 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.470
 properties 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.420
 the window will appear 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.500
 properties of windows we are going to whom 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:41.320
 says advanced system configuration 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.740
 Here we will see a window like 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.080
 is 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.820
 we go to who says performance 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.860
 visual effects programming 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:53.740
 processor use of memory and memory 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:57.130
 virtual we give in configuration 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.380
 a new window will appear and 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.200
 here we will appear this four 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.240
 options the first is to let wind 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.060
 choose the most appropriate configuration 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.580
 team adopt to have better 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.920
 appearance adopt to have better 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.020
 performance and the last one that is 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.450
 customize what you want 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.600
 do I recommend you write in 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:23.110
 the third one that makes you this is to you 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.290
 and all appearance options like 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.570
 what avoids previous windows and 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:32.080
 this makes our windows use 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:35.150
 more resources and makes everything go slow 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.910
 I recommend you use this one 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.020
 I do not do it because they record you then 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:45.290
 I would close the chant myself but you 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:48.320
 I recommend that now good also 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.180
 I recommend here again shelter us 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.350
 we go to the window of this 15 options 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.930
 advanced says down here says memory 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.660
 virtual that is a page file 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.750
 it's an area of ​​the disk that's the one 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.870
 Windows will use run as if you 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.650
 we give here is not in this button where 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.830
 he says change 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:14.930
 and here we will select the hard disk and 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:17.639
 be the one of or the c and I select the c 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.850
 someone of that custom size 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:24.180
 we write the megas we want 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:28.380
 assign it to paging as if it were 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.570
 ram here yo the and black that is 4 gigas 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.539
 I left it that way because if I change it 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.850
 I would touch restart the pc then good 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:39.080
 you write here what is place 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:43.070
 boot down here gives them a recommendation 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:47.430
 to me he recommends 2 gigas three days 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:50.220
 but as I wanted to assign you four that 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.170
 it's the most I can assign 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.770
 once done this we give here in 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:57.480
 establish and accept it will appear to us 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.270
 a window that will ask us to 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.190
 restart our pc to perform the 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:06.310
 changes 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:09.010
 well once we go we close all this 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:12.310
 and in the description of the video I will leave you 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.930
 a program called be clear that also 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.760
 it serves to clean the files 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.450
 temporary that are stored in your 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.960
 good computer you download it and the 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.960
 install 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:30.340
 once downloaded installed we open it 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.639
 and all we have to do is give 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.639
 who says analyze 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:39.590
 and automatically start will start at 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.590
 analyze our computer 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.470
 here it does not look like all the files 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.780
 temporary we have in our 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:51.530
 computer the only thing we have to do 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:54.500
 it's here in says run the cleaner 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:57.320
 let's accept 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:00.500
 and start cleaning the entire computer 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:04.289
 of temporary files 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:07.589
 now we're going on record 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:09.330
 this is to look for the problems that 

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:12.599
 have wind or what has to do 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:16.470
 with extensions programs and all that 

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:18.840
 What we are going to do is look for problems 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:21.480
 once found all the problems what 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:24.840
 what we have to do is go here 

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:29.490
 where it says repair selected we give 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:32.420
 do not repair selected and we will appear 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:37.020
 down here where it says repaired tickets 

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:38.700
 we give close and here cndh in this 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:41.390
 small window that is called 

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.260
 tools we use to uninstall 

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:47.360
 completely some program that 

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.360
 we do not want to use anymore 

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:55.900
 well nothing all this we close and already 

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:58.810
 will have a faster windows 7 

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:02.350
