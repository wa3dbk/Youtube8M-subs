you you can make milk out of nuts and

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.160 
you you can make milk out of nuts and
seeds<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.560> it's<00:00:16.710> easy<00:00:17.150> my<00:00:18.150> friend<00:00:18.179> Vicky<00:00:18.990> is

here and she is dairy free and doesn't

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.870 
here and she is dairy free and doesn't
know<00:00:21.869> how<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.109> make<00:00:22.410> nut<00:00:22.800> milk<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.580> I'm<00:00:23.699> going

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
know how to make nut milk so I'm going

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.810 
know how to make nut milk so I'm going
to<00:00:23.910> show<00:00:24.089> you<00:00:24.150> how<00:00:24.710> so<00:00:25.710> Vicki<00:00:26.369> do<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.640> know

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
to show you how so Vicki do you know

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.679 
to show you how so Vicki do you know
about<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.419> why<00:00:27.810> we<00:00:28.019> would<00:00:28.199> want<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.470> soak<00:00:28.710> nuts

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
about so why we would want to soak nuts

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.960 
about so why we would want to soak nuts
well<00:00:30.689> if<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.079> start<00:00:31.439> with<00:00:31.560> raw<00:00:31.919> nuts<00:00:32.310> nuts<00:00:32.730> and

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
well if you start with raw nuts nuts and

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.660 
well if you start with raw nuts nuts and
seeds<00:00:33.240> have<00:00:33.720> a<00:00:34.050> natural<00:00:34.650> enzyme<00:00:35.100> inhibitor

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
seeds have a natural enzyme inhibitor

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.880 
seeds have a natural enzyme inhibitor
that's<00:00:36.120> what<00:00:36.360> allows<00:00:36.990> them<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.320> stay<00:00:37.650> on<00:00:37.770> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
that's what allows them to stay on the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.010 
that's what allows them to stay on the
shelf<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.430> long<00:00:38.670> time<00:00:38.970> and<00:00:39.330> when<00:00:39.720> they<00:00:39.840> hit

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
shelf for a long time and when they hit

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.200 
shelf for a long time and when they hit
the<00:00:40.080> ground<00:00:40.380> in<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.070> Sun<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.640> end<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
the ground in the Sun and the end the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.180 
the ground in the Sun and the end the
water<00:00:42.630> hit<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.080> that's<00:00:43.230> when<00:00:43.530> they<00:00:43.620> sprout<00:00:43.980> to

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
water hit it that's when they sprout to

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.030 
water hit it that's when they sprout to
life<00:00:44.400> the<00:00:44.940> enzymes<00:00:45.450> are<00:00:45.660> released<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.680> an

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
life the enzymes are released so an

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.950 
life the enzymes are released so an
enzyme<00:00:47.580> inhibitor<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.240> a<00:00:48.270> good<00:00:48.540> thing<00:00:48.750> it

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
enzyme inhibitor is a good thing it

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.750 
enzyme inhibitor is a good thing it
allows<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.500> nut<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.860> stay<00:00:50.040> on<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> shelf<00:00:50.490> but

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
allows the nut to stay on the shelf but

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.720 
allows the nut to stay on the shelf but
it<00:00:50.910> also<00:00:51.060> doesn't<00:00:51.780> allow<00:00:51.960> us<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.350> digest<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.070> so

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
it also doesn't allow us to digest it so

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.090 
it also doesn't allow us to digest it so
in<00:00:53.880> order<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.180> make<00:00:54.390> nuts<00:00:54.690> more<00:00:54.930> digestible<00:00:55.170> we

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
in order to make nuts more digestible we

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.950 
in order to make nuts more digestible we
can<00:00:56.280> soak<00:00:56.610> them<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.180> will<00:00:57.330> release<00:00:57.720> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
can soak them and it will release the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.200 
can soak them and it will release the
whole<00:00:58.200> life<00:00:58.860> force<00:00:59.190> all<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.760> protein

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
whole life force all of the protein

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.440 
whole life force all of the protein
potential<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.900> it<00:01:01.020> has<00:01:01.370> okay<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.790> add<00:01:02.940> two

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
potential that it has okay so we add two

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.580 
potential that it has okay so we add two
cups<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:04.670> soaked<00:01:05.670> almonds<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.630> six<00:01:07.050> cups<00:01:07.380> of

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
cups of soaked almonds to six cups of

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.980 
cups of soaked almonds to six cups of
water<00:01:08.420> salt<00:01:10.040> flaxseed<00:01:11.630> something<00:01:12.630> sweet<00:01:12.960> like

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
water salt flaxseed something sweet like

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.950 
water salt flaxseed something sweet like
agave<00:01:13.500> nectar<00:01:13.710> and

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.630 

high-powered<00:01:20.960> blender<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:21.560> then<00:01:21.590> add<00:01:22.400> the

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
high-powered blender and then add the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.970 
high-powered blender and then add the
water<00:01:25.510> this<00:01:26.510> is<00:01:26.690> six<00:01:27.020> cups<00:01:27.290> of<00:01:27.470> water

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
water this is six cups of water

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.140 
water this is six cups of water
and<00:01:29.070> two<00:01:29.670> cups<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.240> soaked<00:01:30.840> almonds

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
and two cups of soaked almonds

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.940 
and two cups of soaked almonds
and<00:01:32.270> then<00:01:32.510> to<00:01:32.690> that<00:01:32.720> we're<00:01:33.500> going<00:01:33.680> to<00:01:33.740> add<00:01:33.920> just

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
and then to that we're going to add just

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.660 
and then to that we're going to add just
a<00:01:34.520> pinch<00:01:34.550> of<00:01:35.120> salt<00:01:35.440> this<00:01:36.440> is<00:01:36.620> good<00:01:36.950> sea<00:01:37.190> salt<00:01:37.460> so

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
a pinch of salt this is good sea salt so

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.330 
a pinch of salt this is good sea salt so
it<00:01:38.030> has<00:01:38.390> minerals<00:01:38.870> that<00:01:39.170> has<00:01:39.410> content<00:01:40.010> it<00:01:40.190> has

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
it has minerals that has content it has

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.860 
it has minerals that has content it has
