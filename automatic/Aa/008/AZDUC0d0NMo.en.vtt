00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
gardener just in case I get lucky if you

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.230 
gardener just in case I get lucky if you
rocket<00:00:19.560> jump<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.010> then<00:00:20.130> parachute<00:00:20.580> down<00:00:20.939> onto

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
rocket jump and then parachute down onto

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.599 
rocket jump and then parachute down onto
an<00:00:21.330> enemy<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:22.170> can<00:00:22.439> use<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.039> market<00:00:23.340> gardener

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
an enemy you can use the market gardener

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.550 
an enemy you can use the market gardener
and<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.850> still<00:00:24.029> counts<00:00:24.359> as<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.480> crypt<00:00:24.869> which<00:00:25.350> is

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
and it still counts as a crypt which is

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.500 
and it still counts as a crypt which is
really<00:00:25.800> stupid<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.090> shouldn't<00:00:27.269> happen

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
really stupid and that shouldn't happen

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.750 
really stupid and that shouldn't happen
because<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:28.019> makes<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.380> way<00:00:28.560> too<00:00:28.619> easy<00:00:28.830> but

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
because it makes it way too easy but

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.030 
because it makes it way too easy but
also<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.960> rocket<00:00:31.439> jump<00:00:31.710> to

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
also you have to rocket jump to

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.799 
also you have to rocket jump to
parachute<00:00:32.610> for<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> airstrike<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.600> shoot

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
parachute for the airstrike to shoot

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.020 
parachute for the airstrike to shoot
rockets<00:00:34.079> faster<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.250> if<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.430> just<00:00:35.670> jump<00:00:35.940> off

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
rockets faster so if you just jump off

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.760 
rockets faster so if you just jump off
like<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> Ledge<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.540> then<00:00:36.809> parachute<00:00:37.079> down<00:00:37.440> it

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
like a Ledge and then parachute down it

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.549 
like a Ledge and then parachute down it
makes<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.940> Rockets<00:00:39.660> shoe<00:00:39.870> at<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.079> same<00:00:40.290> speed

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
makes the Rockets shoe at the same speed

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.930 
makes the Rockets shoe at the same speed
and<00:00:40.710> that's<00:00:40.890> stupid<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.640> shouldn't

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
and that's stupid and that shouldn't

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.569 
and that's stupid and that shouldn't
happen<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.450> vile<00:00:42.690> please<00:00:42.989> fix<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:44.219> new

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
demo do more damage yeah kind of agree

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.319

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
with it like damage 600 damage per

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.389 
with it like damage 600 damage per
minute<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.750> ridiculous<00:01:01.559> for<00:01:01.739> any<00:01:02.070> class<00:01:02.370> that

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
minute is ridiculous for any class that

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.310 
minute is ridiculous for any class that
shouldn't<00:01:02.969> happen<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.449> think<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> way<00:01:04.290> that

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
shouldn't happen I think the way that

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.789 
shouldn't happen I think the way that
Valve<00:01:04.739> went<00:01:05.010> about<00:01:06.080> nothing<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.200> demo<00:01:07.409> was

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
Valve went about nothing the demo was

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.520 
Valve went about nothing the demo was
odd<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.280> stupid<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.450> they<00:01:09.570> reverted<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
odd and stupid so they reverted that and

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.770 
odd and stupid so they reverted that and
I<00:01:10.890> assume<00:01:11.490> they'll<00:01:11.880> do<00:01:12.060> something<00:01:12.299> else<00:01:12.630> in

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
I assume they'll do something else in

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.510 
I assume they'll do something else in
the<00:01:12.869> future<00:01:12.990> honestly<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.010> demo<00:01:14.220> needs<00:01:14.430> a

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
the future honestly the demo needs a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.100 
the future honestly the demo needs a
nerf<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:15.090> they're<00:01:15.210> doing<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> wrong<00:01:15.930> way

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
nerf but they're doing in the wrong way

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.310 
nerf but they're doing in the wrong way
let's<00:01:16.830> hope<00:01:17.070> they<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.490> do<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.210> but<00:01:18.600> I'm<00:01:18.900> not

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
let's hope they can do that but I'm not

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.219 
let's hope they can do that but I'm not

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
that's also going to affect the viewing

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.050 
that's also going to affect the viewing
experience<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:16.230> on<00:02:16.709> paper<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.400> looks<00:02:17.459> solid

experience and on paper it looks solid

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.970 
experience and on paper it looks solid
like<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.569> don't<00:02:18.780> see<00:02:19.080> how<00:02:19.319> they<00:02:19.500> can<00:02:19.560> fuck<00:02:19.830> this

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
like I don't see how they can fuck this

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.479 
like I don't see how they can fuck this
up<00:02:20.160> we'll<00:02:20.370> see<00:02:20.750> but<00:02:21.980> you<00:02:22.980> know<00:02:23.099> you<00:02:23.160> never<00:02:23.340> know

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
up we'll see but you know you never know

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.460 
up we'll see but you know you never know
there<00:02:24.180> there<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.569> couple<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:24.989> dates<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:25.319> this

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
there there is a couple of dates in this

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.290 
there there is a couple of dates in this
that<00:02:25.680> don't<00:02:25.890> really<00:02:26.099> matter<00:02:26.310> too<00:02:26.580> much<00:02:26.610> much

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
that don't really matter too much much

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.059 
that don't really matter too much much
they're<00:02:27.569> changing<00:02:27.930> annotations<00:02:28.650> which<00:02:28.830> could

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
they're changing annotations which could

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.890 
they're changing annotations which could
be<00:02:29.190> interesting<00:02:29.700> I've<00:02:29.849> never<00:02:30.269> really<00:02:30.629> used

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
be interesting I've never really used

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.470 
be interesting I've never really used
those<00:02:31.110> too<00:02:31.440> much<00:02:31.470> but<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.390> changing<00:02:33.390> the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
those too much but that changing the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.750 
those too much but that changing the
design<00:02:33.629> of<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.200> if<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.069> do<00:02:35.250> make<00:02:35.430> videos

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
design of that if you do make videos

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.420 
design of that if you do make videos
yourself<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.390> like<00:02:36.420> larger<00:02:37.379> audio<00:02:37.830> libraries

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
yourself is like larger audio libraries

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.460 
yourself is like larger audio libraries
and<00:02:38.610> stuff<00:02:38.879> and<00:02:39.090> there's<00:02:39.450> creative<00:02:40.110> credits

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
and stuff and there's creative credits

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.259 
and stuff and there's creative credits
so<00:02:40.709> if<00:02:40.799> you<00:02:40.890> collaborate<00:02:41.489> with<00:02:41.640> others<00:02:42.030> it's

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
so if you collaborate with others it's

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.270 
so if you collaborate with others it's
easier<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.110> link<00:02:43.349> between<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.799> two<00:02:43.920> channels

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
easier to link between the two channels

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.770 
easier to link between the two channels
and<00:02:44.459> stuff<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.790> don't<00:02:45.090> really<00:02:45.209> know<00:02:45.420> how<00:02:45.569> that's

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
and stuff I don't really know how that's

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.720 
and stuff I don't really know how that's
happening<00:02:45.959> we'll<00:02:46.680> see<00:02:46.920> when<00:02:47.099> actually<00:02:47.549> gets

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
happening we'll see when actually gets

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.910 
happening we'll see when actually gets
rolled<00:02:47.970> out<00:02:48.120> but<00:02:48.599> there<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:48.750> mainly<00:02:49.500> two

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
rolled out but there is mainly two

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.039 
rolled out but there is mainly two
things<00:02:50.579> I<00:02:50.790> want<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.030> discuss<00:02:51.180> in<00:02:51.510> this<00:02:51.599> the

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
things I want to discuss in this the

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.300 
things I want to discuss in this the
first<00:02:52.319> one<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.560> 60<00:02:53.400> frames<00:02:53.760> per<00:02:53.940> second<00:02:54.510> on

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
first one is 60 frames per second on

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.350 
first one is 60 frames per second on
YouTube<00:02:56.310> which<00:02:56.489> makes<00:02:56.700> me<00:02:56.880> incredibly<00:02:57.060> happy

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
YouTube which makes me incredibly happy

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.289 
YouTube which makes me incredibly happy
the<00:02:58.019> first<00:02:58.319> video<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.709> made<00:02:59.220> when<00:02:59.700> I<00:02:59.730> got<00:03:00.090> this

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
the first video I made when I got this

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.650 
the first video I made when I got this
new<00:03:00.569> computer<00:03:01.140> was<00:03:01.799> somebody<00:03:02.730> commenting<00:03:03.390> and

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
new computer was somebody commenting and

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.869 
new computer was somebody commenting and
they<00:03:03.780> said<00:03:04.049> wow<00:03:04.379> you<00:03:04.410> still<00:03:04.950> only<00:03:05.129> upward<00:03:05.700> at

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
they said wow you still only upward at

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.180 
they said wow you still only upward at
30fps<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.200> had<00:03:07.349> to<00:03:07.470> explain<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.920> them

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
30fps and I had to explain to them

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.610 
30fps and I had to explain to them
that's<00:03:08.549> what<00:03:08.700> YouTube<00:03:09.090> cups<00:03:09.329> are<00:03:09.569> I<00:03:09.810> can't<00:03:10.349> go

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
that's what YouTube cups are I can't go

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.470 
that's what YouTube cups are I can't go
further<00:03:10.890> than<00:03:11.069> that<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.640> then<00:03:11.970> for<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.239> while

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
further than that and then for a while

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.119 
further than that and then for a while
you<00:03:12.720> know<00:03:12.840> they've<00:03:13.019> been<00:03:13.049> out<00:03:13.290> in<00:03:13.379> like<00:03:13.530> 4k

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
you know they've been out in like 4k

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.710 
you know they've been out in like 4k
resolutions<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.030> all<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:15.299> fancy<00:03:15.510> stuff

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
resolutions and all this fancy stuff

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.140 
resolutions and all this fancy stuff
it's<00:03:16.379> probably<00:03:16.650> not<00:03:16.890> going<00:03:17.099> to<00:03:17.160> be<00:03:17.220> used<00:03:17.609> when

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
it's probably not going to be used when

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.449 
it's probably not going to be used when
simply<00:03:18.630> 60fps<00:03:19.230> would<00:03:19.769> just<00:03:20.100> be<00:03:20.220> nice<00:03:20.400> and

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459
