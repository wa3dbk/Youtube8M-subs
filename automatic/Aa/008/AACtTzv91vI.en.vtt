00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.020 
right so my thoughts about this well
it's<00:01:46.439> really<00:01:46.649> not<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.009> best<00:01:47.040> move<00:01:47.490> if<00:01:47.729> this<00:01:47.909> is

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
it's really not the best move if this is

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.330 
it's really not the best move if this is
what<00:01:48.180> Microsoft<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.840> thinking<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.259> do<00:01:49.439> sure

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
what Microsoft is thinking to do sure

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.889 
what Microsoft is thinking to do sure
you<00:01:50.579> know<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.970> their<00:01:51.119> point<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.479> eyes<00:01:51.659> they

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
you know in their point of eyes they

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.149 
you know in their point of eyes they
probably<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.320> different<00:01:52.649> thoughts<00:01:52.799> about

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
probably have different thoughts about

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.120 
probably have different thoughts about
this<00:01:53.600> you<00:01:54.600> know<00:01:54.630> thinking<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.619> might<00:01:55.649> do

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
this you know thinking that it might do

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.010 
this you know thinking that it might do
something<00:01:56.430> better<00:01:56.850> for<00:01:57.030> them<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.540> maybe<00:01:57.810> it

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
something better for them and maybe it

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.840 
something better for them and maybe it
will<00:01:58.049> who<00:01:58.469> knows<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.979> know<00:01:59.100> maybe<00:01:59.610> they<00:01:59.729> got

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
will who knows you know maybe they got

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.730 
will who knows you know maybe they got
something<00:01:59.909> behind<00:02:00.329> their<00:02:00.689> backs<00:02:00.899> but<00:02:01.680> I

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
something behind their backs but I

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.440 
something behind their backs but I
really<00:02:02.040> don't<00:02:02.189> see<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.520> potential<00:02:03.030> with<00:02:03.420> this

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
really don't see the potential with this

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.200 
really don't see the potential with this
whole<00:02:03.780> too<00:02:03.990> because<00:02:04.259> tons<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.280> people<00:02:05.579> tons<00:02:06.000> of

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
whole too because tons of people tons of

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.300 
whole too because tons of people tons of
people<00:02:06.360> buy<00:02:06.689> used<00:02:07.049> games<00:02:07.290> at<00:02:07.799> stores<00:02:08.220> like

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
people buy used games at stores like

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.820 
people buy used games at stores like

right now I used to work at a gamestop

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.360 
right now I used to work at a gamestop
store<00:02:11.630> and<00:02:11.900> every<00:02:12.500> single<00:02:12.800> customer<00:02:12.980> that

walked into the store was either looking

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.830 
walked into the store was either looking
at<00:02:15.800> a<00:02:15.830> used<00:02:15.890> game<00:02:16.310> or<00:02:16.610> actually<00:02:17.120> selling<00:02:17.690> their

at a used game or actually selling their
games<00:02:18.080> most<00:02:18.560> of<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.920> time<00:02:19.130> you<00:02:19.850> know<00:02:20.000> there

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
games most of the time you know there

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.730 
games most of the time you know there
will<00:02:20.300> be<00:02:20.420> of<00:02:20.540> course<00:02:20.570> some<00:02:21.110> people<00:02:21.170> here<00:02:21.650> and

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
will be of course some people here and

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.500 
will be of course some people here and
they're<00:02:21.890> buying<00:02:22.220> new<00:02:22.430> games<00:02:22.670> but<00:02:23.000> most<00:02:23.240> of<00:02:23.450> the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
they're buying new games but most of the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.450 
they're buying new games but most of the
time<00:02:23.750> people<00:02:24.020> are<00:02:24.740> actually<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.310> know

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
time people are actually you know

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.430 
time people are actually you know
browsing<00:02:26.000> around<00:02:26.120> looking<00:02:26.570> at<00:02:26.690> use<00:02:26.930> games<00:02:27.200> and

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
browsing around looking at use games and

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.460 
browsing around looking at use games and
purchasing<00:02:27.890> them<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:29.180> if<00:02:29.540> Microsoft<00:02:30.140> were<00:02:30.350> to

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
purchasing them so if Microsoft were to

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.440 
purchasing them so if Microsoft were to
pull<00:02:30.680> this<00:02:30.860> move<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:31.430> would<00:02:31.550> definitely<00:02:32.210> put<00:02:32.390> a

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
pull this move it would definitely put a

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.960 
pull this move it would definitely put a
huge<00:02:32.780> impact<00:02:33.230> on<00:02:33.560> stores<00:02:34.190> like<00:02:34.400> game<00:02:34.640> stuff

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
huge impact on stores like game stuff

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.450 
huge impact on stores like game stuff
for<00:02:35.210> example<00:02:35.780> or<00:02:35.990> you<00:02:36.740> know<00:02:36.860> all<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.160> stores

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
for example or you know all the stores

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.460 
for example or you know all the stores
that<00:02:37.670> possibly<00:02:38.120> hold<00:02:38.420> use<00:02:38.720> games<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.350> stuff

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
that possibly hold use games and stuff

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.110 
that possibly hold use games and stuff
like<00:02:39.650> that<00:02:39.710> it<00:02:40.100> really<00:02:40.130> wouldn't<00:02:40.730> be<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.880> good

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
like that it really wouldn't be a good

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.530 
like that it really wouldn't be a good
move<00:02:41.360> here<00:02:41.390> now<00:02:42.350> I've<00:02:42.530> heard<00:02:42.770> things<00:02:43.040> that

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
move here now I've heard things that

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.880 
move here now I've heard things that
apparently<00:02:44.540> I<00:02:44.600> might<00:02:44.900> be<00:02:45.050> able<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.440> play<00:02:45.590> used

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
apparently I might be able to play used

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.890 
apparently I might be able to play used
games<00:02:46.010> but<00:02:46.520> only<00:02:46.850> on<00:02:46.880> your<00:02:47.180> console

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
games but only on your console

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.630 
games but only on your console
apparently<00:02:48.500> people<00:02:48.680> are<00:02:48.950> thinking<00:02:49.190> like<00:02:49.459> oh

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
apparently people are thinking like oh

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.160 
apparently people are thinking like oh
maybe<00:02:49.850> it'll<00:02:50.150> come<00:02:50.300> with<00:02:50.420> like<00:02:50.630> a<00:02:50.660> serial

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
maybe it'll come with like a serial

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.230 
maybe it'll come with like a serial
number<00:02:51.530> all<00:02:52.220> right<00:02:52.430> so<00:02:52.640> like<00:02:52.760> maybe<00:02:52.970> when

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
number all right so like maybe when

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.300 
number all right so like maybe when
someone<00:02:53.660> sells<00:02:53.900> their<00:02:54.140> game<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.980> store

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
someone sells their game the store

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.860 
someone sells their game the store
employees<00:02:55.790> have<00:02:55.970> to<00:02:56.060> make<00:02:56.240> up<00:02:56.270> some<00:02:56.570> sort<00:02:56.780> of

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
employees have to make up some sort of

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.530 
employees have to make up some sort of
code<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.500> put<00:02:58.100> it<00:02:58.190> inside<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.700> box<00:02:58.940> and<00:02:59.330> when

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
code and put it inside the box and when

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.090 
code and put it inside the box and when
you<00:02:59.630> enter<00:02:59.900> that<00:03:00.050> code<00:03:00.230> into<00:03:00.470> your<00:03:00.560> console

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
you enter that code into your console

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.820 
you enter that code into your console
the<00:03:01.790> disc<00:03:02.060> will<00:03:02.180> only<00:03:02.390> work<00:03:02.660> on<00:03:02.900> that<00:03:03.260> console

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
the disc will only work on that console

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.040 
the disc will only work on that console
not<00:03:04.100> anyone<00:03:04.520> elses<00:03:04.910> all<00:03:05.150> right<00:03:05.270> so<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:05.930> guess

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
not anyone elses all right so I guess

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.730 
not anyone elses all right so I guess
they're<00:03:06.380> doing<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:06.860> too<00:03:07.459> I<00:03:08.030> guess<00:03:08.870> you<00:03:09.650> know

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
they're doing that too I guess you know

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.680 
they're doing that too I guess you know
I<00:03:09.770> guess<00:03:10.100> it's<00:03:10.280> like<00:03:10.459> you<00:03:10.850> know<00:03:10.970> trying<00:03:11.570> to

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
I guess it's like you know trying to

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.720 
I guess it's like you know trying to
make<00:03:11.900> people<00:03:12.200> not<00:03:12.350> copy<00:03:12.680> games<00:03:12.980> or<00:03:13.310> lend<00:03:13.520> games

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
make people not copy games or lend games

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.790 
make people not copy games or lend games
other<00:03:13.970> people<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.570> stuff<00:03:14.750> like<00:03:14.900> that<00:03:14.959> that's

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
other people and stuff like that that's

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.949 
other people and stuff like that that's
what<00:03:15.980> I'm<00:03:16.070> guessing<00:03:16.580> I'm<00:03:16.940> sure<00:03:17.300> piracy<00:03:17.840> is

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
what I'm guessing I'm sure piracy is

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.050 
what I'm guessing I'm sure piracy is
somewhat<00:03:18.350> involved<00:03:18.650> in<00:03:18.890> there<00:03:19.070> and<00:03:19.340> just

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
somewhat involved in there and just

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.940 
somewhat involved in there and just
people<00:03:20.450> lending<00:03:20.780> games<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.230> others<00:03:21.470> for<00:03:21.500> free

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
people lending games to others for free

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.040 
people lending games to others for free
so<00:03:22.580> i<00:03:22.610> guess<00:03:22.820> it's<00:03:23.030> that's<00:03:23.300> what<00:03:23.450> microsoft<00:03:23.959> is

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
so i guess it's that's what microsoft is

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.630 
so i guess it's that's what microsoft is
possibly<00:03:24.500> thinking<00:03:24.830> about<00:03:25.040> that's<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.459> only

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
possibly thinking about that's the only

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.430 
possibly thinking about that's the only
thing<00:03:25.760> that<00:03:25.940> I<00:03:25.970> can<00:03:26.090> think<00:03:26.209> about<00:03:26.450> here<00:03:26.900> you

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
thing that I can think about here you

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.580 
thing that I can think about here you
know<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.800> reason<00:03:28.130> why<00:03:28.160> Microsoft<00:03:29.120> is

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
know the reason why Microsoft is

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.960 
know the reason why Microsoft is
possibly<00:03:30.590> just<00:03:30.890> possibly<00:03:30.920> trying<00:03:31.550> to<00:03:31.670> do<00:03:31.820> this

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
possibly just possibly trying to do this

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.910 
possibly just possibly trying to do this
and<00:03:32.269> of<00:03:32.420> course<00:03:32.450> as<00:03:32.900> I've<00:03:33.140> said<00:03:33.320> before<00:03:33.380> this

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
and of course as I've said before this

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.830 
and of course as I've said before this
really<00:03:34.250> isn't<00:03:34.430> a<00:03:34.640> good<00:03:34.670> move<00:03:35.030> by<00:03:35.239> Microsoft

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
really isn't a good move by Microsoft

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.120 
really isn't a good move by Microsoft
because<00:03:36.140> it<00:03:36.290> would<00:03:36.380> definitely<00:03:36.560> impact

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
because it would definitely impact

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.460 
because it would definitely impact

read<00:04:18.979> an<00:04:19.130> article<00:04:19.340> that<00:04:20.270> this<00:04:20.660> thing<00:04:20.930> might

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
read an article that this thing might

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.350

not<00:04:21.169> be<00:04:21.440> so<00:04:21.620> disappointed

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
not be so disappointed

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.940 
not be so disappointed
apparently<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.390> was<00:04:24.780> reading<00:04:25.170> an<00:04:25.380> article<00:04:25.530> and

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
apparently I was reading an article and

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.200 
apparently I was reading an article and
I<00:04:25.980> was<00:04:26.100> talking<00:04:26.520> about<00:04:26.580> this<00:04:26.910> whole<00:04:27.060> entire

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
I was talking about this whole entire

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.320 
I was talking about this whole entire
rumor<00:04:27.870> and<00:04:28.080> yes<00:04:28.920> it<00:04:29.190> sounds<00:04:29.430> disappointing

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
rumor and yes it sounds disappointing

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.850 
rumor and yes it sounds disappointing
but<00:04:30.450> yet<00:04:30.660> there's<00:04:30.840> a<00:04:30.900> positive<00:04:31.080> thing<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:31.710> it

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
but yet there's a positive thing to it

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.570 
but yet there's a positive thing to it
as<00:04:31.950> well<00:04:31.980> the<00:04:32.760> positive<00:04:32.970> thing<00:04:33.330> is<00:04:33.540> that<00:04:34.580> the

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
as well the positive thing is that the

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.250 
as well the positive thing is that the
reason<00:04:35.730> why<00:04:36.150> it's<00:04:36.390> going<00:04:36.540> to<00:04:36.600> be<00:04:36.660> positive<00:04:36.840> is

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
reason why it's going to be positive is

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.520 
reason why it's going to be positive is
because<00:04:37.650> if<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.730> xbox<00:04:38.970> 720<00:04:39.600> doesn't<00:04:40.110> play<00:04:40.290> use

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
because if the xbox 720 doesn't play use

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.590 
because if the xbox 720 doesn't play use
games<00:04:40.830> it<00:04:41.100> only<00:04:41.220> takes<00:04:41.550> new<00:04:41.790> games<00:04:42.060> all<00:04:42.480> right
