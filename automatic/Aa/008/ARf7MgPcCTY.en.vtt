00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.420
 hi girls okay today I came 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.850
 share with you a super tips 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.610
 makeup that is like making a 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.160
 outlined with pencil and not with eyeliner 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.830
 pencil is not 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.109
 It is so beautiful, so striking and so 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.269
 accurate as the one outlined with 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.460
 liquid eyeliner however it is very 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.980
 easier those days that you are 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.840
 no time for it because the eyeliner 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.599
 There are a lot of these 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.730
 so my trick is to do the outline with 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.430
 dinho tombstones smoking because there is no 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.860
 nothing more than to leave the effect 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.870
 more natural for certain occasions 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.120
 I hope you like the tip let's go 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.190
 keep track of how I do is very fast and 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.680
 very simple, we do not have 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.409
 You'll see that it's very fast. 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.180
 and practical make out with pencil 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:54.860
 so you will catch the lapse that you 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.799
 chose in the case today I will make a 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.059
 outlined brown and then I'll make a 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:04.790
 stroke may be irregular need not be 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.600
 right through my whole range of 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:12.380
 eyes trying to narrow down a bit more here 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.600
 in the corner without making a pull is ok 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.420
 There you go and get the brush. 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.940
 bevelled, it is important that it be a 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.130
 little harder do not have the exits 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.490
 very annoying because that's what's going on 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.550
 to help us fade that side and then 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.890
 It's just you came with that lapse and doing 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.820
 back movements so that it does not 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:38.230
 stay ticked and it will fade day after 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.230
 We'll do it for nobody. 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.229
 Okay, now that we've both gone 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.540
 sides 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:59.780
 it's time to pull mullet and it's very simple 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.119
 just do a little bit like you 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.259
 I was doing with the eyeliner 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.200
 liquid 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.630
 if you have with popular as is the case of 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.190
 What do you do 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:16.430
 put a little bit and make the dash 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.540
 A little bit is on sale and fading 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:24.680
 this pencil because like he does not need 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.470
 be as upright as the 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.440
 delineated with liquid eyeliner pl is 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.910
 It's very simple, do not worry, it's okay. 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.910
 get blurry or anything 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.530
 I'm just going to end with convex mask 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.650
 for pencil eyelashes in the case water line 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.410
 You want girls and that's how it is 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.630
 I do my outline with her in five 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.640
 minutes that day I 'm out of time 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.640
 to do the outline with eyeliner 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.579
 liquid that well prepared that raul 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.130
 it just seems like a lot and if it delineates it fades 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.489
 Dino is my trick is my solution 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.870
 I really hope you liked it. 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.269
 besides having a more natural result 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.070
 for day to day is also an option for 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.739
 Who do you like to keep an eye on? 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.109

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.120

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.190
