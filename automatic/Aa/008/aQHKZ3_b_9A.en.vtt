if<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.710> get<00:01:10.860> really<00:01:11.070> close<00:01:11.250> guys<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:14.060> as

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
if I can get really close guys and as

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.480 
if I can get really close guys and as
you<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.360> see<00:01:15.420> when<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.900> stretch<00:01:16.140> them<00:01:16.320> out<00:01:16.490> all

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
you can see when I stretch them out all

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.719 
you can see when I stretch them out all
the<00:01:17.790> way<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.390> would<00:01:18.990> say<00:01:19.380> my<00:01:19.799> guess<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.610> that

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
the way I would say my guess is that

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.700 
the way I would say my guess is that
they're<00:01:20.939> about<00:01:21.659> an<00:01:21.840> eighth<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.350> one's<00:01:22.590> about

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
they're about an eighth this one's about

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.820 
they're about an eighth this one's about
at<00:01:22.920> an<00:01:23.040> eighth<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.960> would<00:01:25.140> say<00:01:25.170> is

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
at an eighth and this one I would say is

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.310 
at an eighth and this one I would say is
a<00:01:26.549> little<00:01:27.119> bit<00:01:27.270> bigger<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:27.720> in-between<00:01:27.930> an

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
a little bit bigger like in-between an

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.640 
a little bit bigger like in-between an
eight<00:01:28.560> mistakes<00:01:29.180> um<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.240> don't<00:01:31.229> know<00:01:31.320> why<00:01:31.470> that

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
eight mistakes um I don't know why that

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.749 
eight mistakes um I don't know why that
one's<00:01:31.799> shrinking<00:01:32.130> faster<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:32.850> whatever<00:01:33.390> um<00:01:33.750> I

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
one's shrinking faster but whatever um I

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.870 
one's shrinking faster but whatever um I
have<00:01:35.759> not<00:01:35.939> had<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.780> do<00:01:37.680> anything<00:01:37.710> harsh<00:01:38.460> like

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
have not had to do anything harsh like

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.810 
have not had to do anything harsh like
sandpaper<00:01:39.509> or<00:01:39.840> anything<00:01:40.079> yet<00:01:40.560> um<00:01:41.009> hopefully

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
sandpaper or anything yet um hopefully

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.270 
sandpaper or anything yet um hopefully
we<00:01:42.000> won't<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.840> we'll<00:01:42.960> see<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.439> am

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
we won't have to but we'll see I am

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.539 
we won't have to but we'll see I am
already<00:01:44.790> able<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.479> wear<00:01:45.630> these<00:01:45.869> earrings

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.510 

they're<00:01:50.549> just<00:01:50.759> giant<00:01:51.920> squares<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.399> only

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
they're just giant squares and the only

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.889 
they're just giant squares and the only
thing<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.729> would<00:01:53.820> worry<00:01:54.030> about<00:01:54.090> mostly<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
thing I would worry about mostly is the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.840 
thing I would worry about mostly is the
back<00:01:55.200> pulling<00:01:55.680> through<00:01:55.920> but<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.700> back

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
back pulling through but the back

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.940 
back pulling through but the back
definitely<00:01:57.420> isn't<00:01:57.930> going<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.170> go<00:01:58.259> through<00:01:58.530> so

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
definitely isn't going to go through so

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.520 
definitely isn't going to go through so
I<00:01:59.009> can<00:01:59.310> wear<00:01:59.549> one<00:02:00.390> pair<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.930> normal<00:02:01.049> earrings

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
I can wear one pair of normal earrings

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.800 
I can wear one pair of normal earrings
not<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.219> my<00:02:02.310> ears<00:02:02.520> are<00:02:02.790> down<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.540> size

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
not that my ears are down to that size

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.660 
not that my ears are down to that size
but<00:02:04.500> at<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.829> front<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.159> back<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.520> big

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
but at the front in the back is big

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.980 
but at the front in the back is big
enough<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.210> not<00:02:06.240> gonna<00:02:06.450> pull<00:02:06.719> through

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
enough that it's not gonna pull through

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.469 
enough that it's not gonna pull through
so<00:02:07.200> um

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
so um

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.540 
so um
hopefully<00:02:10.319> hopefully<00:02:10.470> hopefully<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.280> keeps

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
hopefully hopefully hopefully it keeps

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.160 
hopefully hopefully hopefully it keeps
shrinking<00:02:12.209> they<00:02:12.480> keep<00:02:12.659> shrinking<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:13.110> I

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
shrinking they keep shrinking and I

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.449 
shrinking they keep shrinking and I
won't<00:02:13.319> have<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.560> do<00:02:13.650> anything<00:02:13.830> drastic<00:02:14.010> like

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
won't have to do anything drastic like

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.160 
won't have to do anything drastic like
sandpapering

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
sandpapering
