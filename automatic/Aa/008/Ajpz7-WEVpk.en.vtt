00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.060
 this little tutorial and where I am 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.580
 Show you guys now you will be your windows 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.500
 8th 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.820
 turn off this search index 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.799
 or he wants to call himself always 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.420
 sorry can pronounce that very well 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.210
 I'll show you what I do all the time 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:23.310
 with mine and that always starts so always 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.140
 this weird search index i know 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.539
 that is different but here searchmetrics 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.970
 creation and very annoying 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.309
 this is the windows 8 which should almost 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.930
 always through and then the hard drive 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.270
 totally overloaded and that is always 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.309
 a little bit of you and I will tell you now 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.640
 how to disable the whole permanently 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.280
 can 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.899
 and that saves resources and you can 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.309
 Nevertheless, I am still looking for fast 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.129
 do not have the feeling somehow now 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.629
 that's supposed to be slow by that 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.520
 sweat quite vill computer faster 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.910
 and it goes as follows oppressed the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.920
 windows button + he and then you are in 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.489
 this menu execute and are there 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.320
 their services msc is even ok 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.780
 now you have to wait a bit 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.680
 Now you have to look like this from this list 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.750
 in windows search here the fesche revier 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.700
 comes and there is still a right click 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.350
 properties on it 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.869
 then you go on that I think that was it 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.900
 exactly in general I'm sorry 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.450
 press and then on start type of war 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.759
 others and then you will be deactivated 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.470
 but now click on ok 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.130
 and now it should all be now 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.380
 accomplished 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.810
 I 'm going to do that in the box job 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.790
 thing then still if the still 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.189
 should be running well he is still running 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.390
 little 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.210
 now you do right again wittrock 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.880
 and clicks end it should take it 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.340
 a bit and now the windows 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.810
 search modified cities will disable them 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.149
 can see my characteristics 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.009
 Apple also stays disabled and now 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.290
 it comes very close and you'll 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.450
 the annoying search index los the 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.070
 just makes system slower and slower 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.899
 actually should now be on windows 8 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.360
 run faster again than before 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.179
 at least that's what I've been like when I was 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.410
 I would have done it all 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.569
 bye bye and to the next motto people 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.250
 and for more meaningless eighth goal i am 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.140
 White 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.420
 Of course, still completely 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.220
 orders like base and everything but 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.140
 but also for more windows 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.730
 tutorials also has windows 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.300
 tutorial should do again eg windows 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.250
