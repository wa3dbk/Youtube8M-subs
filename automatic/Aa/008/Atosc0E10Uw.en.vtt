while you're aiming snapshot for aiming
if<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:01.079> stop<00:02:01.290> for<00:02:01.530> stability<00:02:01.740> field

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
if you just stop for stability field

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.310 
if you just stop for stability field
scout<00:02:02.850> for<00:02:03.149> more<00:02:03.360> ammo<00:02:03.570> which<00:02:03.869> would<00:02:04.020> be<00:02:04.110> nice

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
scout for more ammo which would be nice

scout for more ammo which would be nice
hopefully<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.979> would<00:02:05.040> push<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.520> six

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
hopefully that would push it to six

a<00:02:59.280> bad<00:02:59.370> deal<00:02:59.760> I<00:02:59.820> always<00:03:00.270> thought<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:01.140> many

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
a bad deal I always thought that it many

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.620 
a bad deal I always thought that it many
had<00:03:01.560> five<00:03:01.920> in<00:03:02.160> stock<00:03:02.520> but<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.360> can<00:03:03.510> actually

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
had five in stock but you can actually

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.330 
had five in stock but you can actually
go<00:03:03.959> one<00:03:04.230> two<00:03:05.300> three<00:03:06.300> four<00:03:07.170> like<00:03:07.470> that<00:03:07.709> so<00:03:07.950> that

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
go one two three four like that so that

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.220 
go one two three four like that so that
gets<00:03:08.550> you<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.760> lot<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:09.390> heavy<00:03:09.540> ammo<00:03:09.930> for<00:03:10.140> a

next one we'll see you later just a
quick<00:03:29.880> addition<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.480> this<00:03:30.600> video<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:30.989> wanted<00:03:31.350> to

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
quick addition to this video I wanted to

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.340 
quick addition to this video I wanted to
see<00:03:31.680> whether<00:03:31.970> if<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.150> wore<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.600> pumpkin<00:03:34.110> on

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
see whether if you wore the pumpkin on

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.340 
see whether if you wore the pumpkin on
your<00:03:34.650> head<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.250> makes<00:03:35.900> do<00:03:36.900> anything

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
your head it makes do anything

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.420 
your head it makes do anything
differently<00:03:37.800> so<00:03:38.100> let's<00:03:38.310> use<00:03:38.580> one<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:38.790> these

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
differently so let's use one of these

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.250 
differently so let's use one of these
and<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.670> gives<00:03:41.850> us<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.180> halloween<00:03:42.570> pumpkin

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
and that gives us the halloween pumpkin

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.380 
and that gives us the halloween pumpkin
head<00:03:43.470> for<00:03:43.890> 30<00:03:44.160> minutes<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.790> wanted<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.209> see

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
head for 30 minutes I wanted to see

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.850 
head for 30 minutes I wanted to see
because<00:03:45.600> there<00:03:45.900> are<00:03:46.019> some<00:03:46.230> more<00:03:46.410> sparrows
