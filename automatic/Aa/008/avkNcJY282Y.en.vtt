00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:10.400 
again so we can go on to the nighttime
scene<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:05.729> here<00:02:06.390> we<00:02:06.479> are<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:09.509> second<00:02:09.959> part<00:02:10.170> of

you had to jump I believe that was the
pattern<00:04:14.140> last<00:04:14.350> time<00:04:14.530> I<00:04:14.560> just<00:04:14.830> crouched<00:04:15.100> under

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
pattern last time I just crouched under

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.030 
pattern last time I just crouched under
it<00:04:16.140> this<00:04:17.140> time<00:04:17.170> you<00:04:17.380> have<00:04:17.500> to<00:04:17.530> jump<00:04:17.770> in<00:04:17.950> the

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
it this time you have to jump in the

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.670 
it this time you have to jump in the
middle

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:34.480 

now<00:04:23.680> let's<00:04:23.949> see<00:04:26.460> you<00:04:27.460> just<00:04:27.639> go<00:04:27.819> down<00:04:28.060> here

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.830 

and<00:04:35.490> kill<00:04:36.030> some<00:04:36.270> worse<00:04:36.509> guillotines<00:04:38.840> without

once now I know there's a ghost down
here<00:04:48.150> I've<00:04:48.330> fallen<00:04:48.660> for<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.020> several<00:04:49.560> times

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
here I've fallen for it several times

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.820 
here I've fallen for it several times
it's<00:04:51.300> cheap<00:04:51.810> and<00:04:51.990> I'm<00:04:52.139> not<00:04:52.320> falling<00:04:52.620> for<00:04:52.680> it

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
it's cheap and I'm not falling for it

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.620 
it's cheap and I'm not falling for it
again<00:04:55.729> and<00:04:56.729> I<00:04:56.759> could<00:04:57.000> have<00:04:57.120> dropped<00:04:57.300> through

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
again and I could have dropped through

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.240 
again and I could have dropped through
the<00:04:57.660> platform<00:04:58.259> here<00:04:58.470> but<00:04:58.620> I<00:04:58.680> forgot<00:04:59.009> about

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
the platform here but I forgot about

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.610 
the platform here but I forgot about
that<00:05:00.949> and<00:05:01.949> I<00:05:03.110> somehow<00:05:04.110> avoided<00:05:04.530> getting

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
that and I somehow avoided getting

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.240 
that and I somehow avoided getting
killed<00:05:04.979> by<00:05:05.070> those<00:05:05.220> ghosts<00:05:05.699> and<00:05:06.560> oh<00:05:07.560> my<00:05:07.860> god<00:05:08.130> is

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
but this is pretty darn easy and now

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.480 
but this is pretty darn easy and now
it's<00:05:23.760> time<00:05:24.060> to<00:05:24.240> talk<00:05:24.419> about<00:05:24.449> what<00:05:25.020> effect

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
it's time to talk about what effect

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.920 
it's time to talk about what effect
finding<00:05:26.490> van<00:05:26.789> Helsing<00:05:27.240> during<00:05:27.449> the<00:05:27.539> daytime

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
finding van Helsing during the daytime

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.960 
finding van Helsing during the daytime
levels<00:05:28.289> has<00:05:28.530> normally<00:05:29.520> when<00:05:29.639> you<00:05:29.729> run<00:05:29.820> out<00:05:29.849> of

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
levels has normally when you run out of

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.689 
levels has normally when you run out of
ammo<00:05:30.419> you'll<00:05:31.110> get<00:05:31.289> replenished<00:05:32.130> with<00:05:32.370> one

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
ammo you'll get replenished with one

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.150 
ammo you'll get replenished with one
stone<00:05:33.030> but<00:05:33.720> if<00:05:33.810> you<00:05:33.900> find<00:05:34.169> van<00:05:34.530> Helsing<00:05:34.979> in<00:05:35.070> the

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
stone but if you find van Helsing in the

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.100 
stone but if you find van Helsing in the
daytime<00:05:35.520> then<00:05:36.449> you'll<00:05:36.900> get<00:05:37.169> two<00:05:37.650> stones<00:05:38.039> and

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
daytime then you'll get two stones and

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.790 
daytime then you'll get two stones and
this<00:05:40.110> guy<00:05:40.349> takes<00:05:41.160> a<00:05:41.490> lot<00:05:42.090> of<00:05:42.330> hits<00:05:42.800> I'm

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
this guy takes a lot of hits I'm

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.740 
this guy takes a lot of hits I'm
guessing<00:05:44.639> us<00:05:44.789> to<00:05:44.910> compensate<00:05:45.479> for<00:05:45.660> the<00:05:45.720> fact

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
guessing us to compensate for the fact

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.279 
guessing us to compensate for the fact
that<00:05:46.080> he's<00:05:46.289> incredibly<00:05:46.830> easy<00:05:47.570> but<00:05:48.570> it's<00:05:49.020> just

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
that he's incredibly easy but it's just

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.850 
that he's incredibly easy but it's just
kind<00:05:49.500> of<00:05:49.560> time<00:05:49.889> consuming<00:05:50.550> and<00:05:50.639> annoying<00:05:50.760> I

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
kind of time consuming and annoying I

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.620 
kind of time consuming and annoying I
think<00:05:52.860> if<00:05:52.979> I<00:05:53.070> counted<00:05:53.310> right<00:05:55.010> he<00:05:56.010> took<00:05:56.330> 16<00:05:57.330> hits

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
think if I counted right he took 16 hits

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.520 
think if I counted right he took 16 hits
with<00:05:57.810> the<00:05:57.930> double<00:05:58.229> stones<00:05:59.270> which<00:06:00.270> is<00:06:00.870> like<00:06:01.139> 32

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
with the double stones which is like 32

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.070 
with the double stones which is like 32
regular<00:06:02.190> hits

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
regular hits

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.270 
regular hits
that's<00:06:03.680> just<00:06:03.889> ridiculous<00:06:05.919> under<00:06:06.919> the<00:06:07.039> next

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
that's just ridiculous under the next

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.520 
that's just ridiculous under the next
stage
