00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.019
 as gt3 are built since 1999 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.790
 sports version of the 911 what with 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.190
 called water-cooled suction motor 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.800
 his predecessors the between our 72nd 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.689
 and 97 were built under drove 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.609
 the name carrera rs for porsche connoisseur 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.920
 the gt3 is always something else 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.660
 has been only a sports car 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.840
 he is not only one of the fastest 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.820
 911 but also one of the most honest 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.980
 little electronics for more driving experience 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.960
 you need to master it 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.770
 some experience that makes but 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.770
 customer circle clearly 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.370
 demographically a family man 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.230
 usually over 40 already relatively mature 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.510
 the car is mostly as a third or 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.790
 Fourth vehicle used and the 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.769
 most owners of a gt3 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.000
 experience only a few thousand kilometers in the 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:02.800
 really use this only for the year 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.110
 own fun with his 350 kw stapler 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.990
 GT3 sprint to 100 kilometers per hour 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.700
 in 3.5 seconds at a 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.380
 speed of 315 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.270
 kilometer is then but conclusion 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.729
 the manufacturer communicates the consumption 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.729
 12.4 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.009
 and so he looks out of the new his 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.869
 Forms strongly end the predecessor the 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.460
 Modifications of the body send on 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.710
 to recognize the second view 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.250
 Large air intakes leave the grim 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.250
 appear 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.260
 Of course, Xenon headlights are also 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.200
 with on board the round housing again to the 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.490
 Brand of the 911 series 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.280
 Overall, the athlete brings among the 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.610
 new elfer only 1430 kilograms on the 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.610
 Libra 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.450
 it is deeper than the basic model 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.640
 become wider and longer 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.830
 it is standard at 20 inches 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.510
 sport the danger of aquaplaning 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.050
 is not so 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.050
 locked out 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.700
 the mighty one provides for contact pressure 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.760
 rear spoiler put something under 3.8 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:30.820
 liter rear engine with stately 440th 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:32.710
 Newton meters in Zuffenhausen is one of the 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.690
 opinion the new generation needs 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.270
 a revolution and here in the new 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.590
 Porsche GT3 actually has one and 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.510
 two was here on the handshake 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.910
 completely waived we have here 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.350
 new pdk blocks the 100 milliseconds 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.090
 the gears can change 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.920
 whether that is any porsche purist 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.460
 will like it or not will be fine 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.460
 still have to show 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.370
 but the future porsche driver 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.260
 will probably be quite fast with it 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.730
 Of course, you can arrange 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.890
 you still on the steering wheel with the 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.020
 switch parrot or the automatic 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.890
 to select lever so that manually 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.890
 can be switched 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.599
 Another innovation is the active one 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.489
 rear axle steering in tight bends 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.250
 The rear wheels are used with the help of a 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.209
 electronic control by 15 degrees 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.739
 smashed 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.620
 that's the purpose of the grown wheelbase 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.909
 be compensated at the same place 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.950
 the engineers at the back axle 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.420
 Cross-locking the drive torque 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.849
 between the wheels spread over 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.849
 Electronics instead of mechanics 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.090
 inside, the 911 gt3 is especially 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.710
 sporty materials aluminum and 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.650
 leather give the interior one 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.460
 Elegant style on the fittings do her 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.440
 the rest 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.440
 everything is high quality 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:03.040
 special eye-catcher of the tacho of the 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.040
 350 km reached 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.650
 the so-called porsche active suspension 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.240
 Management short psn regulates actively and 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.370
 continuously the electronic 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.320
 Adjustment of the shock absorber system 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.709
 This results in an even better 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.709
 driving behavior 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.940
 the data of the gt3 porsche sound very much 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.850
 intoxicating we have 350 kw performance 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.009
 It only takes 35 seconds to get to 100 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.169
 come and has 440 newton meters 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:38.310
 torque and these values ​​he needs 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.169
 also because he is just for the 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.090
 race track designed considering 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.009
 that this car is often used as a sports equipment 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.620
 So bought as a third or fourth dare 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:48.060
 the consumption is only secondary 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.550
 but then maybe the price is playing 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.580
 one more role and that is 137000 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.580
 Euro
