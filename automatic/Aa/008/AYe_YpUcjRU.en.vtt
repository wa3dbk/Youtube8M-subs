00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
to face one of these things they are

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.289 
to face one of these things they are
devastating<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.549> did<00:03:29.700> in<00:03:29.820> fact<00:03:30.030> believe

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
devastating and I did in fact believe

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.670 
devastating and I did in fact believe
the<00:03:30.420> payback<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:30.989> looks<00:03:31.140> like<00:03:31.290> there<00:03:31.500> is<00:03:31.590> a

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
the payback it looks like there is a

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.729 
the payback it looks like there is a
high<00:03:31.890> probability<00:03:32.100> that<00:03:32.549> this<00:03:32.820> guy's<00:03:33.090> packing

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
high probability that this guy's packing

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.500 
high probability that this guy's packing
payback<00:03:34.739> on<00:03:34.769> his<00:03:35.130> move<00:03:35.549> Arsenal<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.120> know<00:03:36.299> so

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
payback on his move Arsenal you know so

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.970 
payback on his move Arsenal you know so
I<00:03:36.540> was<00:03:36.720> like<00:03:36.900> I<00:03:37.170> gotta<00:03:37.410> get<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.620> hell<00:03:37.799> out<00:03:37.950> of

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
I was like I gotta get a hell out of

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.130 
I was like I gotta get a hell out of
here<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:39.060> best<00:03:39.239> choice<00:03:39.480> that<00:03:39.660> I<00:03:39.720> had<00:03:39.870> left

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
here so the best choice that I had left

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.470 
here so the best choice that I had left
was<00:03:40.470> gyarados<00:03:40.950> get<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.370> Intimidator<00:03:41.880> Flores

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
was gyarados get the Intimidator Flores

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.690 
was gyarados get the Intimidator Flores
attack<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.049> being<00:03:43.590> able<00:03:43.799> to<00:03:44.070> take<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.400> hit<00:03:44.549> a

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
attack and being able to take the hit a

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.039 
attack and being able to take the hit a
lot<00:03:44.940> better<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:45.600> I'm<00:03:45.660> going<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.810> go<00:03:45.900> for<00:03:46.019> the

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
lot better so I'm going to go for the

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.720 
lot better so I'm going to go for the
bounce<00:03:46.260> which<00:03:46.530> is<00:03:46.650> super<00:03:46.829> effective<00:03:47.220> against

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
bounce which is super effective against

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.060 
bounce which is super effective against
a<00:03:47.910> fighting<00:03:48.269> type<00:03:48.420> Pokemon<00:03:49.380> you're<00:03:49.950> not

because<00:03:50.310> bounce<00:03:50.519> Flying<00:03:50.940> type<00:03:51.209> and<00:03:51.420> it's<00:03:51.510> also

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
because bounce Flying type and it's also

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.750
