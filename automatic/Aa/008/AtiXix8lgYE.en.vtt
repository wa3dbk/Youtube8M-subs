which<00:03:10.270> really<00:03:10.540> messed<00:03:10.840> up<00:03:10.990> my<00:03:11.080> paintings<00:03:11.440> for

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
which really messed up my paintings for

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.430 
which really messed up my paintings for
a<00:03:11.650> while<00:03:11.860> but<00:03:12.820> I<00:03:13.150> came<00:03:13.570> home<00:03:13.990> with<00:03:14.140> lots<00:03:14.320> of

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
a while but I came home with lots of

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.470 
a while but I came home with lots of
ideas<00:03:14.560> I<00:03:14.950> needed<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.430> internalize<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.300> I'm

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
ideas I needed to internalize and I'm

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.030 
ideas I needed to internalize and I'm
still<00:03:16.720> processing<00:03:16.930> but<00:03:17.410> that<00:03:17.560> struggle<00:03:17.950> has

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
still processing but that struggle has

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.830 
still processing but that struggle has
helped<00:03:18.220> my<00:03:18.310> work<00:03:18.490> a<00:03:18.610> lot<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:19.330> improve<00:03:19.630> an

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
helped my work a lot to improve an

through<00:03:22.870> that<00:03:22.990> experience<00:03:23.190> he<00:03:24.190> got<00:03:24.370> me<00:03:24.490> to

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
through that experience he got me to

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.100 
through that experience he got me to
think<00:03:24.730> more<00:03:24.880> about<00:03:24.940> design<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:25.600> organizing

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
think more about design and organizing

think more about design and organizing
the<00:03:26.200> canvas<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:27.190> didn't<00:03:28.180> paint<00:03:28.390> these<00:03:28.600> flowers

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
the canvas I didn't paint these flowers

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.630 
the canvas I didn't paint these flowers
because<00:03:29.500> they're<00:03:29.680> pretty<00:03:29.830> or<00:03:30.040> sentimental

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
because they're pretty or sentimental

because they're pretty or sentimental
this<00:03:30.880> is<00:03:31.000> not<00:03:31.150> going<00:03:31.330> to<00:03:31.510> play<00:03:31.690> with<00:03:31.810> color

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
this is not going to play with color

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.800

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
to do with deep resonant power and

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.110 
to do with deep resonant power and
scenery<00:03:40.930> is<00:03:41.260> about<00:03:41.620> pretty<00:03:41.800> places<00:03:42.130> scenery

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
live now and this is a scene I keep

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.760 
live now and this is a scene I keep
coming<00:04:01.000> back<00:04:01.120> -<00:04:01.660> I<00:04:01.690> feel<00:04:01.960> like<00:04:01.990> this<00:04:02.200> landscape

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
coming back - I feel like this landscape

besides being personal has a lot of
resonance<00:04:04.660> to<00:04:05.050> me<00:04:05.200> and<00:04:06.100> I<00:04:06.160> think<00:04:06.340> it's<00:04:06.460> gonna

resonance to me and I think it's gonna
be<00:04:06.730> a<00:04:06.760> subject<00:04:07.150> for<00:04:07.270> a<00:04:07.330> lot<00:04:07.390> of<00:04:07.480> paint
