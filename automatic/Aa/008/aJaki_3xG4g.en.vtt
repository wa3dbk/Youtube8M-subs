what we're trying to do makes the job go

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.850 
what we're trying to do makes the job go
so<00:00:17.940> much<00:00:18.119> faster<00:00:18.420> with<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.170> little<00:00:19.590> bit<00:00:19.710> of

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
so much faster with a little bit of

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.850 
so much faster with a little bit of
pre-planning<00:00:20.550> we<00:00:21.060> can<00:00:21.270> actually<00:00:21.860> save

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
pre-planning we can actually save

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.470 
pre-planning we can actually save
ourselves<00:00:23.040> a<00:00:23.490> lot<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.790> time<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.210> effort

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
ourselves a lot of time and effort

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.530 
ourselves a lot of time and effort
remember<00:00:25.290> that<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.980> Bill<00:00:26.160> Black<00:00:26.430> are<00:00:26.759> 16

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.540 
remember that the Bill Black are 16

remember that the Bill Black are 16
inches<00:00:27.750> tall<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.920> when<00:00:29.130> we<00:00:29.250> put<00:00:29.490> our<00:00:29.610> footing

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
inches tall so when we put our footing

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.240 
inches tall so when we put our footing
in<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.869> want<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.170> make<00:00:31.320> sure<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.859> we<00:00:32.129> are

our<00:00:59.369> material<00:00:59.879> inside<00:01:00.479> the<00:01:00.690> hole<00:01:00.930> before<00:01:01.619> we

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
our material inside the hole before we

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.280 
our material inside the hole before we
get<00:01:02.100> going<00:01:02.549> that<00:01:02.760> way<00:01:03.420> we're<00:01:03.659> not<00:01:03.930> running

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
get going that way we're not running

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
get going that way we're not running
back<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.860> forth<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:05.430> product<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.710> it<00:01:07.710> takes<00:01:08.100> a

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
back and forth for product I it takes a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.250 
back and forth for product I it takes a
little<00:01:08.520> time<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:09.119> get<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.390> there<00:01:09.570> beforehand

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
little time to get it there beforehand

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.080 
little time to get it there beforehand
but<00:01:10.740> we<00:01:10.860> don't<00:01:11.040> want<00:01:11.190> to<00:01:11.220> start<00:01:11.490> laying<00:01:11.760> block

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
but we don't want to start laying block

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.940 
but we don't want to start laying block
too<00:01:12.360> early<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.869> want<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.170> make<00:01:13.320> sure<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.799> we

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
too early we want to make sure that we

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.520 
too early we want to make sure that we
have<00:01:14.220> our<00:01:14.250> rebar<00:01:14.820> we<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.689> our<00:01:15.900> alignment

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
have our rebar we have our alignment

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.830 
have our rebar we have our alignment
system<00:01:16.920> or<00:01:17.100> bracing<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.660> our

system or bracing and that we have our

block in the hole that we're going to be

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.970 
block in the hole that we're going to be
using<00:01:20.730> to<00:01:21.480> save<00:01:21.780> us<00:01:21.960> time<00:01:22.230> and<00:01:22.410> effort<00:01:22.680> when<00:01:22.830> we

using to save us time and effort when we

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.710 
using to save us time and effort when we

two<00:01:27.720> quick<00:01:27.990> tips<00:01:28.290> about<00:01:28.530> staging<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.430> project

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
two quick tips about staging the project

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.210 
two quick tips about staging the project
when<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.509> bring<00:01:30.750> your<00:01:30.810> bundles<00:01:31.290> down<00:01:31.500> space

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
when you bring your bundles down space

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.359 
when you bring your bundles down space
them<00:01:32.460> evenly<00:01:32.810> around<00:01:33.810> your<00:01:34.470> by<00:01:34.830> your<00:01:35.009> footing

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
them evenly around your by your footing

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.910 
them evenly around your by your footing
six<00:01:35.729> foot<00:01:36.000> back<00:01:36.330> if<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:37.259> were<00:01:37.380> closer<00:01:37.649> we

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
six foot back if you were closer we

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.440 
six foot back if you were closer we
would<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.189> moving<00:01:38.369> them<00:01:38.670> again<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.180> get<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
would be moving them again to get the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.139 
would be moving them again to get the
bracing<00:01:39.899> system<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.439> as<00:01:40.560> we<00:01:40.740> went<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.820> what

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
bracing system and as we went so what

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:43.730 
bracing system and as we went so what
we're<00:01:42.299> going<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.869> spread<00:01:43.350> them<00:01:43.590> evenly

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
we're going to do is spread them evenly

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.830 
we're going to do is spread them evenly
and<00:01:44.220> then<00:01:44.369> we're<00:01:44.490> going<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.700> use<00:01:45.000> them<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
and then we're going to use them in the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.320 
and then we're going to use them in the
area<00:01:46.170> where<00:01:46.380> we<00:01:46.409> set<00:01:46.770> them<00:01:47.009> don't<00:01:47.729> use<00:01:47.970> one

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
area where we set them don't use one

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330 
area where we set them don't use one
bundle<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.869> then<00:01:49.289> go<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.740> next<00:01:49.890> bundle

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
bundle and then go to the next bundle

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.580 
bundle and then go to the next bundle
break<00:01:50.670> your<00:01:50.880> bundles<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.450> use<00:01:51.750> them<00:01:52.049> as<00:01:52.259> you

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
break your bundles and use them as you

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.820 
break your bundles and use them as you
go<00:01:52.770> by<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.340> they<00:01:54.000> will<00:01:54.210> stay<00:01:54.479> more<00:01:55.289> uniform

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
go by and they will stay more uniform

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.630 
go by and they will stay more uniform
and<00:01:56.070> even<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.610> doing<00:01:56.970> it<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.360> manner
