00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
hydration is freakin the key to

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.009 
hydration is freakin the key to
pre-workout<00:02:44.459> to<00:02:44.640> good<00:02:44.760> muscle<00:02:45.120> pumps<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.900> get

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
pre-workout to good muscle pumps to get

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.870 
pre-workout to good muscle pumps to get
the<00:02:46.140> most<00:02:46.319> from<00:02:46.590> your<00:02:46.680> workouts<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.489> then

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
the most from your workouts and then

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.539 
the most from your workouts and then
what<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.180> eat<00:02:48.620> there's<00:02:49.620> some<00:02:49.830> guys<00:02:50.010> who<00:02:50.250> say

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
what you eat there's some guys who say

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.250 
what you eat there's some guys who say
like<00:02:51.530> first<00:02:52.530> of<00:02:52.620> all<00:02:52.680> studies<00:02:53.099> will<00:02:53.959> prove<00:02:54.959> or

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
like first of all studies will prove or

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.160 
like first of all studies will prove or
disprove<00:02:55.970> anything<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.299> life<00:02:57.480> there's<00:02:57.810> there

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
disprove anything in life there's there

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.280 
disprove anything in life there's there
studies<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.829> you<00:02:59.610> know<00:02:59.730> will<00:03:00.390> tell<00:03:01.140> you

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
studies that you know will tell you

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.870 
studies that you know will tell you
whatever<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.890> want<00:03:02.099> so<00:03:02.280> whichever<00:03:02.549> later

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
whatever you want so whichever later

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.180 
whatever you want so whichever later
you're<00:03:03.690> leaning<00:03:04.110> towards<00:03:04.440> thinking<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.040> can

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
you're leaning towards thinking you can

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.080 
you're leaning towards thinking you can
probably<00:03:05.400> find<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.940> study<00:03:06.239> to<00:03:06.620> support<00:03:07.620> it

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
probably find a study to support it

some<00:03:09.090> guys<00:03:09.269> say<00:03:09.480> they<00:03:09.660> they<00:03:10.170> like<00:03:10.349> to<00:03:10.500> leave

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
some guys say they they like to leave

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.330 
some guys say they they like to leave
carbs<00:03:11.640> out<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.569> their<00:03:12.750> pre-workout<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:14.069> their

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
carbs out of their pre-workout so their

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.140 
carbs out of their pre-workout so their
insulin<00:03:14.790> sensitivity<00:03:15.299> is<00:03:15.780> higher<00:03:16.489> after<00:03:17.489> the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
insulin sensitivity is higher after the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.849 
insulin sensitivity is higher after the
workout<00:03:18.510> for<00:03:18.540> recovery<00:03:19.170> or<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.530> slump

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
workout for recovery or the slump

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.280

you want a pre-workout those
that<00:06:09.569> I<00:06:09.659> would<00:06:09.810> suggest<00:06:09.990> are<00:06:10.409> the<00:06:11.099> like<00:06:11.819> like

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
that I would suggest are the like like

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:15.350 
that I would suggest are the like like
agem<00:06:12.780> carnitine<00:06:13.639> branched-chain<00:06:14.639> amino<00:06:14.849> that

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
agem carnitine branched-chain amino that

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.990 
agem carnitine branched-chain amino that
they<00:06:15.479> use<00:06:15.659> those<00:06:15.900> those<00:06:16.469> are<00:06:16.830> the<00:06:17.520> most<00:06:17.729> heart

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
they use those those are the most heart

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.689 
they use those those are the most heart
healthy<00:06:18.389> and<00:06:18.560> they<00:06:19.560> support<00:06:19.979> muscle<00:06:20.310> pumps

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 
healthy and they support muscle pumps

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:23.209 
healthy and they support muscle pumps
probably<00:06:21.180> better<00:06:21.449> than<00:06:21.659> organ<00:06:22.020> ID<00:06:22.139> so<00:06:22.830> look

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:23.219 
probably better than organ ID so look

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:25.100 
probably better than organ ID so look
for<00:06:23.400> one<00:06:23.550> that's<00:06:24.090> got<00:06:24.300> that<00:06:24.539> in<00:06:24.719> it<00:06:24.870> if<00:06:24.990> you

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
for one that's got that in it if you

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.559 
for one that's got that in it if you
absolutely<00:06:25.319> must<00:06:26.069> drop<00:06:26.699> money<00:06:27.120> on<00:06:27.509> a

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:27.569 
absolutely must drop money on a

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:31.070 
absolutely must drop money on a
pre-workout<00:06:28.349> but<00:06:29.219> you<00:06:30.090> can<00:06:30.240> get<00:06:30.360> creative<00:06:30.870> and

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
pre-workout but you can get creative and

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.159 
pre-workout but you can get creative and
in<00:06:31.620> any<00:06:32.189> drug<00:06:32.490> store<00:06:32.789> or<00:06:33.060> any<00:06:33.539> section<00:06:33.960> of<00:06:34.050> any

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169 
in any drug store or any section of any

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:36.800 
in any drug store or any section of any
grocery<00:06:34.560> store<00:06:34.590> that<00:06:34.860> you<00:06:35.340> know<00:06:35.909> has<00:06:36.120> the<00:06:36.419> the

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
grocery store that you know has the the

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.260 
grocery store that you know has the the
vitamins<00:06:37.259> and<00:06:37.439> supplements<00:06:37.650> with<00:06:38.340> the

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
vitamins and supplements with the

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.490 
vitamins and supplements with the
branched<00:06:39.569> chain<00:06:39.719> amino<00:06:39.750> that<00:06:40.229> are<00:06:40.319> going<00:06:40.439> to

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
branched chain amino that are going to

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.429 
branched chain amino that are going to
support<00:06:40.740> nitrogen<00:06:41.490> retention<00:06:41.639> and<00:06:42.289> but<00:06:43.289> what

00:06:43.429 --> 00:06:43.439 
support nitrogen retention and but what

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:45.769 
support nitrogen retention and but what
I<00:06:43.469> typically<00:06:43.919> do<00:06:44.129> is<00:06:44.340> a<00:06:45.150> branched<00:06:45.539> chain<00:06:45.750> amino

00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:45.779 
I typically do is a branched chain amino

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:49.820 
I typically do is a branched chain amino
that<00:06:46.439> contains<00:06:46.889> leucine<00:06:47.400> for<00:06:48.110> leucine<00:06:49.110> is<00:06:49.139> as

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
that contains leucine for leucine is as

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.219 
that contains leucine for leucine is as
widely<00:06:50.279> accepted<00:06:50.729> as<00:06:50.879> the<00:06:51.419> branched<00:06:52.080> chain

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:52.229 
widely accepted as the branched chain

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:53.899 
widely accepted as the branched chain
amino<00:06:52.259> that<00:06:52.710> supports<00:06:53.159> muscle<00:06:53.550> growth<00:06:53.669> the

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:53.909 
amino that supports muscle growth the

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:56.330 
amino that supports muscle growth the
best<00:06:54.150> so<00:06:54.810> do<00:06:55.020> a<00:06:55.050> branched<00:06:55.349> chain<00:06:55.469> amino<00:06:55.500> that's

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
best so do a branched chain amino that's

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.429 
best so do a branched chain amino that's
hi<00:06:57.000> I'm<00:06:57.150> Lucy<00:06:57.360> and<00:06:58.289> then<00:06:59.150> like<00:07:00.150> a<00:07:00.180> coffee<00:07:00.479> and<00:07:00.779> I

00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:01.439 
hi I'm Lucy and then like a coffee and I

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:04.129 
hi I'm Lucy and then like a coffee and I
get<00:07:01.830> pretty<00:07:02.039> killer<00:07:02.250> workouts<00:07:02.699> so<00:07:03.050> there<00:07:04.050> you

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:04.139 
get pretty killer workouts so there you

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:06.319 
get pretty killer workouts so there you
have
