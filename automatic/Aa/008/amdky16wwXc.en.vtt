00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.570
 some of all I'm waiting and before 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.070
 nothing then to say to you first to present the 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.019
 game that I'll talk about a lot 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.639
 but as you're probably already seeing 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.170
 is a game check the voucher what 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.320
 first tell you how good you know me 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.050
 to edit I have a very old computer 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.640
 and he is not good and he has already given 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.810
 everything what could give of yes already you know 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.439
 I'm trying to buy a 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.290
 new computer and I'll make it worth it but 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.400
 It turns out that this now because it has 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.489
 caught a problem with the card 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.489
 graph 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.470
 It is impossible for me to make the bases 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.900
 practically impossible to edit so 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.640
 well I tell you I'm not asking for a 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.530
 like nothing but I tell you that it has 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.170
 It cost a lot to edit this client and it's worth 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.540
 I mean the screen looks terrible with the 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.000
 changed colors so I ask you for 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.309
 Please understand that if there is any 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.059
 error in something something so what what 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.379
 comprehend and this is good because this 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.790
 it's a computer that happened a lot 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.190
 this problem is not the card 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.380
 graphic and when I can already happen in 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.630
 some screen capture with how it 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.180
 see the screen when I have to edit 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.220
 so you can see a little bit that is not 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.160
 It's easy, and that's what I'm asking for. 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.570
 and well we already passed that topic and I 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.130
 I will buy a new computer and if not 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.509
 good news because I thought that this 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.180
 computer when I picked up this problem already 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.860
 I could not edit videos but I'm seeing 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.869
 that for now while I'm 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.270
 commenting is going well so let's see to see 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.710
 Well, I have a hacked game, no 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.350
 I want to enter this gameplay if I'm 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.149
 in favor if I am against games 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.760
 hacked but I'll tell you a bit about 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.560
 story knows some guys with my 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.250
 great colleague dhabi 9 fucker 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.180
 they are called ex me and and as it was called the 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.509
 another man 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.460
 cosmi and nothing left David and we were not 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.020
 we met a game and I said then 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.700
 we form a group to go for max or what 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.320
 let it be for where ever I say 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.119
 there is no such and nothing then David went and 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.850
 they tell me come let's look for games 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.560
 hacked me so you tell me and that always 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.319
 we always find hacked games 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.110
 the first game they searched for 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.709
 hacked and I tell you this asset but 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.940
 but what luck we have had if not what 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.530
 we look in a web page 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.390
 but it does not turn out that later they were 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.860
 surrounding that was pure chorra or I do not know 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.140
 how they did it but in the first 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.260
 heading we entered we found a 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.519
 hacked party and nothing I do not want 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.410
 bring in the subject I say again of 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.780
 existed for or against the hacks 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.880
 but today in very strong I do not have 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.830
 No appreciation seems fun but 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.080
 I find it a disgust of play so I said 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.690
 I'm at the forty-something level 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.980
 I say then I take advantage for the 80 is 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.510
 it is actually other games I played 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.370
 already being at level 80 but I wanted 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.590
 I wanted to show you the game of now 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.340
 you will understand why and it turns out that 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.849
 after 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.290
 do the departure they told us not to 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.090
 subscribe let's go to a certain channel 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.910
 of youtube is valid and it turns out that it is from a 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.660
 boy that I'll leave in the description 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.709
 it's good that he does hacks is not a clovis 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.239
 hacked games not to go up 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.280
 level at which you can kill yourself and 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.959
 earn a lot of points and good 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.220
 tell you I did not want to go into that subject 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.480
 to exist in favor or not of the hacks 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.640
 because I only here is the messenger 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.170
 ok or what I bring is a game 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.390
 of which he makes worth only with 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:23.060
 infinite ammunition and a lot of points 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.739
 points for taking a flag and committing suicide or 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.630
 kill someone how good I once 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.890
 I was at 80 the only thing I did was 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.750
 go kill people for fun and 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.000
 ever kill myself but good not 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.470
 it does not make sense since I'm at 80 it was 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.769
 what he wanted all the souls and good him 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.110
 I commented to the boy that I could do a 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.450
 help and nothing to see it here in the 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.890
 youtube channel so you're going to have your 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.569
 face in the description that does not have 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.970
 capturing the boy but but good 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.590
 I think he raffles accounts and those things and 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.000
 that already has enough subscribers and 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.319
 he has a pretty fucking intro no 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.580
 well then basically that if 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.180
 you want 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.430
 max 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.200
 looted departure of buffets to climb 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.109
 to prestige whatever is very important 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.440
 that you do not know that the level of 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.750
 soul worth 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.270
 If you want to go up I know that you are at 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.980
 prestige 5 and that there are 6 that you like 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.830
 more a little plate than another one that yes 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.770
 you want to upload all that yes yes 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.830
 you want to unlock all the emblems 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.410
 with what you have to win all the 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.510
 good prestige them I leave you your 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.730
 channel in the description and your idea of 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.140
 well I do not know if you stop your video from 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.040
 station network is not a matter of 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:32.020
 that you are riddling it 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.390
 friend requests but I'll leave you his 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.550
 channel and then I guess if you put him 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.260
 in some comments something of oier 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:43.330
 black metal which is what is usually done 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:45.280
 not because their posts 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.629
 I suppose it was added and if you have 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.360
 luck because nothing invited you a game 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:50.710
 and go up ladder levels and good to say 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.389
 also that I would like to bring hacks 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.610
 to the channel I honestly think something that 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.280
 Well the truth is quite successful 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.139
 but that's not why I love the world very much 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.800
 the world of mods more than hacks 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.169
 from the world of mods 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.080
 and nothing like I know because I was walking 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:09.229
 looking already a month or so ago um some 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.699
 person that could me I do not like 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.840
 the genes of this type be for modern 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.879
 warfare 3 is fine to raise the level 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.430
 of the 80 but I was looking rather to 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:20.180
 someone who could put me that 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.250
 I will invite a private one and put on the super 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.620
 jump or put all those then to 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.659
 that kind of mods but not good are a 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.639
 little more difficult to find people 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:30.680
 that does that I think because it's very easy 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.360
 find these people that well that that 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.400
 does that today and that is also fine 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.780
 but I do not know at least I was 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.240
 a lot more people than doing this but 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.949
 much more than the one that can also 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.050
 make deponents super jump and 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.330
 such that I would like to have the 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.889
 channel that basically but nothing I leave you 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.610
 to the channel of this guy in case 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:52.310
 if you are interested, then, nothing , 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.750
 you have and say one important thing already in 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.420
 these last moments 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.550
 the special 500 is going to start coming 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.230
 this weekend is the safest thing that 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.820
 in yours we can connect to 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.580
 skype that we are at home we said with 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.770
 exams but nothing I think that already this 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.960
 Friday I do not want to promise anything but 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.370
 well I think it will come soon look 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.700
 then there you have the hacked game 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.310
 kids to enjoy 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.590
 that are a game and I will give my opinion 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.290
 about the hacks if I feel like it in another 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.690
 video is worth but repeat that you do not give me 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.580
 dislike or anything to bring is a departure 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.290
 hacked because I'm only just 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.690
 messenger that is worth this is only the 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.850
 people who are interested in this, not the video 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.460
 I should not even be voted honestly 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.169
 but good 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:39.430
 what you have is to go to the channel 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:41.860
 boy if you want these classics so 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:44.199
 I hope you liked it and nothing that 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.060
 has helped and you write 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:47.380
 also to my channel 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.370
 Obviously, I have been the 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.380
 messenger here on the carrier pigeon 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.380
 good until later kids
