00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:03.839 
soon in my opinion I think or a little
too<00:05:02.289> late<00:05:02.500> actually<00:05:03.099> I<00:05:03.130> think<00:05:03.250> I<00:05:03.580> think

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849 
too late actually I think I think

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:06.330 
too late actually I think I think
kick-ass<00:05:04.150> 2<00:05:04.449> waited<00:05:04.960> a<00:05:04.990> little<00:05:05.139> too<00:05:05.289> long<00:05:06.009> I

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
kick-ass 2 waited a little too long I

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.120 
kick-ass 2 waited a little too long I
want<00:05:07.300> a<00:05:07.360> sequel<00:05:07.750> earlier<00:05:08.259> because<00:05:08.530> little

Khloe<00:05:09.460> yes<00:05:10.000> what<00:05:10.389> I<00:05:10.660> can<00:05:10.930> agree<00:05:11.110> with<00:05:11.199> he

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
Khloe yes what I can agree with he

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.890 
Khloe yes what I can agree with he
wasn't<00:05:11.860> the<00:05:12.039> same<00:05:12.250> character<00:05:12.849> I<00:05:13.150> like<00:05:13.599> the

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
wasn't the same character I like the

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.350 
wasn't the same character I like the
sequel<00:05:14.430> because<00:05:15.430> it's<00:05:15.820> a<00:05:15.970> lot<00:05:16.120> like<00:05:16.270> the

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
sequel because it's a lot like the

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.060 
sequel because it's a lot like the
comics<00:05:16.630> is<00:05:16.720> a<00:05:16.750> darker<00:05:17.530> version<00:05:17.560> of<00:05:17.919> the<00:05:17.979> movie

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
comics is a darker version of the movie

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.129 
comics is a darker version of the movie
but<00:05:18.880> I<00:05:19.090> think<00:05:19.330> you're<00:05:19.419> absolutely<00:05:19.479> right<00:05:19.900> it

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
but I think you're absolutely right it

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:22.409 
but I think you're absolutely right it

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:24.009 
kill people and say the c-word when you

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:25.820
