trouble finding the right downloads for

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.720 
trouble finding the right downloads for
it<00:00:14.070> because<00:00:14.929> the<00:00:15.929> real<00:00:16.350> creator<00:00:16.740> for<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.250> seems

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
it because the real creator for it seems
