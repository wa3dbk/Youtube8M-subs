00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930

in<00:00:52.079> today's<00:00:52.350> game<00:00:52.590> pitching<00:00:53.370> wins

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
in today's game pitching wins

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.729 
in today's game pitching wins
championships<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:55.020> if<00:00:55.140> they<00:00:55.260> can<00:00:55.410> lock<00:00:55.559> up

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
championships so if they can lock up

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.670 
championships so if they can lock up
Scherzer<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.690> mean<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:58.170> helps<00:00:58.530> them

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
Scherzer I mean it helps them

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.439 
Scherzer I mean it helps them
tremendously<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.399> also<00:00:59.550> helps<00:00:59.940> Texas<00:01:00.329> I

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
tremendously but it also helps Texas I

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.110 
tremendously but it also helps Texas I
think<00:01:00.690> too<00:01:00.840> because<00:01:01.590> now<00:01:01.770> trading<00:01:02.520> Kinsler<00:01:02.910> it

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
think too because now trading Kinsler it

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.109 
think too because now trading Kinsler it
opens<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.629> up<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:03.960> Profar<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.640> I<00:01:05.640> think<00:01:05.970> both

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
opens it up for Profar and I think both

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.149 
opens it up for Profar and I think both
teams<00:01:06.180> made<00:01:06.630> out<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:07.740> can't<00:01:08.010> believe

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159

i really don't know i think it works out
for<00:02:01.409> both<00:02:01.439> teams<00:02:01.969> because<00:02:02.969> they've<00:02:03.869> cleared

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
for both teams because they've cleared
