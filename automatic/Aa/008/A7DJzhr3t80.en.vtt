strongest thing out there but riders

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.569

were<00:00:40.320> coming<00:00:40.620> up<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.860> us<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.160> saying<00:00:41.370> they

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
were coming up to us and saying they

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.300 
were coming up to us and saying they
wanted<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.940> go<00:00:42.090> wider<00:00:42.739> 750<00:00:43.739> wasn't<00:00:44.070> enough

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.310 
wanted to go wider 750 wasn't enough

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.729 
wanted to go wider 750 wasn't enough
they<00:00:44.520> wanted<00:00:44.790> to<00:00:44.910> go<00:00:45.060> full<00:00:45.360> 800<00:00:45.930> our<00:00:46.170> our

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
they wanted to go full 800 our our

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.619 
they wanted to go full 800 our our
engineers<00:00:47.309> knew<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.090> took<00:00:48.359> more<00:00:48.570> than

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
engineers knew that it took more than

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.439 
engineers knew that it took more than
just<00:00:48.809> adding<00:00:49.379> width<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.190> bar<00:00:50.489> doing<00:00:51.180> that

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
just adding width to this bar doing that

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.229 
just adding width to this bar doing that
would<00:00:51.660> compromise<00:00:52.250> strength<00:00:53.250> or<00:00:53.519> weight<00:00:54.000> or

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
would compromise strength or weight or

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.599 
would compromise strength or weight or
stiffness<00:00:54.870> when<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.620> go<00:00:55.739> wider<00:00:56.010> stiffness

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:56.609 
stiffness when you go wider stiffness

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:58.729 
stiffness when you go wider stiffness
goes<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> window<00:00:57.440> so<00:00:58.440> our<00:00:58.590> engineers

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
goes out the window so our engineers

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.819 
goes out the window so our engineers
decided<00:00:59.629> let's<00:01:00.629> bulk<00:01:00.929> the<00:01:01.109> thing<00:01:01.350> up<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
decided let's bulk the thing up in the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.780 
decided let's bulk the thing up in the
center<00:01:02.100> section<00:01:02.960> doing<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.580> improves<00:01:05.580> this

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
center section doing that improves this

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.810 
center section doing that improves this
handle<00:01:06.150> bar<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.480> every<00:01:06.870> way<00:01:07.130> it's<00:01:08.130> 20<00:01:08.580> grams

this<00:01:34.439> handle<00:01:34.710> bar<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.670> havoc<00:01:35.939> 35<00:01:36.360> handle

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
this handle bar so the havoc 35 handle

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.780 
this handle bar so the havoc 35 handle
bar<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.930> also<00:01:37.350> available<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:38.070> aluminum<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.700> you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
bar is also available in aluminum so you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.389 
bar is also available in aluminum so you
get<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.060> really<00:01:39.420> great<00:01:39.600> carbon<00:01:40.079> bar<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:41.159> the

like<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.149> carbon<00:01:45.390> bar<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:46.200> get<00:01:46.350> weight

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560
