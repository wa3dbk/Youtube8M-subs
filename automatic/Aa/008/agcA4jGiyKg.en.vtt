00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.829 

technique<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.309> Alok<00:00:14.610> X<00:00:14.940> starts<00:00:15.660> with<00:00:15.750> the

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
technique and Alok X starts with the

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.500 
technique and Alok X starts with the
position<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.350> your<00:00:16.379> feet<00:00:16.640> too<00:00:17.640> far<00:00:17.910> apart<00:00:18.000> and

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
position of your feet too far apart and

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.170 
position of your feet too far apart and
you<00:00:18.840> risk<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.170> ball<00:00:19.380> going<00:00:19.680> for<00:00:19.830> your<00:00:19.949> legs<00:00:20.189> so

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
you risk a ball going for your legs so

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.599 
you risk a ball going for your legs so
close<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.170> makes<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.470> real<00:00:22.590> difficult<00:00:22.800> to

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
close and it makes it real difficult to

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.290 
close and it makes it real difficult to
get<00:00:23.760> down

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
get down

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.839 
get down
so<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.350> length<00:00:25.470> apart<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.070> about<00:00:26.310> right<00:00:26.609> but

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
so the length apart is about right but

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.490 
so the length apart is about right but
ultimately<00:00:27.300> just<00:00:27.869> get<00:00:28.080> into<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.349> position

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
ultimately just get into a position

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.380 
ultimately just get into a position
that's<00:00:28.800> comfortable<00:00:29.010> for<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:30.269> that

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
that's comfortable for you but that

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.080 
that's comfortable for you but that
doesn't<00:00:30.570> open<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:31.019> up<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.320> an<00:00:31.439> easy<00:00:31.590> goal<00:00:32.090> when

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
doesn't open you up to an easy goal when

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.120 
doesn't open you up to an easy goal when
making<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.600> low<00:00:33.750> ball<00:00:34.050> save<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.829> want<00:00:35.040> to

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
making the low ball save you want to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.920 
making the low ball save you want to
make<00:00:35.250> sure<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.610> get<00:00:35.760> your<00:00:35.969> arms<00:00:36.420> as<00:00:36.630> low<00:00:36.870> to

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
make sure you get your arms as low to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.040 
make sure you get your arms as low to
the<00:00:37.079> ground<00:00:37.170> as<00:00:37.530> possible<00:00:37.730> to<00:00:38.730> make<00:00:38.879> sure<00:00:39.180> that

the ground as possible to make sure that

the ground as possible to make sure that
that<00:00:40.230> ball<00:00:40.500> doesn't<00:00:40.710> slip<00:00:41.010> underneath<00:00:41.399> you

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690

your mental focus at a ground ball is

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.600 
your mental focus at a ground ball is
crucial<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:49.289> seems<00:00:49.649> like<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.980> easiest<00:00:50.250> catch

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
crucial it seems like the easiest catch

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.549 
crucial it seems like the easiest catch
but<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.539> be<00:00:51.719> one<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> toughest

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
but it can be one of the toughest

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.319 
but it can be one of the toughest
because<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.280> field<00:00:53.579> surface<00:00:54.059> always
