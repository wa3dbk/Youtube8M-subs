hello guys in my previous blackberry 10
dot<00:00:04.230> 3.1<00:00:04.830> review<00:00:05.190> I<00:00:05.370> forgot<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.120> show<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.450> boot

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
dot 3.1 review I forgot to show the boot

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.320 
dot 3.1 review I forgot to show the boot
animation<00:00:07.319> so<00:00:08.040> let's<00:00:08.580> check<00:00:08.849> it<00:00:08.970> out

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
animation so let's check it out

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.200 
animation so let's check it out
so<00:00:09.750> here<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.139> have<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.679> blackberry<00:00:10.950> z3<00:00:11.670> which<00:00:12.059> is

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
so here I have a blackberry z3 which is

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.570 
so here I have a blackberry z3 which is
running<00:00:12.389> 10<00:00:12.690> dot<00:00:12.900> 3.1<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.889> blackberry<00:00:14.309> z10

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
running 10 dot 3.1 and a blackberry z10

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.240 
running 10 dot 3.1 and a blackberry z10
which<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:14.940> running<00:00:15.179> 10<00:00:15.389> 10.2<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.680> let's<00:00:17.010> check

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
which is running 10 10.2 so let's check

00:00:17.250 --> 00:01:27.450 
which is running 10 10.2 so let's check
out<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.520> difference<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.029> boot<00:00:18.210> animation

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.660 

so<00:01:28.360> you<00:01:28.480> can<00:01:28.690> see<00:01:28.900> in<00:01:28.990> ten<00:01:29.230> dot<00:01:29.440> 3.1<00:01:30.040> they<00:01:30.490> have

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
so you can see in ten dot 3.1 they have

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.750 
so you can see in ten dot 3.1 they have
introduced<00:01:31.410> the<00:01:32.410> words<00:01:32.740> at<00:01:32.980> the<00:01:33.160> bottom<00:01:33.310> so

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
introduced the words at the bottom so

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.800 
introduced the words at the bottom so
verifying<00:01:34.300> and<00:01:34.710> securing<00:01:35.710> blackberry<00:01:36.190> 10<00:01:36.370> OS

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
verifying and securing blackberry 10 OS

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.150 
verifying and securing blackberry 10 OS
so<00:01:37.810> which<00:01:37.960> is<00:01:38.110> in<00:01:38.230> which<00:01:38.440> we<00:01:38.620> won't<00:01:38.800> find<00:01:38.980> it

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
so which is in which we won't find it

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.480 
so which is in which we won't find it
and<00:01:39.340> not<00:01:39.490> 10.2<00:01:40.440> if<00:01:41.440> you<00:01:41.590> tap<00:01:41.800> on<00:01:41.979> the<00:01:42.040> screen<00:01:42.220> we

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
and not 10.2 if you tap on the screen we

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.790 
and not 10.2 if you tap on the screen we
can<00:01:42.520> see<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.880> percentage<00:01:43.450> of<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:44.229> OS<00:01:44.470> it<00:01:44.650> has

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
can see the percentage of the OS it has

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.120 
can see the percentage of the OS it has
been<00:01:44.979> loaded<00:01:45.160> and<00:01:45.430> you<00:01:46.060> can<00:01:46.270> see<00:01:46.630> that<00:01:47.130> 10.3

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
been loaded and you can see that 10.3

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.730 
been loaded and you can see that 10.3
loads<00:01:48.850> of<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.210> ways<00:01:49.420> quickly<00:01:50.170> when<00:01:50.290> compared

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
loads of the ways quickly when compared

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.410 
loads of the ways quickly when compared
to<00:01:50.970> 10.2<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.979> hand<00:01:54.220> now<00:01:54.520> it's<00:01:54.700> showing<00:01:55.150> fear

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
to 10.2 so hand now it's showing fear

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.490 
to 10.2 so hand now it's showing fear
finalizing<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.110> device<00:01:56.380> setup<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:59.229> that<00:01:59.380> is

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
finalizing the device setup so that is

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.870 
finalizing the device setup so that is
that's<00:01:59.649> the<00:01:59.860> additional<00:02:00.280> feature<00:02:00.490> that<00:02:00.700> they

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
that's the additional feature that they

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:31.120 
that's the additional feature that they
have<00:02:01.000> added<00:02:01.950> which<00:02:02.950> we<00:02:03.130> won't<00:02:03.250> find<00:02:03.580> on<00:02:03.790> a<00:02:03.850> 10.2

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.610 

so<00:02:31.700> we<00:02:31.880> can't<00:02:32.180> find<00:02:32.390> any<00:02:32.600> much<00:02:32.900> difference<00:02:33.440> in

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
so we can't find any much difference in

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.510 
so we can't find any much difference in
the<00:02:34.900> loading<00:02:35.900> of<00:02:36.020> operating<00:02:36.560> system<00:02:36.950> so<00:02:37.190> both

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
the loading of operating system so both

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.150 
the loading of operating system so both
loaded<00:02:37.940> at<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.090> same<00:02:38.330> time<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:39.650> let<00:02:40.010> me

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
loaded at the same time so let me

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.850 
loaded at the same time so let me
confirm<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.820> Opera<00:02:41.290> current<00:02:42.290> versions<00:02:42.710> of

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
confirm the Opera current versions of

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.890 
confirm the Opera current versions of
operating<00:02:43.280> systems<00:02:43.610> at<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.970> running<00:02:44.510> on<00:02:44.660> both

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
operating systems at the running on both

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:54.250 
operating systems at the running on both
the<00:02:45.020> devices<00:02:45.850> so<00:02:46.850> on<00:02:47.000> my<00:02:47.210> blackberry<00:02:47.630> z10<00:02:53.260> you

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
the devices so on my blackberry z10 you

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.580 
the devices so on my blackberry z10 you
can<00:02:54.470> see<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.800> OS<00:02:55.010> version<00:02:55.520> that<00:02:55.760> is<00:02:56.320> 10.2<00:02:57.320> dot

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
can see the OS version that is 10.2 dot

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.370 
can see the OS version that is 10.2 dot
one<00:02:57.860> dot<00:02:58.070> three<00:02:59.030> two<00:02:59.210> four<00:02:59.450> seven<00:02:59.630> that<00:03:00.140> is<00:03:00.170> the
