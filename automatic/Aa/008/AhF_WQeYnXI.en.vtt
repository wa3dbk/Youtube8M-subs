 and of course 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:36.700
 the star wars saga 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.380
 after two installments in which each one narrated the main events of the decade 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.330
 trilogy 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.130
 he liked them for stress deaton why he focuses on clone wars 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.519
 especially 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.990
 in fact storytellers in the animated series 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.950
 starting with europa press 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.010
 this hole are prisoners in full circus to be executed with the 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.140
 consequent disembarkation of young people 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.450
 the game will put us in the shoes of many characters in the series

 fiction hobby 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.480

 all with the legal physical humor of their fouad twal sequences 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.010
 which is offered again in this delivery 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.320
 then several societies and especially 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.330
 what we first notice is a greater amount of enemies on the screen 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.360
 especially in open spaces 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.800
 the scenarios are more skeptical more details 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.580
 we have to change this character 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.200
 more often if the moment is offered 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.760
 the characters will separate 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.560
 the actions of tenaris 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.840
 forcing them to overcome that area with each of them 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.280
 fishing very patent and we play cooperatively in the same console 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.000
 as we go forward and that is what we will do new planets and solar systems 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.120
 accessing them in the order that we want 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.289
 there are more bars and use and more objects

 Argentina 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.519
 the adventure that appears to us round the same duration as the usual laymen 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.059
 although the story mode is not the only 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.389
 play the promotion phase 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.509
 collecting more pieces 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:27.719
 break only in statins 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.089
 by delays with an opponent 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:31.759
 building little 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:35.239
 author of these technological constructions and soldiers to defeat 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.899
 to the enemy 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:41.869
 These challenges are mini-games that boast the main offer 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:43.089
 of the game 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:46.980
 completing with an arcade mode and the motivation to get unlock 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:48.599
 the crowd of people 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.559
 then you 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:53.879
 graphically we liked it a lot as well as its playable offer 

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:58.899
 as for the temple inc even curling the curl with respect to other works of 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:00.899
 traveler 6000 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:03.589
 if they manage to pleasantly surprise 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:06.589
 that constant level is not achieved for several reasons 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:10.249
 sometimes we do not know what we have to do 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.449
 abc controls do not respond one hundred percent 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:18.619
 and sometimes the wait that the other player finished his individual part to return to 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:21.079
 advance together 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.109
 popular sciara 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.960
 roughly the game 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.439
 we liked it a lot 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.089
 considering what we are playing 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:34.119
 perhaps it lacks more novelties with impunity in certain technical aspects, but 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:38.179
 the novelties that contribute their technical invoice nor their humor can do it 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:41.179
 recommended for any of the platforms 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.379

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:09.339
