00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.850
 Panasonic aims very much in recent years 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.910
 not bad at all on the headphones 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.690
 market with this ph xd 300 even one 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.339
 design award 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.990
 but that is actually what I am going to do 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.970
 nothing to say anything about with this 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.430
 headphones that cost less than a euro 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.160
 still performs well below par 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.840
 Panasonic OBON so the EF product design 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.329
 for these headphones 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.919
 and why is our puzzle you 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.800
 just fairly cheap and childish 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.510
 from that comes first by the 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.600
 materials used a lot of plastic 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.649
 and that souls especially back in this 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.809
 metallic places 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.250
 yes it just doesn't look real but 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.870
 not only the design is disappointing 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.510
 the build quality is also poor 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.850
 for example the headband that feels 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.109
 just so incredibly limp to an honor 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.550
 plate are some silicone 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.730
 yes that's nice to have anyway 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.199
 really just want fun and cable now 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.600
 then once fun zipper I think 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.339
 He is broken and you build quality 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.530
 is he just not comfortable 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.690
 he fills the loose around the head and like 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.100
 you do a few times after then you 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.729
 would actually finish decisions again 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.640
 very hard 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.580
 and then we actually make it hard 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.840
 unsuitable for sports and contribution 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.600
 you also immediately notice what is not right 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.330
 thought about those silicone honor pets 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.250
 yes it is not even that annoying 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.230
 but it comes to us because 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.580
 silicone retains a lot of heat 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.150
 just got to wear time whole 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.710
 warm ears and that is not nice and still them 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.480
 something not thought about it that 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.230
 there the mending point him of the 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.990
 headphones 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.620
 that looks nice hidden away 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.180
 you would say 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.680
 but if you have a little long hair 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.900
 one ordered on your head 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.900
 then she sits down very quickly 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.470
 no that's really good for you now 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.760
 hairline well headphones in this 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.040
 price range that want sometime 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.330
 perform dramatically but is fair 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.700
 honest panasonic you know present yourself 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.740
 Is there still nice to withdraw all study 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.440
 especially the highs are good 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.210
 shrill and sound not really good at all 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.460
 but the wax was also a can either 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.610
 so very messy so that is possible 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.220
 actually in this price range 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.929
 reasonable with real audiophile 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.490
 will definitely pick their nose for it 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.410
 the sound of these headphones 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.220
 but expect a little less from Diana 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.220
 sides with which
