have like half an avocado like what do

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.940 
have like half an avocado like what do
you<00:01:49.690> do<00:01:49.780> with<00:01:49.840> this<00:01:49.960> bad<00:01:50.140> boy<00:01:50.320> to<00:01:50.530> keep<00:01:50.710> it<00:01:50.860> from

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
you do with this bad boy to keep it from

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.490 
you do with this bad boy to keep it from
going<00:01:51.100> brown<00:01:51.400> because<00:01:52.210> this<00:01:52.869> outer<00:01:53.170> layer

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
going brown because this outer layer

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.010 
going brown because this outer layer
here<00:01:53.740> is<00:01:53.860> going<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.040> oxidize<00:01:54.520> very<00:01:55.509> quickly<00:01:55.780> if

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
here is going to oxidize very quickly if

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.150 
here is going to oxidize very quickly if
it<00:01:56.110> stays<00:01:56.440> out<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.729> exposed<00:01:58.479> to<00:01:59.020> oxygen<00:01:59.259> the

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
it stays out and exposed to oxygen the

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.139 
it stays out and exposed to oxygen the
reason<00:02:00.430> for<00:02:00.580> that<00:02:00.610> is<00:02:00.759> because<00:02:00.790> it's

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
reason for that is because it's

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.660 
reason for that is because it's
predominantly<00:02:01.720> fat<00:02:02.140> and<00:02:02.470> I<00:02:03.130> talked<00:02:03.370> about<00:02:03.460> the

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
predominantly fat and I talked about the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.130 
predominantly fat and I talked about the
importance<00:02:04.030> of<00:02:04.120> healthy<00:02:04.330> fats<00:02:04.600> in<00:02:04.840> your<00:02:04.870> body

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
importance of healthy fats in your body

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.140 
importance of healthy fats in your body
this<00:02:05.680> is<00:02:05.800> a<00:02:05.830> really<00:02:06.220> good<00:02:06.310> vivid<00:02:06.640> example<00:02:07.060> of

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
this is a really good vivid example of

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.419 
this is a really good vivid example of
how<00:02:07.630> what<00:02:07.960> happens<00:02:08.290> inside<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.590> body<00:02:08.860> with

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
how what happens inside the body with

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.300 
how what happens inside the body with
bad<00:02:09.670> fats<00:02:10.000> so<00:02:10.660> if<00:02:10.929> you<00:02:11.320> lit<00:02:11.470> an<00:02:11.560> avocado<00:02:11.950> sit<00:02:12.190> on

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
bad fats so if you lit an avocado sit on

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.580 
bad fats so if you lit an avocado sit on
the<00:02:12.370> counter<00:02:12.580> like<00:02:12.760> this<00:02:13.019> it'll<00:02:14.019> turn<00:02:14.260> brown

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
the counter like this it'll turn brown

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.550 
the counter like this it'll turn brown
and<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:15.549> couple<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.910> hours<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.390> just<00:02:17.350> imagine

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
and a couple of hours and just imagine

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.500 
and a couple of hours and just imagine
what<00:02:18.040> would<00:02:18.190> happen<00:02:18.370> inside<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.910> body<00:02:19.180> that's

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
what would happen inside the body that's

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.729 
what would happen inside the body that's
exactly<00:02:19.840> what<00:02:19.959> happens<00:02:20.230> inside<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.500> body

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
exactly what happens inside the body

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.430 
exactly what happens inside the body
with<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:20.950> lot<00:02:21.160> of<00:02:21.280> these<00:02:21.370> bad<00:02:21.670> fats<00:02:22.030> is<00:02:22.299> enix<00:02:23.260> in

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
with a lot of these bad fats is enix in

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.970 
with a lot of these bad fats is enix in
kind<00:02:23.860> of<00:02:23.920> azor<00:02:24.160> exposed<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:25.390> oxygen<00:02:25.980> they

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
kind of azor exposed to oxygen they

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.120 
kind of azor exposed to oxygen they
become<00:02:27.340> rancid<00:02:28.209> inside<00:02:28.930> of<00:02:29.019> our<00:02:29.140> body<00:02:29.320> now<00:02:29.920> not

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
become rancid inside of our body now not

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.949 
become rancid inside of our body now not
saying<00:02:30.280> avocado<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:30.940> bad<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.570> just<00:02:31.600> it<00:02:31.930> just

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
saying avocado is bad it just it just

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.080 
saying avocado is bad it just it just
tends<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.799> do<00:02:32.950> that<00:02:32.980> when<00:02:33.370> it's<00:02:33.489> exposed<00:02:33.580> to

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
tends to do that when it's exposed to

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.330 
tends to do that when it's exposed to
the<00:02:34.660> environment<00:02:34.799> but<00:02:35.799> I<00:02:35.860> want<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.100> show<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:36.280> a

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
the environment but I want to show you a

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.130 
the environment but I want to show you a
really<00:02:36.459> cool<00:02:36.790> way<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.120> prevent<00:02:37.930> that<00:02:38.080> from

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
really cool way to prevent that from

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.850 
really cool way to prevent that from
happening<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.700> first<00:02:39.970> off<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.440> keep<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.470> pit

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
happening so first off is keep the pit

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.729 
happening so first off is keep the pit
in<00:02:42.070> the<00:02:42.130> avocado<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:42.910> if<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.090> have<00:02:43.180> two<00:02:43.450> sides

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
in the avocado so if you have two sides

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.570 
in the avocado so if you have two sides
choose<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.920> side<00:02:45.100> that<00:02:45.190> doesn't<00:02:45.370> have<00:02:45.519> the

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
choose the side that doesn't have the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.550 
choose the side that doesn't have the
pit<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:45.970> then<00:02:46.510> this<00:02:46.660> side<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:47.019> save<00:02:47.350> until

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
pit and then this side you save until

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.100 
pit and then this side you save until
you<00:02:47.709> want<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:47.920> use<00:02:48.070> it<00:02:48.100> if<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:49.390> don't<00:02:49.750> have<00:02:49.930> the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
you want to use it if you don't have the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.900 
you want to use it if you don't have the
pit<00:02:50.320> in<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.709> you<00:02:50.890> can<00:02:50.950> still<00:02:51.370> do<00:02:51.549> something

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
pit in it you can still do something

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.330 
pit in it you can still do something
with<00:02:52.030> lemon<00:02:52.540> by<00:02:53.260> squeezing<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.860> bit<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.100> lemon

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
juice on the avocado itself the lemon

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.830 
juice on the avocado itself the lemon
has<00:02:59.070> antioxidants<00:03:00.070> which<00:03:00.790> prevent<00:03:01.269> oxidation

fat<00:03:04.800> it's<00:03:05.670> not<00:03:05.760> pretty<00:03:05.880> cool<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:06.630> that's<00:03:06.870> why

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
fat it's not pretty cool so that's why

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.809 
fat it's not pretty cool so that's why
you<00:03:07.050> know<00:03:07.920> hopefully<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.459> kind<00:03:08.640> of<00:03:08.670> making

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
you know hopefully this kind of making

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.150 
you know hopefully this kind of making
sense<00:03:09.120> in<00:03:09.239> terms<00:03:09.360> of<00:03:09.540> this<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.739> power<00:03:10.950> of

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
sense in terms of this is the power of

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.010 
sense in terms of this is the power of
having<00:03:11.520> antioxidants<00:03:12.390> in<00:03:12.480> your<00:03:12.630> bodies<00:03:12.900> that

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
having antioxidants in your bodies that

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.410 
having antioxidants in your bodies that
they<00:03:13.170> actually<00:03:13.470> prevent<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.880> damage<00:03:15.150> that

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
they actually prevent the damage that

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.900 
they actually prevent the damage that
occurs<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.260> lot<00:03:16.410> of<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.650> fats<00:03:17.130> in<00:03:17.489> our<00:03:17.700> body

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
occurs to a lot of the fats in our body

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.890 
occurs to a lot of the fats in our body
as<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.239> result<00:03:19.140> of<00:03:19.260> oxygen<00:03:19.980> so<00:03:20.940> oxygen<00:03:21.420> is<00:03:21.660> kind

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
as a result of oxygen so oxygen is kind

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.300 
as a result of oxygen so oxygen is kind
of<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:22.019> double-edged<00:03:22.410> sword<00:03:22.440> it's<00:03:22.890> good<00:03:23.099> but

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
of a double-edged sword it's good but

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.770 
of a double-edged sword it's good but
too<00:03:23.640> much<00:03:23.760> we<00:03:24.000> can<00:03:24.120> be<00:03:24.209> bad<00:03:24.390> as<00:03:24.569> well

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
too much we can be bad as well

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.620 
too much we can be bad as well
especially<00:03:25.050> if<00:03:25.349> it's<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.530> fat<00:03:25.800> exposed<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:27.239> open

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
especially if it's a fat exposed to open

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.089 
especially if it's a fat exposed to open
air<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.530> once<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:28.890> have<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.120> just<00:03:30.120> take<00:03:30.300> some

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
air so once you have that just take some

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.009 
air so once you have that just take some
cellophane<00:03:32.099> or<00:03:32.280> saran<00:03:32.730> wrap<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.090> just<00:03:33.810> wrap

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
cellophane or saran wrap and just wrap

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.030 
cellophane or saran wrap and just wrap
it<00:03:34.170> up<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:35.300> store<00:03:36.300> it<00:03:36.420> in<00:03:36.450> your<00:03:37.350> fridge<00:03:37.620> and

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
it up and store it in your fridge and

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.220 
it up and store it in your fridge and
that<00:03:38.790> should<00:03:39.030> be<00:03:39.120> good<00:03:39.269> for<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.600> next<00:03:39.840> day<00:03:40.049> or

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
that should be good for the next day or

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.020 
that should be good for the next day or
two<00:03:40.440> don't<00:03:41.280> let<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:41.430> sit<00:03:41.640> in<00:03:41.700> there<00:03:41.819> for<00:03:41.850> a

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
two don't let it sit in there for a

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.090 
two don't let it sit in there for a
month<00:03:42.180> probably<00:03:42.900> not<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.019> good<00:03:43.170> idea<00:03:43.230> but<00:03:43.950> for

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
month probably not a good idea but for

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.530 
month probably not a good idea but for
another<00:03:44.220> day<00:03:44.459> or<00:03:44.610> two<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:44.850> should<00:03:45.000> be<00:03:45.090> fine<00:03:45.269> and

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
another day or two it should be fine and

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.130 
another day or two it should be fine and
that's<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:46.019> really<00:03:46.110> simple<00:03:46.500> trip<00:03:47.720> simple<00:03:48.720> trick

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
that's a really simple trip simple trick

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.990 
that's a really simple trip simple trick
that<00:03:49.170> can<00:03:49.769> help<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.190> save<00:03:50.340> your<00:03:50.489> avocados
