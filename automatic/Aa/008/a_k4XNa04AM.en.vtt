coming<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:48.960> that's<00:01:49.140> exactly<00:01:49.590> what<00:01:49.710> we<00:01:49.829> do<00:01:49.950> to

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
coming in that's exactly what we do to

coming in that's exactly what we do to
stop<00:01:50.340> them<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:50.729> almost<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.180> same<00:01:51.360> as<00:01:51.420> a

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
stop them it's almost the same as a

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.539 
stop them it's almost the same as a
crime<00:01:51.869> except<00:01:52.649> it's<00:01:52.770> not<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.100> succession

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
crime except it's not in succession

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.749 
crime except it's not in succession
you're<00:01:54.000> giving<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.509> single<00:01:54.869> note<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:56.310> it's

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
you're giving it to single note so it's

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.330 
you're giving it to single note so it's
a<00:01:56.880> very<00:01:57.149> very<00:01:57.420> good<00:01:57.659> call<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.110> dynamic<00:01:58.799> this

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
a very very good call it's dynamic this

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.980 
a very very good call it's dynamic this
calls<00:01:59.670> asking<00:02:00.329> for<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> visual<00:02:01.439> identification

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990
