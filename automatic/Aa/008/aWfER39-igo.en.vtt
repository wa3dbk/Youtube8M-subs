00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.850
 very good everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:08.219
 video on the artists channel and after 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.769
 a long time of absence 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:14.259
 I upload videos again as you will see this 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.270
 video is being done with my voice and 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.450
 I wanted to ask them how they prefer 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.890
 videos with my voice or what not because 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.380
 the content of this channel is for 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.030
 you and you decide so let them leave 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.840
 in the comments how do you prefer the 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.600
 videos 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.119
 and good continuing with the video of this 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.390
 we will be learning how to 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.270
 install using the gps mode that we 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.160
 will allow us to be more guided when we go 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.110
 to a destination for what we will need 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.900
 we are a vehicle any I in 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.150
 this case the axis of the motorcycle 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.090
 and to start using it we will open the 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.510
 map and we will mark any point in 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.170
 this case to mark and here 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.160
 I got into the vehicle and we will press the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.950
 efe key 12 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.390
 will begin to guide you as I said there with 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.390
 an arrow to the front 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.049
 now we will have to turn 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.159
 we will have to follow the indications 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.630
 as it says in 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.630
 that is cost 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:32.920
 and when we get to the destination we 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:37.090
 indicate with a logo of a house that 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.400
 we will have arrived comes with audio as well 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.410
 what 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.650
 will not be lost but the most description 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.960
 English 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.000
 you can translate try to do something 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.770
 of a translation for this love but 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.109
 will be later 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.079
 and good and arriving at our destination 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:56.450
 he will have indicated to us how they will have seen and 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.490
 that was all the mod reviews now 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.909
 We will continue with the installation of this 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.570
 mode 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.570
 then 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.390
 we are in the installation of gps for 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.369
 that you bleed the first thing we'll have 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.500
 what to do is go to the link that leaves it 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.370
 in the description of the video uploaded to 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.709
 mega per thousand 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.409
 once we are in the link you 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.989
 we will click on download I will not 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.770
 because I already have it on the desk and 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.740
 meritorious 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.040
 and that I will go to my desk and leave us 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.770
 a rar file called gps mont le 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.680
 we will give right click extract here 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:41.580
 fills us with a folder called gps mod 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.390
 We will open it to a 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.260
 cost now we will go to the folder of 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.670
 our who tea san andrÃ©s 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.709
 in my case it 's having to place cetes 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.170
 I'll put it to one side to be able 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.970
 mobilize the objects better and the first thing 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.970
 that we will open will be the models folder 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.640
 will open a txt folder 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.370
 and we will pass this file inside of this 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.549
 jail in my case does not appear to replace 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.160
 the file because I already had it installed 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:21.600
 We will return back on both sides 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:25.110
 again and we will open the data folder 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.380
 in the data folder we will pass the file 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.390
 data point reuters here 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.910
 it seems to replace me again because 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.580
 you already have it tacan we will go back in 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.500
 both sides and we will open the folder I think 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.580
 I need to read four for this 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.860
 amount did not try with chlorine 3 but 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.650
 necessarily 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.630
 so we'll pass it and we can go back 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.110
 sushi at home that already have it 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.590
 we will go back 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:00.069
 and we will open the audio folder 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.849
 and we will pass this folder to caleta 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.849
 seems to replace 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.299
 and it would already be installed in our mod and 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.219
 that was it for this video tutorial 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.680
