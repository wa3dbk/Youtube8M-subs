brainstorming sessions there's so much

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.889 
brainstorming sessions there's so much
further<00:01:34.119> because<00:01:34.390> we're<00:01:34.630> constantly

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
further because we're constantly

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.810 
further because we're constantly
evaluating<00:01:35.649> and<00:01:35.799> balancing<00:01:36.250> step<00:01:36.460> off<00:01:36.640> each

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
evaluating and balancing step off each

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.330 
evaluating and balancing step off each
other<00:01:37.000> so<00:01:37.210> that's<00:01:37.329> really<00:01:37.539> big<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:38.350> there's

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
other so that's really big and there's

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.789 
other so that's really big and there's
one<00:01:39.520> really<00:01:39.820> big<00:01:40.119> obvious<00:01:40.869> negative<00:01:41.439> that<00:01:41.770> I

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
one really big obvious negative that I

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.170 
one really big obvious negative that I
don't<00:01:42.039> know<00:01:42.159> that<00:01:42.340> we<00:01:42.430> need<00:01:42.579> to<00:01:42.609> say<00:01:42.880> here<00:01:43.149> but

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
don't know that we need to say here but

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.999 
don't know that we need to say here but
it's<00:01:43.450> it's<00:01:43.810> a<00:01:43.899> big<00:01:44.079> ones<00:01:44.259> with<00:01:44.380> something<00:01:44.740> away

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
it's it's a big ones with something away

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.480 
it's it's a big ones with something away
is<00:01:45.280> that<00:01:45.609> you<00:01:45.820> slit<00:01:46.240> your<00:01:46.450> profits<00:01:46.929> 5050<00:01:47.740> so<00:01:48.399> if

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
is that you slit your profits 5050 so if

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.610 
is that you slit your profits 5050 so if
there<00:01:48.670> was<00:01:48.820> a<00:01:48.850> negative

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
there was a negative
