 as we already know the glass subjects are 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.020
 completely black to have the 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.350
 transparency effect we need the 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.930
 black class we execute it and we have 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.970

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.970

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:31.470
