rustling Ross Oh James yeah he practice
it's<00:04:46.250> fair<00:04:46.430> to<00:04:46.460> say<00:04:46.580> that<00:04:46.700> even<00:04:46.880> if<00:04:47.000> that

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
it's fair to say that even if that

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.470 
it's fair to say that even if that
wasn't<00:04:47.690> her<00:04:47.780> Shane<00:04:48.230> of<00:04:48.320> done<00:04:48.470> more<00:04:49.220> reps<00:04:49.490> this

wasn't her Shane of done more reps this

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.440 
wasn't her Shane of done more reps this
period<00:04:51.050> anyway<00:04:51.320> probably<00:04:52.070> most<00:04:52.790> likely<00:04:52.880> was

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
period anyway probably most likely was

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.810 
period anyway probably most likely was
that<00:04:53.540> the<00:04:53.660> plan<00:04:53.690> going<00:04:54.050> in<00:04:54.230> yeah<00:04:54.470> what<00:04:55.130> what<00:04:55.760> do

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
that the plan going in yeah what what do
