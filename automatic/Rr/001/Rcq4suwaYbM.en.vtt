00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
degree angle on the subject pretty

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.560 
degree angle on the subject pretty
simple<00:00:52.020> but<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.699> soft<00:00:53.699> light<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.030> her<00:00:54.329> face

her<00:00:54.899> skin<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.500> lit<00:00:55.739> up<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.219> there's<00:00:57.149> nothing

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
her skin just lit up and there's nothing

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.869 
her skin just lit up and there's nothing
more<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.930> very<00:00:58.170> simple<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.340> come<00:00:59.579> from<00:00:59.730> a

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
more to it very simple and I come from a

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.189 
more to it very simple and I come from a
background<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.420> painting<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.109> illustration

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
background in painting and illustration

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.070 
background in painting and illustration
and<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:03.210> image<00:01:03.510> was<00:01:03.690> really<00:01:03.930> all<00:01:04.049> about

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
and so this image was really all about

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.980 
and so this image was really all about
post-production<00:01:05.210> something<00:01:06.210> about<00:01:06.479> her<00:01:06.689> pose

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
post-production something about her pose

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.859 
post-production something about her pose
was<00:01:07.470> still<00:01:07.799> really<00:01:08.390> magic<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.600> kind<00:01:09.810> of

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
was still really magic and kind of

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.230 
was still really magic and kind of
matched<00:01:10.080> her<00:01:10.350> music<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.700> went<00:01:12.090> into

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
matched her music and so I went into

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.920 
matched her music and so I went into
Photoshop<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.549> took<00:01:14.549> her<00:01:14.820> removed<00:01:15.689> her<00:01:15.869> from

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
Photoshop and took her removed her from

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.200 
Photoshop and took her removed her from
the<00:01:16.110> background<00:01:16.470> entirely<00:01:16.890> brought<00:01:17.850> her<00:01:18.030> back

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
the background entirely brought her back

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.950 
the background entirely brought her back
in<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:19.200> retouched<00:01:19.619> her<00:01:19.770> skin<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> little<00:01:20.340> bit

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
in we retouched her skin a little bit

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.870 
in we retouched her skin a little bit
and<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.619> started<00:01:22.979> bringing<00:01:23.490> different

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
and I just started bringing different

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.390 
and I just started bringing different
backgrounds<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.810> brought<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> landscape<00:01:26.189> in

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
backgrounds in brought a landscape in

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.100 
backgrounds in brought a landscape in
that<00:01:26.640> I'd<00:01:26.759> shot<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.299> shoot<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.540> lot<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.780> stock

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
that I'd shot I shoot a lot of stock

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.440 
that I'd shot I shoot a lot of stock
images<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:28.770> I'm<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.950> down<00:01:29.130> time<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:30.090> I'm<00:01:30.180> always

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
images so I'm a down time so I'm always

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.179 
images so I'm a down time so I'm always
building<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.990> library<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.560> personal<00:01:32.040> work

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
building that library of personal work

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.249 
building that library of personal work
and<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.180> tonnes<00:01:33.420> like<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.110> can

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
and so that in tonnes like this I can

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.260 
and so that in tonnes like this I can
use<00:01:34.290> those<00:01:34.680> images<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.310> I've<00:01:35.850> brought<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.180> a

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
use those images so I've brought in a

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.749 
use those images so I've brought in a
landscape<00:01:36.659> brought<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.650> some<00:01:37.860> clouds<00:01:38.130> and

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
landscape brought in some clouds and

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.300 
landscape brought in some clouds and
just<00:01:39.630> started<00:01:39.900> building<00:01:40.110> building<00:01:41.070> up<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
just started building building up the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.520 
just started building building up the
image<00:01:41.610> one<00:01:41.790> layer<00:01:42.000> at<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.240> time<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.840> do<00:01:43.290> this

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
image one layer at a time I do this

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.100 
image one layer at a time I do this
really<00:01:43.860> crazy<00:01:44.340> effect<00:01:44.909> where<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.270> reshoot

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
really crazy effect where I reshoot

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.340 
really crazy effect where I reshoot
images<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:46.979> my<00:01:47.119> cinema<00:01:48.119> display<00:01:48.509> through

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
various glass and old cameras and so I

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.940

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
and layered them on top of the original

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.060 
and layered them on top of the original
and<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.140> started<00:02:04.500> creating<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:04.950> really

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
and so started creating this really

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.229 
and so started creating this really
bizarre<00:02:06.110> effect<00:02:07.160> and<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.759> start<00:02:08.970> bringing

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239

and all kinds

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.340 
and all kinds
