MIDI controller so today we're going to

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:55.090 
MIDI controller so today we're going to
show<00:00:53.720> how<00:00:53.839> to<00:00:53.899> use<00:00:53.960> it<00:00:54.110> with<00:00:54.199> logic<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:54.920> you

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
show how to use it with logic and you

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.860 
show how to use it with logic and you
can<00:00:55.220> use<00:00:55.339> these<00:00:55.489> same<00:00:55.790> steps<00:00:56.120> through<00:00:56.659> with

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
can use these same steps through with

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.450 
can use these same steps through with
other<00:00:57.019> programs<00:00:57.350> like<00:00:57.470> Pro<00:00:57.769> Tools<00:00:57.979> and<00:00:58.129> reason

do<00:04:21.690> when<00:04:22.690> you<00:04:22.780> start<00:04:22.840> with<00:04:23.169> a<00:04:23.200> blank<00:04:23.410> sheet<00:04:23.680> in

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
do when you start with a blank sheet in

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.190 
do when you start with a blank sheet in
oscillating<00:04:24.880> all<00:04:25.180> you<00:04:25.330> really<00:04:25.479> need<00:04:25.660> to<00:04:25.720> do<00:04:25.960> is

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
oscillating all you really need to do is

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.370 
oscillating all you really need to do is
just<00:04:26.440> tap<00:04:26.680> on<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.370> on<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.450> pads<00:04:28.720> and<00:04:28.960> sliders

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
just tap on the on the pads and sliders

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.520 
just tap on the on the pads and sliders
and<00:04:29.650> I<00:04:29.850> automatically<00:04:30.850> show<00:04:31.150> up<00:04:31.360> in<00:04:31.900> the

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
and I automatically show up in the

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.600 
and I automatically show up in the
oscillator<00:04:32.979> window<00:04:34.979> so<00:04:35.979> from<00:04:36.160> there<00:04:36.370> all<00:04:36.550> you

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
oscillator window so from there all you

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.730 
oscillator window so from there all you
have<00:04:36.760> to<00:04:36.850> do<00:04:37.000> is<00:04:37.210> decide<00:04:37.600> what<00:04:37.960> type<00:04:38.229> of<00:04:38.440> event

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
have to do is decide what type of event

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.719 
have to do is decide what type of event
you<00:04:38.889> want<00:04:39.100> in<00:04:39.280> this<00:04:39.430> case<00:04:39.700> I<00:04:39.940> want<00:04:40.240> a<00:04:40.300> MIDI<00:04:40.479> note

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
you want in this case I want a MIDI note

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.270 
you want in this case I want a MIDI note
and<00:04:42.729> I<00:04:42.789> can<00:04:42.820> change<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.240> Vallum<00:04:43.479> to<00:04:44.100> c3<00:04:45.100> or

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
and I can change the Vallum to c3 or

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.360 
and I can change the Vallum to c3 or
whatever<00:04:45.520> note<00:04:45.760> you<00:04:45.910> want<00:04:46.090> to<00:04:46.210> play<00:04:47.370> actually

whatever note you want to play actually

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.010 
whatever note you want to play actually
to<00:04:48.460> see<00:04:48.639> one

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.610 

and<00:04:54.290> that's<00:04:54.710> c1<00:04:56.080> alright<00:04:57.080> now<00:04:57.230> I'm<00:04:57.320> gonna<00:04:57.410> show

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
and that's c1 alright now I'm gonna show

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.290 
and that's c1 alright now I'm gonna show
you<00:04:57.680> a<00:04:57.770> more<00:04:58.160> practical<00:04:58.670> method<00:04:58.790> here<00:04:59.180> going

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
you a more practical method here going

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.630 
you a more practical method here going
to<00:04:59.360> show<00:04:59.510> you<00:04:59.570> how<00:04:59.660> to<00:04:59.720> attach<00:04:59.930> it<00:05:00.170> to<00:05:00.200> the<00:05:00.680> the

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
to show you how to attach it to the the

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:07.390 
to show you how to attach it to the the
morph<00:05:01.940> pad<00:05:02.210> in<00:05:02.510> the<00:05:02.630> XY<00:05:03.020> pad<00:05:06.100> so<00:05:07.100> all<00:05:07.250> you

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
morph pad in the XY pad so all you

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.340 
morph pad in the XY pad so all you
really<00:05:07.520> need<00:05:07.700> to<00:05:07.730> do<00:05:08.000> is<00:05:08.270> go<00:05:08.720> down<00:05:08.870> here<00:05:09.230> to

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
really need to do is go down here to

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.140 
really need to do is go down here to
morph<00:05:09.770> X&amp;Y<00:05:10.340> and<00:05:10.910> change<00:05:11.810> it<00:05:11.990> to<00:05:12.230> whatever

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
morph X&amp;Y and change it to whatever

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.730 
morph X&amp;Y and change it to whatever
submit<00:05:14.150> ECC<00:05:14.570> you<00:05:14.690> want<00:05:14.900> to<00:05:14.990> use<00:05:15.170> in<00:05:15.440> this<00:05:15.560> case

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
submit ECC you want to use in this case

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.100 
submit ECC you want to use in this case
I<00:05:15.890> have<00:05:15.980> 22<00:05:16.370> and<00:05:16.490> 23<00:05:16.760> so<00:05:17.750> you<00:05:17.840> go<00:05:17.960> over<00:05:18.050> to

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
I have 22 and 23 so you go over to

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.090 
I have 22 and 23 so you go over to
oscillating<00:05:19.270> and<00:05:20.270> you<00:05:20.480> make<00:05:20.630> sure<00:05:20.810> that<00:05:21.100> that

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
oscillating and you make sure that that

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.930 
oscillating and you make sure that that
your<00:05:22.250> X&amp;Y<00:05:22.550> is<00:05:22.940> set<00:05:23.120> to<00:05:23.270> 22<00:05:23.750> and<00:05:23.780> 23<00:05:24.760> so<00:05:25.760> once

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
your X&amp;Y is set to 22 and 23 so once

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.510 
your X&amp;Y is set to 22 and 23 so once
that<00:05:26.000> set<00:05:26.300> up<00:05:26.560> just<00:05:27.560> test<00:05:27.860> it<00:05:28.010> and<00:05:28.160> see<00:05:28.250> that

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
that set up just test it and see that

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.420 
that set up just test it and see that
it's<00:05:28.640> actually<00:05:28.970> working<00:05:30.100> alright<00:05:31.100> and<00:05:31.250> there

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
it's actually working alright and there

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.370 
it's actually working alright and there
you<00:05:31.460> have<00:05:31.610> it<00:05:34.390> that's<00:05:35.390> a<00:05:35.570> practical<00:05:36.050> method

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
you have it that's a practical method

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.320 
you have it that's a practical method
here<00:05:36.560> it's<00:05:36.770> real<00:05:36.950> easy<00:05:36.980> as<00:05:37.550> you<00:05:37.910> saw<00:05:38.060> in<00:05:38.270> a

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
here it's real easy as you saw in a

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330 
here it's real easy as you saw in a
couple<00:05:38.600> seconds<00:05:38.870> you<00:05:38.960> can<00:05:39.080> sync<00:05:39.350> it<00:05:39.410> up<00:05:39.560> and<00:05:40.220> it

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
couple seconds you can sync it up and it

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.670 
couple seconds you can sync it up and it
just<00:05:40.370> automatically<00:05:41.120> picks<00:05:41.360> it<00:05:41.480> up<00:05:41.680> alright

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
just automatically picks it up alright

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.810 
just automatically picks it up alright
there<00:05:42.860> you<00:05:42.920> have<00:05:43.040> it<00:05:43.190> that's<00:05:43.340> how<00:05:43.460> you<00:05:43.550> can

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
there you have it that's how you can

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.630 
there you have it that's how you can
simply<00:05:44.360> connect<00:05:44.750> your<00:05:44.990> iPad<00:05:45.650> to<00:05:45.980> logic<00:05:46.430> studio
