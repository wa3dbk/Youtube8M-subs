00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.060
 the classics have pictures 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.189
 instructions but I think it makes no sense current 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.109

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:52.500

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.700
 Immediately I want to notice the wire is very cool 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.670
 and very powerful look it in a wrapper 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:10.420

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:29.380
 like that 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.690
 In general, it can be seen that he is in such a fabric 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.479
 nice fabric and wicker yes it is very 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.389

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.120

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:36.039

 test this microphone like this 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.630

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:07.020
 accordingly, everything is delayed so that he 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.520
 did not move under already been see 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.640
 what next is this box but in my opinion 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:17.160
 there is nothing else should pull up 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:20.700
