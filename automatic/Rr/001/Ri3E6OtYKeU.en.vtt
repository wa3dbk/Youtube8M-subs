00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.109
 yeah one in all the all phases 

00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:06.250
 of the game he was present as well we're going 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.590
 by its speed what we can expect 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.410
 of a small but but also rebound this 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.690
 which is exceptional and then especially a 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.820
 commitment at all times and we have 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.910
 the impression that he always want 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.770
 to have an impact on the game what 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.519
 that he has never seen what he is 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:27.430
 always in all phases of the game to 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:30.580
 see his stats rogers is dreaming 20.7 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.880

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.820
 rebounds 3.55 interception of rags 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.500
 rare when we measure a meter 61 or so 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.800
 you prefer five feet and four 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:01:13.150
 inch 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:01:14.920

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.320
 last night everyone wants to see it 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.939
 everyone wants to approach him singing 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.040
 rodgers only discusses his 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.710
 second match in three but he's already 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.000
 the number 1 attraction against the greens 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.730
 of all their theses 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.160
 it is he who gives the right tempo 17 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.610

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:38.970
 points 6 rebounds 10 assists and 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.970
 the man is needed from 11.89 to 77 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.160
 seen from here 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.390
 sang in the rogers won his 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.220
 fight against prejudices 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.620
 but the little man baltimore dreams 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.870
 to go even higher this game hours 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.580
