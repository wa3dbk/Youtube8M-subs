describe that aspect of because I think

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.160

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
people that are in the Saudi government

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.740 
people that are in the Saudi government
I<00:06:27.250> think<00:06:27.670> that<00:06:27.820> the<00:06:28.300> United<00:06:28.690> States

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
I think that the United States

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.230 
I think that the United States
government<00:06:28.990> has<00:06:29.410> a<00:06:29.560> lot<00:06:29.800> of<00:06:29.830> discretion<00:06:30.430> and<00:06:30.820> I

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
government has a lot of discretion and I

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.300 
government has a lot of discretion and I
think<00:06:31.300> that<00:06:31.570> they<00:06:31.900> grease<00:06:32.530> the<00:06:32.740> wheel<00:06:32.920> a<00:06:32.950> lot

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
think that they grease the wheel a lot

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.860 
think that they grease the wheel a lot
because<00:06:33.550> the<00:06:33.910> Saudis<00:06:34.300> are<00:06:34.330> one<00:06:34.630> of<00:06:34.750> our

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
because the Saudis are one of our

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.570 
because the Saudis are one of our
biggest<00:06:35.050> allies<00:06:35.530> in<00:06:35.830> the<00:06:35.919> Middle<00:06:35.950> East<00:06:36.310> and<00:06:36.490> we

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
biggest allies in the Middle East and we

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.900 
biggest allies in the Middle East and we
want<00:06:36.760> to<00:06:36.850> keep<00:06:36.940> them<00:06:37.120> that<00:06:37.270> way<00:06:37.330> excuse<00:06:38.169> me<00:06:38.320> I

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
want to keep them that way excuse me I

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.240 
want to keep them that way excuse me I
on<00:06:39.060> national<00:06:39.810> security<00:06:39.960> grounds<00:06:40.560> if<00:06:40.920> this<00:06:41.100> is

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
on national security grounds if this is

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.710 
on national security grounds if this is
going<00:06:41.370> to<00:06:41.460> happen<00:06:41.640> I<00:06:42.090> think<00:06:42.450> this<00:06:42.540> is

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 
going to happen I think this is

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.850 
going to happen I think this is
something<00:06:42.900> that<00:06:43.020> the<00:06:43.140> American<00:06:43.470> people<00:06:43.590> need
