00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.410 

by<00:00:12.860> reversing<00:00:13.430> the<00:00:13.460> mount<00:00:13.730> I<00:00:13.850> was<00:00:14.000> able<00:00:14.240> to<00:00:14.270> get

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
by reversing the mount I was able to get

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.140 
by reversing the mount I was able to get
it<00:00:14.570> to<00:00:14.930> go<00:00:15.740> a<00:00:15.770> little<00:00:15.950> bit<00:00:16.160> further<00:00:16.520> back<00:00:16.820> I

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
it to go a little bit further back I

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.740 
it to go a little bit further back I
like<00:00:17.420> the<00:00:17.600> idea<00:00:17.990> of<00:00:18.020> it<00:00:18.140> not<00:00:18.380> being<00:00:18.910> out<00:00:19.910> where

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
like the idea of it not being out where

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.720 
like the idea of it not being out where
as<00:00:20.869> quite<00:00:21.200> as<00:00:21.320> exposed<00:00:21.800> and<00:00:22.160> vulnerable<00:00:22.189> to

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
as quite as exposed and vulnerable to

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.269 
as quite as exposed and vulnerable to
being<00:00:22.970> knocked<00:00:23.210> off

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.310 

the<00:00:29.789> two<00:00:30.029> short<00:00:30.359> wires<00:00:30.630> coming<00:00:30.990> out<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
the two short wires coming out of the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:01:17.149 
the two short wires coming out of the
light<00:00:31.500> or<00:00:31.710> for<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.250> taillight

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.940 

okay<00:01:17.850> here's<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.119> valuable<00:01:18.450> lesson<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.289> went<00:01:19.799> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
okay here's a valuable lesson I went to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.160 
okay here's a valuable lesson I went to
a<00:01:19.979> whole<00:01:20.219> lot<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.700> trouble<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.659> not<00:01:21.960> only

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
a whole lot of trouble to not only

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.359 
a whole lot of trouble to not only
mechanically<00:01:23.039> attach<00:01:23.399> the<00:01:23.759> two<00:01:25.159> plugs<00:01:26.159> that

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
mechanically attach the two plugs that

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.760 
mechanically attach the two plugs that
came<00:01:26.759> with<00:01:27.149> the<00:01:28.100> light<00:01:29.149> but<00:01:30.149> I<00:01:30.179> soldered<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.259> so

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
came with the light but I soldered it so

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.139 
came with the light but I soldered it so
that<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:31.950> would<00:01:32.039> have<00:01:32.189> both<00:01:32.429> an<00:01:32.610> electrical

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
that it would have both an electrical

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.300 
that it would have both an electrical
and<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.420> mechanical<00:01:33.929> connection<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.560> then<00:01:35.280> I

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
and a mechanical connection and then I

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.279 
and a mechanical connection and then I
very<00:01:35.670> carefully<00:01:36.270> put<00:01:36.479> shrink<00:01:36.810> wrap<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.259> it

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
very carefully put shrink wrap on it

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.139 
very carefully put shrink wrap on it
then<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.280> looked<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.909> said<00:01:39.240> oh<00:01:39.450> boy<00:01:40.700> those<00:01:41.700> are

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
then I looked and said oh boy those are

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.919 
then I looked and said oh boy those are
not<00:01:42.600> going<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.899> fit<00:01:43.170> over<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:44.729> terminals<00:01:45.720> on

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
not going to fit over the terminals on

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.760 
not going to fit over the terminals on
the<00:01:45.960> hub<00:01:46.319> and<00:01:46.759> indeed<00:01:47.759> they<00:01:48.179> do<00:01:48.240> not<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.929> would

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
the hub and indeed they do not I would

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.240 
the hub and indeed they do not I would
have<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.360> have<00:01:51.360> something<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.890> wide

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
have to have something that is that wide

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.279 
have to have something that is that wide
I<00:01:53.700> think<00:01:54.240> what<00:01:54.390> I'm<00:01:54.479> going<00:01:54.599> to<00:01:54.659> do<00:01:54.780> instead<00:01:54.990> is

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
I think what I'm going to do instead is

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.969 
I think what I'm going to do instead is
just<00:01:55.799> cut<00:01:56.459> these<00:01:56.700> off<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.500> solder<00:01:58.500> them<00:01:58.770> to

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
just cut these off and solder them to

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.580 
just cut these off and solder them to
the<00:01:59.130> wire<00:01:59.420> they'll<00:02:00.420> have<00:02:00.630> good<00:02:00.659> mechanical

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
the wire they'll have good mechanical

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.660 
the wire they'll have good mechanical
protection<00:02:01.909> underneath<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:04.039> the<00:02:05.039> wire<00:02:05.280> wrap

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
protection underneath the the wire wrap

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.889 
protection underneath the the wire wrap
it's<00:02:06.659> okay<00:02:06.990> we<00:02:07.259> have<00:02:07.530> Reese<00:02:08.009> honored<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.910> old

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
it's okay we have Reese honored the old

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.580 
it's okay we have Reese honored the old
ends<00:02:10.530> onto<00:02:10.799> the<00:02:11.009> new<00:02:11.190> wire<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:12.630> only<00:02:12.959> heat

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
ends onto the new wire the only heat

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.020 
ends onto the new wire the only heat

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
shrink tubing ahead of the right size

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.170 
shrink tubing ahead of the right size
was<00:02:15.390> blue<00:02:15.750> but<00:02:16.560> maybe<00:02:17.489> nobody<00:02:17.880> will<00:02:18.030> notice

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
was blue but maybe nobody will notice

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.380 
was blue but maybe nobody will notice
and<00:02:18.540> complain<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:20.640> let's<00:02:20.790> go<00:02:20.910> ahead<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.060> start

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
and complain so let's go ahead and start

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:48.780 
and complain so let's go ahead and start
wrapping<00:02:21.870> this

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.130 

this<00:02:49.790> point<00:02:50.090> I've<00:02:50.210> got<00:02:50.240> a<00:02:50.390> little<00:02:50.750> bit<00:02:50.870> more

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
this point I've got a little bit more

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.410 
this point I've got a little bit more
wire<00:02:51.470> than<00:02:51.740> I<00:02:51.770> need<00:02:52.100> so<00:02:52.820> we're<00:02:52.940> going<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.090> plug

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
wire than I need so we're going to plug

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:02.770 
wire than I need so we're going to plug
these<00:02:53.630> in

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.860 

I'm<00:03:03.290> going<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.590> make<00:03:03.680> sure<00:03:04.160> that<00:03:04.640> it<00:03:04.760> works<00:03:05.000> wow

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
I'm going to make sure that it works wow

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.000 
I'm going to make sure that it works wow
that's<00:03:06.110> bright<00:03:06.380> that<00:03:07.370> works<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:08.740> then<00:03:09.740> we'll

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
that's bright that works and then we'll

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.690 
that's bright that works and then we'll
take<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.310> excess<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.270> dress<00:03:11.930> it<00:03:12.140> up<00:03:12.700> inside

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
take the excess and dress it up inside

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:39.250 
take the excess and dress it up inside
the<00:03:16.300> spiral<00:03:17.300> around

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.800 

and<00:03:39.739> there<00:03:40.159> we<00:03:40.280> go<00:03:40.489> it's<00:03:41.000> a<00:03:41.060> little<00:03:41.480> tight<00:03:41.780> so

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
and there we go it's a little tight so

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.970 
and there we go it's a little tight so
I'm<00:03:42.050> going<00:03:42.170> to<00:03:42.200> pull<00:03:42.590> just<00:03:42.890> a<00:03:43.099> little<00:03:44.060> bit<00:03:44.269> of

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
I'm going to pull just a little bit of

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.220 
I'm going to pull just a little bit of
slack<00:03:45.980> there<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:46.640> thought<00:03:47.599> I<00:03:47.659> had<00:03:47.840> a<00:03:47.870> small

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
slack there I thought I had a small

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.720 
slack there I thought I had a small
piece<00:03:48.530> of<00:03:49.030> spiral<00:03:50.030> wrap<00:03:50.299> left<00:03:50.769> but<00:03:51.769> I'll<00:03:52.430> cut<00:03:52.700> a

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
piece of spiral wrap left but I'll cut a

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.789 
piece of spiral wrap left but I'll cut a
new<00:03:52.819> piece<00:03:52.970> just<00:03:53.569> to<00:03:53.900> make<00:03:54.319> that<00:03:54.500> look<00:03:54.680> a

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
new piece just to make that look a

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:02.680 
new piece just to make that look a
little<00:03:55.069> better<00:03:55.569> round<00:03:56.569> it<00:03:56.780> up<00:03:56.930> there<00:04:01.480> it's<00:04:02.480> not

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
little better round it up there it's not

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.809 
little better round it up there it's not
really<00:04:02.930> necessary<00:04:03.560> but<00:04:03.890> I<00:04:04.160> think<00:04:04.489> it<00:04:04.549> dresses

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
really necessary but I think it dresses

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:44.480 
really necessary but I think it dresses
it<00:04:04.970> up<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.209> little<00:04:05.360> bit

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:58.210 

and<00:04:45.490> it<00:04:45.700> works<00:04:45.940> so<00:04:46.630> that's<00:04:47.050> a<00:04:47.200> wonderful<00:04:47.380> thing

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.100 

okay<00:04:58.940> one<00:04:59.150> thing<00:04:59.180> about<00:04:59.480> the<00:04:59.570> light<00:04:59.720> it<00:04:59.870> does

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
okay one thing about the light it does

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.500 
okay one thing about the light it does
throw<00:05:00.470> out<00:05:00.680> a<00:05:00.920> lot<00:05:01.130> of<00:05:01.280> juice<00:05:01.550> and<00:05:04.420> even<00:05:05.420> the
