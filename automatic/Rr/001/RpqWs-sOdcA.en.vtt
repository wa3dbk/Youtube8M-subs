00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.860
 hello to everyone in this video would like to 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.340
 you do a test drive tonal framework 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.460
 otto clarence everlasting as far as i am 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.410
 I remember I put a photo here, here I am 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.010
 looking for a new tonal basis because 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.550
 that ended my favorite tonal 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.890
 mix was displayed 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.800
 and I decided to try something from the suite 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.230
 for a long time I have not tried in the general 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.280
 drew attention to the basics clarans took 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.020
 probnichek on this basis and also some 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.280
 Highlighting to teach I already put it on 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.360
 one part of the face 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.430
 she is really very good 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.120
 blocks redness 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.789
 I took the brightest shade 103 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.800
 I also like her smell so much 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.719
 floral something like her scent 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.370
 tones from chanel 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.520
 and let's get down to applying 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.109
 second half of the face and also we ISC 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.350
 we will check you how much tincture 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.000
 how much she keeps matizing general 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.750
 all its characteristics after 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.439
 some time lapse this is the basis 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.780
 has a creamy powder finish i.e. she 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.030
 liquid but dense at the same time falls 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.060
 subtle enough ie coating 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.000
 the average does not strongly emphasize peeling 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.350
 that I really like 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.960
 honestly I did not read 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.180
 description from the manufacturer but rather 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.380
 In total, this tonal basis is stated and 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.540
 as resistant and as highlighting in 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.270
 principle you can see already this 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.369
 The effect of a light moist luster on the face 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.380
 even though I have oily skin on it 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.470
 I like this effect very much because 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.470
 that he makes the face more youthful and light 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.319
 as far as i remember from this basis 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:59.289
 spf15 that is absolutely enough for me 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:08.019
 and so here I am, in principle, already toned 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:11.819
 I like the whole effect honestly 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:15.340
 I confess and if it lasts 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.220
 about the same as the bourgeois is 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.970
 I can say that most likely I myself and 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.880
 will buy 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.220
 but the bourgeois I continue to love and if you 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.680
 Looking for a good budget for tonal foundation 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.900
 then pay attention to her because 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.030
 I have on pc sheer gloss 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.360
 I'm going to make a comparison with the bourgeois 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.700
 phoenix and frankly to Jacques 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.010
 wins according to some characteristics 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.310
 it is much better naturally cheaper and 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.790
 I think he wins many 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.049
 luxury tones i'm not talking about 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.049
 mass market Orsk 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.280
 Well , so here is the basis 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.049
 I like it now I have powder 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.139
 I'll disguise some of my own 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:02.170
 pimples and so I already powdered her 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:04.810
 and honestly that in itself it is without 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.310
 powder is absolutely not sticky so in 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.459
 In principle, I think you can not even 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.579
 dusting absolutely not felt on 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:15.190
 her face is very light and pleasant 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:18.090
 after a while she seems to be sitting down 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.790
 there is if at first it seemed to me that she 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.919
 lays down me very smoothly and enough 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.549
 strongly emphasizes peeling now 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:30.970
 the situation has improved a bit she settled down 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.889
 good on the face in general i probably 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.049
 I’m going to make you lips for now because 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.810
 would like to show you my new also 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.790
 nyx pokupochka who bought from Kiev 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.310
 and here's what product you would like 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.819
 lip show is nyx soft matte lip 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.519
 cream 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.739
 and I finally tried to buy it in 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:51.930
 keel because there are my goats a whole stand 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:56.079
 mix and i took a shade milan 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.849
 I have already tested it and honestly say that 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.760
 the product is not bad but it has its 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.950
 cons but 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.150
 in the king for his value he is very 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.150
 behaves with dignity 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.110
 I will honestly say that for my money it is 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.330
 very cool fudge she reminded me 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.190
 cream stand lipstick by sephora 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.770
 the only lipstick vote for and of course 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.800
 lasts much longer i think nix 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.500
 will very quickly go from the lips but 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.139
 Do you know this fudge I have experienced reception 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.259
 food when you put it very nice 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:52.780
 felt on the lips and i also don't feel 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:55.330
 no discomfort during wear in 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.930
 during the day but then when passed 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.509
 some time hours 6 and I already came 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.300
 wash off the makeup I looked at my lips 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:06.940
 they were just like parchment such everything 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.000
 skimpy dried up by the way color more 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.949
 stayed on the lips ie this 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.919
 specifically given shade or all of them 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.539
 work a little bit like tint so there is 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:19.360
 its cons but they honestly 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:21.220
 minor and you know I haven't 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.080
 lost the desire to try the other one 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.520
 so I liked it lipstick 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.729
 I also like shades 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.490
 this shade is cute I remind you and everything 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.889
 let's wait for the results now 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.050
 testing the very tonal framework from 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:38.680
 kloran complete our image with 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:41.949
 I have cream blush from denters 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:45.039
 natural color and for 50 hryvnia 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:47.229
 they have such a price they are wonderful 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.389
 behave the only negative that their 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:53.669
 need to quickly and carefully shade 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.669
 until they stuck to the skin 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:06:00.509
 hello so on my face 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.520
 tonal lasted more than five hours I 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:06.479
 would even say 6 because I have him 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:08.400
 Has put in five evenings already 11 and I never 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:09.180
 didn’t promote nod to a matting person 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.190
 napkin 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.639
 as you can see my face 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.650
 shines enough but in principle 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:19.110
 I would not say that it glitters like 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.509
 fat damn the same effect on me 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.970
 observed from the healthy bourgeois mix 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:26.759
 but a little less that is and how 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.819
 matting tonal this tone from clarans 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:33.120
 He certainly does not work but I would like 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:38.090
 notice that he really stands that 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:41.310
 he didn’t drip of course his pores became visible 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:43.349
 Immediately after applying, I waited 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.550
 some time somewhere minute five 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:47.460
 ten 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:50.400
 tonal very cool lay on the face i 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.969
 even the effect of this tonal 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.979
 could compare with the effect of 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:58.050
 airbrush i.e. pores absolutely everything 

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:01.110
 flattened face was very smooth 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:05.909
 so soft like after silicone 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:08.250
 base is not quite he lay down tight but here if 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:11.520
 look at myself from afar I am very 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:14.520
 really liked it so I won't say that I 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.460
 I will immediately buy it, but you know 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.479
 this is one of my last tonal 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:23.069
 luxury one of the most successful 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:25.500
 judge for yourself how you like the effect 

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:28.050
 or not tonally good for its price 

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:30.479
 of course he could behave a little 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:33.180
 best of all, I confess exactly because 

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:35.310
 little he stressed peeling not 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.800
 very well mattes the skin well in general you 

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.840
 see for yourself I hope you have this video 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.870
 was useful and interesting 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:45.800
 Thank you all for watching and all while yes 

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.800
