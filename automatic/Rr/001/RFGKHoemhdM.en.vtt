00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.419
 welcome to the young people of him 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.789
 I bring you how to adjust a blouse 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.280
 and also from the sides 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:28.009
 as long as I'm going to remember 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.009
 just the other side 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.530
 well I count the russa 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 in which I wanted to go so much 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:49.560
 rather the curvature of the hand and take 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:54.980
 the measurement of the shoulder 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.980
 what I went through in the rows 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.000
 marquez 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.690
 and with a rule 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.170
 curve 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.270
 Mark what is the waist 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.550
 from the previous point that we mark 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:54.180
 and then we join this point 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.560
 to the shoulder line that we had 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.560
 marked previously 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.240
 let's sew the sleeve 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.590
 to put it in the place where we have 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.590
 marked previously 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.630
 We cut the 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.040
 [Music] 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.040
 the excess of cloth 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.230
 where we mark 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.740
 leaving a seam allowance and also 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.000
 remember that one more centimeter is left 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.000
 wide the back 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:47.840
 Well, let's cut the sides 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:47.840
 then we go through the front 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.240
 let's accommodate the sleeve 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.530
 We will make the sewing around 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.110
 the sleeve 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.790
 leaving as a beginning and end what is 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.939
 the armpit 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.530
 for later if we have to 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.530
 remove a little of sleeves 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:27.890
 and all that is the culture of 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.890
 the side we follow up sleeve 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.450
 good is my book that goes inside 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.570
 and in the parts a little hand 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:53.650
 the seam of the I will continue for 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:57.209
 all the little hands 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.209
 and finally that's how it was 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:18.680
 Well I hope you have served this 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:23.290

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:28.800
