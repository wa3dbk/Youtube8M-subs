this<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:09.080> no<00:00:10.080> it's<00:00:10.290> not<00:00:10.469> centipede<00:00:11.250> what<00:00:11.820> do

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
this is no it's not centipede what do

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.299 
this is no it's not centipede what do
you<00:00:11.969> mean<00:00:12.179> this<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.200> actually<00:00:13.469> the

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
you mean this is actually the

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.849 
you mean this is actually the
little-known<00:00:14.910> sequel<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.020> centipedes<00:00:16.560> which

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
little-known sequel to centipedes which

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.420 
little-known sequel to centipedes which
is<00:00:17.039> called<00:00:17.340> millipede<00:00:18.140> and<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.949> think<00:00:20.250> it's

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
is called millipede and I think it's

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.960 
is called millipede and I think it's
actually<00:00:21.060> one<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.660> very<00:00:21.689> few<00:00:22.439> games<00:00:23.400> Atari

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
actually one of the very few games Atari

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.070 
actually one of the very few games Atari
actually<00:00:24.779> made<00:00:25.170> on<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.710> NES<00:00:28.820> it's<00:00:30.080> it's

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
actually made on the NES it's it's

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.350 
actually made on the NES it's it's
almost<00:00:31.349> actually<00:00:32.009> almost<00:00:32.640> exactly<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.329> same

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
almost actually almost exactly the same

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.680 
almost actually almost exactly the same
as<00:00:33.630> centipede<00:00:34.290> there<00:00:34.559> are<00:00:34.710> some<00:00:35.690> differences

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
as centipede there are some differences

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.130 
as centipede there are some differences
in<00:00:36.750> enemies<00:00:37.850> but<00:00:38.850> otherwise<00:00:39.239> it's<00:00:39.660> pretty

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
in enemies but otherwise it's pretty

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.279 
in enemies but otherwise it's pretty
much<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.590> same<00:00:40.620> concept<00:00:43.730> and<00:00:44.870> there<00:00:45.870> hasn't

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
much the same concept and there hasn't

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.529 
much the same concept and there hasn't
been<00:00:46.530> too<00:00:46.980> much<00:00:47.190> changes<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.270> version

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
been too much changes to this version

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.250 
been too much changes to this version
apart<00:00:49.170> from<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.590> sprites<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.280> guess<00:00:51.199> now<00:00:52.199> we

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
apart from the sprites I guess now we

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.810 
apart from the sprites I guess now we
got<00:00:52.530> flying<00:00:53.460> tanks<00:00:54.180> for<00:00:54.420> some<00:00:54.750> reason<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.820> all

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
got flying tanks for some reason and all

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.290 
got flying tanks for some reason and all
kind<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.210> crap<00:00:57.680> dropping<00:00:58.680> down<00:00:59.039> from<00:00:59.180> from<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
kind of crap dropping down from from the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.230 
kind of crap dropping down from from the
skies<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:02.660> normally<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.809> course<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.320> all

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
skies and normally of course it's all

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.240 
skies and normally of course it's all
creepy<00:01:06.240> critters<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.840> come<00:01:07.619> rushing<00:01:07.979> down

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
creepy critters that come rushing down

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.810 
creepy critters that come rushing down
at<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.810> name<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.170> choice<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.890> oh

crap<00:01:15.180> I'm<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.250> die<00:01:17.659> which<00:01:18.659> is

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
crap I'm going to die which is

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.060 
crap I'm going to die which is
completely<00:01:20.009> not<00:01:20.820> necessary<00:01:21.479> since<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.380> could

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
completely not necessary since I could

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.929 
completely not necessary since I could
have<00:01:23.189> actually<00:01:24.140> gone<00:01:25.140> up<00:01:25.200> but<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.430> forgot<00:01:26.790> about

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
have actually gone up but I forgot about

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.480 
have actually gone up but I forgot about
that<00:01:27.090> which<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.810> often<00:01:28.259> together<00:01:28.590> with<00:01:29.280> this

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
that which is often together with this

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.090 
that which is often together with this
game<00:01:29.840> every<00:01:30.840> time<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> first<00:01:31.439> time<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.740> die<00:01:31.950> I

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
game every time the first time I die I

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.810 
game every time the first time I die I
just<00:01:32.369> forget<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.119> let's<00:01:34.250> get<00:01:35.250> around<00:01:35.400> those

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
just forget it let's get around those

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.480 
just forget it let's get around those
guys<00:01:36.150> when<00:01:36.780> possible

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.230 

and<00:01:44.250> there<00:01:45.250> was<00:01:45.430> you<00:01:45.640> need<00:01:45.820> to<00:01:45.850> shoot<00:01:46.090> down

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
and there was you need to shoot down

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.800 
and there was you need to shoot down
before<00:01:46.810> they<00:01:47.260> get<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.880> your<00:01:49.180> ship

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
before they get on your ship

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.270 
before they get on your ship
which<00:01:50.710> is<00:01:50.950> of<00:01:51.160> course<00:01:51.460> obvious<00:01:52.590> but<00:01:53.590> I<00:01:53.950> just

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
which is of course obvious but I just

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.520 
which is of course obvious but I just
like<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.840> show<00:01:55.840> off<00:01:55.869> how<00:01:56.290> much<00:01:56.500> I<00:01:56.650> suck<00:01:56.950> I<00:01:57.100> guess

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
like to show off how much I suck I guess

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.730 
like to show off how much I suck I guess
I'm<00:01:59.530> not<00:01:59.710> good<00:01:59.950> at<00:02:00.130> this<00:02:00.250> game<00:02:00.720> either<00:02:01.720> as<00:02:02.380> you

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
I'm not good at this game either as you

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.400 
I'm not good at this game either as you
can<00:02:02.979> see<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:06.390> actually<00:02:07.390> never<00:02:07.840> played<00:02:08.020> this

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
can see and I actually never played this

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.810 
can see and I actually never played this
one<00:02:08.679> back<00:02:09.160> in<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.369> day<00:02:09.459> as<00:02:10.090> they<00:02:10.300> say<00:02:10.330> I

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
one back in the day as they say I

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.880 
one back in the day as they say I
probably<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:12.940> first<00:02:13.180> time<00:02:13.390> I<00:02:13.420> played<00:02:13.890> well

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
probably the first time I played well

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.970 
probably the first time I played well
that<00:02:15.310> was<00:02:15.510> centipede<00:02:16.510> probably<00:02:17.080> was<00:02:17.260> on<00:02:17.290> one

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
that was centipede probably was on one

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.290 
that was centipede probably was on one
of<00:02:18.010> those<00:02:18.250> compilation<00:02:19.060> discs<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.690> guess<00:02:19.989> I

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
of those compilation discs I guess I

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.540 
of those compilation discs I guess I
really<00:02:22.300> don't<00:02:22.540> even<00:02:22.660> know<00:02:22.989> as<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:25.090> him<00:02:25.420> didn't

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
really don't even know as and him didn't

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.250 
really don't even know as and him didn't
leave<00:02:27.550> that<00:02:27.760> good<00:02:27.970> of<00:02:28.090> an<00:02:28.209> impression<00:02:28.570> and<00:02:29.110> we

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
leave that good of an impression and we

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.370 
leave that good of an impression and we
got<00:02:29.470> an<00:02:29.560> extra<00:02:29.680> life<00:02:30.070> suite

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
got an extra life suite

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.050 
got an extra life suite
we'll<00:02:32.380> be<00:02:33.190> using<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:35.400> probably<00:02:36.400> really

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
we'll be using that probably really

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.900 
we'll be using that probably really
quickly<00:02:38.010> since<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.280> don't<00:02:39.340> lost<00:02:39.700> this

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
quickly since I don't lost this

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.289 
quickly since I don't lost this
loneliness<00:02:40.480> again<00:02:44.100> lying<00:02:45.100> things<00:02:45.610> is<00:02:45.910> kind<00:02:46.180> of

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
loneliness again lying things is kind of

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.089 
loneliness again lying things is kind of
ridiculous

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.250 

and<00:02:52.099> as<00:02:52.370> you<00:02:52.489> can<00:02:52.640> see<00:02:52.700> as<00:02:53.000> those<00:02:53.239> boulders<00:02:53.959> get

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
and as you can see as those boulders get

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.650 
and as you can see as those boulders get
down<00:02:54.500> they<00:02:54.739> just<00:02:55.690> roll<00:02:56.690> around<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:57.650> bit<00:02:58.660> but

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
down they just roll around a bit but

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.260 
down they just roll around a bit but
that's<00:03:00.080> just<00:03:00.440> cheap

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.230 

more<00:03:06.140> crap<00:03:06.470> on<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.070> screen<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:07.640> now<00:03:08.060> there

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
more crap on the screen and now there
