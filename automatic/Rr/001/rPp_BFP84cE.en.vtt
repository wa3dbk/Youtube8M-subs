very<00:05:17.110> good<00:05:17.200> at<00:05:17.530> it<00:05:17.710> and<00:05:17.770> I<00:05:17.890> just<00:05:18.100> never<00:05:18.400> played

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
very good at it and I just never played

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.480 
very good at it and I just never played
it<00:05:19.000> after<00:05:19.780> a<00:05:20.140> month<00:05:20.530> and<00:05:20.800> that's<00:05:20.950> why<00:05:21.190> I<00:05:21.220> never

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
it after a month and that's why I never

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.280 
it after a month and that's why I never
really<00:05:21.760> got<00:05:21.910> into<00:05:22.060> mud<00:05:22.420> 11<00:05:22.810> either<00:05:22.960> because<00:05:23.200> I

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
really got into mud 11 either because I

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.980 
really got into mud 11 either because I
never<00:05:23.470> really<00:05:23.710> played<00:05:23.920> the<00:05:24.130> game<00:05:24.570> but<00:05:25.570> I<00:05:25.630> would

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990
