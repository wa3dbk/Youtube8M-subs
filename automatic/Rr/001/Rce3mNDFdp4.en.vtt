00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.950
 on youtube is the nuclear command floor 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.590
 on this occasion to show a little 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.380
 more about the strategy of arenas but 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.020
 this time do not leave me this time an attack 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.660
 formal good to see first in 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.460
 strategy they use is what they have 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.720
 what to do is destroy the mortars 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.739
 common place in this case for 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.180
 eliminate the mortars of what they have 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.840
 what to do is to draw the attention of the 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.460
 mortar and firing you to another to 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.230
 another building that is on par as in 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.300
 this case I did first me 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.400
 shooting the cannon so that the 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.340
 mortar is distracted from that the lawn and I 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.830
 can attack the mortar with a little 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.080
 more than goalkeepers good up here what 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.100
 we have to do is with the minor 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.380
 amount of archers possible destroy 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.570
 all these camps that were there 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.730
 in order to allow free passage to be able 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.250
 Doing the same thing draws the attention of the 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:11.100
 mortar and destroy the mortar 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.080
 good as we see practically that already 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.850
 Then I 'm studying it. 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.860
 here as we have been mortar is a 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.870
 little bit more hidden what we should 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.610
 use are made of radio I used 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.390
 we give that normally with two 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.610
 destroy all mortars 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.030
 at least have a level 4 the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.240
 spells to be used and already 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.229
 having the free space without mortars 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.780
 all we have to do is look 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.219
 an area through which we can penetrate and 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.729
 for this case I had already cleaned 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:44.280
 all this area right there I went 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.640
 all my archers and end and it was opening 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.720
 step to be able to make a greater 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.630
 destruction 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.569
 we take not always we will find 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.740
 farming villages like the previous half 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:59.240
 but when we find the one doing so 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.390
 that the mortars are a bit 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.810
 available to destroy them 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.930
 let's try it is quite simple to the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.640
 long 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.240
 it's just a little bit of practice what 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:17.410
 it is necessary but but good is how we see 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.200
 that simple strategy is only more 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.450
 that all destroy the mortars that 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.550
 main and the wizard towers that are 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.320
 the defenses that hurt splash 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.880
 and in the case to the archers that almost 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.560
 they always attack all together when not 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.170
 hit together 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.950
 then the mortars and the towers of 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.200
 magician got her out pretty fast then 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.790
 the strategy is that 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.000
 we first have to destroy 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.849
 the defenses that do damage splash a 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.790
 and after destroying those simply 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.819
 we are organizing 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.579
 where they are a little cleaner 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.439
 the area without so many defenses to be able 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.200
 drop in the attack and make a 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:02.000
 somewhat large destruction 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.700
 as we see in this repetition I already 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.739
 practically destroys more than 50% 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.260
 destroy the average city ​​hall 22 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.959
 stars level the most resources 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.750
 that in this case it was not for resources 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.420
 but I found that village and I 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.040
 I liked I liked attacking her to be able to 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.160
 show you how it is a good 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.440
 strategy with the nearby so nothing 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.890
 my people I hope you liked them 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.630
 have served a little and 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.660
 I hope you have learned a little bit about 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.970
 always I apologize strategy 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.550
 by the one we have in these videos 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.110
 but as he repeated in the video 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.210
 previous 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.180
 the most of all is due to problems 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:49.630
 of CPU problems with the computer but 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.210
 Today, I feel that they understand me 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.100
 little and that is the purpose that they can 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.320
 understand you learn a little bit of 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.970
 the tactic and you employing in your 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.470
 attacks 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.520
 good as I told you in the previous video 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.740
 if you have attacks 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.960
 please record your screens and those that 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.670
 they have grass they can do much more 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.550
 easy they can look for tutorials in 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.110
 youtube with youtube or tutorials in all 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.810
 the internet there are quite a few tutorials 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.280
 how to record your screen with grass and 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.139
 also without grass 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.670
 I think the next video will be the 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:25.800
 special 200 already for this moment we are 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.350
 197 in the channel then already three 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.870
 people more practically already the 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.919
 Special is already around corner 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.990
 then especially I'm going to 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.440
 show the way in which I record my 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.630
 videos 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.100
 I do not have yeivic right now so I 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.220
 I'm recording practically all the 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.830
 video without boiling so not my people 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.720
 for those who record their games their 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.260
 attacks your defenses please send 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.240
 the twitter can upload them now 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.460
 any better server if it's the snot 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.169
 they can not send my account 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.290
 twitter 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.790
 Juan can send me in the direction I 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.280
 I'll be downloading it by watching them and 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.390
 analyzing them to comment on and 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.940
 upload them in a video on the channel 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.770
 a moment so we see each other until the 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.620
 next that if it's not wrong would be the 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:15.010
 special of 200 subscribers and it 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.840
 would come the draw for the 10 card 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.760
 iTunes dollars 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.150
 so nothing we see in the next 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.150
