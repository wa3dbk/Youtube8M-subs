notice that the tent is about three four

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:24.580 
notice that the tent is about three four
inches<00:01:18.160> off<00:01:18.550> the<00:01:18.580> ground<00:01:19.050> most<00:01:20.050> places

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.130 

here<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:25.979> see<00:01:26.249> that<00:01:26.640> I've<00:01:26.759> added

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
here you can see that I've added

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.309 
here you can see that I've added
Keltie<00:01:28.799> trip<00:01:29.130> tees<00:01:29.640> line<00:01:30.179> to<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:31.020> ends<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
Keltie trip tees line to the ends of the

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:33.410 
Keltie trip tees line to the ends of the
guy<00:01:31.619> outs<00:01:31.859> to<00:01:32.579> make<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.819> a<00:01:32.880> little<00:01:32.939> bit<00:01:33.119> easier

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
guy outs to make it a little bit easier

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.969 
guy outs to make it a little bit easier
because<00:01:33.569> that<00:01:33.810> ribbon<00:01:34.079> doesn't<00:01:34.530> really<00:01:34.679> work

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
because that ribbon doesn't really work

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.449 
because that ribbon doesn't really work
so<00:01:35.009> well<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.729> me<00:01:35.909> anyway<00:01:36.890> plus<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.039> adds<00:01:38.130> just

00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:38.459 
so well for me anyway plus it adds just

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:40.130 
so well for me anyway plus it adds just
a<00:01:38.609> little<00:01:38.850> bit<00:01:38.939> more<00:01:39.149> length<00:01:39.450> which<00:01:39.719> is<00:01:39.749> nice

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
a little bit more length which is nice

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.639 
a little bit more length which is nice
for<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.500> setup<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.189> also<00:01:41.969> use<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.359> steak<00:01:42.990> stuff

for the setup I also use a steak stuff
sack<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.189> protect<00:01:44.609> the<00:01:44.759> handle<00:01:45.179> the<00:01:45.299> trekking

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
sack to protect the handle the trekking

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.600 
sack to protect the handle the trekking
pole<00:01:45.929> from<00:01:46.319> the<00:01:46.469> dirt<00:01:46.709> and<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.039> ground

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
pole from the dirt and the ground

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.420 
pole from the dirt and the ground
here<00:01:49.450> you<00:01:49.630> can<00:01:49.840> see<00:01:50.110> that<00:01:50.470> I<00:01:50.500> even<00:01:50.710> did<00:01:50.830> around

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
here you can see that I even did around

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.570 
here you can see that I even did around
the<00:01:51.670> vent<00:01:52.260> given<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.380> vent<00:01:53.590> seat<00:01:53.920> of<00:01:54.130> an<00:01:54.340> event

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
the vent given the vent seat of an event

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.930 
the vent given the vent seat of an event
seam<00:01:54.910> up<00:01:55.150> there<00:01:55.480> and<00:01:56.350> then<00:01:56.530> I<00:01:56.680> sealed<00:01:57.070> down<00:01:57.580> the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
seam up there and then I sealed down the

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.200 
seam up there and then I sealed down the
length<00:01:58.210> of<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:58.810> door<00:01:59.460> so<00:02:00.460> nothing<00:02:00.880> would<00:02:01.030> get

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
length of the door so nothing would get

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.280 
length of the door so nothing would get
in<00:02:01.270> that<00:02:02.260> I<00:02:02.350> do<00:02:02.410> notice<00:02:02.800> that<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.430> zipper<00:02:04.290> you

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
in that I do notice that the zipper you

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
in that I do notice that the zipper you
know<00:02:05.380> high-wind

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
know high-wind

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.800 
know high-wind
would<00:02:06.760> probably<00:02:07.720> open<00:02:08.200> up<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.940> hasn't<00:02:10.570> yet

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
would probably open up it hasn't yet

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.390 
would probably open up it hasn't yet
because<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:11.260> haven't<00:02:11.410> been<00:02:11.590> in<00:02:11.740> too<00:02:11.950> high<00:02:12.130> of<00:02:12.310> a

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
because I haven't been in too high of a

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.190 
because I haven't been in too high of a
wind<00:02:12.670> but<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.000> can<00:02:13.300> see<00:02:13.480> there's<00:02:13.720> nothing<00:02:14.080> to

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
wind but you can see there's nothing to

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.920 
wind but you can see there's nothing to
seal<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.709> down<00:02:14.920> except<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.520> zipper<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.540> if

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
seal it down except the zipper and if

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.260 
seal it down except the zipper and if
the<00:02:17.080> wind<00:02:17.260> came<00:02:17.680> from<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.130> wrong<00:02:18.370> end<00:02:18.730> it

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
the wind came from the wrong end it

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
would definitely open here's what it

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.690 
would definitely open here's what it
looks<00:02:21.640> like<00:02:21.880> inside<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:24.010> can<00:02:24.160> see<00:02:24.310> you've<00:02:24.490> got

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
looks like inside you can see you've got

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.449 
looks like inside you can see you've got
a<00:02:24.730> lot<00:02:25.000> of<00:02:25.030> space<00:02:25.870> for<00:02:25.930> air<00:02:26.380> all<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.310> way

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
a lot of space for air all the way

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:39.350 
a lot of space for air all the way
around<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:29.140> there's<00:02:29.770> more<00:02:30.040> than<00:02:30.280> enough<00:02:30.550> room

some condensation inside it wasn't
troubling<00:03:33.019> unless<00:03:33.319> you<00:03:33.530> rub<00:03:33.769> the<00:03:34.580> top<00:03:35.360> of<00:03:35.540> the

tent

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.940 

when<00:03:45.400> I<00:03:45.430> stayed<00:03:45.819> in<00:03:46.440> when<00:03:47.440> I<00:03:47.530> was<00:03:47.650> going<00:03:47.800> on

when I stayed in when I was going on
north<00:03:48.220> country<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:48.849> it<00:03:49.450> was<00:03:49.569> really<00:03:49.930> cold<00:03:50.110> at

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
north country and it was really cold at

north country and it was really cold at
night<00:03:50.379> like<00:03:50.800> 10<00:03:51.250> degrees

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.020 

there's<00:03:56.870> all<00:03:57.050> kinds<00:03:57.350> of<00:03:57.380> condensation<00:03:58.040> frozen

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
there's all kinds of condensation frozen

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.630 
there's all kinds of condensation frozen
on<00:03:59.390> top<00:03:59.720> of<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.020> tent<00:04:00.320> and<00:04:00.500> whenever<00:04:01.160> I'd<00:04:01.370> move

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
on top of the tent and whenever I'd move

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.509 
on top of the tent and whenever I'd move
it<00:04:01.820> would<00:04:01.940> snow<00:04:02.270> down

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.479 

but<00:04:08.519> that<00:04:08.700> was<00:04:08.879> bad<00:04:09.390> I'll<00:04:09.689> see<00:04:10.200> tonight<00:04:10.590> it's<00:04:11.400> a

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
but that was bad I'll see tonight it's a

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.130 
but that was bad I'll see tonight it's a
little<00:04:11.730> warmer<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.420> I<00:04:12.480> don't<00:04:12.540> think<00:04:12.750> there

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
little warmer and I don't think there

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.630 
little warmer and I don't think there
will<00:04:13.200> be<00:04:13.260> so<00:04:13.530> much<00:04:13.680> condensation<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.459> other

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
will be so much condensation the other

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.060 
will be so much condensation the other
thing<00:04:14.849> is<00:04:14.970> last<00:04:15.209> night<00:04:15.390> it<00:04:16.079> rains<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.769> had<00:04:16.919> to

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
thing is last night it rains I had to

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.319 
thing is last night it rains I had to
close<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.699> whole<00:04:17.880> thing<00:04:18.180> down<00:04:18.829> and<00:04:20.329> that's

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
close the whole thing down and that's

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.300 
close the whole thing down and that's
when<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.750> condensation<00:04:22.290> really<00:04:22.800> started

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
when the condensation really started

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.610 
when the condensation really started
plus<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.120> back<00:04:24.330> end<00:04:24.600> you<00:04:24.690> have<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.020> be<00:04:25.199> careful

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
plus the back end you have to be careful

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.670 
plus the back end you have to be careful
on<00:04:25.710> how<00:04:25.919> you<00:04:25.949> pitch<00:04:26.370> it<00:04:26.930> because<00:04:27.930> if<00:04:28.229> you<00:04:28.440> don't

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
on how you pitch it because if you don't

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.830 
on how you pitch it because if you don't
have<00:04:29.130> it<00:04:29.340> pitched<00:04:29.669> off<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.240> ground<00:04:30.570> you<00:04:30.810> don't

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
have it pitched off the ground you don't

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.560 
have it pitched off the ground you don't
get<00:04:31.229> enough<00:04:31.530> draft<00:04:32.010> coming<00:04:32.370> through<00:04:32.820> and<00:04:33.090> if

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
get enough draft coming through and if

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.270 
get enough draft coming through and if
there's<00:04:33.780> no<00:04:34.020> wind<00:04:34.260> you<00:04:34.470> don't<00:04:34.500> get<00:04:34.740> any<00:04:34.979> draft

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
there's no wind you don't get any draft

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.040 
there's no wind you don't get any draft
anyway<00:04:35.789> and<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.060> you<00:04:36.120> get<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.449> condensation

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
anyway and so you get the condensation

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.070 
anyway and so you get the condensation
on<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.470> inside<00:04:38.400> it<00:04:38.820> dries<00:04:39.270> fast<00:04:39.720> though

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
on the inside it dries fast though

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.010 
on the inside it dries fast though
because<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:40.680> sill<00:04:40.949> nylon<00:04:41.370> just<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.780> water

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
because the sill nylon just the water

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.800 
because the sill nylon just the water
just<00:04:43.380> evaporates<00:04:43.979> like<00:04:44.580> nothing<00:04:45.000> I've<00:04:45.449> done

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
just evaporates like nothing I've done

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.370 
just evaporates like nothing I've done
you<00:04:46.350> do<00:04:46.530> have<00:04:46.710> to<00:04:46.860> watch<00:04:47.039> so<00:04:47.699> that's<00:04:48.570> my<00:04:48.990> take

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
you do have to watch so that's my take

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.539 
you do have to watch so that's my take
in<00:04:49.949> the<00:04:50.100> six<00:04:50.310> millions<00:04:50.729> lunar<00:04:51.270> Seoul
