00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
very simple we're going to take the

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.400 
very simple we're going to take the
players<00:01:11.640> born<00:01:11.910> section<00:01:12.360> here<00:01:12.630> I'm<00:01:13.020> going<00:01:13.290> to

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
players born section here I'm going to

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.900 
players born section here I'm going to
add<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.890> thread<00:01:14.220> which<00:01:14.550> is<00:01:14.670> going<00:01:14.820> to

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
add in a thread which is going to

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.720 
add in a thread which is going to
reference<00:01:15.210> our<00:01:15.660> actual<00:01:16.110> code<00:01:16.410> for<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.770> mod<00:01:16.950> so

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
reference our actual code for the mod so

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.070 
reference our actual code for the mod so
in<00:01:17.910> this<00:01:18.000> case<00:01:18.210> we're<00:01:18.450> adding<00:01:18.690> an<00:01:18.780> unlimited

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
in this case we're adding an unlimited

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.270 
in this case we're adding an unlimited
ammo<00:01:19.440> so<00:01:20.100> we'll<00:01:20.220> just<00:01:20.370> type<00:01:23.000> cell<00:01:24.020> thread<00:01:25.280> do

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
ammo so we'll just type cell thread do

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.260 
ammo so we'll just type cell thread do
ammo<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:27.900> will<00:01:28.140> close<00:01:28.350> off<00:01:28.620> that<00:01:28.830> line<00:01:29.270> there

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
ammo and will close off that line there

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.120 
ammo and will close off that line there
we<00:01:30.390> go<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.930> simple<00:01:31.110> then<00:01:31.770> we'll<00:01:31.920> scroll

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
we go it's that simple then we'll scroll

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.760 
we go it's that simple then we'll scroll
down<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:32.750> find<00:01:33.750> any<00:01:33.990> empty<00:01:34.290> section<00:01:34.680> you

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
down here find any empty section you

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.640 
down here find any empty section you
want<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.369> make<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.550> space<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.420> there<00:01:36.660> and<00:01:36.900> we'll

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
want to make a space in there and we'll

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.359 
want to make a space in there and we'll
paste<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.190> in<00:01:38.450> unlimited<00:01:39.450> ammo<00:01:40.070> give<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.190> space

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.640 
paste it in unlimited ammo give it space
to<00:01:41.550> the<00:01:41.670> end<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.000> there<00:01:42.930> we<00:01:43.050> go<00:01:43.170> we<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.440> just

really<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.820> simple<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.450> not<00:01:49.350> every

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
really is that simple and not every

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.560 
really is that simple and not every
single<00:01:50.250> mod<00:01:50.430> will<00:01:50.760> go<00:01:50.940> into<00:01:51.119> your<00:01:51.330> players

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
radar jammer let's go with the no recoil

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.350 
radar jammer let's go with the no recoil
so<00:02:05.640> we'll<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.090> copy<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.720> from<00:02:06.960> their

so we'll just copy that from their

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.240 
so we'll just copy that from their
animal<00:02:09.360> head<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.600> here<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:09.990> this<00:02:10.560> time<00:02:10.860> rather

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
find that there will add in back now we

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.020 
find that there will add in back now we
should<00:02:21.810> have<00:02:22.050> no<00:02:22.440> recoil<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.190> unlimited<00:02:23.610> ammo

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
should have no recoil and unlimited ammo

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
should have no recoil and unlimited ammo

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
there is a limit to the file size here

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.570 
there is a limit to the file size here
like<00:02:30.630> em<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.380> version<00:02:31.560> which<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:32.010> downloaded

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
to your patch NP from that page there is

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.520 
to your patch NP from that page there is
basically<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:36.240> strict<00:02:36.660> version<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.260> file

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
basically a strict version of the file

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.650 
basically a strict version of the file
with<00:02:38.069> all<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.370> unnecessary<00:02:38.550> codes<00:02:39.180> removed

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
with all the unnecessary codes removed

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.220 
with all the unnecessary codes removed
the<00:02:40.640> overall<00:02:41.640> file<00:02:41.940> size<00:02:42.390> when<00:02:43.080> you're

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
the overall file size when you're

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.990 
the overall file size when you're
finished<00:02:43.470> adding<00:02:43.680> in<00:02:43.860> your<00:02:43.980> month<00:02:44.250> can<00:02:44.700> never

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
finished adding in your month can never

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.160 
finished adding in your month can never
exceed<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:46.200> original<00:02:46.830> size<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.810> can<00:02:48.990> see

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
exceed the original size so you can see

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.470 
exceed the original size so you can see
that<00:02:49.350> there<00:02:49.620> that's<00:02:50.490> how<00:02:50.760> much<00:02:50.940> basically<00:02:51.180> got

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
that there that's how much basically got

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.040 
that there that's how much basically got
left<00:02:51.750> that's<00:02:52.200> minus<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:54.090> let's<00:02:54.480> go<00:02:54.630> save
