00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240
 What you say 

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.020
 The 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:15.420
 Sa Sasasasasa 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.876
 Sasabe 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.254
 Well Amber, if you guys do not know Amber 

00:00:23.254 --> 00:00:25.535
 Um Anbar runs a laundry on the corner of our street 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.260
 Yeah 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.800
 Best laundry in town 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.300
 Yeah 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.260
 $ 5 in one day! Boiah! 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.200
 B 2 minutes! 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.914
 And even they give bubble tea. 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.620
 Both. Anbar of FX 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.994
 Which you have known before. 

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:36.414
 Hello guys! I am Anbar from FX! 

00:00:36.414 --> 00:00:39.554
 I will make the life of Simon and Martina bass today. 

00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:40.696
 That's what I'd like to know 

00:00:40.696 --> 00:00:42.174
 When I was traveling in Japan 

00:00:42.174 --> 00:00:43.555
 I was on your way back 

00:00:43.555 --> 00:00:47.114
 What did you think when I bought this sweet to us? 

00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:49.234
 Well, I was buying for my friends 

00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:50.260
 Pastries, and the like 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.954
 Ah, pastry 

00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:51.454
 Yes and 

00:00:51.454 --> 00:00:52.494
 Nice things 

00:00:52.494 --> 00:00:53.313
 Nice things, I am 

00:00:53.313 --> 00:00:54.735
 I saw this and you like 

00:00:54.735 --> 00:00:55.843
 Simon and Martina. 

00:00:55.843 --> 00:00:57.096
 There is Kate Cats with green tea 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.980
 You could have bought ... like two Kate Cats 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.420
 This would have been lovely 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.220
 From Kate Cats with the Wasabi flavor you bought for us 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.736
 Have you tried this before? 

00:01:04.736 --> 00:01:05.463
 No, I actually did not try it 

00:01:05.463 --> 00:01:07.340
 I wanted to leave it 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.736
 For the experience that we can share together 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.540
 Okay. 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.155
 Is this new to all of us? 

00:01:11.155 --> 00:01:11.655
 Yeah .... 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.275
 Am I entitled to be here? 

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:17.195
 I love you girl 

00:01:17.195 --> 00:01:18.649
 I love you so darling 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:19.683
 you are the best 

00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:21.795
 I feel something comes between us 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.180
 Something ... 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.774
 This is my suggestion of how to taste these 

00:01:25.774 --> 00:01:28.594
 Or do I think you should do the traditional Kai Bai Bo counter (rock, paper, scissors) 

00:01:28.594 --> 00:01:30.415
 The loser tasted it first 

00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:32.494
 Simon is a cheater 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.920
 So you should pay attention to it 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.623
 did you see? look at him 

00:01:35.623 --> 00:01:37.074
 He tries to think in a way to cheat 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.140
 They make a correct point. 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.674
 Thanks! 

00:01:39.674 --> 00:01:40.454
 Ok, ready? 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.940
 Rock, paper, scissors 

00:01:42.348 --> 00:01:42.848
 I won. 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.120
 I call the power of FX 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.220
 For guidance .. Ohio 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.195
 I'll actually call you 

00:01:49.195 --> 00:01:50.695
 I took the FX power 

00:01:50.695 --> 00:01:52.014
 You have to choose a new band, I'm sorry 

00:01:52.715 --> 00:01:53.995
 Ok ready? here we are 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.440
 Rock, paper, scissors 

00:01:55.655 --> 00:01:57.695
 Yup 

00:01:58.954 --> 00:02:00.234
 FX has let me down! 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.560
 Okay. 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.780
 Give me the first half, give me the first half 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.540
 Break me a piece of Kat Kat! 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.740
 This was not an advertisement for Kat Cat 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.715
 I can not open these 

00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:13.815
 He will destroy my nails 

00:02:13.816 --> 00:02:15.896
 I have seen? It's harder than expected 

00:02:15.896 --> 00:02:16.629
 You had to tear it 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:17.549
 This is an easy way 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:18.542
 Look, here 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.280
 My God. 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.294
 Wahh see how easy this was? 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.860
 Sciences!! 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.194
 Oh this is too small! 

00:02:26.194 --> 00:02:28.703
 Are you saying you want two of them at the same time? 

00:02:28.703 --> 00:02:29.203
 No! 

00:02:29.203 --> 00:02:30.043
 That's what I heard 

00:02:30.043 --> 00:02:31.360
 I did not say that 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.390
 It resembles fermented mayonnaise 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.870
 This smell is not good, I will be honest 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.090
 Okay. Ready? 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.180
 It's fine! 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.929
 I'm really excited now. I will try one 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:55.330
 We must try it on Monday to see how the food is 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.560
 Who made it? 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.755
 That's what I'm saying! 

00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:06.475
 Where the hell is your doubt? 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.480
 I do not know? 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.460
 We invite others to play with us 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.720
 And they do not play with us !! 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.215
 I'll call your mother. 

00:03:13.215 --> 00:03:14.635
 Ok I'll eat it now. 

00:03:14.635 --> 00:03:15.735
 Eat come on one shot 

00:03:16.155 --> 00:03:17.195
 everything 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.020
 I will describe him after he has eaten 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.640
 Yeah? 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.400
 I have seen? 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.469
 Sleep in the bed that built it! 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:27.140
 It's sweet 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.460
 Wassamah 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.220
 But you can taste 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.720
 Pepper 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.754
 When you taste it for the first time 

00:03:33.754 --> 00:03:35.575
 You think oh this is not bad 

00:03:35.575 --> 00:03:37.313
 And then - when Wasabi kicked 

00:03:37.313 --> 00:03:38.150
 Contemplate 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.376
 Why did they put this together (Kit Kat and Wasabi)? 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.200
 I was hoping this would be delicious. 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.342
 They did a good job with the Wasabi part 

00:03:43.342 --> 00:03:44.620
 It tastes just like an eraser 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.840
 They do not do a good job on Kit Kat 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.555
 Amber has eaten a lot of erasers before. 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.620
 So they know 

00:03:49.753 --> 00:03:51.273
 They eat them nonstop 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.420
 F from EX 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.534
 Arch .... Mathematics ... 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.660
 ... erase ... 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.090
 But when no one can see them, you eat them 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.980
 I really am honored that you came here 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.734
 And you brought us some candy 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.660
 We also thought about you 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.794
 We have some dessert you want today to eat 

00:04:07.794 --> 00:04:10.495
 When we were on our European tour 

00:04:10.495 --> 00:04:13.155
 We fell in love with this dessert in Norway 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.960
 Oh "fell in love"? 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.904
 Yeah. In fact we brought some of them with us 

00:04:16.904 --> 00:04:19.040
 This is called "salmiakkis" 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.180
 This has a great popularity in Sweden, Norway, and Finland 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.035
 And lots of places in Europe 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.520
 Yeah. People love this dessert 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.260
 Take one 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.135
 I have never tasted anything like this before 

00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:30.487
 And then we became addicted 

00:04:30.487 --> 00:04:32.249
 So you're the whole piece in your mouth 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:34.054
 Then you can chew it 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.220
 3, 2, 1 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.720
 OK Go !! 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.460
 Can I wash my mouth with Katie Wasabi? 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.940
 Yes you can do it 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.796
 Was not this the worst thing you've tasted in a long time? 

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:56.834
 Describe taste, Amber! 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.260
 It's terrible !! 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.120
 I describe the taste! 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.620
 It's terrible 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.460
 Is not this a punishment? 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.100
 I want to go to a house 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.060
 I want to go to a house 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.820
 What is this made of? 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.814
 It's actually a mite sweat 

00:05:08.814 --> 00:05:10.775
 It's the tears of children, it is what is made of 

00:05:10.775 --> 00:05:13.193
 But here's the thing, it's salted licorice 

00:05:13.193 --> 00:05:15.555
 I think your boss there wants some 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.860
 I see it in his eyes 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:17.374
 It really is 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.380
 Oba! 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.645
 He really wanted 

00:05:19.645 --> 00:05:20.495
 "Try to eat this' 

00:05:20.495 --> 00:05:21.615
 It's from Norway 

00:05:21.615 --> 00:05:22.954
 "it's very delicious" 

00:05:23.744 --> 00:05:25.184
 "It's not delicious" 

00:05:32.254 --> 00:05:34.494
 This is the worst thing I've tasted 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.240
 I can see the doors close 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.057
 I saw your car go 

00:05:39.057 --> 00:05:42.491
 And the manager of your dorm window and he put up a middle finger 

00:05:43.873 --> 00:05:46.033
 We got many of this 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.374
 Eat a super salmiakki bar 

00:05:47.374 --> 00:05:47.915
 and then 

00:05:49.236 --> 00:05:50.836
 Super salmiakki chewing gum 

00:05:50.836 --> 00:05:51.416
 And like 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.320
 Do you think there are more of these things ??! 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.540
 There are all the flavors - it - 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.460
 Loveable 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.758
 I'm not kidding. This is very popular 

00:05:58.794 --> 00:05:59.754
 I respect that 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.560
 I respect your decision but politely 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.720
 We will reject it. 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.400
 Yeah 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.633
 We refuse to offer salmiakki. 

00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:09.420
 So thank you for coming to do a wonderful treasure hunt 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.994
 I have not yet come here again! 

00:06:10.994 --> 00:06:12.234
 I had a feeling that 

00:06:12.234 --> 00:06:13.575
 Next time when you go to Japan, 

00:06:13.575 --> 00:06:14.803
 If any d 

00:06:14.803 --> 00:06:16.603
 Edible Shorts, I think you saw? 

00:06:16.603 --> 00:06:17.563
 Oh yes. 

00:06:17.563 --> 00:06:18.360
 Think about us. 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.336
 Oh, oh, by nature. 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.520
 Think about us 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.040
 Well that's all this week about a fabulous treasure hunt 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.969
 Thanks for being tortured with us!
