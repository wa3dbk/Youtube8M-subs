00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello to all these kids have 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.150
 today a quick unpacking and a 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:14.009
 little grip of the logitech 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.440
 g300 mouse gaming that I won on the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.760
 facebook page of logitech who had put 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.460
 in place a small contest that lasted 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.269
 a week I was the first winner 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.000
 so here's a little gaming mouse 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.439
 entry level 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.439
 knowing the logitech brand 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.530
 should be a nice product that 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.680
 worth a little over thirty euros in 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.629
 shop it's a late 2011 mouse so 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.739
 I say no nonsense 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.719
 a wired mouse we will see it optically 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.250
 with some small functions and 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.710
 some little buttons with two 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.949
 kids and especially little thing 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.690
 friendly light profiles that 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:04.170
 allow to change a colored led 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:06.320
 on the side of the mouse while they 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:18.600
 should be a little bit more stable 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:22.830
 that usually it will change you the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:30.619
 cable fell behind we will go out the 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:30.619
 mouse then a little bit of reading 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:39.650
 a priori there is no yielding two 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.650
 drivers in it's just reading 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:56.060
 so let's get out the case so a usb cable 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:58.600
 she smiled problem itself 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:04.700
 the impossible 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:06.560
 the good of course we need 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.289
 to pass all these whites is very 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:15.049
 practical when you want to start a small 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:17.420
 gone no then that's the bug a 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.459
 cable that looks pretty long even though me 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.629
 I'm used to mice without 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.549
 wire pop a usb cable of course 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.340
 now the ps2 mice is done 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:31.130
 and that's the beast in itself 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.140
 so we'll start with 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.910
 below 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:39.099
 then with an optical sensor 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.750
 so it's not the ultimate 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.890
 crack on all the collateral all 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.599
 surfaces but that should allow 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.870
 to still have enough follow-up 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.760
 correct movement of the mouse the 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.440
 small Teflon pads that go well on 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.489
 below the red mouse why not 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:02.959
 remains original then when we pass 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:06.350
 side be in itself on the slice 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:09.019
 so here you see the famous help 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.139
 famous colleagues location that 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.160
 become green blue and red if I get 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:14.569
 not deceive so adapt according 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.870
 profiles it must be able to be adjusted 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:21.139
 with the driver with the drivers here a 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.019
 small soft plastic coating that 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:26.840
 has a pretty pleasant touch 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:29.299
 besides the rest of the mouse is in 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.500
 glossy plastic it's a bit 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.530
 a shame because it tends to 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.329
 take very fingerprints 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.130
 easily dust ultra easily 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.609
 but finally it gives a pretty impression 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.790
 class that's matte plastic of 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.139
 rather good quality so there is nothing 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.430
 special at the connection 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:49.620
 Wired There is no 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.590
 small gadgets that can mitigate 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.540
 the tension on the wire by eclipsing by 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.180
 example to his mouse pad or 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.129
 things like that nothing special at 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.200
 level of buttons left click click 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.760
 right is obviously the wheel that is 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.599
 a classic wheel so but not the 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.969
 logitech wheel ultra-perfected I 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.469
 also to show you a little bit to 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:12.480
 the entry of a little closer is 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:14.430
 not the ultra- sophisticated die that has 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.590
 a notched mode a free mode that I like 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.560
 a lot a lot at logitech it's 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.930
 a simple notched wheel that is 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.020
 flexible plastic also so with a 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.030
 touch nice enough she is clickable 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.090
 it's a big click but it's 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.680
 clickable l epa movable on the 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.150
 left and right for the scroll 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.300
 left and right which is handy 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.910
 in office but against 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.840
 originality so the buttons 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.800
 we are used to 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.550
 to have on the slice by here are one 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.470
 on the side so right next to the index 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:53.310
 is right next to the middle finger so you 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:57.840
 have two three four buttons 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:01.199
 additional here 6 finally 5 and 6 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.900
 forgiveness are here with sensations of 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:06.780
 click different there here you have 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.780
 classic duplicate as well as on 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.849
 buttons that are on the side and behind 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.510
 these are a little harder clicks 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:18.030
 so here is a nice little mouse 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:22.289
 entry level but who will I serve me 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.639
 well on a secondary pc game I 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.139
 do not wait a lot since all 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:29.370
 way I will not test it in mode 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:30.720
 gaming intensively but that's it 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.470
 will make me a nice little mouse 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.849
 so thanks to logitech for this choice of 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.310
 gifts that arrived safely and 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:41.099
 quickly I wanted to insist on a 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.229
 point it does not concern me but I am a 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.470
 great lover of logitech products in 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:46.600
 general 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:52.720
 and we could see his watch and 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:54.460
 above that is that you have 3 years of 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.910
 guarantee so it's pretty much all 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.340
 logitech products you have 3 years of 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:04.750

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:07.570
 big strengths of logitech who she 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:11.140
 really knew how super they are 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.240

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.620

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.590

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.380
 so do not hesitate if there are products 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.120
 logitech that you like darken I say 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.800
 not that because I won one of their 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.450
 products but simply because 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.370
 it's a brand that I like a lot and 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.580
 which usually makes good products 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.860
 which are entry-level or range 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.810
 higher for example I have a one 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.890
 aymeric performance which is the mouse the 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.350
 high end of logitech 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.360
 and that's really an excellent 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.850
 mark so that's it for this little 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:55.240

 Hi
