one<00:05:03.580> thing<00:05:03.610> I<00:05:03.820> realized<00:05:04.150> is<00:05:04.420> I<00:05:04.780> didn't<00:05:05.110> need<00:05:05.260> to

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
one thing I realized is I didn't need to

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.260 
one thing I realized is I didn't need to
pull<00:05:05.920> as<00:05:06.040> many<00:05:06.220> strands<00:05:06.730> through<00:05:07.120> the

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
pull as many strands through the

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.630 
pull as many strands through the
highlighting<00:05:07.750> cap<00:05:07.900> as<00:05:08.140> I<00:05:08.290> did<00:05:08.560> I<00:05:08.860> didn't<00:05:09.550> need

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
highlighting cap as I did I didn't need

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.130 
highlighting cap as I did I didn't need
to<00:05:09.730> highlight<00:05:09.970> so<00:05:10.390> many<00:05:10.600> pieces<00:05:10.780> I

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
to highlight so many pieces I

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.590 
to highlight so many pieces I
practically<00:05:11.650> turned<00:05:11.980> the<00:05:12.250> hair<00:05:12.430> blonde<00:05:12.760> so

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
practically turned the hair blonde so

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.540 
practically turned the hair blonde so
next<00:05:14.200> time<00:05:14.410> when<00:05:14.560> I<00:05:14.680> highlight<00:05:15.040> hair<00:05:15.250> I'm

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
next time when I highlight hair I'm

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.460 
next time when I highlight hair I'm
definitely<00:05:15.790> going<00:05:16.180> to<00:05:16.420> not<00:05:16.660> pull<00:05:16.990> through<00:05:17.350> as

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
definitely going to not pull through as

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.740 
definitely going to not pull through as
many<00:05:17.650> strands<00:05:18.160> that's<00:05:19.000> why<00:05:19.210> I<00:05:19.240> ended<00:05:19.570> up

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
many strands that's why I ended up

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.880 
many strands that's why I ended up
taking<00:05:19.990> me<00:05:20.230> so<00:05:20.410> long<00:05:20.440> when<00:05:20.740> I<00:05:20.800> was

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
taking me so long when I was

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.260 
taking me so long when I was
highlighting<00:05:21.430> it<00:05:21.490> cuz<00:05:21.700> I<00:05:21.760> was<00:05:21.850> just<00:05:21.970> pulling

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
through way too many strands then I

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.850 
through way too many strands then I
needed<00:05:24.490> to<00:05:24.580> pull<00:05:24.790> through<00:05:25.350> so<00:05:26.350> that's<00:05:26.500> one
