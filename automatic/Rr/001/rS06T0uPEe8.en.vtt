00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.309 
before so this time I'm going all the
way<00:04:09.739> dropping<00:04:10.219> my<00:04:10.459> OE<00:04:10.689> right<00:04:11.689> here<00:04:11.900> I<00:04:12.109> turned

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
way dropping my OE right here I turned

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.140 
way dropping my OE right here I turned
around<00:04:12.439> to<00:04:13.129> make<00:04:13.250> sure<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.549> Rhinos<00:04:13.849> catched

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
around to make sure the Rhinos catched

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.960 
around to make sure the Rhinos catched
up<00:04:14.329> because<00:04:15.109> if<00:04:16.100> you<00:04:16.280> just<00:04:16.489> keep<00:04:16.609> going

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
up because if you just keep going

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.539 
up because if you just keep going
they'll<00:04:17.359> lag<00:04:18.320> behind<00:04:18.560> and<00:04:19.009> then<00:04:19.130> if<00:04:19.250> they<00:04:19.370> get

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
they'll lag behind and then if they get

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.230 
they'll lag behind and then if they get
too<00:04:19.699> far<00:04:19.849> behind<00:04:19.910> they<00:04:20.630> will<00:04:20.870> reset<00:04:21.769> so<00:04:22.699> I<00:04:23.030> turn

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
too far behind they will reset so I turn

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.640 
too far behind they will reset so I turn
around<00:04:23.270> every<00:04:23.690> now<00:04:23.810> and<00:04:23.960> again<00:04:23.990> let<00:04:24.560> them

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
around every now and again let them

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.060 
around every now and again let them
catch<00:04:24.830> up<00:04:25.070> and<00:04:25.720> drop<00:04:26.720> an<00:04:26.840> AoE<00:04:27.050> and<00:04:27.440> then

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
catch up and drop an AoE and then

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.480 
catch up and drop an AoE and then
continue<00:04:28.639> on<00:04:31.330> this<00:04:32.440> this<00:04:33.440> little<00:04:33.800> pull<00:04:34.160> here

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490
