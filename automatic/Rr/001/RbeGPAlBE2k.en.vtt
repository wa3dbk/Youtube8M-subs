 configurator here we can choose on 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:31.359
 building a server connection 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.219
 Irina server is the main gateway case 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:35.249
 extremities 

00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:37.909

 troshchinsky which can be customized to 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.140
 network wiretapping mode 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.360
 in this case we need to choose 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.900
 main shilovsky so choose 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.060

 click next 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.530
 we have the current configuration window 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.710
 and here we see this system data 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.180
 linda dry data about his will 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.240
 current version of krasich inspectors as well 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.140

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.220
 we select routing 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.970
 use nato from internet service 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.369
 colleagues that Misharin several times 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.240
 click next and then continue them 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.500
 we see the configuration of service settings 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.380
 spend inspectors and vindouz first hand 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.310
 windows and leave everything by default as 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.680
 we are only interested in the setting on the TEC 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.080
 a setup tab appears above 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.800
 but here you need to show them 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.270
 Khreschatytska who will be inside does not have 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.570
 and interfaces and which will be external 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.200
 peace in our case is the participants

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.270
 applying the configure n we expect to take off 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.020
 when the internet is set up 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.640
 master krasich inspector mood 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.470

 if you need to change made your way to 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.950
 the other one is the interface properties and 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.999
 We are changing the progress Olympic 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:18.840
 changing update now we need 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.149
 configure network interfaces by 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:24.189
 customers go network device 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:25.480
 interface m 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.300
 on the Ossetia tab, select the protocol 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.499
 the internet has such degrees of taiga and there are 4 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:35.179
 go to its properties and prescribe taipei 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:36.349
 by address 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.170
 if a powerful network has climbers 192 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.019
 168 1 1 customer share of the address starts with 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.269
 one side 192 that 68 1 2 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.169
 go in we register climbers 192 168 1 2 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:03:00.980
 if the height is 192 in 168 1 1 the mask is the same 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:04.069
 also fake stamps can be specified 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.929
 taipei aggression ie the main gateway 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:09.289
 either register the deed with 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:10.419
 by the provider 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:12.869
 after setting up nato on the operating room 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:15.709
 system and network settings 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.539
 interfaces on client machines 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:20.489
 need to create and authorize and 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.109
 Shiki Spector's users 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.299
 To do this, run the console name bing in 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.789
 submenu clients right click 

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:34.459

 group ul if needed tab 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.869
 authorization indicates the way 

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:41.629
 authorization 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:47.239
 in our case it is to go to the address 192 168 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.739
 Mr Putin 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.650
 confirm adding new 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.170
