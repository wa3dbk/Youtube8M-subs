00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.180 
actually the dilemma between both
players<00:00:36.840> what<00:00:37.590> do<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.680> think<00:00:37.770> was<00:00:38.010> your

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
players what do you think was your

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.740 
players what do you think was your
output<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.730> game<00:00:38.969> anything<00:00:39.629> should

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
output of this game anything should

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.660 
output of this game anything should
happen<00:00:39.870> from<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.260> moment<00:00:40.469> right<00:00:40.829> now<00:00:40.890> um<00:00:41.280> I

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
happen from this moment right now um I

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.270 
happen from this moment right now um I
would<00:00:41.850> say<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.540> even<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.620> because<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
would say it's even but because of the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.490 
would say it's even but because of the
spot<00:00:44.579> advantage<00:00:45.120> hash<00:00:45.870> being<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> little<00:00:46.379> bit

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
spot advantage hash being a little bit

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.049 
spot advantage hash being a little bit
above<00:00:46.649> him<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.920> would<00:00:47.039> still<00:00:47.250> say<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.579> hash<00:00:47.760> has

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
above him I would still say the hash has

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.170 
above him I would still say the hash has
the<00:00:48.239> advantage<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.750> game<00:00:49.250> but<00:00:50.250> it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the advantage in the game but it

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.430 
the advantage in the game but it
definitely<00:00:51.449> could<00:00:51.750> go<00:00:51.870> either<00:00:52.020> way<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.320> this

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
definitely could go either way at this

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.069 
definitely could go either way at this
point<00:00:53.149> yeah<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.390> he's<00:00:54.480> going<00:00:54.629> with<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> mute

we pumping out well what i would do is
just<00:01:35.620> go<00:01:35.770> muta<00:01:36.460> hydralisk<00:01:37.000> i<00:01:37.300> mean<00:01:38.020> use<00:01:38.650> the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
just go muta hydralisk i mean use the

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.920 
just go muta hydralisk i mean use the
mutants<00:01:39.130> take<00:01:39.280> out<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.640> tanks<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:40.330> then<00:01:40.750> use

mass high duelist filled in passion is

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.569 
mass high duelist filled in passion is
what<00:04:19.600> hash<00:04:19.840> is<00:04:20.049> doing<00:04:20.410> in<00:04:20.680> my<00:04:20.859> opinion<00:04:21.100> is<00:04:21.340> he's

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
what hash is doing in my opinion is he's

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.800 
what hash is doing in my opinion is he's
just<00:04:21.790> kind<00:04:21.970> of<00:04:22.000> sticking<00:04:22.240> his<00:04:22.420> ground<00:04:22.660> he

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
just kind of sticking his ground he

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.690 
just kind of sticking his ground he
knows<00:04:23.020> this<00:04:23.560> herb<00:04:23.740> doesn't<00:04:23.830> have<00:04:24.100> a<00:04:24.130> choke<00:04:24.400> and

then that allows some great access to
just<00:04:27.730> talk<00:04:27.940> with<00:04:28.210> this<00:04:28.330> early<00:04:28.570> yeah<00:04:28.750> hash

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
just talk with this early yeah hash

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.630 
just talk with this early yeah hash
isn't<00:04:29.470> worried<00:04:29.680> about<00:04:29.830> late<00:04:30.040> game<00:04:30.250> he<00:04:30.460> knows
