00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
really so different leaf patterns it's

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.520 
really so different leaf patterns it's
really<00:01:38.670> interesting<00:01:38.880> little<00:01:39.869> damage<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.350> this

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
really interesting little damage on this

really interesting little damage on this
leaf<00:01:40.799> right<00:01:41.100> here<00:01:42.560> but<00:01:43.560> other<00:01:43.740> than<00:01:43.890> that

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.790 

hmm<00:01:49.070> a<00:01:49.210> lot<00:01:50.210> of<00:01:50.240> styrofoam<00:01:50.570> what<00:01:50.870> I<00:01:51.110> was

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
hmm a lot of styrofoam what I was

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.490 
hmm a lot of styrofoam what I was
thinking<00:01:52.220> is<00:01:52.310> gonna<00:01:52.520> be<00:01:52.610> way<00:01:52.730> taller<00:01:53.030> you<00:01:53.300> know

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
thinking is gonna be way taller you know

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
thinking is gonna be way taller you know
but<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:54.620> other<00:01:54.770> one<00:01:55.010> was<00:01:55.160> kind<00:01:55.370> of<00:01:55.400> like

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
but the other one was kind of like

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.890 
but the other one was kind of like
encased<00:01:56.120> in<00:01:56.420> a<00:01:56.890> paper<00:01:57.890> bag<00:01:58.570> so<00:01:59.570> that's<00:01:59.720> why<00:01:59.870> I

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
encased in a paper bag so that's why I

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.270 
encased in a paper bag so that's why I
didn't<00:02:00.140> understand<00:02:00.530> that<00:02:00.650> I<00:02:00.680> need<00:02:00.890> for<00:02:01.160> the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
didn't understand that I need for the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:13.930 
didn't understand that I need for the
