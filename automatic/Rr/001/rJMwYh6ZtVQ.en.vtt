 Camera Mainz leave teachers children to tinker something out of cardboard boxes 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.920
 an old technology that leads Volker Schütz to something completely new 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.630
 if you look at the world through a tiny hole 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.450
 like him Arnold and Volker Schütz 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.450
 then you see things 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.110
 For example, here at the top of the ninth floor an industrial ruin you come across

 her eyes are slow 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.400
 here is Rundschau 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.700

 a time somewhere next to it in the imagination of an author no

 it is not sure if Volker Schütz actually believes a ghost 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.800
 in any case believed in the possibilities of his still camera 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.380
 Instead of a brake she has a canned lid with a tiny yet 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.970
 nevertheless, of course, it comes to a very excellent means for spirits

 It mainly focuses on the environment
