of<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.820> things<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.300> they<00:00:21.449> asked<00:00:21.750> for<00:00:21.930> is

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
of the things that they asked for is

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.640 
of the things that they asked for is
some<00:00:23.520> backgrounds<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.449> cartoony<00:00:25.109> typical

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
some backgrounds and a cartoony typical

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.620 
some backgrounds and a cartoony typical
classic<00:00:26.279> cartoony<00:00:26.730> background<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.600> a

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
classic cartoony background is a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.140 
classic cartoony background is a
suburban<00:00:28.320> tract<00:00:28.619> house<00:00:28.859> we're<00:00:29.730> going<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.880> have

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
suburban tract house we're going to have

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.670 
suburban tract house we're going to have
a<00:00:30.180> little<00:00:30.449> bit<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.869> perspective<00:00:31.109> as<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.560> can

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
a little bit of perspective as you can

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.500 
a little bit of perspective as you can
see<00:00:31.769> these<00:00:31.920> lines<00:00:32.129> converge<00:00:32.609> this<00:00:33.059> way<00:00:33.239> and

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
see these lines converge this way and

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.479 
see these lines converge this way and
these<00:00:34.050> lines<00:00:34.319> converge<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:35.039> way<00:00:35.219> that's

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
these lines converge this way that's

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.279 
these lines converge this way that's
basically<00:00:35.969> two<00:00:36.239> point<00:00:36.510> perspective<00:00:36.780> when<00:00:37.229> you

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:37.289 
basically two point perspective when you

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:39.379 
basically two point perspective when you
have<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.710> corner<00:00:38.309> facing<00:00:38.519> you<00:00:38.850> like<00:00:39.179> this

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:39.389 
have a a corner facing you like this

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:40.939 
have a a corner facing you like this
then<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.350> means<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.679> the<00:00:40.739> perspective

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
then that means that the perspective

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.840 
then that means that the perspective
trails<00:00:41.489> off<00:00:41.699> on<00:00:42.199> to<00:00:43.199> vanishing<00:00:43.739> points<00:00:44.100> but

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
trails off on to vanishing points but

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.819 
trails off on to vanishing points but
you<00:00:45.030> don't<00:00:45.149> have<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.329> commit<00:00:45.479> this<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.780> memory

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
you don't have to commit this to memory

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.299 
you don't have to commit this to memory
because<00:00:47.149> this<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.389> a<00:00:48.659> cartoon<00:00:49.499> and<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.799> cookie

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
because this is a cartoon and a cookie

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.859 
because this is a cartoon and a cookie
kind<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.909> wacky<00:00:51.420> retro<00:00:52.789> background<00:00:53.869> which

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:54.869 
kind of wacky retro background which

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:58.669 
kind of wacky retro background which
means<00:00:56.059> it's<00:00:57.059> going<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.299> be<00:00:57.359> tilted<00:00:57.929> and<00:00:58.170> crazy

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679 
means it's going to be tilted and crazy

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.169 
means it's going to be tilted and crazy
and<00:00:59.039> I'm<00:00:59.369> not<00:00:59.399> going<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.670> pay<00:00:59.729> attention<00:01:00.119> to

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
and I'm not going to pay attention to

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:02.389 
and I'm not going to pay attention to
any<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.479> rules<00:01:00.659> just<00:01:01.440> suggest<00:01:02.039> some<00:01:02.309> of

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
any of the rules just suggest some of

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.820 
any of the rules just suggest some of
them<00:01:02.519> now<00:01:02.699> like<00:01:03.329> for<00:01:03.539> instance<00:01:03.629> when<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.619> have

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
them now like for instance when you have

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.190 
them now like for instance when you have
a<00:01:05.100> chimney<00:01:05.430> usually<00:01:06.119> when<00:01:06.240> something<00:01:06.450> sends

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
a chimney usually when something sends

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.109 
a chimney usually when something sends
it<00:01:07.409> converges<00:01:07.950> up<00:01:08.250> meaning<00:01:08.579> it<00:01:08.789> looks<00:01:09.000> like

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
it converges up meaning it looks like

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.690 
it converges up meaning it looks like
it's<00:01:09.240> getting<00:01:09.329> smaller<00:01:09.899> the<00:01:10.109> higher<00:01:10.289> it<00:01:10.500> goes

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
it's getting smaller the higher it goes

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.789 
it's getting smaller the higher it goes
so<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:12.000> are<00:01:12.210> going<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.539> do<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.930> opposite<00:01:13.409> to

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
so we are going to do the opposite to

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.469 
so we are going to do the opposite to
make<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.070> really<00:01:14.340> kooky<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.880> make<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.240> look

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
make it really kooky and make it look

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.359 
make it really kooky and make it look
like<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:15.869> getting<00:01:16.200> bigger<00:01:16.530> as<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.280> goes

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
like it's getting bigger as it goes

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.340 
like it's getting bigger as it goes
higher<00:01:17.670> that's<00:01:18.179> smaller<00:01:18.509> as<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.929> comes<00:01:19.079> closer

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
higher that's smaller as it comes closer

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.940 
higher that's smaller as it comes closer
to<00:01:19.590> us<00:01:19.909> which<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:20.969> really<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.359> nutty<00:01:21.840> look<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
to us which is really a nutty look but a

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.050 
to us which is really a nutty look but a
fun<00:01:23.520> look<00:01:24.469> it's<00:01:25.469> top<00:01:25.679> the<00:01:25.829> chimney<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.820> there

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
fun look it's top the chimney and there

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.419 
fun look it's top the chimney and there
is<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.570> chimney<00:01:31.140> smoke<00:01:33.859> let's<00:01:34.859> shade<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.280> this

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
is the chimney smoke let's shade in this

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.010 
is the chimney smoke let's shade in this
party<00:01:35.789> we'll<00:01:36.060> make<00:01:36.179> this<00:01:36.299> part<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.719> shadow

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
party we'll make this part the shadow

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.289 
party we'll make this part the shadow
because<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.469> Sun<00:01:37.679> is<00:01:37.799> here<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.060> part

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
because the Sun is here and so this part

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.080 
because the Sun is here and so this part
will<00:01:39.359> end<00:01:39.479> up<00:01:39.539> in<00:01:39.689> shadow<00:01:40.409> also<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.789> helps<00:01:42.060> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
will end up in shadow also it helps to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.539 
will end up in shadow also it helps to
define<00:01:42.539> the<00:01:43.170> image<00:01:43.439> if<00:01:43.590> part<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.219> it<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.429> in

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
define the image if part of it is in

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:44.959 
define the image if part of it is in
shadow

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
shadow

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.830 
shadow
nice<00:01:45.630> let's<00:01:45.950> talk<00:01:46.950> about<00:01:47.069> in<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.369> bit<00:01:47.520> now<00:01:47.840> this

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
nice let's talk about in a bit now this

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.010 
nice let's talk about in a bit now this
is<00:01:49.109> the<00:01:49.950> house<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.509> roof<00:01:51.630> notice

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
is the house and this is the roof notice

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.020 
is the house and this is the roof notice
that<00:01:52.170> there<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.619> separated<00:01:53.579> by<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> space<00:01:53.880> and

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
that there is separated by a space and

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.590 
that there is separated by a space and
here<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.600> shadow<00:01:54.840> falls<00:01:55.200> again<00:01:56.420> because<00:01:57.420> roof

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
here the shadow falls again because roof

I mean there's more on this side then

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.390 
I mean there's more on this side then
there<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.869> on<00:02:10.019> this<00:02:10.140> side<00:02:10.409> because<00:02:11.250> we're

there is on this side because we're

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.160 
there is on this side because we're

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.960 
angle and so we will stick in a little
door<00:02:15.920> here

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.020 

and<00:02:36.319> will<00:02:36.530> give<00:02:36.770> on<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.310> perspective<00:02:37.760> middle

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
and will give on the perspective middle

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:45.030 
and will give on the perspective middle
will<00:02:38.209> give<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:38.630> nice<00:02:39.910> dome<00:02:40.910> window<00:02:41.840> here

more<00:02:46.040> smaller<00:02:46.910> windows<00:02:47.269> like<00:02:47.480> so<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:49.330> mean<00:02:50.330> to

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
more smaller windows like so I mean to

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.080 
more smaller windows like so I mean to
be<00:02:50.569> very<00:02:50.600> rudimentary<00:02:51.200> very<00:02:51.890> easy<00:02:52.250> because

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
be very rudimentary very easy because

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.809 
be very rudimentary very easy because
it's<00:02:53.900> just<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.290> fun<00:02:54.680> background<00:02:55.610> you<00:02:55.790> don't

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
it's just a fun background you don't

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.699 
it's just a fun background you don't
want<00:02:56.090> your<00:02:56.209> background<00:02:56.420> be<00:02:56.720> so<00:02:56.989> detailed<00:02:57.319> in

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
want your background be so detailed in

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.789 
want your background be so detailed in
fact<00:02:57.980> that<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:58.910> takes<00:02:59.090> away<00:02:59.470> from<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.590> image

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
fact that it takes away from the image

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.270 
fact that it takes away from the image
that<00:03:01.010> you're<00:03:01.130> drawing<00:03:01.459> in<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.819> foreground

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
that you're drawing in the foreground

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.440 
that you're drawing in the foreground
we'll<00:03:04.280> make<00:03:04.370> this<00:03:04.489> a<00:03:04.640> tutor<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:08.000> we'll<00:03:08.150> see

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
we'll make this a tutor so we'll see

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.130 
we'll make this a tutor so we'll see
that<00:03:08.480> in<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.810> little<00:03:09.019> bit<00:03:09.170> because<00:03:09.290> that's<00:03:09.500> wood

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
that in a little bit because that's wood

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.449 
that in a little bit because that's wood
and<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:12.230> gets<00:03:12.380> uneven<00:03:12.980> you<00:03:13.040> notice<00:03:13.280> these

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
and it gets uneven you notice these

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.130 
and it gets uneven you notice these
don't<00:03:13.730> line<00:03:13.910> up<00:03:13.940> exactly<00:03:14.569> these<00:03:14.780> don't<00:03:15.019> line

don't line up exactly these don't line

don't line up exactly these don't line
up<00:03:15.170> exactly<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.799> unevenness<00:03:16.660> is<00:03:17.660> what<00:03:17.900> gives

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
up exactly the unevenness is what gives

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:24.150 
up exactly the unevenness is what gives
a<00:03:18.140> little<00:03:18.260> bit<00:03:18.410> of<00:03:18.470> character<00:03:19.070> and<00:03:19.450> dynamism

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.289 

we're<00:03:25.160> going<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.459> add<00:03:25.579> well<00:03:25.730> shading<00:03:26.120> back

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
we're going to add well shading back

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.060 
we're going to add well shading back
here<00:03:26.600> just<00:03:26.750> on<00:03:26.930> under<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.410> top<00:03:27.769> of<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:27.950> roof

make it look like this
like<00:03:29.570> it's<00:03:29.720> real<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.049> shadows<00:03:30.380> real<00:03:30.820> if<00:03:31.820> you

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
like it's real the shadows real if you

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
like it's real the shadows real if you
do<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.120> same<00:03:32.299> thing<00:03:32.510> here<00:03:37.660> now<00:03:38.660> I'll<00:03:38.780> have

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.740 
just give one window here and one door
the<00:04:39.740> reason<00:04:40.069> is<00:04:40.219> you<00:04:40.610> don't<00:04:40.819> want<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.509> stuff

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
the reason is you don't want the stuff

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.929 
the reason is you don't want the stuff
that's<00:04:42.110> behind<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:43.069> foreground<00:04:43.490> stuff

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:43.939 
that's behind the foreground stuff

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:44.980 
that's behind the foreground stuff
that's<00:04:44.090> in<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:44.300> background<00:04:44.719> to<00:04:44.810> be<00:04:44.900> as

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
that's in the background to be as

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.510 
that's in the background to be as
detailed<00:04:45.289> as<00:04:45.650> this<00:04:45.800> stuff<00:04:45.979> in<00:04:46.099> the<00:04:46.159> foreground

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
detailed as this stuff in the foreground

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.059 
detailed as this stuff in the foreground
otherwise<00:04:47.360> it<00:04:47.659> looks<00:04:47.719> very<00:04:48.169> busy<00:04:48.560> you<00:04:48.919> have<00:04:48.949> to

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:49.069 
otherwise it looks very busy you have to

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.309 
otherwise it looks very busy you have to
prioritize<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:50.240> background<00:04:50.750> is<00:04:50.960> simpler

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:51.319 
prioritize the background is simpler

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.950 
prioritize the background is simpler
than<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:51.770> foreground<00:04:52.120> let's<00:04:53.120> give<00:04:53.659> the<00:04:53.810> white

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
than the foreground let's give the white

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.360 
than the foreground let's give the white
picket<00:04:54.169> fence<00:04:54.469> but<00:04:54.680> let's<00:04:54.919> not<00:04:55.129> make<00:04:55.280> it

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
picket fence but let's not make it

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.790 
picket fence but let's not make it
completely<00:04:55.909> straight

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
completely straight

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.050 
completely straight
maybe<00:04:57.800> it's<00:04:57.949> because<00:04:58.039> dad<00:04:58.400> worked<00:04:58.699> on<00:04:58.879> that

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
maybe it's because dad worked on that

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.850 
maybe it's because dad worked on that
that's<00:04:59.840> what<00:05:00.020> they<00:05:00.110> would<00:05:00.229> tell<00:05:00.440> me<00:05:00.560> of<00:05:00.650> my

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
that's what they would tell me of my

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.990 
that's what they would tell me of my
house<00:05:01.330> dad<00:05:02.680> but<00:05:03.680> also<00:05:03.830> in<00:05:04.250> cartoons<00:05:04.669> the

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
house dad but also in cartoons the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.230 
house dad but also in cartoons the
kookiness<00:05:05.530> the<00:05:06.530> randomness<00:05:07.069> has<00:05:07.879> to<00:05:08.060> come<00:05:08.210> out

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
kookiness the randomness has to come out

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.700 
kookiness the randomness has to come out
somewhere<00:05:08.659> so<00:05:09.020> that's<00:05:09.169> where<00:05:09.319> it<00:05:09.379> comes<00:05:09.530> out

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
somewhere so that's where it comes out

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.119 
somewhere so that's where it comes out
and<00:05:10.520> here<00:05:10.819> is<00:05:10.969> the<00:05:11.289> sorry<00:05:12.289> I<00:05:12.349> not<00:05:12.469> driveway<00:05:12.949> but
