00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.219
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.570
 new edition of pcgh new in the test lab 

00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:10.320
 after a longer break is now 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.019
 once again something wonderful 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.570
 arrived and we have the svz 77th 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.100
 Extreme 11 got a mainboard 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.410
 At least one could say superlative 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.240
 as far as the connections are concerned 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.410
 we have the board here and pack 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.310
 Let's have a look and have a look 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.930
 the details 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.150
 what is considered the manufacturer here has so 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.090
 as if it just now as I said times 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.450
 unpack once the packaging first 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.850
 in front a small artthuer that one 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.960
 can look in the packaging in the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.030
 lid so also a few more 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.610
 functions explained for example 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.989
 built-in wlan it is natural 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.000
 also supported 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.300
 Here you can already see the board with the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.370
 pretty massive heat sinks and what 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.570
 you quickly get out of the packaging and 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.610
 look what is offered to us 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.880
 So as I said relatively massive sport 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.470
 normal atx format but also the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.610
 southbridge students had 40 millimeters 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.870
 fan for cooling 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.479
 and if we get this out of it 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.600
 So first, the wlan module 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.710
 see what is sitting in the lower area 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.299
 and now if we are here in the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.130
 area of data connections look 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.119
 we have since 14 connections twice usb 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:35.040
 3.0 we would also have in the area 2 x 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:39.479
 gigabit lan 246 8 x usb 3.0 then still 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.640
 times two usb 2.0 of course that too 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.020
 still available 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.430
 as I said 770 chip set yes, especially 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.100
 Of course, high-quality components would also be 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.380
 We have the surcharge to apply 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.180
 the 14 connections, eight of which sas 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.070
 We also need standard support 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.619
 according to the cable 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.340
 We still have six pieces 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.159
 an adapter of 4 pin molex on sata 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.560
 have the same again then of course 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.280
 the blind yes a few notes that 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.959
 Manual 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.850
 driver cd is exactly is in here 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.760
 and yes otherwise we also have 12 x usb 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.540
 3.0 is supported in this case the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.150
 dealer and then again 8 behind 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.250
 Now we have a sli here or here 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:36.989
 crossfire bridge as we have times just 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:39.750
 look what that is a sli bridge yes 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.150
 otherwise it will be up to the quad 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.660
 crossfirex respectively supported 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.190
 we also have a triple sli at 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.120
 me a big module of 50 inches 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.790
 drive that offers two super speed usb 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.110
 connections say usb 3.0 and at the same time 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.709
 two more wlan antennas then in the 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.090
 housing are so naturally the the 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.450
 receive significantly better again 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.900
 should 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.459
 yes that was it then again 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.110
 pcgh new in the test lab 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.980
 we hope you enjoyed it and he did 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.660
 a look the next time again 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.950
 over here if we have the latest 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.459
 can imagine hardware 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.459
 until then
