 united kingdom these ads are some 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.909
 well others not so much in the USA we have seen 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.399
 an ad only on the console and new 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.399
 Super Mario Bros and United Kingdom 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.740
 we have the an announcement also about the 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.649
 console and a nintendo land ad 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.479
 here you are seeing the links worth to 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.520
 than us what yesterday's courses by 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.450
 your account if you liked it we like it 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.570
 but those in the USA have a lot of music 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.640
 of disco verymac and do not give you this 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.679
 I like not hit at all what 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.950
 they want to sell, it's worth not 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:41.509
 they show games like that we like the 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.539
 games that have to show me they seem 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:47.539
 that American ads are 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.880
 pretty bad quite more sincerely 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.399
 but unlike the united kingdom 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.709
 the uk is fine on 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.870
 all of nintendo the nhs showing the 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:59.630
 minigame of 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.360
 cell that you go with the bow and with the 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.000
 gamepad showing with his original music 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.100
 what is this awesome guys for me 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.670
 ads UK as I 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.800
 said perfect very well we'll see 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.470
 see what they put us in Spain and in 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.140
 Latin America and the USA 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.520
 Sincerely, they have not been able to capture well 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.950
 the essence of what the console is 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.080
 we have images of new covers 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.030
 for nintendo wii games and you 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.160
 you will say but you have already seen many 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.380
 covers is new because the 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.240
 cover behind I have not yet 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.590
 seen no cover from behind and 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.620
 although the quality of the images is 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.959
 pretty bad we can see 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.239
 that in the back of the games 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.489
 the covers will come with what command 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.799
 can judge these games and that's 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.319
 I had to believe that well that I was going to 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.209
 come and it has come is that it is obvious 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.510
 it has to come from behind with what hands 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:57.110
 we can play the game and one thing very 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:01.069
 curious that puts a play vale and a play 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.230
 is the steam-type ubisoft platform 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.079
 vale is a platform where we 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.150
 we have a profile and we have a series of 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:11.720
 games is worth it if we have it in pc we can 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.400
 play from the play platform and if not 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.620
 we have it there because we play then the 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.720
 platform that we have it and a play the 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.879
 ubisoft uss is that it is very cool 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.530
 I guess it will mean that when I play 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.420
 that we go to the game we will surely have 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.640
 that create an account in a play or 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.349
 something like that so you can play it only with 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.900
 ubisoft games I remember that game 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.180
 visas can be rain man ag singrid 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.340
 they are also ubisoft viruses 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.859
 if you are converting from ubisoft into a 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.540
 of my favorite tripartites have many 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.629
 games that are like 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.610
 and really much new trailer for Sonic 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:50.830
 and sega all-stars racing transformers 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.890
 a good ad you know this game 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.390
 ok this game goes about it's like a 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.940
 Mario Kart but with the characters of 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.730
 sonic sega I liked it a lot 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.440
 honestly and in this new trailers there 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.370
 have taught the arrival of a new 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.470
 character of the movie breaks ralph and 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.390
 if weird guy the character of the 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.910
 movie this movie so famous that 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.100
 It has not been released yet in the cinemas. 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.810
 disney the main character will be 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.959
 inside this game as a character 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.680
 playable the truth is that it's something that 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:26.800
 He left totally stunned but he is a very 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.010
 good movement on the part of 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.260
 disney when it comes to publicizing the 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.760
 character before the movie comes out 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.890
 so that people go to see the movie 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.260
 it is an impressive movement 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.760
 sincerely the model very cool the 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.390
 character in the game and it looks great 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:47.200
