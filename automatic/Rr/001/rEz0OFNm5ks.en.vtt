00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
and this is a pretty big change killing

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.380 
and this is a pretty big change killing
one<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.110> Avengers<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:50.240> obviously<00:01:51.240> gonna

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
one of the Avengers is obviously gonna

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.780 
one of the Avengers is obviously gonna
have<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> lot<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.810> impact<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.549> kind<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.670> get

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
have a lot of impact and you kind of get

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.120 
have a lot of impact and you kind of get
a<00:01:53.850> glimpse<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.360> what<00:01:54.540> might<00:01:55.079> be<00:01:55.110> changed<00:01:55.860> in

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
a glimpse of what might be changed in

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.179 
a glimpse of what might be changed in
the<00:01:56.490> promo<00:01:57.000> cover<00:01:57.450> for<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.810> next<00:01:58.049> issue<00:01:58.189> yes

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
the promo cover for the next issue yes

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.109 
the promo cover for the next issue yes
we<00:01:59.369> could<00:01:59.490> see<00:01:59.640> what<00:01:59.759> appears<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.060> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
we could see what appears to be the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.870 
we could see what appears to be the
Avengers<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.869> new<00:02:01.140> timeline<00:02:01.880> Stephen

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
Avengers in this new timeline Stephen

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.700 
Avengers in this new timeline Stephen
strange<00:02:03.090> kind<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.450> looks<00:02:03.600> same<00:02:04.399> but<00:02:06.710> star-lord

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
strange kind of looks same but star-lord

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.680 
strange kind of looks same but star-lord
is<00:02:07.829> now<00:02:07.979> on<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.190> Avengers<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.670> looks<00:02:08.819> like<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
is now on the Avengers it looks like the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.800 
is now on the Avengers it looks like the
thing<00:02:09.959> has<00:02:10.470> some

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
thing has some

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.410 
thing has some
Denson<00:02:11.739> him<00:02:11.860> I<00:02:12.120> thought<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.239> most

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
Denson him I thought the most

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.870 
Denson him I thought the most
interesting<00:02:13.930> thing<00:02:14.110> was<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.739> Wolverine<00:02:15.550> in

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
interesting thing was the Wolverine in

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.059 
interesting thing was the Wolverine in
this<00:02:16.150> looks<00:02:16.540> like<00:02:16.750> daikin<00:02:17.380> so<00:02:17.620> maybe<00:02:17.860> it's

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
this looks like daikin so maybe it's

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.479 
this looks like daikin so maybe it's
taking<00:02:18.580> that<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:18.849> Avengers<00:02:19.360> now<00:02:19.569> so

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
taking that to the Avengers now so

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.920 
taking that to the Avengers now so
Wolverine<00:02:21.489> I<00:02:21.700> don't<00:02:22.540> necessarily<00:02:22.630> think

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
Wolverine I don't necessarily think

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.089 
Wolverine I don't necessarily think
that's<00:02:23.110> taking<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.620> think<00:02:23.800> it's<00:02:23.890> still

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
that's taking I think it's still

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.370 
that's taking I think it's still
Wolverine<00:02:24.550> but<00:02:24.730> we<00:02:25.660> could<00:02:25.810> see<00:02:25.989> Captain

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
Wolverine but we could see Captain

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.809 
Wolverine but we could see Captain
Marvel<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.010> it's<00:02:27.099> kind<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.280> unclear<00:02:27.519> who<00:02:27.670> that

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
Marvel and it's kind of unclear who that

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.720 
Marvel and it's kind of unclear who that
is<00:02:27.970> I<00:02:28.120> was<00:02:28.239> thinking<00:02:28.480> maybe<00:02:28.599> Black<00:02:28.930> Widow<00:02:29.730> it

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
is I was thinking maybe Black Widow it

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.210 
is I was thinking maybe Black Widow it
does<00:02:31.000> look<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.510> bit<00:02:31.540> like<00:02:31.750> her<00:02:32.230> it's<00:02:32.950> really

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
does look a bit like her it's really

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.710 
does look a bit like her it's really
hard<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.459> say<00:02:33.640> I'd<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.150> only<00:02:34.300> reason<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.540> think

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
hard to say I'd the only reason I think

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.250 
hard to say I'd the only reason I think
it<00:02:34.780> might<00:02:34.900> be<00:02:34.959> would<00:02:35.200> be<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.970> wristbands<00:02:37.260> the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
it might be would be the wristbands the

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.540 
it might be would be the wristbands the
coolest<00:02:38.560> person<00:02:38.620> discovers<00:02:38.980> definite<00:02:39.459> what

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
coolest person discovers definite what

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.690 
coolest person discovers definite what
appears<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:39.910> be<00:02:39.970> Steve<00:02:40.300> Rogers<00:02:40.780> he's<00:02:41.769> still

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
appears to be Steve Rogers he's still

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.920 
appears to be Steve Rogers he's still
got<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.880> captain<00:02:43.239> america<00:02:43.540> stuff<00:02:43.720> but<00:02:43.870> he

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
got the captain america stuff but he

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.520 
got the captain america stuff but he
looks<00:02:44.140> way<00:02:45.100> more<00:02:45.360> battled<00:02:46.360> tested<00:02:46.540> now<00:02:46.930> dream

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
looks way more battled tested now dream

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.670 
looks way more battled tested now dream
of<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:47.769> fury<00:02:48.190> esque<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:50.110> bottom<00:02:50.380> right<00:02:50.500> is<00:02:50.530> the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
of a fury esque the bottom right is the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.320 
of a fury esque the bottom right is the
one<00:02:50.769> that<00:02:50.890> really<00:02:51.280> intrigues<00:02:51.700> me<00:02:51.790> though<00:02:52.060> I'm

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
one that really intrigues me though I'm

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.539 
one that really intrigues me though I'm
not<00:02:52.390> entirely<00:02:53.019> sure<00:02:53.200> whether<00:02:53.470> it's<00:02:53.709> Scott

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
not entirely sure whether it's Scott

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.630 
not entirely sure whether it's Scott
Summers<00:02:54.850> or<00:02:55.209> cable<00:02:55.810> yeah<00:02:56.500> you<00:02:56.560> see<00:02:56.920> both<00:02:57.370> the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
Summers or cable yeah you see both the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.210 
Summers or cable yeah you see both the
visor<00:02:57.880> and<00:02:58.360> he's<00:02:58.690> got<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.200> hand<00:02:59.680> that<00:03:00.010> is

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
visor and he's got the hand that is

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.289 
visor and he's got the hand that is
characteristic<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:01.090> cable<00:03:01.480> so<00:03:02.430> we<00:03:03.430> can<00:03:03.640> pretty

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
characteristic of cable so we can pretty

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.990 
characteristic of cable so we can pretty
safely<00:03:04.390> say<00:03:04.989> it<00:03:05.110> looks<00:03:05.349> like<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.560> summers<00:03:06.010> with

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
safely say it looks like a summers with

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.220 
safely say it looks like a summers with
this<00:03:07.150> change<00:03:07.420> I<00:03:07.720> think<00:03:07.780> what's<00:03:08.049> going<00:03:08.170> to

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
this change I think what's going to

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.949 
this change I think what's going to
happen<00:03:08.530> is<00:03:08.620> sort<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.269> divergent<00:03:10.269> timeline

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
happen is sort of a divergent timeline

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.440 
happen is sort of a divergent timeline
or<00:03:10.989> divergent<00:03:11.680> universe<00:03:12.040> vs<00:03:12.760> sort<00:03:12.970> of<00:03:13.060> created

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
or divergent universe vs sort of created

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.400 
or divergent universe vs sort of created
where<00:03:13.630> Hank<00:03:14.140> Pym<00:03:14.410> wasn't<00:03:14.890> alive<00:03:15.130> and<00:03:16.350> so<00:03:17.350> you

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
where Hank Pym wasn't alive and so you

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.509 
where Hank Pym wasn't alive and so you
think<00:03:17.560> there's<00:03:17.739> going<00:03:17.859> to<00:03:17.950> be<00:03:17.980> two<00:03:18.190> separate

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
think there's going to be two separate

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.080 
think there's going to be two separate
universes<00:03:18.850> now<00:03:19.150> yeah<00:03:19.959> what<00:03:20.769> if<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.820> age<00:03:21.970> of

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
universes now yeah what if the age of

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.120 
universes now yeah what if the age of
Ultron<00:03:22.510> universe<00:03:23.200> was<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.769> original

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
Ultron universe was the original

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.490 
Ultron universe was the original
universe<00:03:24.489> to<00:03:24.609> begin<00:03:24.850> with<00:03:25.000> 616<00:03:25.570> if<00:03:26.019> what<00:03:26.410> it

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
universe to begin with 616 if what it

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.670 
universe to begin with 616 if what it
reminds<00:03:26.980> me<00:03:27.040> of<00:03:27.160> is<00:03:27.760> like<00:03:28.569> house<00:03:28.840> of<00:03:29.049> m<00:03:29.290> wheres

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
reminds me of is like house of m wheres

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.530 
reminds me of is like house of m wheres
Carla<00:03:30.220> which<00:03:30.370> essentially<00:03:30.700> creates<00:03:31.450> a

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
Carla which essentially creates a

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.680 
Carla which essentially creates a
divergent<00:03:32.530> universe<00:03:33.130> we're<00:03:34.000> meeting<00:03:34.359> kind<00:03:34.540> is

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
divergent universe we're meeting kind is

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.610 
divergent universe we're meeting kind is
one<00:03:34.989> and<00:03:35.609> in<00:03:36.609> that<00:03:37.390> one<00:03:37.600> there<00:03:37.810> was<00:03:37.989> like<00:03:38.170> a<00:03:38.200> key

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
one and in that one there was like a key

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.990 
one and in that one there was like a key
thing<00:03:38.920> that<00:03:39.100> they<00:03:39.220> had<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.519> do<00:03:39.670> to<00:03:39.880> make

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
thing that they had to do to make

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.470 
thing that they had to do to make
everything<00:03:40.359> back<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:40.930> was<00:03:41.290> so<00:03:41.709> maybe<00:03:42.120> this<00:03:43.120> has

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
everything back to was so maybe this has

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.030 
everything back to was so maybe this has
created<00:03:43.750> a<00:03:43.959> new<00:03:44.049> universe<00:03:44.530> and<00:03:44.680> there's<00:03:44.859> this

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
created a new universe and there's this

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.039 
created a new universe and there's this
one<00:03:45.430> key<00:03:45.700> aspect<00:03:45.730> that<00:03:46.239> they<00:03:46.389> could<00:03:46.569> use<00:03:46.780> to

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
one key aspect that they could use to

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.360 
one key aspect that they could use to
make<00:03:47.290> it<00:03:47.410> right<00:03:47.739> back<00:03:47.920> to<00:03:48.100> where<00:03:48.220> it<00:03:48.280> was

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
make it right back to where it was

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.309 
make it right back to where it was
supposed<00:03:48.489> to<00:03:48.760> be<00:03:48.880> but<00:03:49.569> another<00:03:49.780> thing<00:03:50.019> to<00:03:50.170> keep

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
supposed to be but another thing to keep

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.920 
supposed to be but another thing to keep
in<00:03:50.410> mind<00:03:50.470> about<00:03:50.650> House<00:03:51.310> of<00:03:51.489> M<00:03:51.639> is<00:03:51.850> even<00:03:52.810> though

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
in mind about House of M is even though

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.930 
in mind about House of M is even though
they<00:03:53.139> did<00:03:53.290> attempt<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.160> set<00:03:54.340> everything<00:03:54.430> back

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
they did attempt to set everything back

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.550 
they did attempt to set everything back
to<00:03:55.389> the<00:03:55.420> way<00:03:55.510> it's<00:03:55.690> supposed<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:55.930> be<00:03:56.049> there's

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
to the way it's supposed to be there's

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.289 
to the way it's supposed to be there's
one<00:03:56.829> minor<00:03:57.040> tweak<00:03:57.370> on<00:03:57.519> it<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.790> fact<00:03:57.970> that<00:03:58.060> all

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
one minor tweak on it the fact that all

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.229 
one minor tweak on it the fact that all
mutants<00:03:58.630> except<00:03:58.900> for<00:03:59.109> like<00:03:59.350> 150<00:03:59.889> or<00:04:00.579> D<00:04:01.030> power

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
mutants except for like 150 or D power

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.229 
mutants except for like 150 or D power
yeah<00:04:02.079> so<00:04:02.350> it's<00:04:02.680> a<00:04:02.799> way<00:04:02.950> to<00:04:02.980> cause<00:04:03.760> a<00:04:03.790> massive

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
yeah so it's a way to cause a massive

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.509 
yeah so it's a way to cause a massive
change<00:04:04.900> in<00:04:05.139> the<00:04:05.260> Marvel<00:04:05.590> Universe<00:04:05.620> like<00:04:06.280> we've

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
change in the Marvel Universe like we've

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.360 
change in the Marvel Universe like we've
talked<00:04:07.329> about<00:04:07.510> some<00:04:07.840> sort<00:04:08.079> of<00:04:08.200> reset<00:04:08.769> without

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
talked about some sort of reset without

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.080 
talked about some sort of reset without
not<00:04:09.579> completely<00:04:10.180> doing<00:04:10.690> a<00:04:10.810> reset<00:04:11.139> right<00:04:12.090> one

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
not completely doing a reset right one

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.069 
not completely doing a reset right one
of<00:04:13.209> the<00:04:13.299> things<00:04:13.480> I<00:04:13.600> found<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.870> most

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
of the things I found the most

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:15.780 
of the things I found the most
interesting<00:04:14.290> was<00:04:15.160> the<00:04:15.370> scene<00:04:15.579> where

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
interesting was the scene where

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.050 
interesting was the scene where
Wolverine<00:04:16.450> walks<00:04:16.780> in<00:04:16.989> on<00:04:17.109> Hank<00:04:17.500> Pym<00:04:17.769> and<00:04:18.060> tank

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
Wolverine walks in on Hank Pym and tank

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.599 
Wolverine walks in on Hank Pym and tank
p.m.<00:04:19.269> seems<00:04:19.539> to<00:04:19.690> be<00:04:19.840> almost<00:04:20.620> coming<00:04:21.400> up<00:04:21.489> with

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
p.m. seems to be almost coming up with

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.850 
p.m. seems to be almost coming up with
the<00:04:21.729> idea<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.390> create<00:04:22.510> Ultron<00:04:23.320> it<00:04:23.470> was<00:04:23.590> like<00:04:23.710> in

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
the idea to create Ultron it was like in

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:24.660 
the idea to create Ultron it was like in
that<00:04:23.950> exact<00:04:24.370> moment

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
that exact moment

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.400 
that exact moment
he<00:04:24.850> was<00:04:25.000> inspired<00:04:25.450> to<00:04:25.600> create<00:04:25.840> this<00:04:26.110> perfect

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
he was inspired to create this perfect

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.010 
he was inspired to create this perfect
artificial<00:04:27.100> intelligence<00:04:27.840> that<00:04:28.840> was<00:04:28.930> a<00:04:28.960> very

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
artificial intelligence that was a very

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.560 
artificial intelligence that was a very
cool<00:04:29.470> seen'em<00:04:29.980> for<00:04:30.550> multiple<00:04:30.910> reasons<00:04:30.940> 1i

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
cool seen'em for multiple reasons 1i

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.640 
cool seen'em for multiple reasons 1i
think<00:04:31.780> that<00:04:32.170> was<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:32.820> catalyst<00:04:33.820> for

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
think that was the catalyst for

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.190 
think that was the catalyst for
Wolverine<00:04:35.650> eventually<00:04:36.160> having<00:04:36.400> to<00:04:36.760> kill<00:04:37.200> Hank

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
Wolverine eventually having to kill Hank

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.260 
Wolverine eventually having to kill Hank
been<00:04:38.470> when<00:04:38.740> he<00:04:38.770> gets<00:04:39.070> into<00:04:39.250> that<00:04:39.490> room<00:04:39.730> he<00:04:40.000> sees

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
been when he gets into that room he sees

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.150 
been when he gets into that room he sees
that<00:04:40.480> oh<00:04:40.630> man<00:04:40.960> it's<00:04:41.170> kind<00:04:41.440> of<00:04:41.530> already<00:04:41.830> too

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
that oh man it's kind of already too

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.090 
that oh man it's kind of already too
late<00:04:42.370> that's<00:04:42.670> I've<00:04:42.940> already<00:04:43.300> seen<00:04:43.990> him<00:04:44.920> just

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
late that's I've already seen him just

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.890 
late that's I've already seen him just
come<00:04:45.310> up<00:04:45.460> with<00:04:45.580> the<00:04:45.700> idea<00:04:46.060> so<00:04:46.570> if<00:04:46.660> you<00:04:46.720> would've

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
come up with the idea so if you would've

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.660 
come up with the idea so if you would've
got<00:04:47.020> there<00:04:47.230> you<00:04:47.500> know<00:04:47.620> 20<00:04:47.980> minutes<00:04:48.250> earlier<00:04:48.550> he

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
got there you know 20 minutes earlier he

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.010 
got there you know 20 minutes earlier he
could<00:04:48.820> have<00:04:48.910> talked<00:04:49.060> him<00:04:49.240> down<00:04:49.270> perhaps<00:04:49.720> or

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
could have talked him down perhaps or

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.620 
could have talked him down perhaps or
maybe<00:04:50.140> maybe<00:04:50.770> he<00:04:51.040> could<00:04:51.250> have<00:04:51.340> like<00:04:51.550> told<00:04:52.450> him

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
maybe maybe he could have like told him

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.600 
maybe maybe he could have like told him
about<00:04:52.750> something<00:04:53.230> he's<00:04:53.350> about<00:04:53.560> to<00:04:53.770> do<00:04:53.950> or<00:04:54.400> I

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
about something he's about to do or I

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.580 
about something he's about to do or I
think<00:04:55.600> it<00:04:55.720> would<00:04:55.810> have<00:04:55.840> played<00:04:56.050> out<00:04:56.200> entirely

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
think it would have played out entirely

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.170 
think it would have played out entirely
differently<00:04:57.280> if<00:04:57.430> he<00:04:57.490> hadn't<00:04:57.790> walked<00:04:57.910> in<00:04:58.060> at

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
differently if he hadn't walked in at

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.850 
differently if he hadn't walked in at
that<00:04:58.360> exact<00:04:58.900> moment<00:04:59.020> so<00:04:59.650> that's<00:04:59.800> just

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
that exact moment so that's just

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.120 
that exact moment so that's just
incredibly<00:05:00.460> unlucky<00:05:00.820> or<00:05:02.130> coincidentally

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
incredibly unlucky or coincidentally

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.040 
incredibly unlucky or coincidentally
incredible<00:05:03.640> incidental<00:05:04.240> yeah<00:05:04.450> that<00:05:04.780> he<00:05:04.840> shows

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
incredible incidental yeah that he shows

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.470 
incredible incidental yeah that he shows
at<00:05:05.170> the<00:05:05.230> bay<00:05:05.350> the<00:05:05.410> exact<00:05:05.860> moment<00:05:06.240> but<00:05:07.240> I<00:05:07.270> was

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
at the bay the exact moment but I was

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.340 
at the bay the exact moment but I was
also<00:05:07.630> a<00:05:07.720> little<00:05:07.930> disappointed<00:05:08.320> that

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
also a little disappointed that

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.460 
also a little disappointed that
Wolverine<00:05:09.240> came<00:05:10.240> in<00:05:10.420> and<00:05:10.690> he<00:05:10.990> got<00:05:11.110> a<00:05:11.170> reveal

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
Wolverine came in and he got a reveal

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.200 
Wolverine came in and he got a reveal
himself<00:05:11.650> first<00:05:12.040> I<00:05:12.340> think<00:05:12.730> he<00:05:12.820> should've<00:05:13.030> just

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
himself first I think he should've just

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.610 
himself first I think he should've just
gone<00:05:13.360> all<00:05:13.540> x-force<00:05:14.140> and<00:05:14.410> you<00:05:14.470> know<00:05:14.590> just

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
gone all x-force and you know just

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.110 
gone all x-force and you know just
stabbed<00:05:15.100> him<00:05:15.280> in<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.370> back<00:05:15.430> without<00:05:15.820> him<00:05:16.060> even

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
stabbed him in the back without him even

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.030 
stabbed him in the back without him even
knowing<00:05:16.270> see<00:05:16.960> that's<00:05:17.170> why<00:05:17.350> I<00:05:17.380> think<00:05:17.830> that<00:05:17.980> he

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
knowing see that's why I think that he

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.710 
knowing see that's why I think that he
came<00:05:18.220> in<00:05:18.400> with<00:05:18.430> the<00:05:18.640> idea<00:05:18.910> of<00:05:18.970> talking<00:05:19.210> to<00:05:19.600> him

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
came in with the idea of talking to him

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.570 
came in with the idea of talking to him
because<00:05:19.960> he<00:05:20.140> has<00:05:20.470> so<00:05:20.710> much<00:05:20.950> experience<00:05:21.010> with

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
because he has so much experience with

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.190 
because he has so much experience with
just<00:05:21.790> killing<00:05:22.210> people<00:05:22.480> right<00:05:22.600> off<00:05:22.720> the<00:05:23.020> bat

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
just killing people right off the bat

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.670 
just killing people right off the bat
and<00:05:23.730> he<00:05:24.730> comes<00:05:25.000> in<00:05:25.180> and<00:05:25.300> sort<00:05:25.480> of<00:05:25.570> does<00:05:26.230> it<00:05:26.410> in<00:05:26.530> a

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
and he comes in and sort of does it in a

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.230 
and he comes in and sort of does it in a
way<00:05:26.740> that<00:05:26.860> gives<00:05:27.040> him<00:05:27.400> a<00:05:27.520> chance<00:05:27.790> so<00:05:28.090> I<00:05:28.120> think

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
way that gives him a chance so I think

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.510 
way that gives him a chance so I think
he<00:05:28.600> meant<00:05:29.260> to<00:05:29.410> come<00:05:29.560> in<00:05:29.710> and<00:05:29.890> like<00:05:30.010> talk<00:05:30.190> to<00:05:30.400> him

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
he meant to come in and like talk to him

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.310 
he meant to come in and like talk to him
reason<00:05:30.850> with<00:05:31.000> them<00:05:31.090> we<00:05:31.750> should<00:05:31.900> also<00:05:32.020> take<00:05:32.230> a

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
reason with them we should also take a

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.690 
reason with them we should also take a
look<00:05:32.440> at<00:05:32.530> the<00:05:32.590> future<00:05:32.770> where<00:05:33.100> Nick<00:05:33.250> very<00:05:33.460> goes

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
look at the future where Nick very goes

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.910 
look at the future where Nick very goes
and<00:05:33.970> we<00:05:34.060> see<00:05:34.240> what<00:05:34.390> Ultron<00:05:35.050> has<00:05:35.170> created<00:05:35.590> out

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
and we see what Ultron has created out

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.430 
and we see what Ultron has created out
of<00:05:35.950> the<00:05:36.100> world<00:05:36.340> works<00:05:37.210> just<00:05:37.390> like<00:05:37.630> golden

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
of the world works just like golden

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.210 
of the world works just like golden
world<00:05:39.930> it<00:05:40.930> looks<00:05:41.170> very<00:05:41.440> robust<00:05:41.800> everywhere

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
world it looks very robust everywhere

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.220 
world it looks very robust everywhere
yeah<00:05:42.790> I<00:05:43.120> don't<00:05:43.510> think<00:05:43.660> it<00:05:43.720> looks<00:05:43.810> beautiful<00:05:43.990> I

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
yeah I don't think it looks beautiful I

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.450 
yeah I don't think it looks beautiful I
think<00:05:44.440> it<00:05:44.500> looks<00:05:44.530> like<00:05:44.800> a<00:05:44.830> completely

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
think it looks like a completely

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.310 
think it looks like a completely
dystopian<00:05:46.180> future<00:05:46.570> I<00:05:46.750> thought<00:05:47.050> it<00:05:47.200> looked

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
dystopian future I thought it looked

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
when they get to the Savage Land though

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.610 
when they get to the Savage Land though
the<00:05:53.590> place<00:05:53.980> looks<00:05:54.190> like<00:05:54.310> a<00:05:54.340> paradise<00:05:54.820> it's<00:05:55.120> not
