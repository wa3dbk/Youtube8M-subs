00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
tell me about to work so physically the

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.759 
tell me about to work so physically the
strategic<00:00:37.460> move<00:00:37.670> pretty<00:00:38.480> fast<00:00:38.600> pace<00:00:38.989> which<00:00:39.559> is

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
strategic move pretty fast pace which is

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:41.709 
strategic move pretty fast pace which is
about<00:00:39.980> killing<00:00:40.760> opponents<00:00:40.879> but<00:00:41.390> getting

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
about killing opponents but getting

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.319 
about killing opponents but getting
strategy<00:00:42.289> points<00:00:42.710> so<00:00:43.219> you<00:00:43.280> can<00:00:43.519> break<00:00:44.149> the

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
strategy points so you can break the

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.360 
strategy points so you can break the
morale<00:00:44.660> of<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:45.019> enemy<00:00:45.379> team<00:00:45.559> so<00:00:46.100> it's<00:00:46.219> not

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
morale of the enemy team so it's not

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.849 
morale of the enemy team so it's not
about<00:00:46.809> crushing<00:00:47.809> their<00:00:47.989> morale<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:48.530> then<00:00:48.739> you

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
about crushing their morale and then you

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:50.349 
about crushing their morale and then you
can<00:00:49.010> kill<00:00:49.280> them<00:00:49.489> all<00:00:49.609> and<00:00:49.640> then<00:00:49.879> win<00:00:50.059> the<00:00:50.089> game

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 
can kill them all and then win the game

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:53.560 
can kill them all and then win the game
so<00:00:50.870> it's<00:00:51.079> a<00:00:51.199> skill-based<00:00:51.499> game<00:00:51.940> team<00:00:52.940> base<00:00:53.210> for

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
so it's a skill-based game team base for

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.349 
so it's a skill-based game team base for
v4<00:00:53.890> but<00:00:54.890> there's<00:00:55.399> a<00:00:55.489> lot<00:00:55.789> of<00:00:55.819> strategic

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 
v4 but there's a lot of strategic

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.149 
v4 but there's a lot of strategic
elements<00:00:56.780> to<00:00:56.929> it<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:57.469> once<00:00:57.679> you<00:00:57.829> get<00:00:58.010> to<00:00:58.039> a

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
elements to it so once you get to a

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.099 
elements to it so once you get to a
certain<00:00:58.249> point<00:00:58.760> in<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.149> match<00:00:59.329> you<00:00:59.690> actually

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
certain point in the match you actually

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.259 
certain point in the match you actually
force<00:01:00.440> your<00:01:00.649> opponent<00:01:00.679> into<00:01:01.190> breaking<00:01:01.609> tell

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
force your opponent into breaking tell

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.060 
force your opponent into breaking tell
me<00:01:02.390> what<00:01:02.539> this<00:01:02.659> mean<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.499> it<00:01:03.589> means<00:01:03.800> their

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
me what this mean so it means their

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.130 
me what this mean so it means their
morale<00:01:04.370> has<00:01:04.519> been<00:01:04.580> shut<00:01:04.970> down<00:01:05.030> so<00:01:05.659> they<00:01:05.930> won't

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
morale has been shut down so they won't

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.470 
morale has been shut down so they won't
respond<00:01:06.650> anymore<00:01:06.890> they<00:01:07.580> still<00:01:07.850> have<00:01:08.120> a<00:01:08.150> chance

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
respond anymore they still have a chance

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.540 
respond anymore they still have a chance
to<00:01:08.690> come<00:01:08.870> back<00:01:08.930> though<00:01:09.410> we<00:01:09.650> can<00:01:09.830> steal<00:01:10.130> points

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
to come back though we can steal points

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.770 
to come back though we can steal points
for<00:01:10.700> you<00:01:10.850> by<00:01:11.030> getting<00:01:11.090> those<00:01:11.570> strategic

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
for you by getting those strategic

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.020 
for you by getting those strategic
location<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.010> getting<00:01:13.280> them<00:01:13.460> back<00:01:13.700> or

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
location and getting them back or

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.360 
location and getting them back or

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
getting a lot of points so they can

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.310

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
break your morale to or what we call

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.920 
break your morale to or what we call
rally<00:01:18.860> so<00:01:19.370> they<00:01:19.520> get<00:01:20.030> back<00:01:20.300> their<00:01:20.480> morale<00:01:20.750> and

interesting there are to capture points
and<00:02:00.009> then<00:02:00.219> there's<00:02:00.459> a<00:02:00.729> Lane<00:02:01.060> in<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.659> middle

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
and then there's a Lane in the middle

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.380 
and then there's a Lane in the middle
what<00:02:02.619> is<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:02.979> Lane<00:02:03.340> so<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.149> game<00:02:04.359> starts

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
what is that Lane so the game starts

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.870 
what is that Lane so the game starts
where<00:02:05.049> those<00:02:05.350> tormey<00:02:05.890> are<00:02:06.069> running<00:02:06.520> towards

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
where those tormey are running towards

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.639 
where those tormey are running towards
each<00:02:06.969> other<00:02:07.149> you<00:02:07.780> know<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:08.049> arrogate<00:02:08.500> is

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
each other you know the arrogate is

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.190 
each other you know the arrogate is
lifting<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.819> attackers<00:02:10.179> are<00:02:10.390> jumping<00:02:11.019> in

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
lifting and the attackers are jumping in

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.490 
lifting and the attackers are jumping in
and<00:02:11.380> that<00:02:12.220> front<00:02:12.849> you<00:02:13.269> can<00:02:13.510> win<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:13.989> like<00:02:14.260> other

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
and that front you can win it like other

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.470 
and that front you can win it like other
control<00:02:14.950> points<00:02:15.250> but<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:15.519> have<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.819> push<00:02:16.150> the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
control points but you have to push the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.380 
control points but you have to push the
enemy<00:02:17.099> inside<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.280> territory<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.090> kill

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
enemy inside the territory so you kill

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.880 
enemy inside the territory so you kill
their<00:02:19.599> soldiers<00:02:20.110> but<00:02:20.650> you're<00:02:20.860> very

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
their soldiers but you're very

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.160 
their soldiers but you're very
vulnerable<00:02:21.430> around<00:02:21.970> there<00:02:22.329> you're<00:02:22.690> visible

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
vulnerable around there you're visible

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.170 
vulnerable around there you're visible
and<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.620> have<00:02:23.799> enemy<00:02:24.280> soldiers<00:02:24.670> around<00:02:24.940> you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
and you have enemy soldiers around you

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.150 
and you have enemy soldiers around you
they<00:02:25.390> can<00:02:25.569> hit<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:26.049> they<00:02:26.260> can<00:02:26.470> lock<00:02:26.890> your
