00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
I guess I could do some roach micro

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.749 
I guess I could do some roach micro
again<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.140> big<00:01:37.320> battle<00:01:37.560> but<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.399> know<00:01:38.490> he

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
again in a big battle but you know he

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.370 
again in a big battle but you know he
can<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.000> storm<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.570> ground<00:01:39.840> where<00:01:40.110> they<00:01:40.229> are

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
can just storm the ground where they are

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.069 
can just storm the ground where they are
can<00:01:41.040> move<00:01:41.189> them<00:01:41.369> around<00:01:41.490> yeah<00:01:41.970> but<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:43.020> that

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
can move them around yeah but is that

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.319 
can move them around yeah but is that
really<00:01:43.439> worth<00:01:43.799> spending<00:01:44.520> all<00:01:44.789> that<00:01:44.820> tech<00:01:45.149> to

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
really worth spending all that tech to

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.660 
really worth spending all that tech to
