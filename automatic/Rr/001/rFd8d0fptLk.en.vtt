00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.099

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:11.799
 men x you saw it with your mind not 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:16.250
 with my awkward magnetism binoculars 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:18.289
 go that has excellent potential I say 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.689
 if it's okay hello I'm the teacher 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.849
 Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr your 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.619
 extraordinary skills are you 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.320

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.839

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.640

 make a century more triple twist 1393 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:42.510
 now that does not make sense only the 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.510
 ship of hate magnetism 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.710
 but all possess skills outside of 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.040
 normal and that's why the humanity that 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.230
 will be very rigorous and their 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.880
 powers will surpass any 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.680
 obstacle is that humanity will have 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.239
 much rigor 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.559
 we want to guide you along the way of 10 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.809
 that the good of humanity that gives them 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.750
 will have a lot of cattle could you excuse us 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.280
 a moment what's up with you always 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.619
 do the same thing is not true 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.630
 well let's deliver these types are 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.409
 rare today is it informed that I can read your 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.409
 mind in your fingers 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.510
 in action 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.359
 but no 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.300
 have 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.270
 I do not do 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.710
 they were right we are special thanks to 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.310
 we will take all the 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.770
 medals in sexy games 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.659
 games that we train them to fight 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.659
 mutants super villains that 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.740
 listen there is a submarine where he lived and 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.160
 mutant that looks like kevin bacon is 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.410
 ready to face his army and 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.220
 all your fellow doubles the art 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.220
 it's not suicide 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.819
 I guess they do not want an autograph 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.890
 I think it did not work at all I knew that 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.200
 we wanted to recruit through blue 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.000
 And Christ does not hear that you should not 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.000
 piloting the plane is still true 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:39.220
 and replacing the area mysteriously 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:43.050
 I own not think it's quiet 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.050
 I'll be fine this is a piece of cake 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.840
 and that's why you always have to wear a helmet 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.670
 children 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.670
 and now you know
