00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
could probably do together stuff is

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.449 
could probably do together stuff is
going<00:04:13.549> back<00:04:13.940> and<00:04:14.840> probably<00:04:15.260> going<00:04:16.160> up<00:04:16.280> there

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
going back and probably going up there

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.880 
going back and probably going up there
in<00:04:16.549> place<00:04:16.790> so<00:04:17.060> faster<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:18.049> jump<00:04:18.260> on<00:04:18.380> it<00:04:18.500> now<00:04:18.620> and

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
in place so faster to jump on it now and

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.140 
in place so faster to jump on it now and
get<00:04:18.979> it<00:04:19.040> in<00:04:19.190> a<00:04:19.220> couple<00:04:19.400> of<00:04:19.489> years<00:04:19.760> when<00:04:19.970> it<00:04:20.060> has

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
as much as I can

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.570 
as much as I can
I<00:04:25.910> think<00:04:26.510> it's<00:04:26.630> so<00:04:26.870> such<00:04:27.140> a<00:04:27.230> cool<00:04:27.530> series<00:04:27.950> the

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
I think it's so such a cool series the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.120 
I think it's so such a cool series the
reason<00:04:28.910> why<00:04:29.090> is<00:04:29.150> it's<00:04:29.690> so<00:04:30.050> different<00:04:30.350> it's<00:04:30.770> so

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
reason why is it's so different it's so

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.540 
reason why is it's so different it's so
unusual<00:04:31.340> it's<00:04:32.150> so<00:04:32.540> unusual<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:33.800> music<00:04:34.310> the

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
unusual it's so unusual the music the

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.660 
unusual it's so unusual the music the
visual<00:04:34.940> style<00:04:35.330> these<00:04:35.750> games<00:04:36.080> is<00:04:36.440> like<00:04:36.740> is

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
visual style these games is like is

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.520 
visual style these games is like is
really<00:04:38.510> really<00:04:38.840> different<00:04:39.050> and<00:04:39.290> I<00:04:39.320> think

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
really really different and I think

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.430 
really really different and I think
that's<00:04:39.710> what<00:04:39.860> draws<00:04:40.220> into<00:04:40.730> the<00:04:40.850> series<00:04:41.440> it's

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
that's what draws into the series it's

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.490 
that's what draws into the series it's
very<00:04:42.680> dark<00:04:43.100> it's<00:04:43.460> very<00:04:43.700> unusual<00:04:44.260> it's<00:04:45.260> not
