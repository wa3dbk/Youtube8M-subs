00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.789
 hello everyone how are you 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.289
 welcome one more day to the channel in 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.150
 today's video I bring you my latest 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.039
 complete of kiko so if you are interested 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.480
 stay to see good first thing that you 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.699
 I teach is from a collection that are 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.090
 discontinuing the archery collection and 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:37.879
 is this blusher on the stick he is the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.879
 number 06 select expressed 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.800
 Well I was very struck by the 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.150
 shape that you have and the tone that you have to 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.830
 It's a light brown shade and I thought 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.470
 that I could do very well to do the 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:58.040
 cream outline below the base and 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.520
 the hd and I saw how good the tone was 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.520
 fairly good 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.920
 and how they were descatalogando to 390 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.630
 I did not think about it and I took it good 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.210
 more little things that I took from collection are 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.740
 these three cream shadows of the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.720
 colors of long lasting and shadow no 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.060
 I remember the name of this collection the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.210
 I really do not remember I'm sorry 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.340
 but hey, I had heard a lot about 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.590
 them and I've taken a look and I 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.689
 loved these three good the first 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.689
 thing I teach is the number 100 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:43.030
 it's a topic that I thought was super special 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:46.390
 It's like a pearly rose and has a 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:50.280
 reflex like pulling to golden or something 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.280
 It did not seem like a super nice color 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.250
 then there's 101 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.830
 good thing I 'm not much roses but 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.910
 he called me mogollÃ³n the pink attention 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.930
 Fuchsia clarito and has as the reflection 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.930
 so also golden 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:21.110
 and finally I show you the 102 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:24.020
 what is a very dark dark burgundy tone 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.850
 and it has flashes in it too 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.850
 tone but a little more clarito 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.340
 good to tell you that it is a long 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.690
 lasting me luck in the store and 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.240
 when I went to pay and others I tried 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.280
 remove it with a two-phase and cost me a 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.410
 heap removing the switches the truth is 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.470
 that at the time of drying it seems that 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.290
 They last a lot are cream shades 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.500
 that are super super creamy are more 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.510
 as in mousse and it is very easy to 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.400
 slide but the truth is that I still do not know 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.430
 how can I apply them with my finger or 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.290
 well I will try to look at the brush with the 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.300
 what better management and I'll tell you 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.220
 well I tell you that I do not remember the 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.200
 name of the collection but the price of 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.910
 each shadow is six with ninety euros 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.100
 The next thing I show you are these two 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.980
 enamels that were also on offer 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.200
 they were on offer at one euro I do not know why 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.120
 there was an area of the enamels of this 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.000
 range that were one euro and the rest 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.700
 they were at their normal price I fucked 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.180
 this one that is in a cream tone puts there 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.830
 which is for French manicure and is the 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.830
 number 206 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.670
 and then I took this one that is in a tone 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.340
 brown camel would not know well how 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.319
 explain it I do not know if on camera you will see 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.160
 same as you see here but good is a 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.720
 tone that I do many better 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.640
 jackets and many boots that I have is 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.770
 a very similar color so good for 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.320
 a euro that was I thought that some 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.989
 day I give myself to paint my nails 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.580
 they could combine well with those clothes and it's 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.580
 the number 370 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.739
 Well, I only have three little things left 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.810
 tell you that everything he took was from 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.209
 collection or is in promotion and good 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.819
 first I teach you I bought the book 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.430
 design air had not been for a long time 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.620
 I had it I do not know why I stopped it 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.190
 use stop using fixators but 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.900
 well now that I'm trying I do not know 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.259
 how to reshape the eyebrows 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.990
 Well, I do not pilot them so much and I need 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:34.090
 that fixation I do not suppose that all the 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.960
 world knows this product but 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:40.240
 good is a simple eyebrow fixer 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.520
 is a brush with a gel that what 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.830
 it is is to pass it through the eyebrows 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.599
 and fixes your hair so you do not get 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.610
 the disheveled eyebrows are 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:51.190
 they were on offer to the masks of 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.069
 tabs to 3 with 90 and well I guess that 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.080
 you will know and if not tell you that when 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:58.630
 the mascara tabs in kiko are 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.789
 of offer also put this product and 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.860
 they go down of about seven euros that usually 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.780
 cost generally three with ninety and 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.910
 the other two things that I picked up were 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.210
 two eyeliner I know there were also the 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.150
 eyeliner to 390 the first one that I caught 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.160
 when I saw it I did not know how not to 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.030
 had caught before the truth is that I 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.920
 charm 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.560
 I really tell you that you will know them 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.930
 all but I had never noticed is this 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.130
 that this glitter I do not know if you can see 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.130
 how nice it is 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:33.309
 well I do not know if the leader will look like 

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:35.839
 How is it 

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:39.019
 multicolored and when I saw it I thought 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:41.689
 Perfect for lower lashes or 

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:44.299
 to do a double delineated but 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:46.939
 maybe its putting it on top of eyeliner in 

00:05:44.299 --> 00:05:49.399
 black did not get my attention and I said 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:51.679
 are going to 390 so I took advantage and 

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:56.119
 last one I also caught another eyeliner was 

00:05:51.679 --> 00:06:00.559
 this is such a dark blue tone is the 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:06:03.139
 number 107 and I really wanted a 

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:05.269
 blue eyeliner of this type of blue 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:09.789
 because I really wanted to make a 

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:09.789
 smoked brown with delineated in blue 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.069
 and nothing like always I hope that I have 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.110

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.939
