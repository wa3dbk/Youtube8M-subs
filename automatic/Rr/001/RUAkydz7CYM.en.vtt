00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
spotted it it's quite a cool little lens

00:00:24.480 --> 00:01:02.820 
spotted it it's quite a cool little lens
and<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.410> price<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:26.130> fantastic

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.840 

firstly<00:01:03.830> what<00:01:04.220> does<00:01:04.309> it<00:01:04.400> do

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
firstly what does it do

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.820 
firstly what does it do
well<00:01:05.030> when<00:01:05.900> you're<00:01:06.020> underwater<00:01:06.290> there's<00:01:06.770> a

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
well when you're underwater there's a

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
well when you're underwater there's a
magnification<00:01:07.340> of<00:01:07.960> about<00:01:09.010> 1.3<00:01:10.010> three<00:01:10.520> times

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
magnification of about 1.3 three times

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.790 
magnification of about 1.3 three times
your<00:01:11.090> focal<00:01:11.540> length<00:01:11.720> which<00:01:11.930> means<00:01:11.990> that<00:01:12.620> if

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
your focal length which means that if

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.890 
your focal length which means that if
you<00:01:12.830> have<00:01:13.010> a<00:01:13.160> 28<00:01:13.580> millimeter<00:01:14.090> lens<00:01:14.360> like<00:01:14.690> my

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
you have a 28 millimeter lens like my

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.610 
you have a 28 millimeter lens like my
Sony<00:01:15.260> rx100<00:01:15.920> mark<00:01:16.670> 2<00:01:16.940> you<00:01:17.750> are<00:01:17.780> going<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:18.440> get

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
Sony rx100 mark 2 you are going to get

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:27.070 
Sony rx100 mark 2 you are going to get
roughly<00:01:19.479> 37<00:01:20.479> or<00:01:21.050> 38<00:01:21.220> millimeters<00:01:22.220> of<00:01:23.229> zoom<00:01:26.080> in

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
roughly 37 or 38 millimeters of zoom in

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.020 
roughly 37 or 38 millimeters of zoom in
your<00:01:27.290> images<00:01:27.650> which<00:01:27.890> sorry<00:01:28.460> on<00:01:28.610> your<00:01:28.640> camera

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
your images which sorry on your camera

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.359 
your images which sorry on your camera
which<00:01:29.240> is<00:01:29.570> not<00:01:30.080> the<00:01:30.320> greatest<00:01:30.560> thing<00:01:31.190> is

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
which is not the greatest thing is

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.010 
which is not the greatest thing is
underwater<00:01:31.729> you<00:01:31.910> want<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.150> get<00:01:32.270> as<00:01:32.360> close<00:01:32.600> as

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
underwater you want to get as close as

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.469 
underwater you want to get as close as
possible<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:34.040> your<00:01:34.430> subject<00:01:35.119> that<00:01:35.270> you're

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
possible to your subject that you're

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.499 
possible to your subject that you're
that<00:01:35.810> you're<00:01:35.990> photographing<00:01:36.229> or<00:01:36.770> filming<00:01:37.130> and

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
that you're photographing or filming and

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.450 
that you're photographing or filming and
that's<00:01:38.509> why<00:01:38.690> wide-angle<00:01:39.380> lenses<00:01:39.740> are<00:01:39.979> pretty

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
that's why wide-angle lenses are pretty

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.050 
that's why wide-angle lenses are pretty
awesome<00:01:42.160> the<00:01:43.160> closer<00:01:43.369> you<00:01:43.580> get<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.910> less

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
awesome the closer you get the less

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.760 
awesome the closer you get the less
light<00:01:44.300> you<00:01:44.479> lose<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:45.170> better<00:01:45.380> your<00:01:45.530> image

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
light you lose the better your image

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.620 
light you lose the better your image
quality<00:01:45.920> and<00:01:46.430> pretty<00:01:46.850> much<00:01:47.030> to<00:01:47.210> eat<00:01:47.390> the

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
quality and pretty much to eat the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.210 
quality and pretty much to eat the
easier<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:48.140> is<00:01:48.229> for<00:01:48.290> you<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.650> expose<00:01:49.040> your

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
easier it is for you to expose your

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.040 
easier it is for you to expose your
images<00:01:51.670> secondly<00:01:52.670> over<00:01:53.540> unders

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
images secondly over unders

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.170 
images secondly over unders
over/under<00:01:54.680> is<00:01:54.710> weighing<00:01:55.160> half<00:01:55.729> of<00:01:56.000> your

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
over/under is weighing half of your

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.280 
over/under is weighing half of your
image<00:01:56.570> is<00:01:56.840> split<00:01:57.170> by<00:01:57.440> water<00:01:57.800> and<00:01:58.160> land<00:01:59.149> land<00:02:00.050> on

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
image is split by water and land land on

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.139 
image is split by water and land land on
top<00:02:00.530> water<00:02:00.800> at<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.130> bottom<00:02:01.430> when<00:02:02.000> you're

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
top water at the bottom when you're

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.330 
top water at the bottom when you're
taking<00:02:02.479> these<00:02:02.630> images<00:02:03.140> sometimes<00:02:03.410> or<00:02:03.979> if<00:02:04.220> you

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
taking these images sometimes or if you

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.710 
taking these images sometimes or if you
have<00:02:04.490> taken<00:02:04.880> these<00:02:04.970> images<00:02:05.360> you<00:02:05.479> may<00:02:05.630> have

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
have taken these images you may have

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.960 
have taken these images you may have
noticed<00:02:06.110> that<00:02:06.229> well<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.130> bottom<00:02:07.460> half<00:02:07.670> is

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
noticed that well the bottom half is

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.510 
noticed that well the bottom half is
quite<00:02:08.780> big<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.319> magnified<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.130> top<00:02:10.310> up

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
quite big and magnified and the top up

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.540 
quite big and magnified and the top up
is<00:02:10.789> mobile<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:12.530> reason<00:02:12.800> for<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.010> again<00:02:13.370> is

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
is mobile the reason for that again is

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.440 
is mobile the reason for that again is
like<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:13.850> mentioned<00:02:14.180> earlier<00:02:14.420> that

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
like I mentioned earlier that

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.680 
like I mentioned earlier that
magnification<00:02:15.580> if<00:02:16.580> you<00:02:16.819> take<00:02:17.090> an<00:02:17.240> image<00:02:17.480> with

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
magnification if you take an image with

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.510 
magnification if you take an image with
this<00:02:17.810> port<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.500> can<00:02:18.680> see<00:02:18.860> it's<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.040> very<00:02:19.220> small

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
this port you can see it's a very small

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.120 
this port you can see it's a very small
port<00:02:19.940> getting<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:21.110> water<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.680> stay<00:02:21.890> in<00:02:22.040> the

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
port getting the water to stay in the

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.440 
port getting the water to stay in the
middle<00:02:22.400> is<00:02:22.520> number<00:02:22.940> one<00:02:23.120> very<00:02:23.360> difficult<00:02:23.900> and

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
middle is number one very difficult and

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.190 
middle is number one very difficult and
number<00:02:26.450> two<00:02:26.630> not<00:02:27.050> ideal<00:02:28.450> this<00:02:29.450> kind<00:02:29.840> makes<00:02:30.050> it

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
number two not ideal this kind makes it

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.290 
number two not ideal this kind makes it
slightly<00:02:30.410> easier<00:02:30.920> it's<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.520> much<00:02:31.700> bigger<00:02:31.910> port

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
slightly easier it's a much bigger port

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.580 
slightly easier it's a much bigger port
keeping<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.720> water<00:02:32.840> in<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.080> middle<00:02:33.319> is<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.440> lot

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
keeping the water in the middle is a lot

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.400 
keeping the water in the middle is a lot
easier<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.220> obviously<00:02:34.910> that<00:02:35.410> magnification

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
easier and obviously that magnification

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
easier and obviously that magnification
is<00:02:36.620> lust<00:02:37.340> with<00:02:37.790> this<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.830> bottom<00:02:40.130> half<00:02:40.310> of

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
is lust with this so the bottom half of

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.830

so you're not going to have these weird
looking<00:02:50.300> people<00:02:50.780> half<00:02:51.319> in<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.650> water<00:02:51.860> and

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
looking people half in the water and

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.550 
looking people half in the water and
half<00:02:52.250> out<00:02:52.720> take<00:02:53.720> a<00:02:53.750> look<00:02:53.959> at<00:02:54.050> these<00:02:54.110> pics<00:02:54.380> and

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
half out take a look at these pics and

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:21.800 
half out take a look at these pics and
see<00:02:54.680> what<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:54.950> lens<00:02:55.130> does

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.150 

so<00:03:22.810> that's<00:03:23.260> pretty<00:03:23.410> much<00:03:23.530> it<00:03:23.830> for<00:03:23.980> this<00:03:24.100> guy

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
so that's pretty much it for this guy

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.440 
so that's pretty much it for this guy
positives<00:03:27.160> just<00:03:27.520> to<00:03:27.610> sum<00:03:27.820> up<00:03:27.940> very<00:03:28.210> quickly

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
positives just to sum up very quickly

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.240 
positives just to sum up very quickly
it's<00:03:28.870> well-priced

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
it's well-priced

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.360 
it's well-priced
it<00:03:30.960> 67<00:03:31.960> millimeters<00:03:32.470> which<00:03:32.710> means<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.160> can<00:03:33.340> use

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
it 67 millimeters which means I can use

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.460 
it 67 millimeters which means I can use
it<00:03:33.730> even<00:03:33.910> if<00:03:34.120> I<00:03:34.210> upgrade<00:03:34.600> my<00:03:34.630> housing<00:03:35.170> at<00:03:35.290> some

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
it even if I upgrade my housing at some

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.470 
it even if I upgrade my housing at some
point<00:03:35.710> I<00:03:35.920> can<00:03:36.100> use<00:03:36.310> it<00:03:36.460> on<00:03:36.610> on<00:03:37.000> my<00:03:37.240> newer

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
point I can use it on on my newer

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.530
