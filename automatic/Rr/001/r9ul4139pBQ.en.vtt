five years in the same terrarium and

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.789 
five years in the same terrarium and
actually<00:01:54.179> have<00:01:54.359> had<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.689> lot<00:01:54.959> less<00:01:55.229> space<00:01:55.560> than

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
actually have had a lot less space than

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.609 
actually have had a lot less space than
this<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:57.359> give<00:01:57.539> them<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.810> much<00:01:58.049> room<00:01:58.350> is

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
this so to give them this much room is

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.539 
this so to give them this much room is
uh<00:01:59.479> definitely<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.779> step<00:02:01.020> up<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.319> the<00:02:01.380> world<00:02:01.549> so

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
uh definitely a step up in the world so

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.129 
uh definitely a step up in the world so
i<00:02:02.579> thought<00:02:02.789> i'd<00:02:02.969> try<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.299> get<00:02:03.450> another<00:02:03.539> angle

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:04.139 
i thought i'd try and get another angle

this tank is as I said like before that
space<00:02:11.580> in<00:02:11.849> between<00:02:12.000> my<00:02:12.330> geckos<00:02:13.290> over<00:02:13.590> here

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
space in between my geckos over here

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.250 
space in between my geckos over here
that's<00:02:14.549> what<00:02:14.849> I<00:02:14.879> was<00:02:15.239> clearing<00:02:15.599> this<00:02:15.840> up<00:02:15.989> for

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
this huge

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.520 
this huge
tank<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.250> this<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.150> custom-made<00:02:18.720> thing<00:02:19.320> it

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.890 
has a handmade stand with the wheels and
everything<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:24.120> it's<00:02:24.270> easy<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.540> move<00:02:24.750> around

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
everything so it's easy to move around

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.950 
everything so it's easy to move around
and<00:02:26.000> it's<00:02:27.000> got<00:02:27.830> Tara<00:02:28.830> heat<00:02:29.070> pads<00:02:29.310> on<00:02:29.580> it

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
and it's got Tara heat pads on it

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.810 
and it's got Tara heat pads on it
there's<00:02:30.960> one<00:02:31.350> at<00:02:31.620> this<00:02:32.070> end<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.610> don't

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
there's one at this end that I don't

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.970 
there's one at this end that I don't
actually<00:02:32.970> have<00:02:33.300> plugged<00:02:34.200> in<00:02:34.410> because<00:02:34.590> my

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
actually have plugged in because my

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.860 
actually have plugged in because my
reptile<00:02:35.340> room<00:02:35.820> is<00:02:36.060> warm<00:02:36.210> enough<00:02:36.390> for<00:02:36.660> the

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
reptile room is warm enough for the

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.450 
reptile room is warm enough for the
gradient<00:02:37.440> at<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.740> end<00:02:37.980> they<00:02:38.160> don't<00:02:38.340> need

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
gradient at this end they don't need

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.760 
gradient at this end they don't need
extra<00:02:38.610> heat<00:02:38.970> but<00:02:39.570> then<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.720> have<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.350> second

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
extra heat but then I have the second

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.760 
extra heat but then I have the second
heat<00:02:40.920> pad<00:02:41.130> at<00:02:41.280> this<00:02:41.430> end<00:02:41.670> plugged<00:02:42.600> in<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:43.230> get

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
heat pad at this end plugged in to get

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.530 
heat pad at this end plugged in to get
there<00:02:43.920> basking<00:02:44.430> spot<00:02:44.460> over<00:02:44.970> here<00:02:45.000> up<00:02:45.300> nice<00:02:45.510> and

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
there basking spot over here up nice and

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.290 
there basking spot over here up nice and
warm<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:49.100> yeah<00:02:50.100> so<00:02:50.310> that's<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.700> terrarium<00:02:51.210> I
