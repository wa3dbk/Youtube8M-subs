a<00:02:45.600> huge<00:02:46.080> fail<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.830> I<00:02:47.370> don't<00:02:47.550> think<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.850> would

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
a huge fail and I don't think it would

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.460 
a huge fail and I don't think it would
really<00:02:48.060> work<00:02:48.330> on<00:02:48.510> anyone's<00:02:48.959> hair<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.320> be
