00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.360
 hello good afternoon on barriers now noon and 21 on the air the local edition of 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.400
 bay half a day the temperature that in the city 30 degrees 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.249
 Today is Thursday, March 26. 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:20.929
 research has shown that the milk produced here in the western region 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:22.319
 need to improve 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:25.319
 the main problem is with regard to pgm 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.449
 but properties like this in the rural zone of barriers 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.660
 the animal production research center of the state university of Bahia 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.319
 assess the quality of milk produced in the region for only one year 

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:43.110
 will be examined more than a thousand stalls 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.300
 the research verified 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.090
 leader of mechanical milking and one in the sanga district and the result showed that 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.020
 the production systems need to be better postponed a planned trip in. 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.560
 the standards of regulations 51 and 2002 of the Ministry of Livestock 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.910
 supply 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.050
 However 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.480
 compared to the international quality standards of the 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.320
 milk 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.670
 the milk of the region it would be out of international standards the presence of 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.700
 South margin is a disease that inflamed her ana maria was also detected in the 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.869
 study according to specialists the sea the magic central serious damages to the 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.909
 producers and dairies 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:24.940
 on the other hand 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.370
 milk prisons 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.170
 and therefore prevention is fundamental 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.000
 the research coordinator explains that there are barbell battery spikes and study 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.850
 with paper discarded before the order is indispensable in addition the three 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.120
 first jets of milk should be eliminated 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.710
 every day should also be made up of the mug of black background 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.500
 if there is any residue on the body screen it means that it is contaminated 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.350
 but the care does not stop there 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.830
 after the village, what is done is the raising of trees in October and being 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.780
 indicated 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.740
 if it is tested year of 130 works since they produce about 850 liters of 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.989
 milk per day the producer knows the price of version 8 weakened 539 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.849
 You do not have to take care of him. 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.049
 in the field for the laboratory 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.449
 students of the agronomy course attested the density of milk to 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:26.989
 check if it has been added to water 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.259
 it's even via sedex 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:33.809
 with air of antibodies to approve or not the presence of the teen magic told 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:38.599
 with the optimum amount of bacteria one of the factors that determine the quality 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.229
 of food 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:42.550
 but despite the search result 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.440
 to point out some shortcomings in local production 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.529
 the positive conclusion 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:52.379
 already the region and if it can invest in dairy cattle vehicle regions have a 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.529
 very large potential if the milk production chain 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:03:00.489
 why when enough grain that can be used in the animal feed in 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.059
 our region can have a favorable climate for the 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:05.269
 pasture 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.340
 It is possible to bring animals say placard to that position and dairy products that 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.969
 can transform milk are products with quality
