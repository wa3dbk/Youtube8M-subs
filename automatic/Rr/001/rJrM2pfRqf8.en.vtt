right<00:00:08.040> now<00:00:08.220> we're<00:00:08.460> actually<00:00:08.639> in<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:09.150> camera

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
right now we're actually in a camera

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.089 
right now we're actually in a camera
this<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:10.050> you<00:00:10.200> right<00:00:10.440> now<00:00:10.469> we're<00:00:10.860> looking

this of you right now we're looking
through<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.280> camera<00:00:11.460> it's<00:00:11.820> right<00:00:12.030> here<00:00:12.269> it's

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
through a camera it's right here it's

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.160 
through a camera it's right here it's
called<00:00:12.950> perspective<00:00:13.950> pers<00:00:14.759> P<00:00:15.000> if<00:00:15.240> we<00:00:15.839> go<00:00:16.109> up

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
called perspective pers P if we go up

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.500 
called perspective pers P if we go up
here<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.560> panels<00:00:17.130> we<00:00:17.970> have<00:00:18.000> perspective

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
here in panels we have perspective

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.470 
here in panels we have perspective
cameras<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:20.010> can<00:00:20.160> create<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.640> new<00:00:20.880> one<00:00:21.060> here

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
cameras you can create a new one here

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.080 
cameras you can create a new one here
you<00:00:22.470> can<00:00:22.500> look<00:00:22.830> at<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.100> existing<00:00:23.550> perspective

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
you can look at the existing perspective

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.790 
you can look at the existing perspective
on<00:00:24.180> we<00:00:24.359> already<00:00:24.510> are<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.990> orthographic

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800

those we're in one view right now we did

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.069 
those we're in one view right now we did
spacebar<00:00:32.180> and<00:00:33.180> there<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.570> go<00:00:33.690> there's<00:00:33.930> the

if I want to go on top view I can hit

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.430 
if I want to go on top view I can hit
spacebar<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.640> maximize<00:00:39.600> my<00:00:39.780> top<00:00:40.020> view<00:00:40.050> hit

spacebar and maximize my top view hit

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.010 
spacebar and maximize my top view hit
the<00:00:40.530> spacebar<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.010> go<00:00:41.219> back<00:00:41.399> out<00:00:41.719> go<00:00:42.719> back<00:00:42.870> to

front aside the top perspective now we

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.380 
front aside the top perspective now we
can<00:00:48.750> go<00:00:48.899> up<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.850> perspective<00:00:50.850> if<00:00:50.969> we<00:00:51.120> want<00:00:51.329> to

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
can go up in perspective if we want to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.700 
can go up in perspective if we want to
make<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> new<00:00:51.719> camera<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.170> here<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:52.590> can

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
make a new camera in here and we can

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.180 
make a new camera in here and we can
just<00:00:52.829> go<00:00:52.980> new<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:54.230> we're<00:00:55.230> automatically

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
just go new and we're automatically

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.099 
just go new and we're automatically
looking<00:00:56.699> through<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.059> right<00:00:57.239> now<00:00:57.480> says

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
looking through it right now says

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.830 
looking through it right now says
perspective<00:00:58.770> one<00:00:59.039> that's<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.270> camera<00:01:00.510> that

perspective one that's the camera that

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.270 
perspective one that's the camera that
we're<00:01:01.020> actually<00:01:01.320> looking<00:01:01.890> through<00:01:01.920> right<00:01:02.160> now

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
we're actually looking through right now

we're actually looking through right now
in<00:01:02.460> fact<00:01:02.640> if<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:02.969> look<00:01:03.149> around<00:01:04.610> enough<00:01:08.180> well

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
in fact if we look around enough well

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.740 
in fact if we look around enough well
maybe<00:01:09.450> not<00:01:11.000> anyway<00:01:12.000> open<00:01:12.420> up<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.659> attribute

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
reading this thing new camera I guess I

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.450 
reading this thing new camera I guess I
don't<00:01:24.869> know<00:01:24.960> their<00:01:25.229> new<00:01:25.710> camera<00:01:26.159> never

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
don't know their new camera never

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.550 
don't know their new camera never
there's<00:01:26.759> our<00:01:26.939> new<00:01:27.119> camera<00:01:28.020> down<00:01:28.170> there<00:01:28.380> so

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
there's our new camera down there so

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.990 
there's our new camera down there so
when<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.710> go<00:01:28.920> up<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.189> perspective<00:01:29.790> window

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
when I go up in the perspective window

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.980 
when I go up in the perspective window
now<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.180> see<00:01:30.570> new<00:01:30.720> camera<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.759> perspective

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
now I see new camera and perspective

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.569 
now I see new camera and perspective
this<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.049> where<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.409> panel<00:01:34.799> menu<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:37.430> there<00:01:38.430> we

you can do it the old-fashioned way just
go<00:01:56.009> create<00:01:56.630> cameras<00:01:57.740> camera<00:01:59.240> there<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.420> is

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
go create cameras camera there it is

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.840 
go create cameras camera there it is
creates<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.170> at<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.380> world<00:02:01.560> origin<00:02:01.890> that's

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
creates it at the world origin that's

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.640 
creates it at the world origin that's
pretty<00:02:03.060> useful<00:02:03.649> you<00:02:04.649> know

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650

that you can name this camera final shot
or<00:02:14.050> something<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.870> that's<00:02:17.080> it<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.620> cameras

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
or something and that's it and cameras

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.560 
or something and that's it and cameras
work<00:02:18.250> like<00:02:18.520> any<00:02:18.760> other<00:02:19.000> kind<00:02:19.270> of<00:02:19.390> piece<00:02:19.540> of

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
work like any other kind of piece of

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.100 
work like any other kind of piece of
geometry<00:02:19.900> with<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.650> respect<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.520> you<00:02:21.580> can

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
geometry with the respect that you can

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.490 
geometry with the respect that you can
move<00:02:23.110> them<00:02:23.410> all<00:02:23.920> over<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.670> scene<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:26.470> can

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
move them all over the scene you can

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.910 
move them all over the scene you can
rotate<00:02:26.950> them<00:02:27.780> all<00:02:28.780> kinds<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.290> nifty<00:02:29.530> things

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
rotate them all kinds of nifty things

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.790 
rotate them all kinds of nifty things
like<00:02:30.190> that<00:02:30.400> upside<00:02:30.850> down<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:35.320> can<00:02:35.500> name<00:02:35.770> it

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
like that upside down you can name it

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.470 
like that upside down you can name it
like<00:02:36.190> we<00:02:36.340> did<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:39.100> also<00:02:39.550> if<00:02:39.880> I<00:02:40.030> want<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.360> look

like we did and also if I want to look

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.270 
like we did and also if I want to look
through<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:40.990> camera<00:02:41.500> I<00:02:41.560> go<00:02:41.680> up<00:02:41.740> your<00:02:41.890> panel

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
through that camera I go up your panel

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.650 
through that camera I go up your panel
look<00:02:42.730> through<00:02:42.940> selected<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:43.660> Here<00:02:44.350> I<00:02:44.380> am<00:02:45.660> I'm
