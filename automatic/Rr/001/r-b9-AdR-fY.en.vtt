00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.629
 hi guys here we are on the battle for 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.950
 see some double application 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.410
 shot like exercises on the drums 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.789
 I highly recommend trying out doubles 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.880
 strokes both on snare drum on tones 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.789
 dishes on all the pieces where it is 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.060
 You can do them because every single one 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.500
 piece has its rebound response then 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.480
 the snare drum will have its answer on 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.990
 charlie is not another and so on 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.990
 then 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.490
 ok if we want to help with a metronome 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.350
 I recommend playing the eighths for 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.330
 then then double them if I am 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.460
 heroes the eighths on a speed of m g 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:56.630
 that I can do now with the charlie 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:59.509
 so then I played eighths for then 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.399
 split every stroke of the eighths 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:08.330
 they would be sixteenths made however with i 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:11.550
 double puffs up applications 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.450
 could be one could be 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.849
 this 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.980
 so I'm going to play now a 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.530
 time then a snare drum with a few strokes 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.459
 snare upbeat and that shot him 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.510
 then burst without a double blow 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.510
 that would be so 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:47.000
 with double blow I'm playing without ring 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.980
 shot the normal snare and or others 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:11.630
 rhythms a little more complex but always 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:03:15.050
 simple regarding the steps 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.290
 you can use the double hit in this one 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.290
 way 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:35.560
 so let 's hit it with your hand 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:37.810
 right on the toms and I regret them we fill 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:46.030
 on the other side with double blows with 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:47.590
 this left hand on the snare drum 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.799
 what is always better to learn it too 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.840
 making the opposite movement then a 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:04:14.769
 blow with the left and double with the 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:18.280
 right other applications could 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:21.039
 be charlie in his sixteenth position 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.970
 rhythms and with double strokes inside and 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:23.970
 embellishment then 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:53.610
 exercise I recommend you make it 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:58.889
 several to get to have one 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:00.449
 good mastery then exercises on 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:05.159
 snare exercises like I said before 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:07.199
 suite oms try the su su su vari 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:11.099
 surfaces because every surface has the 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:15.599
 its rebound type is however ahead 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:18.719
 I will make other videos where we will try anyway 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:24.259
 to do double strokes deepen a 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:27.929
 this technique for now violated one 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:31.079
 small demonstration on how we can 

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:34.679
 intervene with double strokes for 

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:37.429
 whatever it writes themes and thanks to 

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:37.429
 all bye
