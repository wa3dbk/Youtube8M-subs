00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420

cognac<00:01:51.639> on<00:01:51.819> it<00:01:52.079> some<00:01:53.079> of<00:01:53.109> you<00:01:53.289> may<00:01:53.469> think<00:01:53.799> that

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
cognac on it some of you may think that

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:57.330 
cognac on it some of you may think that
I<00:01:54.090> came<00:01:55.090> down<00:01:55.359> a<00:01:55.630> little<00:01:55.810> too<00:01:56.109> low<00:01:56.380> in<00:01:56.709> the

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
I came down a little too low in the

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.999 
I came down a little too low in the
front<00:01:57.579> but<00:01:58.209> it<00:01:58.299> seems<00:01:58.569> like<00:01:58.869> whenever<00:01:59.139> I<00:01:59.409> stop

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
front but it seems like whenever I stop

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.129 
front but it seems like whenever I stop
right<00:02:00.399> here<00:02:00.849> and<00:02:01.060> then<00:02:01.569> I<00:02:01.689> rinse<00:02:01.899> everything

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:02.139 
right here and then I rinse everything

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:04.739 
right here and then I rinse everything
out<00:02:02.590> my<00:02:02.799> hair<00:02:03.130> it<00:02:03.579> looks<00:02:03.939> like<00:02:04.149> you<00:02:04.599> know<00:02:04.719> I

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749 
out my hair it looks like you know I

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.690 
out my hair it looks like you know I
didn't<00:02:05.109> catch<00:02:05.289> all<00:02:05.529> the<00:02:05.709> hairs<00:02:05.950> on<00:02:06.159> front<00:02:06.459> so<00:02:06.609> I

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
didn't catch all the hairs on front so I

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.210 
didn't catch all the hairs on front so I
figured<00:02:07.029> I'd<00:02:07.149> go<00:02:07.359> down<00:02:07.569> lower<00:02:07.869> and<00:02:08.229> then<00:02:09.040> what

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
figured I'd go down lower and then what

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.339 
figured I'd go down lower and then what
I<00:02:09.250> do<00:02:09.340> is<00:02:09.490> take<00:02:09.759> some<00:02:09.940> alcohol<00:02:10.450> after<00:02:11.100> doing

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349
