00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
have the default spawn rate of the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.970 
have the default spawn rate of the
villages<00:00:38.969> they<00:00:39.180> just<00:00:39.360> spawn<00:00:39.600> like<00:00:39.840> crazy<00:00:40.440> as

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
villages they just spawn like crazy as

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.350 
villages they just spawn like crazy as
you<00:00:41.190> can<00:00:41.309> see<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.489> village<00:00:41.790> over<00:00:41.940> there<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
villages everywhere so I thought it'd

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.590

just be easier to show you guys um this

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.630 
just be easier to show you guys um this

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
simple mod but I figured I'd go with

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.060 
simple mod but I figured I'd go with
something<00:01:09.390> simple<00:01:09.630> for<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> first<00:01:10.409> one<00:01:10.860> just

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
something simple for the first one just

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.950 
something simple for the first one just
cuz<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.880> don't<00:01:12.240> even<00:01:12.330> know<00:01:12.510> if<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.689> guys<00:01:12.840> are

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.770 
see this um some rocks built into it
it's<00:01:38.130> kind<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.400> funny<00:01:38.670> anyways<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.720> a

it's kind of funny anyways this is a
really<00:01:39.960> big<00:01:40.140> building<00:01:40.500> actually<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.970> I

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
really big building actually and I

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.880 
really big building actually and I
really<00:01:42.570> cannot<00:01:42.810> stand<00:01:43.020> when<00:01:43.320> they<00:01:43.560> don't<00:01:43.680> load

actually<00:01:49.829> they<00:01:50.640> they<00:01:50.939> always<00:01:51.149> spawn<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
actually they they always spawn and the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.810 
actually they they always spawn and the
planes<00:01:52.619> like<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.369> we're<00:01:53.520> gonna<00:01:53.610> go

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
planes like this so we're gonna go

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.209 
planes like this so we're gonna go
through<00:01:54.060> different<00:01:54.270> areas<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.560> I'll

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
through different areas like this I'll

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.100 
through different areas like this I'll
try<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.520> find<00:01:56.880> another<00:01:56.969> one<00:01:57.329> that's<00:01:57.659> why<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.869> put

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
try to find another one that's why I put

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.749 
try to find another one that's why I put
it<00:01:58.170> like<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.649> we<00:01:58.799> can<00:01:58.920> actually<00:01:59.040> you

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
it like this so that we can actually you

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.910 
it like this so that we can actually you
know<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.600> has<00:02:00.899> um<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.320> know<00:02:01.409> wood<00:02:01.680> paths

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
know and it has um you know wood paths

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.499 
know and it has um you know wood paths
which<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.189> kind<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.460> cool<00:02:02.610> actually<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:03.240> guess

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
which is kind of cool actually I guess

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.320 
which is kind of cool actually I guess
this<00:02:03.630> one's<00:02:03.810> more<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.110> forest<00:02:04.500> type<00:02:05.159> area

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
this one's more of a forest type area

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.090 
this one's more of a forest type area
as<00:02:08.170> you<00:02:08.380> guys<00:02:08.470> can<00:02:08.619> see<00:02:08.680> they're<00:02:08.950> really

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
as you guys can see they're really

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.710 
as you guys can see they're really
spawning<00:02:09.580> all<00:02:09.880> over<00:02:10.150> the<00:02:10.240> place<00:02:10.479> they're<00:02:10.690> in

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
spawning all over the place they're in

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.570 
spawning all over the place they're in
the<00:02:10.869> water<00:02:11.110> they're<00:02:11.440> everywhere<00:02:12.070> pretty<00:02:12.310> much

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
the water they're everywhere pretty much

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.370 
the water they're everywhere pretty much
so<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.240> whole<00:02:13.390> village<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.870> mean<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.230> whole

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
so the whole village I mean the whole

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.410 
so the whole village I mean the whole
like<00:02:14.650> world<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.190> like<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.370> giant<00:02:15.730> metropolis<00:02:16.270> if

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
like world is like a giant metropolis if

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.200 
like world is like a giant metropolis if
you<00:02:16.510> decide<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:17.080> go<00:02:17.950> with<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.250> one<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:19.060> has

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
you decide to go with the one that has

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.670 
you decide to go with the one that has
them<00:02:19.420> every<00:02:19.720> single<00:02:19.990> place<00:02:20.140> okay<00:02:20.440> here's<00:02:20.590> a

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
them every single place okay here's a

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.050 
them every single place okay here's a
swamp<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.220> was<00:02:21.580> looking<00:02:21.820> for<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:21.970> different

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
swamp I was looking for a different

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.840 
swamp I was looking for a different
biome<00:02:22.510> so<00:02:23.080> I'm<00:02:23.320> sure<00:02:23.590> that<00:02:23.770> there<00:02:23.980> will<00:02:24.010> be<00:02:24.160> a

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
biome so I'm sure that there will be a

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.000 
biome so I'm sure that there will be a
village<00:02:25.750> around<00:02:25.870> here<00:02:26.170> somewhere<00:02:26.620> once<00:02:26.950> we

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
village around here somewhere once we

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.270 
village around here somewhere once we
can<00:02:27.130> get<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.340> screen<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.820> load<00:02:28.980> all<00:02:29.980> right<00:02:30.130> so

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
can get the screen to load all right so

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.920 
can get the screen to load all right so
there's<00:02:30.460> one<00:02:30.580> right<00:02:30.730> over<00:02:30.790> here<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:31.840> can

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
there's one right over here and you can

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.150 
there's one right over here and you can
see<00:02:32.140> that<00:02:32.290> they<00:02:32.380> all<00:02:32.500> have<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.740> different<00:02:32.800> look

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
see that they all have a different look

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
see that they all have a different look
to<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.280> they<00:02:33.400> all<00:02:33.520> pretty<00:02:33.790> much<00:02:33.970> like<00:02:34.150> a

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
to it they all pretty much like a

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.390 
to it they all pretty much like a
different<00:02:34.570> like<00:02:34.690> path<00:02:35.050> made<00:02:35.950> out<00:02:36.070> of<00:02:36.190> like<00:02:36.310> a

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
different like path made out of like a

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.740 
different like path made out of like a
different<00:02:36.700> block<00:02:36.880> I<00:02:37.150> don't<00:02:37.330> know<00:02:37.420> it's<00:02:37.600> pretty

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
different block I don't know it's pretty

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.230 
different block I don't know it's pretty
cool<00:02:37.960> it's<00:02:38.560> really<00:02:38.920> obviously<00:02:39.880> it's<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.060> mod

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
cool it's really obviously it's a mod

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.970 
cool it's really obviously it's a mod
for<00:02:40.270> people<00:02:40.690> who<00:02:40.750> really<00:02:41.020> like<00:02:41.320> villages<00:02:41.800> and

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
for people who really like villages and

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.040 
for people who really like villages and
want<00:02:42.160> to<00:02:42.250> see<00:02:42.370> more<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.700> them<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.270> I<00:02:43.840> think

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
want to see more of them and I think

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.300 
want to see more of them and I think
that<00:02:44.200> actually<00:02:44.440> should<00:02:44.680> be<00:02:44.830> something<00:02:45.040> added

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
that actually should be something added

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.490 
that actually should be something added
into<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.640> game<00:02:45.850> you<00:02:46.150> know<00:02:46.450> villages<00:02:47.110> in<00:02:47.260> every

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
into the game you know villages in every

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.170 
into the game you know villages in every
biome<00:02:47.830> I<00:02:47.950> think<00:02:48.130> it<00:02:48.190> would<00:02:48.280> be<00:02:48.370> cool<00:02:48.550> let's<00:02:49.150> see

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
biome I think it would be cool let's see

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.840 
biome I think it would be cool let's see
if<00:02:49.270> we<00:02:49.330> can<00:02:49.420> find<00:02:49.510> a<00:02:49.630> jungle<00:02:49.930> now<00:02:50.670> all<00:02:51.670> right<00:02:51.760> so

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
if we can find a jungle now all right so

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.060 
if we can find a jungle now all right so
I<00:02:51.910> found<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.150> jungle<00:02:52.510> guys<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:52.959> as<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.770> can<00:02:53.890> see

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
I found a jungle guys and as you can see

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.140 
I found a jungle guys and as you can see
that<00:02:54.220> there's<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:54.490> many<00:02:54.550> trees<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.090> the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
that there's so many trees and the

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.670 
that there's so many trees and the
trouble<00:02:55.420> they<00:02:55.480> really<00:02:55.870> just<00:02:56.080> spawned<00:02:56.440> like

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
trouble they really just spawned like

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.770 
trouble they really just spawned like
really<00:02:57.520> close<00:02:57.850> together<00:02:58.209> in<00:02:58.390> between<00:02:58.690> the

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
really close together in between the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.840 
really close together in between the
trees<00:02:58.990> but<00:02:59.320> it's<00:02:59.440> pretty<00:02:59.530> cool<00:02:59.770> and<00:03:00.459> as<00:03:00.730> you

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
trees but it's pretty cool and as you

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.100 
trees but it's pretty cool and as you
can<00:03:00.910> see<00:03:00.970> same<00:03:01.209> thing<00:03:01.450> you<00:03:01.600> know<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.720> different

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
can see same thing you know a different

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.660 
can see same thing you know a different
little<00:03:02.200> path<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.800> the<00:03:02.980> blocks<00:03:03.250> that<00:03:03.430> they're

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
little path and the blocks that they're

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.220 
little path and the blocks that they're
made<00:03:03.820> out<00:03:03.850> of<00:03:03.970> it's<00:03:04.209> pretty<00:03:04.390> cool<00:03:04.570> here<00:03:04.930> in<00:03:05.050> the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
made out of it's pretty cool here in the

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.680 
made out of it's pretty cool here in the
jungle<00:03:05.880> so<00:03:06.880> it<00:03:07.030> really<00:03:07.240> they<00:03:07.360> really<00:03:07.540> did

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
jungle so it really they really did

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.930 
jungle so it really they really did
customize<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.560> way<00:03:08.740> that<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.490> know<00:03:09.610> all<00:03:09.820> the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
customize the way that you know all the

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.949 
customize the way that you know all the
buildings<00:03:10.240> look<00:03:10.360> they<00:03:10.540> don't<00:03:10.690> have<00:03:10.780> they

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
buildings look they don't have they

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.420 
buildings look they don't have they
haven't<00:03:11.080> added<00:03:11.440> any<00:03:11.590> extra<00:03:11.650> buildings<00:03:12.310> but

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
haven't added any extra buildings but

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.710 
haven't added any extra buildings but
they<00:03:12.550> did<00:03:12.730> customize<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.300> way<00:03:13.390> they<00:03:13.510> look

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
they did customize the way they look

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.800 
they did customize the way they look
based<00:03:14.260> on<00:03:14.440> which<00:03:14.650> biome<00:03:15.070> they're<00:03:15.310> in<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:16.510> I

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
based on which biome they're in so I

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.960 
based on which biome they're in so I
don't<00:03:17.440> know<00:03:17.500> I<00:03:17.650> think<00:03:17.890> it's<00:03:17.980> pretty<00:03:18.100> cool<00:03:18.430> at

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
don't know I think it's pretty cool at

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.160 
don't know I think it's pretty cool at
least<00:03:19.300> it<00:03:19.420> makes<00:03:19.540> it<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:19.810> know<00:03:19.840> gives<00:03:20.110> you

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
least it makes it you know gives you

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.479 
least it makes it you know gives you
something<00:03:20.470> else<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.739> check<00:03:20.920> out<00:03:21.130> when<00:03:21.340> you're

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
something else to check out when you're

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:22.860 
something else to check out when you're
playing<00:03:21.700> you<00:03:21.940> know<00:03:22.060> because<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.570> lot<00:03:22.600> of<00:03:22.750> the

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
playing you know because a lot of the

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.740 
playing you know because a lot of the
times<00:03:23.080> you<00:03:23.260> may<00:03:23.410> play<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:25.000> know<00:03:25.120> survival<00:03:25.510> or

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
times you may play you know survival or

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.050 
times you may play you know survival or
whatever<00:03:26.050> and<00:03:26.440> you<00:03:27.370> may<00:03:27.489> never<00:03:27.610> even<00:03:27.850> see<00:03:28.030> a

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
whatever and you may never even see a

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.699 
whatever and you may never even see a
village<00:03:28.300> this<00:03:28.959> gives<00:03:29.200> you<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.350> higher<00:03:29.530> chance

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
village this gives you a higher chance

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.840 
village this gives you a higher chance
at<00:03:29.860> seeing<00:03:30.070> one<00:03:30.220> if<00:03:30.310> you<00:03:30.370> put<00:03:30.489> them<00:03:30.610> in<00:03:30.670> all<00:03:30.760> the

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
at seeing one if you put them in all the

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.710 
at seeing one if you put them in all the
biomes<00:03:31.120> I<00:03:31.239> probably<00:03:31.420> wouldn't<00:03:31.660> recommend

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
biomes I probably wouldn't recommend

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.960 
biomes I probably wouldn't recommend
having<00:03:32.410> it<00:03:32.530> like<00:03:32.980> this<00:03:33.250> where<00:03:33.459> there's<00:03:33.610> a<00:03:33.670> by

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
having it like this where there's a by

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.090 
having it like this where there's a by
the<00:03:34.209> way<00:03:34.300> there's<00:03:34.480> a<00:03:34.630> village<00:03:34.930> every<00:03:35.140> 20<00:03:35.890> feet

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
the way there's a village every 20 feet

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.949 
the way there's a village every 20 feet
but<00:03:36.670> it<00:03:37.060> would<00:03:37.269> give<00:03:37.420> you<00:03:37.510> a<00:03:37.570> very<00:03:37.810> high<00:03:37.930> chance

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
but it would give you a very high chance

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.630 
but it would give you a very high chance
of<00:03:38.260> at<00:03:38.350> least<00:03:38.470> seeing<00:03:38.769> one<00:03:38.980> sometimes<00:03:39.489> you're

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
of at least seeing one sometimes you're

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.830 
of at least seeing one sometimes you're
not<00:03:39.670> in<00:03:39.880> the<00:03:39.970> areas<00:03:40.300> where<00:03:40.330> there<00:03:40.630> would<00:03:40.720> be<00:03:40.750> a

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
not in the areas where there would be a

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.090 
not in the areas where there would be a
village<00:03:41.170> and<00:03:41.380> this<00:03:41.500> would<00:03:41.680> give<00:03:41.830> you<00:03:41.950> that

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
village and this would give you that

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.310 
village and this would give you that
chance<00:03:42.390> plus<00:03:43.390> it<00:03:43.540> adds<00:03:43.570> a<00:03:43.810> little<00:03:43.930> bit<00:03:44.050> extra

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
chance plus it adds a little bit extra

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.340 
chance plus it adds a little bit extra
to<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.650> game<00:03:44.830> in<00:03:45.040> my<00:03:45.220> opinion<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:47.110> as<00:03:47.260> you

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
to the game in my opinion and as you

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.690 
to the game in my opinion and as you
guys<00:03:47.440> can<00:03:47.620> see<00:03:47.800> now<00:03:47.950> back<00:03:48.160> to<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.370> extreme

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
guys can see now back to the extreme

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.740 
guys can see now back to the extreme
hills<00:03:48.910> I<00:03:49.030> just<00:03:49.209> wanted<00:03:49.390> to<00:03:49.450> show<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:49.630> some

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
hills I just wanted to show you some

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.479 
hills I just wanted to show you some
pretty<00:03:49.930> cool<00:03:50.200> ones<00:03:50.410> this<00:03:50.920> one<00:03:51.130> look<00:03:51.340> at<00:03:51.430> how

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
pretty cool ones this one look at how

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:52.979 
pretty cool ones this one look at how
they<00:03:51.610> spawn<00:03:51.940> all<00:03:52.180> on<00:03:52.300> the<00:03:52.420> top<00:03:52.660> of<00:03:52.870> the

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
they spawn all on the top of the

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.449 
they spawn all on the top of the
mountain<00:03:53.290> I<00:03:53.350> think<00:03:53.530> it<00:03:53.620> looks<00:03:53.800> pretty<00:03:53.950> cool<00:03:54.220> I

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
mountain I think it looks pretty cool I

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:55.860 
mountain I think it looks pretty cool I
think<00:03:54.730> that<00:03:54.910> this<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.239> probably<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.720> coolest

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
think that this is probably the coolest

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.259 
think that this is probably the coolest
biome<00:03:56.410> for<00:03:56.769> them<00:03:56.980> you<00:03:57.820> know<00:03:57.910> to<00:03:58.000> have

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
biome for them you know to have

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.420 
biome for them you know to have
buildings<00:03:58.810> a<00:03:59.010> couple<00:04:00.010> these<00:04:00.100> things<00:04:00.280> do<00:04:00.370> look

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
buildings a couple these things do look

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.580 
buildings a couple these things do look
a<00:04:00.580> little<00:04:00.730> strange<00:04:01.239> as<00:04:01.570> you<00:04:01.989> can<00:04:02.110> see<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.320> path

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
a little strange as you can see the path

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.800 
a little strange as you can see the path
comes<00:04:02.980> down<00:04:03.310> like<00:04:03.580> off<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:04.030> top<00:04:04.209> of<00:04:04.239> the<00:04:04.450> Balan

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
comes down like off the top of the Balan

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.840 
comes down like off the top of the Balan
which<00:04:05.290> doesn't<00:04:05.590> really<00:04:05.680> make<00:04:05.799> sense<00:04:05.920> but<00:04:06.730> it

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
which doesn't really make sense but it

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.759 
which doesn't really make sense but it
still<00:04:07.120> does<00:04:07.360> look<00:04:07.600> pretty<00:04:07.870> awesome<00:04:08.049> and<00:04:08.470> I

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
still does look pretty awesome and I

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.920 
still does look pretty awesome and I
like<00:04:08.920> how<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.070> farms<00:04:09.549> are<00:04:09.700> like<00:04:09.880> branched<00:04:10.810> off

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
like how the farms are like branched off

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.479 
like how the farms are like branched off
like<00:04:11.170> that<00:04:11.320> some<00:04:11.500> buildings<00:04:11.650> on<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.010> top<00:04:12.220> some

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
like that some buildings on the top some
