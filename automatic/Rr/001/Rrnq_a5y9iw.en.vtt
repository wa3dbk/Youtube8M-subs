 here is shown your 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:15.589
 and therefore in her evaluation 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.869

 if we carry on the action so the ball does not like to make the ball 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.450
 procedure 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.870
 he is doing 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.550
 he goes into 800 mode, so we can farm the record from here. 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.040

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.220
 shut down cool drive in the shit with that on 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.180
 person wastes time that led to the 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.940
 So take this one with

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.480
 production is positive 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.730
 so click here I have to know that this is going to go 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.960
 delete completely on right to a certificate 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.960

 for you can put another 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.580
 so come on 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.580
 Let's stay here for some defendants. 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.820
 christensen

 So you'll turn it off and then go guys again. 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.470
 the mec is adding 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.059
 so he went into the motown watching 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:23.009

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.689
 the wheat states 72 done what we want 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.519

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:32.809
 and ready 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:35.809
 done this procedure we will come back here 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.359
 in the end i'm 32 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:44.529
 burn shows that our 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:47.529
 If you think ours is not 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:50.969
 and here below erect penis 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.789
 you here you can put 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:54.949
 the pivot Ã©rika 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:57.859
 10 am - but in case he had 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:02:59.759
 light 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:01.149
 the ideal spot 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:04.149
 the internet humor is a lot this law has 

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:07.199
 lp has tags 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:10.849
 I just say it's the same thing exa only that I think the most personal state 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.160
 talk like a triple 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.699
 Hear here in Brazil he has more or less 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:17.209
 It was this information I had 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.519
 peter staff 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.519
 with the card 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:25.400
 in season 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.969

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:28.519
 search here 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.519
 in the case of other information also people who 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:36.879
 so it is very valuable for iara rech that the staff explains to me more or less the 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:38.779
 respect 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:41.779
 our goal 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.069
 excuse me 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.519
 What did I do 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.519
 inside the folder donated 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.809
 I put 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.299
 in the case of the teacher the solution of the brain 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.109
 or because I thought that 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.109
 within this peace he said put this impasse 

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:10.269
 home of the nervous psychologist update because when you open the game in flash 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:14.770

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.219
 practically cost 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:18.019
 understood that he pulled 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.220
 the local power aice is her 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.499

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:28.259
 register here 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:33.689
 notice that the team is all that I am, it does not have a sea with a 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:35.099
 identification with him 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.099

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:51.360
 torres vedras 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.770
 I noticed that he was used to it. 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.770
 He already transferred 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.759
 Now, we're going back. 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.009
 erika here 10 32 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.249

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.830
 the clip is a myth await 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.169
 what some states 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:48.900

 It's a good boy for you now if it really works. 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:00.129
 so it's just people 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:02.979
