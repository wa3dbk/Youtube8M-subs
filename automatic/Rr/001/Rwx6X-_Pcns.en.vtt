00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
really not practical because the product

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.850 
really not practical because the product
only<00:00:47.879> lasted<00:00:48.390> three<00:00:48.540> days<00:00:48.780> without<00:00:49.409> adding

only lasted three days without adding
anything<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.940> four<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.239> us<00:00:51.329> learned

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
anything to it the four of us learned

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.040 
anything to it the four of us learned
about<00:00:51.839> high<00:00:52.079> pressure<00:00:52.350> processing<00:00:52.559> or<00:00:53.460> HBP

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
about high pressure processing or HBP

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.270 
about high pressure processing or HBP
and<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.290> we<00:00:55.379> could<00:00:55.559> run<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.890> products

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and that we could run the products

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.429 
and that we could run the products
through<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.460> machine<00:00:56.820> at<00:00:57.089> the<00:00:57.210> end<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.659> that

00:00:58.429 --> 00:00:58.439 
through a machine at the end and that

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:59.990 
through a machine at the end and that
would<00:00:58.710> give<00:00:58.860> it<00:00:58.890> about<00:00:59.040> 40<00:00:59.489> days<00:00:59.610> of<00:00:59.670> shelf

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
would give it about 40 days of shelf

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.939 
would give it about 40 days of shelf
life<00:01:00.119> without<00:01:00.720> affecting<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.439> nutritional

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.190 
content of the products and without
affecting<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.280> taste<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.780> began<00:01:07.140> to

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
affecting the taste so we began to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.499 
affecting the taste so we began to
launch<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.770> products<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.820> know<00:01:08.939> nationally
