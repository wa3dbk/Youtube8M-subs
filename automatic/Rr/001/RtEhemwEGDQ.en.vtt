I have checked over and over the little

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.620 
I have checked over and over the little
side<00:02:28.440> vibrate<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:30.610> does<00:02:30.790> go<00:02:30.970> on<00:02:31.120> vibrate<00:02:31.510> when

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
side vibrate it does go on vibrate when

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.210 
side vibrate it does go on vibrate when
I<00:02:31.690> put<00:02:31.930> it<00:02:32.020> there<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:34.620> tells<00:02:35.620> me<00:02:35.800> that<00:02:35.920> it's<00:02:36.099> on

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
I put it there and tells me that it's on

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.580 
I put it there and tells me that it's on
vibrate<00:02:36.430> turn<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.540> off<00:02:37.750> tells<00:02:38.200> me<00:02:38.349> it's<00:02:38.470> off

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
vibrate turn it off tells me it's off

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.170 
vibrate turn it off tells me it's off
vibrate<00:02:39.099> and<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.489> speaker<00:02:39.730> should<00:02:39.849> work

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
vibrate and that the speaker should work

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.250
