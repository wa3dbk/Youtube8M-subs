00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.850 

in<00:00:00.089> these<00:00:00.659> problems<00:00:01.140> we're<00:00:01.350> working<00:00:01.709> on

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
in these problems we're working on

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.010 
in these problems we're working on
calculating<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:02.939> surface<00:00:03.540> area<00:00:03.959> of

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
calculating the surface area of

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.690 
calculating the surface area of
rectangular<00:00:04.740> pyramids

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
rectangular pyramids

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.179 
rectangular pyramids
so<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.299> rectangular<00:00:06.899> pyramids<00:00:07.560> got<00:00:07.740> some<00:00:08.010> kind

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
so a rectangular pyramids got some kind

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.770 
so a rectangular pyramids got some kind
of<00:00:08.280> rectangular<00:00:08.760> square<00:00:09.150> down<00:00:09.420> at<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.630> bottom

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
of rectangular square down at the bottom

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.080 
of rectangular square down at the bottom
and<00:00:10.170> then<00:00:10.260> these<00:00:10.380> four<00:00:10.679> triangle<00:00:11.370> sides<00:00:11.730> or

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
and then these four triangle sides or

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.720 
and then these four triangle sides or
faces<00:00:12.630> so<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.650> calculate<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.219> surface<00:00:14.460> area

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
faces so to calculate the surface area

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.220 
faces so to calculate the surface area
we<00:00:15.030> want<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.299> figure<00:00:15.420> out<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.690> area<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:16.199> that

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
we want to figure out the area of that

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.230 
we want to figure out the area of that
rectangle<00:00:16.830> down<00:00:17.340> at<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.490> bottom<00:00:17.789> that's<00:00:18.000> not

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
rectangle down at the bottom that's not

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.150 
rectangle down at the bottom that's not
too<00:00:18.390> hard<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.810> then<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.350> area<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.920> each<00:00:20.130> of

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
too hard and then the area of each of

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.490 
too hard and then the area of each of
these<00:00:20.369> triangles<00:00:20.960> now<00:00:21.960> you'll<00:00:22.140> notice<00:00:22.289> in

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
these triangles now you'll notice in

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.679 
these triangles now you'll notice in
this<00:00:22.590> one<00:00:22.769> since<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.369> side<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.850> for<00:00:24.210> this

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
this one since this side is for this

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.929 
this one since this side is for this
side<00:00:24.930> over<00:00:25.109> here<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.380> going<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.619> be<00:00:25.710> four<00:00:26.010> so

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
side over here is going to be four so

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.359 
side over here is going to be four so
these<00:00:27.210> two<00:00:27.660> triangles<00:00:28.019> on<00:00:28.529> opposite<00:00:29.160> sides

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
these two triangles on opposite sides

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.950 
these two triangles on opposite sides
are<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.670> be<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.849> same<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.300> then<00:00:30.750> since

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
are going to be the same and then since

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.110 
are going to be the same and then since
this<00:00:31.170> side<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.500> eight<00:00:31.880> similarly<00:00:32.880> over<00:00:33.000> here

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
this side is eight similarly over here

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.819 
this side is eight similarly over here
it's<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.600> be<00:00:33.690> eight<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.320> these<00:00:34.590> two

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
it's going to be eight so these two

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.090 
it's going to be eight so these two
triangles<00:00:35.070> are<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.520> same<00:00:35.870> so<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.140> add<00:00:37.770> up<00:00:37.980> all

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
triangles are the same so to add up all

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.150 
triangles are the same so to add up all
the<00:00:38.190> pieces<00:00:38.370> here<00:00:38.730> we've<00:00:38.879> got<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.390> square<00:00:40.160> we've

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the pieces here we've got a square we've

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.490 
the pieces here we've got a square we've
got<00:00:41.309> two<00:00:41.550> skinny<00:00:41.989> triangles<00:00:42.989> with<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.200> four

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
got two skinny triangles with the four

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.779 
got two skinny triangles with the four
base<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.899> then<00:00:45.899> we've<00:00:46.050> got<00:00:46.200> two<00:00:46.980> wider

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
base and then we've got two wider

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.119 
base and then we've got two wider
triangles<00:00:48.420> with<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.570> eight<00:00:48.780> base<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.920> those

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
triangles with the eight base so those

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.799 
triangles with the eight base so those
are<00:00:50.280> all<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.579> things<00:00:50.610> where<00:00:51.180> we<00:00:51.360> have<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.570> find

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
are all the things where we have to find

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.959 
are all the things where we have to find
their<00:00:51.960> areas<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.320> then<00:00:52.620> add<00:00:52.800> them<00:00:53.129> together

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
their areas and then add them together

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.029 
their areas and then add them together
and<00:00:54.420> that's<00:00:54.719> going<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.079> give<00:00:55.199> us<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.530> total

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
and that's going to give us the total

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.660 
and that's going to give us the total
surface<00:00:56.969> area<00:00:57.680> well<00:00:58.680> let's<00:00:58.859> start<00:00:59.219> with<00:00:59.489> this

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
surface area well let's start with this

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.360 
surface area well let's start with this
rectangle<00:01:00.390> that's<00:01:00.480> pretty<00:01:00.870> easy<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.410> area<00:01:02.250> of

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
rectangle that's pretty easy the area of

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.460 
rectangle that's pretty easy the area of
a<00:01:02.430> rectangle<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.969> 4<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.480> length<00:01:04.019> times<00:01:04.290> width

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
a rectangle is 4 is length times width

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.679 
a rectangle is 4 is length times width
in<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.830> case<00:01:05.010> 4<00:01:05.250> times<00:01:05.489> 8<00:01:07.490> now<00:01:08.490> let's<00:01:09.119> go

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
in this case 4 times 8 now let's go

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.770 
in this case 4 times 8 now let's go
after<00:01:10.110> our<00:01:10.140> skinny<00:01:10.710> triangle<00:01:11.280> here<00:01:11.689> what<00:01:12.689> we

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
after our skinny triangle here what we

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.940 
after our skinny triangle here what we
need<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.049> figure<00:01:13.170> out<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> area<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.890> a

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
need to figure out the area of a

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.789 
need to figure out the area of a
triangle<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:17.729> base<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.930> height<00:01:18.960> now

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
triangle is the base and the height now

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.030 
triangle is the base and the height now
the<00:01:19.860> base<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.310> no<00:01:20.430> problem<00:01:20.790> we've<00:01:20.939> got<00:01:20.970> 4<00:01:21.619> so<00:01:22.619> so

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
the base is no problem we've got 4 so so

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.719 
the base is no problem we've got 4 so so
far<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.369> got<00:01:23.400> 1/2<00:01:24.200> 4<00:01:25.200> times<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.520> height

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
far we got 1/2 4 times but the height

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.929 
far we got 1/2 4 times but the height
here<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.479> want<00:01:28.130> something<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.579> goes<00:01:29.729> down

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
here we want something that goes down

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.840 
here we want something that goes down
like<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.479> forms<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.840> perpendicular<00:01:31.850> well

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
like this and forms a perpendicular well

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.969 
like this and forms a perpendicular well
to<00:01:33.090> figure<00:01:33.299> out<00:01:33.509> what<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.780> height<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.829> we're

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
to figure out what that height is we're

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.380 
to figure out what that height is we're
going<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.490> use<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> Pythagorean

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
going to have to use the Pythagorean

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.770 
going to have to use the Pythagorean
theorem<00:01:36.799> since<00:01:37.799> we're<00:01:38.210> bisecting<00:01:39.210> here<00:01:39.540> we

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
theorem since we're bisecting here we

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.499 
theorem since we're bisecting here we
can<00:01:40.020> assume<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.979> side<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.250> 2<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.030> this

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
can assume that this side is 2 and this

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.030 
can assume that this side is 2 and this
side<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.810> 2<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.409> we<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:43.680> look<00:01:43.799> at<00:01:43.920> this

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
side is 2 and we can look at this

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.300 
side is 2 and we can look at this
triangle<00:01:44.369> right<00:01:44.579> here<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.470> say<00:01:46.470> 2<00:01:46.890> squared

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
triangle right here and say 2 squared

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.060 
triangle right here and say 2 squared
plus<00:01:47.640> B<00:01:47.939> squared<00:01:47.970> equals<00:01:48.390> 8<00:01:48.869> squared<00:01:49.380> so

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
plus B squared equals 8 squared so

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.190 
plus B squared equals 8 squared so
that's<00:01:50.189> what<00:01:50.430> I'm<00:01:50.520> going<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:50.909> 2<00:01:51.659> squared

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
that's what I'm going to do 2 squared

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.429 
that's what I'm going to do 2 squared
plus<00:01:52.530> B<00:01:52.890> squared<00:01:53.490> equals<00:01:53.640> 8<00:01:54.090> squared<00:01:54.630> so

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
plus B squared equals 8 squared so

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.260 
plus B squared equals 8 squared so
that's<00:01:55.649> 4<00:01:56.250> plus<00:01:56.880> B<00:01:57.149> squared<00:01:57.719> equals<00:01:57.899> 64<00:01:59.000> so<00:02:00.000> B

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
that's 4 plus B squared equals 64 so B

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.959 
that's 4 plus B squared equals 64 so B
squared<00:02:00.869> equals<00:02:01.140> 60<00:02:02.009> after<00:02:02.670> I've<00:02:02.759> subtracted

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
squared equals 60 after I've subtracted

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.139 
squared equals 60 after I've subtracted
4<00:02:03.450> from<00:02:03.630> each<00:02:03.780> side<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.619> B<00:02:04.920> equals<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.790> square

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
4 from each side so B equals the square

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.029 
4 from each side so B equals the square
root<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.450> 60<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.079> that's<00:02:07.409> our<00:02:07.530> height<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:07.950> I'm

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
root of 60 and that's our height so I'm

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.650 
root of 60 and that's our height so I'm
going<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.220> put<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.550> up<00:02:08.670> here<00:02:08.940> square<00:02:09.629> root

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
going to put it in up here square root

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.220 
going to put it in up here square root
of<00:02:09.840> 60<00:02:10.849> so<00:02:11.849> that's<00:02:12.090> one<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.629> those<00:02:12.720> triangles

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
of 60 so that's one of those triangles

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.850 
of 60 so that's one of those triangles
and<00:02:13.319> remember<00:02:13.620> we

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
and remember we

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.760 
and remember we
two<00:02:14.160> on<00:02:14.400> opposite<00:02:14.850> sides<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.510> we've<00:02:15.690> got<00:02:15.930> 2

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
two on opposite sides so we've got 2

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.580 
two on opposite sides so we've got 2
times<00:02:17.750> 1/2<00:02:18.750> 4<00:02:19.680> times<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.520> square<00:02:20.790> root<00:02:20.820> of<00:02:20.940> 60

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
times 1/2 4 times the square root of 60

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.940 
times 1/2 4 times the square root of 60
all<00:02:22.590> right

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
all right

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.350 
all right
we've<00:02:23.100> only<00:02:23.190> got<00:02:23.370> two<00:02:23.550> triangles<00:02:24.000> left<00:02:24.180> these

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
we've only got two triangles left these

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.140 
we've only got two triangles left these
ones<00:02:25.080> with<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.650> 8-foot<00:02:26.430> basis<00:02:26.970> and

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
ones with that the 8-foot basis and

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.460 
ones with that the 8-foot basis and
again<00:02:27.630> we'll<00:02:28.760> split<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.360> half<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:31.350> we've

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
again we'll split this in half so we've

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.300 
again we'll split this in half so we've
got<00:02:31.590> 4<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.420> then<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.960> side<00:02:34.260> here<00:02:34.860> just<00:02:34.980> like

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
got 4 and then this side here just like

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.610 
got 4 and then this side here just like
this<00:02:35.760> side<00:02:35.940> here<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.270> going<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.540> be<00:02:36.600> 8<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.500> we've

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
this side here is going to be 8 so we've

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.050 
this side here is going to be 8 so we've
got<00:02:37.710> an<00:02:37.800> 8<00:02:38.070> there<00:02:38.840> for<00:02:39.840> 8<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:41.490> might<00:02:41.760> know

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
got an 8 there for 8 and you might know

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.260 
got an 8 there for 8 and you might know
that<00:02:42.770> when<00:02:43.770> you've<00:02:43.920> got<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.400> triangle<00:02:44.880> with<00:02:45.180> the

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
that when you've got a triangle with the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.360 
that when you've got a triangle with the
ratio<00:02:45.570> of<00:02:45.630> 1<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.320> other<00:02:46.620> side<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.160> going<00:02:47.310> to

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
ratio of 1 to the other side is going to

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.080 
ratio of 1 to the other side is going to
be<00:02:47.520> square<00:02:48.120> root<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.360> 3<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.490> so<00:02:50.490> that<00:02:50.760> the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
be square root of 3 and so that the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.729 
be square root of 3 and so that the
height<00:02:51.300> here<00:02:51.570> is<00:02:51.660> going<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.870> be<00:02:51.959> 4<00:02:52.290> times<00:02:52.530> the

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
height here is going to be 4 times the

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.610 
height here is going to be 4 times the
square<00:02:52.860> root<00:02:53.100> of<00:02:53.130> 3<00:02:53.660> you<00:02:54.660> can<00:02:54.840> also<00:02:55.020> just<00:02:55.410> use

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
square root of 3 you can also just use

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.570 
square root of 3 you can also just use
the<00:02:55.650> Pythagorean<00:02:55.890> theorem<00:02:56.700> again<00:02:57.270> and<00:02:57.540> say<00:02:58.580> 4

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
the Pythagorean theorem again and say 4

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.410 
the Pythagorean theorem again and say 4
squared<00:03:00.180> plus<00:03:00.690> B<00:03:00.989> squared<00:03:01.020> equals<00:03:01.770> 8<00:03:02.420> squared

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
squared plus B squared equals 8 squared

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.050 
squared plus B squared equals 8 squared
so<00:03:04.020> you<00:03:04.080> get<00:03:04.230> 16<00:03:04.709> plus<00:03:05.010> B<00:03:05.250> squared<00:03:05.640> equals<00:03:05.820> 64

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
so you get 16 plus B squared equals 64

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.410 
so you get 16 plus B squared equals 64
or<00:03:09.060> B<00:03:09.390> squared<00:03:09.870> equals<00:03:10.140> 48<00:03:10.820> B<00:03:11.820> equals<00:03:12.300> the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
or B squared equals 48 B equals the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.470 
or B squared equals 48 B equals the
square<00:03:12.540> root<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.989> 48<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:14.730> we'll<00:03:14.880> just<00:03:15.090> go

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
square root of 48 and we'll just go

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.300 
square root of 48 and we'll just go
ahead<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.870> use<00:03:15.989> that<00:03:16.020> either<00:03:16.739> way<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:17.190> would

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
ahead and use that either way it would

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.380 
ahead and use that either way it would
be<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.790> same<00:03:18.030> thing<00:03:18.360> and<00:03:19.940> so<00:03:20.940> this<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.299> going

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
be the same thing and so this is going

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.150 
be the same thing and so this is going
to<00:03:21.450> be<00:03:21.630> 2<00:03:22.049> times<00:03:22.470> 1/2<00:03:23.430> times<00:03:23.940> 8<00:03:24.530> times<00:03:25.530> the

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
to be 2 times 1/2 times 8 times the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.509 
to be 2 times 1/2 times 8 times the
square<00:03:26.970> root<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.570> 48

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
square root of 48

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.110 
square root of 48
all<00:03:29.519> right<00:03:29.640> I've<00:03:29.760> gotten<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.030> little

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
all right I've gotten a little

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.120 
all right I've gotten a little
complicated<00:03:30.330> a<00:03:30.900> little<00:03:31.140> crowded<00:03:31.560> in<00:03:31.769> here<00:03:31.830> but

add<00:04:01.799> all<00:04:02.100> of<00:04:02.130> those<00:04:02.400> together<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:03.299> I<00:04:04.110> get<00:04:04.260> one

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
add all of those together and I get one

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.930 
add all of those together and I get one
hundred<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.769> eighteen<00:04:05.220> point<00:04:06.090> four<00:04:06.510> four<00:04:07.410> and

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
hundred and eighteen point four four and

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.490 
hundred and eighteen point four four and
the<00:04:08.940> measurements<00:04:09.360> were<00:04:09.450> in<00:04:09.540> feet<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:10.079> this

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
the measurements were in feet and this

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.530 
the measurements were in feet and this
is<00:04:10.650> area<00:04:10.890> surface<00:04:11.459> area<00:04:11.700> for<00:04:11.970> you<00:04:12.090> so<00:04:12.239> it'll<00:04:12.450> be

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
is area surface area for you so it'll be

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.039 
is area surface area for you so it'll be
square<00:04:13.320> feet<00:04:14.269> all<00:04:15.269> right<00:04:15.329> that's<00:04:15.600> one<00:04:15.840> let's

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
square feet all right that's one let's

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.259 
square feet all right that's one let's
try<00:04:16.350> another<00:04:19.130> all<00:04:20.130> right<00:04:20.370> this<00:04:20.880> one's<00:04:21.090> pretty

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
try another all right this one's pretty

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.020 
try another all right this one's pretty
similar<00:04:21.800> again<00:04:22.800> we're<00:04:23.460> going<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:23.640> have<00:04:23.820> our

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
similar again we're going to have our

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.379 
similar again we're going to have our
square<00:04:24.539> we're<00:04:25.289> going<00:04:25.410> to<00:04:25.470> have<00:04:25.680> two<00:04:26.520> of<00:04:26.970> our

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
square we're going to have two of our

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.499 
square we're going to have two of our
our<00:04:28.039> triangles<00:04:29.039> with<00:04:29.159> the<00:04:29.280> space<00:04:29.879> of<00:04:30.090> six<00:04:30.860> and

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509 
our triangles with the space of six and

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:36.439 
our triangles with the space of six and
we're<00:04:33.509> going<00:04:33.629> to<00:04:33.689> have<00:04:34.069> two<00:04:35.069> of<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:35.939> triangles

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
we're going to have two of the triangles

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.860 
we're going to have two of the triangles
with<00:04:36.599> the<00:04:36.629> base<00:04:37.169> of<00:04:37.379> eight<00:04:37.529> and<00:04:38.689> once<00:04:39.689> again

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
with the base of eight and once again

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.779 
with the base of eight and once again
we'll<00:04:40.020> need<00:04:40.169> to<00:04:40.229> figure<00:04:40.499> out<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:41.219> heights<00:04:41.520> for

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
we'll need to figure out the heights for

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.610 
we'll need to figure out the heights for
these<00:04:42.060> triangles<00:04:42.569> so<00:04:43.020> that<00:04:43.199> we<00:04:43.319> can<00:04:43.469> figure

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
these triangles so that we can figure

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.920 
these triangles so that we can figure
out<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:43.979> area<00:04:44.009> when<00:04:44.999> I<00:04:45.029> drop<00:04:45.749> a<00:04:45.779> perpendicular

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
out the area when I drop a perpendicular

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.129 
out the area when I drop a perpendicular
here<00:04:46.590> what<00:04:47.460> I<00:04:47.490> get<00:04:47.759> is<00:04:47.939> sides<00:04:48.449> of<00:04:48.629> three<00:04:48.930> and

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
here what I get is sides of three and

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:49.700 
here what I get is sides of three and
ten

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
ten

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.499 
ten
so<00:04:50.009> if<00:04:50.099> I<00:04:50.219> were<00:04:50.969> to<00:04:51.029> use<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.330> Pythagorean

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
so if I were to use the Pythagorean

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.260 
so if I were to use the Pythagorean
theorem<00:04:52.080> I'd<00:04:52.319> say<00:04:52.499> three<00:04:52.770> squared<00:04:53.159> plus<00:04:53.370> B

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
theorem I'd say three squared plus B

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.489 
theorem I'd say three squared plus B
squared<00:04:54.300> equals<00:04:54.990> ten<00:04:55.590> at<00:04:55.860> ten<00:04:56.129> squared<00:04:56.550> and<00:04:57.499> B

00:04:58.489 --> 00:04:58.499 
squared equals ten at ten squared and B

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:59.899 
squared equals ten at ten squared and B
squared<00:04:58.529> would<00:04:59.129> equal

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
squared would equal

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:02.360 
squared would equal
let's<00:05:00.180> see<00:05:00.330> 100<00:05:00.779> minus<00:05:01.229> nine<00:05:01.439> would<00:05:01.680> be<00:05:01.800> ninety

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
let's see 100 minus nine would be ninety

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.760 
let's see 100 minus nine would be ninety
one<00:05:02.699> so<00:05:03.300> B<00:05:03.599> would<00:05:03.990> equal<00:05:04.259> the<00:05:04.379> square<00:05:04.500> root<00:05:04.740> of

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
one so B would equal the square root of

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.409 
one so B would equal the square root of
91<00:05:05.219> or<00:05:05.460> about<00:05:05.939> nine<00:05:06.240> point<00:05:06.509> five<00:05:06.689> four<00:05:08.419> so

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
91 or about nine point five four so

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.189 
91 or about nine point five four so
that's<00:05:09.599> for<00:05:09.900> one<00:05:10.080> triangle<00:05:11.120> let's<00:05:12.120> let's<00:05:12.659> go

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
that's for one triangle let's let's go

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.629 
that's for one triangle let's let's go
ahead<00:05:13.259> and<00:05:13.469> put<00:05:13.620> in<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:13.889> formula<00:05:14.310> for<00:05:14.520> the

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
ahead and put in the formula for the

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.909 
ahead and put in the formula for the
area<00:05:14.939> so<00:05:15.090> we've<00:05:15.240> got<00:05:15.360> two<00:05:15.569> times<00:05:15.930> one<00:05:16.620> half<00:05:16.770> the

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
area so we've got two times one half the

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.719 
area so we've got two times one half the
base<00:05:17.219> which<00:05:17.909> is<00:05:17.939> six<00:05:18.529> times<00:05:19.529> the<00:05:20.250> height<00:05:20.460> which

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
base which is six times the height which

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.309 
base which is six times the height which
we<00:05:21.029> just<00:05:21.300> figured<00:05:21.539> out<00:05:21.599> now<00:05:21.750> is<00:05:21.900> nine<00:05:22.050> point

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
we just figured out now is nine point

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.469 
we just figured out now is nine point
five<00:05:22.500> four<00:05:22.889> all<00:05:23.759> right<00:05:23.789> let's<00:05:24.060> work<00:05:24.210> on<00:05:24.389> the

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
five four all right let's work on the

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.510 
five four all right let's work on the
triangle<00:05:24.870> with<00:05:24.960> a<00:05:25.020> base<00:05:25.139> of<00:05:25.199> eight<00:05:25.560> so

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
triangle with a base of eight so

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.670 
triangle with a base of eight so
dropping<00:05:27.089> a<00:05:27.210> perpendicular<00:05:27.659> there<00:05:28.349> I<00:05:28.379> get

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
dropping a perpendicular there I get

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.709 
dropping a perpendicular there I get
sides<00:05:28.919> of<00:05:29.099> four<00:05:29.400> and<00:05:29.699> well<00:05:30.180> this<00:05:30.360> side<00:05:30.599> is

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 
sides of four and well this side is

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:32.360 
sides of four and well this side is
going<00:05:30.870> to<00:05:30.930> be<00:05:30.990> ten<00:05:31.259> because<00:05:31.589> this<00:05:31.830> side<00:05:32.009> is<00:05:32.129> 10

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
going to be ten because this side is 10

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.709 
going to be ten because this side is 10
four<00:05:33.240> and<00:05:33.479> ten<00:05:33.719> so<00:05:34.289> I<00:05:34.349> get<00:05:34.650> 4<00:05:35.550> squared<00:05:36.029> plus<00:05:36.449> B

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
four and ten so I get 4 squared plus B

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:40.219 
four and ten so I get 4 squared plus B
squared<00:05:36.750> equals<00:05:37.529> ten<00:05:38.039> squared<00:05:39.029> let's<00:05:39.960> see<00:05:40.110> one

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
squared equals ten squared let's see one

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.649 
squared equals ten squared let's see one
hundred<00:05:40.439> minus<00:05:40.909> 16<00:05:41.909> and<00:05:41.939> we're<00:05:42.360> going<00:05:42.479> to<00:05:42.509> have

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
hundred minus 16 and we're going to have

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:47.149 
hundred minus 16 and we're going to have
B<00:05:42.960> squared<00:05:42.990> equals<00:05:43.649> 84<00:05:44.430> and<00:05:45.740> that's<00:05:46.740> about

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159 
B squared equals 84 and that's about

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:52.040 
B squared equals 84 and that's about
nine<00:05:48.089> point<00:05:48.479> one<00:05:48.599> seven<00:05:49.789> so<00:05:50.789> this<00:05:51.300> is<00:05:51.509> two

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
nine point one seven so this is two

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.309 
nine point one seven so this is two
times<00:05:53.870> one<00:05:54.870> half<00:05:55.229> the<00:05:56.099> base<00:05:56.129> which<00:05:56.610> is<00:05:56.759> eight

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 
times one half the base which is eight

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:59.689 
times one half the base which is eight
times<00:05:58.319> the<00:05:58.649> height<00:05:58.770> nine<00:05:59.069> point<00:05:59.339> one<00:05:59.399> seven

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
times the height nine point one seven

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.329 
times the height nine point one seven
and<00:06:00.020> then<00:06:01.020> of<00:06:01.110> course<00:06:01.139> our<00:06:01.500> rectangle<00:06:02.219> on<00:06:02.279> the

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:02.339 
and then of course our rectangle on the

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:05.300 
and then of course our rectangle on the
bottom<00:06:02.580> is<00:06:02.699> just<00:06:02.729> six<00:06:03.120> times<00:06:03.360> eight<00:06:03.599> and<00:06:04.310> we

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
bottom is just six times eight and we

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.719 
bottom is just six times eight and we
add<00:06:05.490> all<00:06:05.819> these<00:06:06.000> guys<00:06:06.270> together<00:06:07.009> so<00:06:08.009> 6<00:06:08.310> times<00:06:08.490> 8

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
add all these guys together so 6 times 8

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:13.429 
add all these guys together so 6 times 8
is<00:06:08.759> 48<00:06:10.310> this<00:06:11.310> one<00:06:11.520> comes<00:06:11.819> out<00:06:12.000> to<00:06:12.439> fifty-seven

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:13.439
