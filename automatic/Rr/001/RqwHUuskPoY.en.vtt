good<00:00:31.880> let's<00:00:32.689> get<00:00:32.900> started<00:00:33.290> first<00:00:33.740> time<00:00:33.890> you're

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
good let's get started first time you're

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.070 
good let's get started first time you're
meeting<00:00:34.100> is<00:00:34.430> a<00:00:34.490> forward<00:00:34.820> backward<00:00:35.150> lunge<00:00:35.690> this

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.080 
meeting is a forward backward lunge this

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.960 
meeting is a forward backward lunge this
is<00:00:36.230> how<00:00:36.320> it's<00:00:36.440> gonna<00:00:36.530> work<00:00:36.650> a<00:00:37.040> normal<00:00:37.820> line

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
is how it's gonna work a normal line

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.790 
is how it's gonna work a normal line
which<00:00:38.150> just<00:00:38.390> typically<00:00:38.660> goes<00:00:38.900> forward<00:00:39.650> like

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
which just typically goes forward like

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.740 
which just typically goes forward like
so<00:00:40.070> what<00:00:40.850> we're<00:00:41.030> going<00:00:41.150> to<00:00:41.180> do<00:00:41.300> today<00:00:41.540> is<00:00:41.720> a

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
so what we're going to do today is a

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.660 
so what we're going to do today is a
forward<00:00:42.080> and<00:00:42.320> backwards<00:00:42.800> lunge<00:00:42.950> in<00:00:43.250> that<00:00:43.520> we

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
forward and backwards lunge in that we

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.990 
forward and backwards lunge in that we
go<00:00:43.820> forwards<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:44.600> then<00:00:45.140> rate<00:00:45.530> into<00:00:46.460> backwards

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
go forwards and then rate into backwards

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.780 
go forwards and then rate into backwards
on<00:00:47.240> the<00:00:47.660> same<00:00:47.870> leg<00:00:48.110> if<00:00:48.500> you<00:00:48.950> need<00:00:49.310> to<00:00:49.400> stop<00:00:49.640> in

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
on the same leg if you need to stop in

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.940 
on the same leg if you need to stop in
the<00:00:49.850> middle<00:00:49.880> you<00:00:50.180> can<00:00:50.210> do<00:00:50.450> so<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:51.080> then<00:00:51.770> work

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
the middle you can do so and then work

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.680 
the middle you can do so and then work
backwards<00:00:52.220> the<00:00:52.580> key<00:00:52.790> is<00:00:52.940> getting<00:00:53.090> next<00:00:53.390> long

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
backwards the key is getting next long

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.320 
backwards the key is getting next long
lunge<00:00:54.100> so<00:00:55.100> that<00:00:55.250> the<00:00:55.370> media<00:00:55.610> does<00:00:55.730> not<00:00:55.760> go<00:00:56.060> past

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
lunge so that the media does not go past

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.870 
lunge so that the media does not go past
the<00:00:56.480> toe<00:00:56.770> so<00:00:57.770> I<00:00:57.800> like<00:00:58.130> to<00:00:58.160> just<00:00:58.280> do<00:00:58.520> it<00:00:58.640> nice<00:00:58.850> and
