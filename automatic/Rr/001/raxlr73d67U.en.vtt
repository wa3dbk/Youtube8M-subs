 I'm creeper but 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:28.180
 There are some enemies that are very annoying because they explode, but after all they are very cute 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:31.039
 I do not think that it is a character with attachment, but this time it is a bit equivalent to the creeper 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.780
 To I think let's take a walk a 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.630
 However if you only take it for a walk 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:42.750
 I think something is not enough 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:47.610
 3 putt probably the only also say I unsatisfactory is this why and will end soon 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:52.640

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:03.079
 What you will find a more almost like escape is eliminated as the name that it was brain death 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.280
 It is funny that there is no escape, and it is funny 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:11.450
 Specific Mog ai but is What Truly I'm be strengthened, for example, of 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.659
 I think there are zombies, so zombies usually break blocks or block myself 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.630
 Stacked and expensive 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:22.450
 I will follow you to the end 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.140
