00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.390 
simple as a custom button remapping
which<00:02:34.580> is<00:02:34.819> just<00:02:35.540> ridiculous<00:02:36.220> they<00:02:37.220> actually

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
which is just ridiculous they actually

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.430 
which is just ridiculous they actually
there<00:02:38.360> was<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.510> thing<00:02:38.870> about<00:02:39.049> it<00:02:39.319> they're

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
there was a thing about it they're

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.170 
there was a thing about it they're
talking<00:02:39.860> about<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.430> read<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.730> article

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
talking about it and I read the article

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.720 
talking about it and I read the article
and<00:02:41.360> they<00:02:42.260> said<00:02:42.500> there's<00:02:42.769> a<00:02:42.799> lot<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.040> bugs<00:02:43.400> from

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
and they said there's a lot of bugs from

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.729 
and they said there's a lot of bugs from
switches<00:02:44.299> and<00:02:44.690> they<00:02:44.900> think<00:02:45.290> it's<00:02:45.470> going<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:45.680> be

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
switches and they think it's going to be

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.170 
switches and they think it's going to be
exploited<00:02:46.640> if<00:02:46.819> they<00:02:47.329> do<00:02:47.390> that<00:02:47.780> so<00:02:49.180> that's

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
exploited if they do that so that's

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.000 
exploited if they do that so that's
probably<00:02:50.480> going<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.720> be<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.870> no-go<00:02:51.319> it<00:02:51.590> more

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
probably going to be a no-go it more

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.740 
probably going to be a no-go it more
likely<00:02:52.250> they're<00:02:52.670> never<00:02:52.880> going<00:02:53.090> to<00:02:53.180> do<00:02:53.390> custom

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
likely they're never going to do custom

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.940 
likely they're never going to do custom
button<00:02:54.350> remapping<00:02:55.630> her<00:02:56.630> I<00:02:56.660> really<00:02:57.290> hope<00:02:57.680> that

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
button remapping her I really hope that

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.710 
button remapping her I really hope that
maybe<00:02:58.340> they<00:02:58.609> can<00:02:58.760> get<00:02:58.910> like<00:02:59.120> a<00:02:59.150> team<00:02:59.510> together

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720

really<00:04:05.510> don't<00:04:05.720> think<00:04:05.810> it's<00:04:06.260> gonna<00:04:06.410> cause<00:04:07.280> a

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
really don't think it's gonna cause a

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.819 
really don't think it's gonna cause a
big<00:04:07.849> problem<00:04:07.989> yeah<00:04:08.989> there<00:04:09.170> might<00:04:09.290> be<00:04:09.349> a<00:04:09.500> few

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
big problem yeah there might be a few

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.699 
big problem yeah there might be a few
people<00:04:10.340> that<00:04:10.370> you<00:04:11.030> know<00:04:11.180> might<00:04:11.959> exploit<00:04:12.530> it

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
people that you know might exploit it

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.400 
people that you know might exploit it
but<00:04:13.129> that<00:04:13.519> is<00:04:13.700> just<00:04:13.730> a<00:04:14.180> few<00:04:14.599> people<00:04:15.140> out<00:04:15.379> of

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
but that is just a few people out of

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.390 
but that is just a few people out of
like<00:04:16.120> millions<00:04:17.169> that<00:04:18.169> could<00:04:18.380> benefit<00:04:18.889> from<00:04:18.950> it

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
like millions that could benefit from it

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.969 
like millions that could benefit from it
and<00:04:19.609> I<00:04:20.539> really<00:04:21.079> think<00:04:21.260> there's<00:04:21.530> millions<00:04:21.739> of

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
and I really think there's millions of

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.560 
and I really think there's millions of
people<00:04:22.250> who<00:04:22.310> could<00:04:22.340> benefit<00:04:22.850> from<00:04:22.910> it<00:04:23.270> to<00:04:23.449> be

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
people who could benefit from it to be

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.890 
people who could benefit from it to be
honest<00:04:23.960> I<00:04:24.199> mean<00:04:25.300> there's<00:04:26.300> a<00:04:26.389> lot<00:04:26.450> of<00:04:26.600> people

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
honest I mean there's a lot of people

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.260 
honest I mean there's a lot of people
that<00:04:27.050> just<00:04:27.080> don't<00:04:27.470> even<00:04:27.889> like<00:04:28.160> Xbox<00:04:28.789> because

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
that just don't even like Xbox because

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.629 
that just don't even like Xbox because
the<00:04:29.539> good<00:04:29.930> controls<00:04:30.380> the<00:04:30.680> configuration<00:04:31.490> on

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
the good controls the configuration on

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.690 
the good controls the configuration on
the<00:04:32.450> buttons<00:04:33.139> are<00:04:33.289> flick<00:04:34.039> they're<00:04:34.310> not<00:04:34.430> used

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
the buttons are flick they're not used

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.600 
the buttons are flick they're not used
to<00:04:34.880> it<00:04:35.000> so<00:04:35.210> they<00:04:35.330> have<00:04:35.479> to<00:04:35.630> adjust<00:04:36.050> so<00:04:36.919> you<00:04:37.490> know

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
to it so they have to adjust so you know

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.029 
to it so they have to adjust so you know
their<00:04:38.060> timing<00:04:38.630> or<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:38.930> reactions<00:04:39.800> are<00:04:40.010> a

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
their timing or the reactions are a

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.250 
their timing or the reactions are a
little<00:04:40.190> bit<00:04:40.430> off<00:04:40.610> yeah<00:04:41.510> you<00:04:41.570> can<00:04:41.990> you<00:04:42.110> know

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
little bit off yeah you can you know

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.980 
little bit off yeah you can you know
work<00:04:42.979> into<00:04:43.430> it<00:04:43.460> and<00:04:43.760> over<00:04:44.479> time<00:04:44.690> you're<00:04:44.960> going

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
work into it and over time you're going

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.300 
work into it and over time you're going
to<00:04:45.169> progress<00:04:45.410> and<00:04:45.889> you're<00:04:46.010> going<00:04:46.099> to<00:04:46.190> get

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
to progress and you're going to get

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.640 
to progress and you're going to get
better<00:04:46.490> at<00:04:46.639> it<00:04:46.789> which<00:04:47.330> is<00:04:47.570> like<00:04:47.780> anything<00:04:48.500> else

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
better at it which is like anything else

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.550 
better at it which is like anything else
but<00:04:49.780> it's<00:04:50.780> just<00:04:50.990> it<00:04:51.139> would<00:04:51.229> be<00:04:51.349> more

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
but it's just it would be more

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.409 
but it's just it would be more
convenient<00:04:52.010> for<00:04:52.220> people<00:04:52.490> to<00:04:52.849> select<00:04:53.270> their

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
convenient for people to select their

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.170 
convenient for people to select their
button<00:04:53.780> layout<00:04:54.080> to<00:04:54.320> what<00:04:54.500> they<00:04:54.620> want

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
button layout to what they want

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.909 
button layout to what they want
hopefully<00:04:56.180> i<00:04:56.210> get<00:04:56.389> my<00:04:56.630> custom<00:04:57.169> controller<00:04:57.620> for

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
hopefully i get my custom controller for

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.490 
hopefully i get my custom controller for
xbox<00:04:58.039> and<00:04:58.729> i<00:04:59.479> think<00:04:59.720> i'll<00:04:59.840> probably<00:05:00.050> get<00:05:00.260> i'm

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
xbox and i think i'll probably get i'm

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.890 
xbox and i think i'll probably get i'm
hoping<00:05:01.010> to<00:05:01.070> get<00:05:01.340> that<00:05:01.550> actually<00:05:02.060> tomorrow<00:05:02.270> i

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
hoping to get that actually tomorrow i

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.170 
hoping to get that actually tomorrow i

some<00:05:35.480> money<00:05:35.690> on<00:05:35.780> that<00:05:35.990> damn<00:05:36.230> thing<00:05:36.530> hopefully

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
some money on that damn thing hopefully

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.400 
some money on that damn thing hopefully
it's<00:05:37.160> worth<00:05:37.220> it<00:05:37.610> because<00:05:38.080> basically<00:05:39.080> what<00:05:39.380> I

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
it's worth it because basically what I

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.000 
it's worth it because basically what I
did<00:05:39.530> I<00:05:39.770> a<00:05:40.430> reverse<00:05:41.270> the<00:05:41.650> trigger<00:05:42.650> buttons

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
did I a reverse the trigger buttons

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.250 
did I a reverse the trigger buttons
instead<00:05:43.730> of<00:05:43.940> the<00:05:44.120> being<00:05:44.600> you<00:05:44.630> know<00:05:44.870> aim<00:05:45.110> and

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
instead of the being you know aim and

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.300 
instead of the being you know aim and
shoot<00:05:45.350> it's<00:05:45.800> going<00:05:46.010> to<00:05:46.040> be<00:05:46.160> the<00:05:46.280> bumpers<00:05:46.700> so

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
shoot it's going to be the bumpers so

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.130 
shoot it's going to be the bumpers so
hopefully<00:05:49.310> that<00:05:49.520> benefits<00:05:50.060> me<00:05:50.180> I'm<00:05:50.720> sure<00:05:50.960> it

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.140 
hopefully that benefits me I'm sure it

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.840 
hopefully that benefits me I'm sure it
will<00:05:52.570> the<00:05:53.570> map<00:05:53.780> pack<00:05:53.990> came<00:05:54.260> out<00:05:54.440> on<00:05:54.710> ps3<00:05:55.130> so

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
will the map pack came out on ps3 so

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.470 
will the map pack came out on ps3 so
zombie<00:05:56.360> is<00:05:56.480> called<00:05:56.780> a<00:05:56.930> dead<00:05:57.170> and<00:05:58.180> the<00:05:59.180> the

zombie is called a dead and the the

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.930 
zombie is called a dead and the the
first<00:05:59.780> first<00:06:00.620> time<00:06:00.710> playing<00:06:01.190> I<00:06:01.430> got<00:06:01.640> to<00:06:01.760> round

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940
