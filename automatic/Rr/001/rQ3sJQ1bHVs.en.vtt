and so I'm going to do a video on the
best<00:00:36.510> plug-ins<00:00:37.020> for<00:00:37.500> your<00:00:38.190> server<00:00:38.670> for<00:00:39.120> your

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
best plug-ins for your server for your

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.160 
best plug-ins for your server for your
basic<00:00:39.899> server<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.550> create<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.930> let's

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
basic server that you create so let's

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.250 
basic server that you create so let's
start<00:00:43.640> it's<00:00:44.640> what<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.850> also<00:00:45.480> use<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.110> there's

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
start it's what I also use and there's

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.860 
start it's what I also use and there's
12<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.800> them<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.400> this<00:00:48.060> can<00:00:48.690> start<00:00:49.050> working<00:00:49.860> on

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
12 of them so this can start working on

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.760 
12 of them so this can start working on
one<00:00:51.870> gigabyte<00:00:52.230> servers<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:53.480> and<00:00:54.480> that's<00:00:55.260> bait

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
one gigabyte servers I and that's bait

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.819 
one gigabyte servers I and that's bait
that<00:00:56.130> one<00:00:56.520> gigabyte<00:00:56.850> server<00:00:57.150> is<00:00:57.360> basic<00:00:57.900> so<00:00:58.230> you

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
that one gigabyte server is basic so you

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.770 
that one gigabyte server is basic so you
should<00:00:59.010> use<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.910> best<00:01:00.149> one<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.600> probably

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
should use this the best one is probably

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.830 
should use this the best one is probably

they add I let commands and they help
you<00:01:15.570> set<00:01:15.750> spawns<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.560> then<00:01:17.189> also<00:01:17.399> we<00:01:17.820> have

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
you set spawns and then also we have

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:19.760 
you set spawns and then also we have
factions<00:01:18.420> here<00:01:18.659> but<00:01:18.899> to<00:01:18.990> run<00:01:19.140> factions<00:01:19.650> you

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
factions here but to run factions you

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.980 
factions here but to run factions you
have<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.549> massive<00:01:21.420> core<00:01:21.780> which

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
have to have a massive core which

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
everything around 10 minutes every 10

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.890 
everything around 10 minutes every 10
minutes<00:03:22.650> aves<00:03:23.159> so<00:03:23.940> if<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.180> mess<00:03:24.389> up<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:24.870> can
