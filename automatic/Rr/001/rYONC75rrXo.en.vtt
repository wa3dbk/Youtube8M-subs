00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.270
 Hello 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.770
 Today I'll give you a little something 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.150
 About masks tell the final 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.679
 the most important pieces of equipment 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.779
 paintball protects the eyes and the 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.970
 that's what paintball really is 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.250
 Endangered is at the end of the day before 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.869
 All eyes meet a paintball 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.269
 the eyes are the eyesight in the eyes 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.950
 then see it over with it 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.230
 then nothing more so you are good 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.880
 The money for a mask done on it 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.920
 to invest well in any case so that you 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.660
 are you what he wants to or should buy 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.030
 I want you a little something today 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.730
 We start to talk about it in the bottom 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.950
 segment at the very simple beginner 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.100
 Mask in the case I take now 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.780
 an example of proto the switch gl 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.710
 Ultimately, every manufacturer has 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.970
 each of a brand-name manufacturers 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.120
 entry-level model and they differ 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.950
 All of them are marginal 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.620
 do it all at the end of the day 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.790
 by a very hard shield this has 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.220
 a very good ventilation because of that 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.509
 we also recommend it 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.130
 she has a very large field of vision there 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.600
 Many masks differ 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.370
 some masks have much smaller ones 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.750
 Field of view in the area you have in 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.250
 usually all sun shield here too 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.930
 the proto is a bit again 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.880
 significantly better than any other she has 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.230
 a relatively soft foam what 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.540
 a very high wearing comfort out 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.159
 she calls and she only has a one-walled one 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.530
 normal plastic glass 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.300
 so that does not fog up immediately 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.680
 Do it from the back with an anti fog 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.750
 solutions of the so-called 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.000
 spraying that is ultimately nothing 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.620
 other than an anti fog two three 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Let splash on it easily 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.010
 and then a polish yes those are the 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.630
 Beginners masks always cost something 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.030
 so between 25 and 30 euros 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.490
 in the case with us in the 28 90 for the 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.140
 switches very good mask what i at the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.690
 very nice is you can for 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.160
 narrow money so around the 20 25 euro 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.420
 like me a very good topic gas from 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.920
 Proto can buy this easily 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.050
 use and ultimately has such a 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.430
 medium between something better mask 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.300
 And just the entry-level models for it 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.000
 but not much money 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.979
 output 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.989
 nothing else is ultimately the 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.640
 Defusing brands also the 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.770
 is characterized by the fact that they already 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.420
 from the front home outside thermals in there 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.580
 has a double-walled it is 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.900
 works so that outside glass and that 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.800
 inside lars are glued on each other 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.450
 through this membrane visible here 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.220
 circulated separately from each other 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.750
 the air thereby fog these glasses 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.010
 it's not that much less 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.480
 they do not fog anymore, especially 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.780
 in extreme situations, each one fogs up 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.890
 mask but they fog clearly 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.930
 slower or less often you like it too 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.940
 want to express here is an example 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.160
 man had no foam but 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.570
 relatively hard foam rubber is not like that 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.100
 particularly high wearing comfort 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.310
 but we're still in there too 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.760
 entry-level segment at the mask with 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.330
 clear glass we are at 32 to 35 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.730
 Euro 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.100
 the same segment covers the helix of 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.010
 empire off she has greater protection 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.780
 as the elevation of beams also here 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.640
 again a very good topic glass 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.670
 one recognizes again simply at the 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.070
 Membrane here is a special feature 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.750
 is the good in the glass of the event of 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.640
 one of the most expensive masks of empire 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.810
 there are the same glasses in it 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.280
 is a very good work of the 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.180
 thermal systems very very well protected 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.180
 is again a relatively hard here 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.489
 Foam for something more comfortable 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.440
 but it is very very comprehensive 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.940
 good protection 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.860
 we come to one of our main goals 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.620
 simply because the mask in her 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.760
 price segment has outstanding sales data 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.030
 it is 44 to 44 90 so far 49 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.490
 90 depending on the color variant 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.400
 black and gray cost 44 90 the chamber 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.930
 variant 49 90 she has data from 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.959
 Ultimately a professional mask you have 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.730
 man had very rich from that though 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.920
 Ballauf also true love away again 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.510
 Baumann had oversized good 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.340
 ventilation is very good 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.600
 not to recognize the theme of glass here so well 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.940
 here on the edge you can see the therme 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.370
 membrane but the glass is very very good 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.080
 protected and so that's not really there 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.610
 what can happen the glass is very 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.920
 very easy to change 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.810
 about a very simple system in here 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.940
 in the mask one has a very very 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.310
 soft foam which is very very high 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.720
 wearing comfort calls out and again 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.810
 the obligatory sunscreen 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.669
 These are all final data from 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.190
 Masks that are significantly more expensive in the professional 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.880
 Siekmann against and so between 1825 euro 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.700
 costs 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.500
 the gross fs from the switch series 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.390
 The whole offers just under 50 euros 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.750
 One can only recommend is with us in 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.330
 home one of the best selling mask 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.250
 thus to the mentioned profi masks 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.229
 there are many manufacturers 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.690
 We now have it here at home 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:46.140
 the series of ihf her a very very 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.840
 good mask the absolute the high end 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.479
 Model from the home at Werder knows 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.169
 knows there is quality and precision 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.850
 behind here as well as the protoss 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.229
 tinchev eat very soft frame like that 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.710
 that also balls away again build 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.100
 can 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.990
 a very light ear part but what 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.000
 still protects the ears well and the 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.669
 Noise well filters very soft 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.530
 Foam very very very very big 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.810
 field of view here again with the 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.850
 Thermal thermal membrane and mask 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.229
 relatively specific very easy too 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.390
 changing masts glass you have to give them 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:19.500
 The unlocking can click it 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.880
 then pull inside and then you can 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.500
 the mass sheet very very quickly after 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.080
 Take out is actually the outside 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.370
 Mask at the fastest way 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.110
 There is still a thing that exists 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.850
 no sunscreen at the 4 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.370
 Therefore, says the tournament players 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.530
 do not need something like this is one of the 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.220
 most popular masks in the leagues top 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:40.580
 mask so between 100 and 125 euro each 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.580
 after execution 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:47.430
 Lastly, I want to give you the flex 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:50.940
 introduce the new big sister of 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:54.060
 the impala event is a hybrid of the 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.789
 formerly cat pro flex series and just that 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.810
 Empire event last year on the 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:01.259
 market was brought 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.539
 in the lower part it is a mask of 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:05.270
 Jackie in the upper area is the area 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:07.500
 event of empire 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.729
 i find very very good second me 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.979
 I bought you myself last year 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:12.900
 is a great mask wears great 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:15.539
 only a disadvantage it is relatively thin fun 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.550
 again very warmly scary here 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:19.080
 good ventilation here in the 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:23.699
 next time also changeable 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:25.320
 come out so you can open each one up 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:27.240
 the face size can adjust what i like 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.580
 also very great find the great great 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.979
 glass of the event or confess what 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.630
 just from the helix in the trap 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:35.580
 again a special feature on publishers 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.900
 foam really really 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.430
 You can not really get that soft 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.190
 show but that is one of the best 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.840
 I have been wearing it in tampa so far 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.000
 experienced masks really sits 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.220
 oversized here again 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.770
 light provided with grids of 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:53.340
 ear protection the mask is really great 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:56.370
 I like to wear them very much 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.710
 recommend so around the 120 125 euro 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.180
 again depending on the version 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.830
 yes and that is ultimately one 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.729
 ramble through the masks world been 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.419
 sometimes from cheap to expensive 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:08.190
 you decide for yourself what he is 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:11.070
 use can only listen to the 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:13.650
 is a good manufacturer is you should 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:15.090
 on the double-walled stars made if 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.229
 wanted to buy cheaper because he 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.169
 not enough money in the first step 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:21.000
 has bought you systems like the switche l 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:22.620
 I have shown you in detail as 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.880
 you can afterwards the therme sa 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.310
 retrofit so that does not equal one 

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.050
 new mask is there and always on it 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.729
 think mask on what really 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.900
 endangered are the eyes and then 

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:31.979
 do you always have fun I wish 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.070
 Have a nice day until the next 

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:34.070
 times
