00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
improved the most evening yeah I mean I

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.130 
improved the most evening yeah I mean I
just<00:00:45.350> just<00:00:46.350> know<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.950> offense<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:48.140> second

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
just just know in the offense and second

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.380 
just just know in the offense and second
year<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.590> feel<00:00:49.860> like<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.760> gotta<00:00:50.969> even<00:00:51.300> go

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
year in it feel like you gotta even go

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.630 
year in it feel like you gotta even go
out<00:00:51.510> then<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.780> kind<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:51.989> know<00:00:52.110> what<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.469> do<00:00:52.640> and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.180 
out then you kind of know what to do and
I<00:00:53.789> think<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.030> helps<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:54.960> play<00:00:55.230> play

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.910 
I think that helps you can play play
free<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.789> not<00:00:57.210> be<00:00:57.420> worried<00:00:58.350> about<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.559> thousand

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
free and not be worried about a thousand

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.049 
free and not be worried about a thousand
different<00:00:58.980> things<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.520> have<00:00:59.670> one<00:00:59.850> time

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
guys for the months that we were

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.210 
guys for the months that we were
together<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.500> then<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.620> good<00:03:04.800> five<00:03:04.980> weeks

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220

after<00:03:05.520> that<00:03:05.700> so<00:03:06.050> it's<00:03:07.050> been<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.290> perfect<00:03:07.650> setup

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
after that so it's been a perfect setup

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.370 
after that so it's been a perfect setup
and<00:03:08.280> just<00:03:08.940> want<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.150> keep<00:03:09.239> growing<00:03:09.510> Robert

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
get practicing against a player like JJ

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.890 
get practicing against a player like JJ
Watt<00:03:13.739> what<00:03:14.310> was<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.430> like<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.750> that

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
Watt what was that like and is that

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.710 
Watt what was that like and is that
something<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.110> helps<00:03:16.380> you

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
something that helps you

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.440 
something that helps you
yeah<00:03:17.470> I<00:03:17.500> mean<00:03:17.650> I<00:03:17.770> don't<00:03:18.160> want<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.430> see<00:03:18.640> JJ<00:03:18.880> so

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
yeah I mean I don't want to see JJ so

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.970 
yeah I mean I don't want to see JJ so
you<00:03:20.230> know<00:03:20.350> I<00:03:20.650> hope<00:03:21.130> I<00:03:21.250> don't<00:03:21.310> see<00:03:21.670> JJ<00:03:22.590> he<00:03:23.590> I

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
you know I hope I don't see JJ he I

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.740 
you know I hope I don't see JJ he I
think<00:03:24.220> it's<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.430> good<00:03:24.520> for<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.790> lineman<00:03:25.120> to<00:03:25.600> go

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
think it's a good for the lineman to go

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.720 
think it's a good for the lineman to go
against<00:03:25.990> one<00:03:26.890> of<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.040> best<00:03:27.070> d-linemen<00:03:27.610> in<00:03:27.670> the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
against one of the best d-linemen in the

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.700 
against one of the best d-linemen in the
league<00:03:27.880> if<00:03:28.030> not<00:03:28.210> the<00:03:28.330> best<00:03:28.510> I'll<00:03:29.290> let<00:03:29.410> you<00:03:29.470> guys

forward<00:03:43.210> to<00:03:43.330> going<00:03:43.540> up<00:03:43.720> against<00:03:43.990> him<00:03:44.080> every

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.010 
forward to going up against him every
day<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:45.100> kind<00:03:45.430> of<00:03:45.550> gauge<00:03:45.730> what<00:03:46.390> what<00:03:46.720> else<00:03:46.870> it

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
day to kind of gauge what what else it

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.870 
day to kind of gauge what what else it
is<00:03:47.110> that<00:03:47.140> they<00:03:47.350> need<00:03:47.380> to<00:03:47.530> work<00:03:47.710> on<00:03:47.890> so<00:03:48.760> I<00:03:48.790> think

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
is that they need to work on so I think

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.150 
is that they need to work on so I think
that's<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.240> good<00:03:49.390> test<00:03:49.570> for<00:03:49.660> them<00:03:50.070> Robert<00:03:51.070> how

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
that's a good test for them Robert how

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.530 
that's a good test for them Robert how

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
know guys get to go against guys I don't

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.610 
know guys get to go against guys I don't
know<00:04:45.910> every<00:04:46.210> release<00:04:46.750> that<00:04:46.960> they<00:04:47.080> have<00:04:47.260> and

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
know every release that they have and

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.070 
know every release that they have and
don't<00:04:48.190> know<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:48.400> concepts<00:04:48.940> that<00:04:49.030> we<00:04:49.150> run<00:04:49.360> so<00:04:50.050> I

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
don't know the concepts that we run so I

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.170 
don't know the concepts that we run so I
think<00:04:50.200> it<00:04:50.620> breaks<00:04:50.890> up<00:04:51.070> that<00:04:51.370> that<00:04:51.880> part<00:04:52.120> of

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
think it breaks up that that part of

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.719 
think it breaks up that that part of
camp<00:04:52.390> a<00:04:52.479> little<00:04:52.570> bit<00:04:52.810> but<00:04:53.520> everyone<00:04:54.520> gets

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
camp a little bit but everyone gets

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.520 
camp a little bit but everyone gets
turned<00:04:54.970> up<00:04:55.150> and<00:04:55.360> gets<00:04:55.750> excited<00:04:56.169> about<00:04:56.350> going

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
turned up and gets excited about going

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.850 
turned up and gets excited about going
against<00:04:56.830> someone<00:04:57.100> else<00:04:58.169> so<00:04:59.169> feels<00:04:59.590> like<00:04:59.680> an

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
against someone else so feels like an

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.290 
against someone else so feels like an
