00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
bought this bike fairly recently and

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.200 
bought this bike fairly recently and
there's<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.289> couple<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.740> things<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.130> sort<00:00:27.029> of

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
there's a couple of things that sort of

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.750 
there's a couple of things that sort of
need<00:00:27.420> addressing<00:00:27.990> before<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.410> goes<00:00:28.560> on<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
need addressing before it goes on the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.080 
need addressing before it goes on the
road<00:00:29.910> one<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.960> those<00:00:31.050> things<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:32.090> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
road one of those things is that the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.180 
road one of those things is that the
horn<00:00:33.420> button<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.320> missing<00:00:34.350> as<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:34.950> can<00:00:35.100> see

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
horn button is missing as you can see

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.069 
horn button is missing as you can see
right<00:00:35.309> there<00:00:35.370> but<00:00:35.850> more<00:00:36.090> importantly<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.780> can't

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
right there but more importantly I can't

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.410 
right there but more importantly I can't
seem<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.350> get<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.800> horn<00:00:38.040> itself<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.700> work<00:00:38.910> Pepa

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
seem to get the horn itself to work Pepa

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.299 
seem to get the horn itself to work Pepa
hi<00:00:39.570> Therese<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.020> good<00:00:40.649> shape<00:00:40.829> all<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> rest

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
hi Therese in good shape all the rest

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.920 
hi Therese in good shape all the rest
the<00:00:41.430> electrical<00:00:41.879> works<00:00:42.480> but<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.200> horn<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:44.399> not

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
the electrical works but the horn is not

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.660 
the electrical works but the horn is not
it's<00:00:45.930> not<00:00:45.989> making<00:00:46.260> any<00:00:46.440> noise<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.770> I'm<00:00:47.489> not

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
it's not making any noise so I'm not

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.799 
it's not making any noise so I'm not
really<00:00:47.850> sure<00:00:47.969> what<00:00:48.210> that's<00:00:48.390> about

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
really sure what that's about

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.160 
really sure what that's about
there's<00:00:49.350> any<00:00:49.500> way<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.680> test<00:00:50.930> where<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
there's any way to test where the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.299 
there's any way to test where the
breakdown<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:54.829> what<00:00:55.829> else

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
breakdown is on that what else

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.310 
breakdown is on that what else
the<00:00:56.460> other<00:00:56.610> major<00:00:57.030> thing<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.899> bike<00:00:58.079> is

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the other major thing on this bike is

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.979 
the other major thing on this bike is
that<00:00:58.699> when<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.850> change<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> oil<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that when to change the oil and in the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.290 
that when to change the oil and in the
process<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.739> pulling<00:01:01.949> off<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.460> oil<00:01:03.059> filter

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
process of pulling off this oil filter

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.920 
process of pulling off this oil filter
cover<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.899> stripped<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:04.860> two<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.780> well<00:01:06.780> not

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
cover I stripped out two of the well not

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.149 
cover I stripped out two of the well not
the<00:01:07.080> bolt<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> threading<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:07.950> hold

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
the bolt but the threading that hold

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.490 
the bolt but the threading that hold
into<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.670> bolts<00:01:08.970> there's<00:01:09.689> one<00:01:09.869> bolt<00:01:10.020> stuck<00:01:10.380> in

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
into the bolts there's one bolt stuck in

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.870 
into the bolts there's one bolt stuck in
there<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.799> managed<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.070> get<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.400> other<00:01:11.549> two

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
there and I managed to get the other two

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.460 
there and I managed to get the other two
out<00:01:11.909> one<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.630> them<00:01:12.780> was<00:01:12.900> fine<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> other

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
out one of them was fine and the other

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.999 
out one of them was fine and the other
one<00:01:13.590> came<00:01:14.280> out<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> little<00:01:14.790> bit<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:14.939> work

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
one came out with a little bit of work

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.020 
one came out with a little bit of work
so<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.040> guess<00:01:17.250> I'm<00:01:17.369> gonna<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.700> get<00:01:17.880> these

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
so I guess I'm gonna have to get these

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.090 
so I guess I'm gonna have to get these
to<00:01:18.270> reach<00:01:18.509> out<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.049> put<00:01:19.979> new<00:01:20.189> bolts<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.670> them

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
to reach out and put new bolts in them

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.340 
to reach out and put new bolts in them
that's<00:01:23.100> about<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.390> guess<00:01:25.549> I'm<00:01:26.549> new<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.350> twin

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
that's about it I guess I'm new to twin

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.030 
that's about it I guess I'm new to twin
cylinder<00:01:29.030> engines<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.270> I'm<00:01:31.140> not<00:01:31.350> really<00:01:31.680> sure

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
cylinder engines and I'm not really sure

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.440 
cylinder engines and I'm not really sure
how<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.909> tune<00:01:33.360> them<00:01:33.720> I'm<00:01:34.549> kind<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.729> curious

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
how to tune them I'm kind of curious

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.569 
how to tune them I'm kind of curious
especially<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.619> dial<00:01:37.950> right<00:01:38.159> here<00:01:38.369> I'm<00:01:38.460> not

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
especially this dial right here I'm not

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.230 
especially this dial right here I'm not
really<00:01:38.759> sure<00:01:39.000> what<00:01:39.150> that's<00:01:39.329> all<00:01:39.540> about<00:01:41.240> what

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
really sure what that's all about what

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.889 
really sure what that's all about what
it<00:01:42.420> adjusts<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.290> needs<00:01:43.549> adjusting

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
it adjusts and if it needs adjusting

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.870 
it adjusts and if it needs adjusting
I<00:01:45.960> pulled<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.710> spark<00:01:46.950> plugs<00:01:47.189> here<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.640> they

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
I pulled the spark plugs here and they

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.819 
I pulled the spark plugs here and they
look<00:01:48.030> pretty<00:01:48.240> good<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:49.350> one's<00:01:49.560> out<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
look pretty good this one's out of the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.139 
look pretty good this one's out of the
right<00:01:49.979> hand<00:01:50.009> side<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.520> as<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.729> can<00:01:50.850> see<00:01:50.909> it's

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
right hand side and as you can see it's

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.609 
right hand side and as you can see it's
a<00:01:51.210> little<00:01:51.420> bit<00:01:51.509> darker<00:01:51.899> than<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.530> other<00:01:52.649> one

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
a little bit darker than the other one

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.640 
a little bit darker than the other one
so

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
so

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.810 
so
but<00:01:57.310> they<00:01:57.550> both<00:01:57.760> look<00:01:58.000> pretty<00:01:58.270> good<00:01:58.900> to<00:01:59.050> me

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
but they both look pretty good to me

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.640 
but they both look pretty good to me
anyways<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.860> bike<00:02:03.040> has<00:02:03.930> 63,000<00:02:04.930> case<00:02:05.140> I<00:02:05.470> put

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
anyways the bike has 63,000 case I put

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.389
