and a four she's gonna cross it she's
gotta<00:02:45.000> pop<00:02:45.300> out<00:02:45.450> on<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.690> edge<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:47.070> ball

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
came just it's it first time and hoped

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.860 
came just it's it first time and hoped
it<00:02:49.980> went<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:51.120> don't<00:02:51.510> think<00:02:51.630> I'd<00:02:51.720> do<00:02:51.810> it

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
it went in and I don't think I'd do it

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.290 
it went in and I don't think I'd do it
again<00:02:51.900> no<00:02:52.170> but<00:02:52.320> I'll<00:02:52.440> give<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.650> go<00:02:53.300> probably

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300

have<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.510> give<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.690> special<00:02:54.959> mention<00:02:55.230> to

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
have to give a special mention to

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.350 
have to give a special mention to
Crystal<00:02:55.920> Johnston<00:02:56.370> as<00:02:56.490> well<00:02:56.640> she<00:02:56.940> played<00:02:57.090> left

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
Crystal Johnston as well she played left

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.060 
Crystal Johnston as well she played left
back<00:02:57.540> but<00:02:57.840> she's<00:02:58.440> actually<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.680> right<00:02:58.830> winger

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
back but she's actually a right winger

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.010 
back but she's actually a right winger
we<00:02:59.940> had<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.060> look<00:03:00.270> at<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:00.450> we've<00:03:00.630> seen<00:03:00.810> that

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020

Nikki<00:03:01.380> harden<00:03:01.680> had<00:03:01.770> an<00:03:01.890> injury<00:03:02.190> we<00:03:02.700> are<00:03:02.880> we

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
Nikki harden had an injury we are we

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.729 
Nikki harden had an injury we are we
didn't<00:03:03.390> really<00:03:03.510> have<00:03:03.690> any<00:03:03.810> real<00:03:04.230> full<00:03:04.530> bucks

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
didn't really have any real full bucks

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.460 
didn't really have any real full bucks
on<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.250> bench<00:03:05.480> so<00:03:06.480> we<00:03:06.570> had<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.720> little<00:03:06.900> gamble

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
on the bench so we had a little gamble

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.840 
on the bench so we had a little gamble
we<00:03:07.739> had<00:03:07.830> a<00:03:07.860> little<00:03:08.010> gamble<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.580> we<00:03:08.640> thought

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
we had a little gamble and we thought

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.970 
we had a little gamble and we thought
maybe<00:03:09.330> this<00:03:09.630> might<00:03:09.870> benefit<00:03:10.380> us<00:03:10.530> in<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.830> way

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
maybe this might benefit us in the way

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.650 
maybe this might benefit us in the way
