Europe a few times before but recent
years<00:02:36.360> maybe<00:02:36.840> was<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.170> was<00:02:37.350> a<00:02:37.410> couple<00:02:37.620> years

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
ago there was actually Europe so I'm

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.330 
ago there was actually Europe so I'm
doubting<00:02:39.930> myself<00:02:40.140> now<00:02:40.560> but<00:02:40.740> basically<00:02:41.069> how<00:02:41.310> I

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
doubting myself now but basically how I

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.430 
doubting myself now but basically how I
always<00:02:41.640> see<00:02:41.819> them<00:02:42.030> as<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.780> round<00:02:43.050> about<00:02:43.140> that

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
always see them as a round about that

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.880 
always see them as a round about that
level<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:43.860> know<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.190> 910<00:02:45.090> which<00:02:45.630> is<00:02:45.990> nearly

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
level you know a 910 which is nearly

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.710 
level you know a 910 which is nearly
mid-table<00:02:47.490> okay<00:02:47.850> maybe<00:02:48.060> what<00:02:48.300> I<00:02:48.330> said<00:02:48.569> there's

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
mid-table okay maybe what I said there's

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.750 
mid-table okay maybe what I said there's
a<00:02:48.780> bit<00:02:48.930> wrong<00:02:49.080> then<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:49.950> knew<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.250> man<00:02:50.520> in<00:02:50.640> my
