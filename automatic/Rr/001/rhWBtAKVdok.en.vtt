angle to come down to the monitors and

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.679 
angle to come down to the monitors and
this<00:01:13.020> backbone<00:01:13.590> I'll<00:01:13.950> call<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.430> spine<00:01:14.790> if<00:01:15.060> you

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
this backbone I'll call the spine if you

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.399 
this backbone I'll call the spine if you
will<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:17.360> made<00:01:18.360> from<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.869> their<00:01:19.020> see

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
will is made from one of their see

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.640 
will is made from one of their see
brackets<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.299> just<00:01:21.509> creates<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.439> top

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
brackets so that just creates the top

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.249 
brackets so that just creates the top
rail<00:01:23.210> connection<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.479> bottom<00:01:24.780> rail<00:01:24.960> there

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
rail connection to the bottom rail there

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.190 
rail connection to the bottom rail there
and<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.820> makes<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.420> really<00:01:27.630> pretty

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
and so it makes for a really pretty

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.310 
and so it makes for a really pretty
simple<00:01:28.610> pretty<00:01:29.610> elegant<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.390> also<00:01:31.079> pretty

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
