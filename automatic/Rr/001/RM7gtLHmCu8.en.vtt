00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.620
 the patient physician relationship 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.420
 she's phenomenal because it involves 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.670
 a person on the other side of the 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.210
 another person on the other who is the 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:24.080
 patient relationship and the trinomial 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.910
 family grilling friends at last the net 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:32.270
 of the patient 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:35.060
 then the essence of the relationship is that the 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.690
 doctor or health care professional if 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:42.470
 he also needs to have a 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.650
 perception of what it is that it is bringing 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.100
 for the patient as a non- language 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.680
 verbal to be really is giving 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.010
 attention to what you are patient 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.450
 explaining you are evaluating 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.260
 symptoms if it is present. 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:03.100
 prepared technically and in what way 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.770
 that it can improve your communication 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.909
 because often the person knows a lot 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.009
 and communicates little it communicates much 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.280
 knows why then it is fundamental that 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:19.990
 all this while patient 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.229
 he has to organize for one 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.140
 Query 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.829
 He has to know the exams he brings. 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.749
 following a chronological order 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:32.659
 have a list of questions and 

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:36.530
 answers to the doubts he will 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.560
 acquiring meeting with talk not 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.999
 was ashamed to ask, is that question? 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.670
 really does not offend what's the 

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:45.859
 difficulty is availability of 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.979
 professional because often the 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:51.289
 patient question but the professional 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.399
 is scarcely available to bring a 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.600
 answer 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:59.380
 and that this emptiness often 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.429
 information makes the patient 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:07.969
 inclusive and do not make a 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:10.850
 adequate adherence to the treatment then 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:13.640
 that the patient understands adequately 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.750
 what was said and what needs to be 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.870
 done 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.900
 need to see all this 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.290
 communication between the professional and 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.290
 I passed
