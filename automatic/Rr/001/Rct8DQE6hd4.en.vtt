00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
got the vibrator motor microphone but

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.540 
got the vibrator motor microphone but
they're<00:04:36.690> all<00:04:36.810> pub<00:04:37.320> on<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.740> antennas<00:04:38.250> with<00:04:38.370> for

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
they're all pub on the antennas with for

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.490 
they're all pub on the antennas with for
public<00:04:38.940> box<00:04:39.120> okay<00:04:39.419> okay<00:04:39.930> we<00:04:40.200> don't<00:04:40.290> need<00:04:40.380> to

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
public box okay okay we don't need to

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.500 
public box okay okay we don't need to
worry<00:04:40.620> about<00:04:40.740> them<00:04:40.979> falling<00:04:41.190> out<00:04:44.210> okay<00:04:45.210> for

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
worry about them falling out okay for

worry about them falling out okay for
all<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:45.660> PCB<00:04:46.020> to<00:04:46.080> position<00:04:47.660> get<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:48.870> keypad

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
all the PCB to position get the keypad

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.159 
all the PCB to position get the keypad
back<00:04:50.820> on<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:51.060> short<00:04:51.270> run<00:04:51.450> backing<00:04:51.780> out<00:04:51.900> Utley

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
back on the short run backing out Utley

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.870 
back on the short run backing out Utley
keep<00:04:53.130> out<00:04:53.280> assembly<00:04:55.520> how<00:04:56.520> many<00:04:56.669> scooters

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
keep out assembly how many scooters

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.909 
keep out assembly how many scooters
without<00:04:57.120> their<00:04:57.300> 636<00:04:58.050> ok<00:04:58.970> generally<00:04:59.970> speaking

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
without their 636 ok generally speaking

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.350 
without their 636 ok generally speaking
want<00:05:01.919> to<00:05:01.979> put<00:05:02.130> a<00:05:02.160> diagonal<00:05:02.580> ones<00:05:02.760> first<00:05:03.060> just

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
want to put a diagonal ones first just

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.740 
want to put a diagonal ones first just
to<00:05:03.419> get<00:05:03.570> it<00:05:03.660> to<00:05:03.750> square<00:05:04.020> yeah<00:05:05.180> by<00:05:06.180> changing<00:05:06.449> the

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
to get it to square yeah by changing the

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.500 
to get it to square yeah by changing the
tire<00:05:06.960> on<00:05:07.139> a<00:05:07.169> car<00:05:07.260> yep<00:05:07.800> also<00:05:08.729> bad<00:05:09.210> yeah<00:05:10.160> and<00:05:11.510> it's

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
tire on a car yep also bad yeah and it's

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.670 
tire on a car yep also bad yeah and it's
exactly<00:05:12.600> the<00:05:12.960> same<00:05:13.080> reason<00:05:13.470> because<00:05:13.620> you

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
exactly the same reason because you

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.350 
exactly the same reason because you
don't<00:05:13.860> want<00:05:13.889> to<00:05:14.039> distort<00:05:14.310> it<00:05:14.520> if<00:05:14.850> you<00:05:14.970> bolt<00:05:15.210> it

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
don't want to distort it if you bolt it

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.230 
don't want to distort it if you bolt it
all<00:05:15.450> down<00:05:15.630> at<00:05:15.750> one<00:05:15.870> side<00:05:16.110> yeah<00:05:17.210> you'd<00:05:18.210> probably

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
all down at one side yeah you'd probably

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.730 
all down at one side yeah you'd probably
find<00:05:19.110> that<00:05:20.720> it<00:05:21.720> wasn't<00:05:22.050> quite<00:05:22.139> squirrel<00:05:22.590> what

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
find that it wasn't quite squirrel what

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.620 
find that it wasn't quite squirrel what
he<00:05:22.830> came<00:05:22.979> to<00:05:23.070> put<00:05:23.190> in<00:05:23.280> the<00:05:23.370> others<00:05:23.580> yeah<00:05:24.240> that's

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
he came to put in the others yeah that's

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:37.650 
he came to put in the others yeah that's
right

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.480 

so<00:05:38.650> you<00:05:38.710> think<00:05:38.890> there's<00:05:39.040> still<00:05:39.220> a<00:05:39.250> lot<00:05:39.460> of

so you think there's still a lot of

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.800 
so you think there's still a lot of
these<00:05:39.640> siemens<00:05:40.060> floating<00:05:40.420> around<00:05:40.510> in<00:05:40.720> the

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
these siemens floating around in the

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
I've already got a sim card in there

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:21.050 
I've already got a sim card in there
great<00:06:11.460> how<00:06:12.460> this<00:06:12.670> under<00:06:13.000> see<00:06:13.210> if<00:06:13.270> it<00:06:13.390> works
