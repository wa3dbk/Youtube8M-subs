 it is being shown that the boys no longer 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.789
 they are guys or the distances are shortened 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:25.150

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.460

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:42.610
 much of the rivals can be given many 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.559
 things then I think the good 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.089
 work that we have done has cut all 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.089
 distances has cut many things 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:52.659
 that we come to surprise and give us a 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:55.110
 surprise and we are for more and 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.110

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.720
 social networks to Guanacaste like I've 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.119

 t as it is for the last game that 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.470
 it's harder to make a goal more than 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.049
 to dance and people support me good with 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.259

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.730
 jimmy rcn television from colombia 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.110
 we want to know your opinion of colombia 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.540
 it could be one of the crosses in eighths 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.150
 of end and good have already knocked down two 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.980
 historic two world champions 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.540
 could that confrontation occur 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.720
 colombia who have thought it have 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.579
 visualized so they want it suddenly 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.879
 Well now we are not 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:50.359
 thinking about eighths we classify but the 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.920
 true that the group has touched us like 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:54.500
 it is said to dance with the ugliest equal 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.849
 this that comes colombia that comes to 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.159
 ivory coast that comes japan the 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.790
 true that we go and we will be 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.920
 preparations 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.359
 no matter what we play in eighths 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.950
 so I think we're right now 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.329
 thinking and the earth get a good 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.159
 result finish the group well 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.139
 first and then see if it touches us 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.690
 Colombia as a teacher knows her very 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:13.909
 you know everything about your country 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.989
 so I think that we can go there 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:16.989
 get a little advantage
