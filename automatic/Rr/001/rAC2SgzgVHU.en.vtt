00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
we add that to the chocolate is because

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.600 
we add that to the chocolate is because
it<00:02:16.990> helps<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.260> track<00:02:17.470> down<00:02:17.680> some<00:02:17.890> more<00:02:18.070> solid

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
it helps the track down some more solid

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.720 
it helps the track down some more solid
and<00:02:19.240> also<00:02:19.660> much<00:02:20.560> smoother<00:02:21.010> whenever<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.490> cools

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
and also much smoother whenever it cools

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.900
