hi there and welcome to miss rennolds
months<00:00:02.129> this<00:00:02.610> video<00:00:02.879> we're<00:00:03.030> going<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.179> look<00:00:03.270> at

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
months this video we're going to look at

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.289 
months this video we're going to look at
some<00:00:03.600> division<00:00:04.020> problems<00:00:04.490> so<00:00:05.490> I'm<00:00:06.000> gonna<00:00:06.150> do

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
some division problems so I'm gonna do

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.179 
some division problems so I'm gonna do
the<00:00:06.420> first<00:00:06.629> five<00:00:06.870> examples<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.620> I'm<00:00:08.010> gonna

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
the first five examples and I'm gonna

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.030 
the first five examples and I'm gonna
leave<00:00:08.400> questions<00:00:08.639> 6<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.540> 10<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.530> at

leave questions 6 to 10 to you and at

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.259 
leave questions 6 to 10 to you and at
the<00:00:11.130> end<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.400> video<00:00:11.610> I'll<00:00:11.880> show<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.150> the

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
the end of the video I'll show you the

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.509 
the end of the video I'll show you the
solutions<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.929> all<00:00:12.960> 10<00:00:13.710> questions<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.429> you

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
solutions to all 10 questions and you

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.980 
solutions to all 10 questions and you
can<00:00:14.730> check<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.150> see<00:00:15.210> how<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.540> did

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
can check and see how you did

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.980 
can check and see how you did
so<00:00:16.410> let's<00:00:16.949> start<00:00:17.490> off<00:00:17.640> with<00:00:17.850> number<00:00:17.910> 1<00:00:18.359> here<00:00:18.600> we

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
so let's start off with number 1 here we

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.160 
so let's start off with number 1 here we
got<00:00:19.140> 105<00:00:19.770> divided<00:00:20.609> by<00:00:20.730> 7<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.570> what<00:00:21.960> basically

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
got 105 divided by 7 so what basically

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.750 
got 105 divided by 7 so what basically
what<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.680> want<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.949> know<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.220> how<00:00:23.460> many<00:00:23.519> times

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
what I want to know is how many times

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.540 
what I want to know is how many times
can<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.449> fit<00:00:24.689> seven<00:00:24.990> into<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> hundred<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.400> five

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
can I fit seven into a hundred and five

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.060 
can I fit seven into a hundred and five
now<00:00:27.300> not<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:27.689> easy<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.109> do<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.320> in<00:00:28.710> our<00:00:28.769> heads

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
now not so easy to do this in our heads

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.179 
now not so easy to do this in our heads
so<00:00:29.400> we<00:00:29.609> need<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.970> method<00:00:30.380> so<00:00:31.380> we<00:00:31.590> start<00:00:31.830> off<00:00:31.980> by

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
so we need a method so we start off by

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.590 
so we need a method so we start off by
drawing<00:00:32.790> an<00:00:33.210> L<00:00:33.600> shape<00:00:33.960> like<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.489> I'm<00:00:36.329> gonna

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
drawing an L shape like so and I'm gonna

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.410 
drawing an L shape like so and I'm gonna
put<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.320> number<00:00:37.770> I'm<00:00:37.950> dividing<00:00:38.180> into<00:00:41.420> within

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
put the number I'm dividing into within

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.569 
put the number I'm dividing into within
the<00:00:42.570> L<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.379> number<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.860> I'm<00:00:44.010> dividing

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
the L and the number that I'm dividing

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.260 
the L and the number that I'm dividing
with<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.930> outside<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:46.829> seven<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.610> want<00:00:48.210> to

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
with on the outside so seven I want to

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.110 
with on the outside so seven I want to
know<00:00:48.360> how<00:00:48.570> many<00:00:48.629> times<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.200> fits<00:00:49.469> into<00:00:49.739> 105<00:00:50.550> so

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
know how many times it fits into 105 so

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.000 
know how many times it fits into 105 so
I<00:00:51.149> asked<00:00:51.480> myself<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.960> question<00:00:52.170> how<00:00:52.949> many

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
I asked myself this question how many

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.910 
I asked myself this question how many
times<00:00:53.250> does<00:00:53.670> 7<00:00:53.940> fit<00:00:54.539> into<00:00:54.690> one<00:00:54.989> well<00:00:55.800> it

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
times does 7 fit into one well it

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.790 
times does 7 fit into one well it
doesn't<00:00:56.180> it<00:00:57.180> doesn't<00:00:57.510> go<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.719> any<00:00:57.870> x<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.680> I'm

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
doesn't it doesn't go in any x so I'm

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.639 
doesn't it doesn't go in any x so I'm
gonna<00:00:58.949> carry<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.430> one<00:00:59.910> over<00:01:00.300> how<00:01:01.260> many<00:01:01.440> times

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
gonna carry that one over how many times

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.680 
gonna carry that one over how many times
are<00:01:01.829> seven<00:01:02.129> fit<00:01:02.280> into<00:01:02.399> ten<00:01:02.699> well<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.239> fits<00:01:03.480> in

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
are seven fit into ten well it fits in

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.539 
are seven fit into ten well it fits in
once

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
once

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.370 
once
seven<00:01:05.549> times<00:01:05.790> one<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.210> seven<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:07.170> have

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
seven times one is seven and we have

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.730 
seven times one is seven and we have
three<00:01:07.860> left<00:01:08.070> over<00:01:08.750> so<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.780> carry<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.260> three

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
three left over so I carry that three

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.859 
three left over so I carry that three
then<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.310> say<00:01:11.520> how<00:01:11.729> many<00:01:11.790> times<00:01:11.970> does<00:01:12.330> 7<00:01:12.540> fit

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
then I say how many times does 7 fit

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.560 
then I say how many times does 7 fit
into<00:01:13.020> 35<00:01:13.760> hopefully<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.820> know<00:01:14.909> your<00:01:15.060> 7<00:01:15.330> times

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
into 35 hopefully you know your 7 times

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.080 
into 35 hopefully you know your 7 times
table<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.650> know<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.070> fits<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.490> five<00:01:17.790> times

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
table and you know it fits in five times

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.289 
table and you know it fits in five times
so<00:01:18.869> 105<00:01:19.680> divided<00:01:20.159> by<00:01:20.280> 7<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:21.439> 15<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:23.100> that's<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
so 105 divided by 7 is 15 and that's the

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.859 
so 105 divided by 7 is 15 and that's the
first<00:01:24.509> one<00:01:24.810> don't<00:01:26.240> let's<00:01:27.240> crack<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.509> with

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
first one don't let's crack on with

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.149 
first one don't let's crack on with
question<00:01:28.740> 2

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
question 2

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.899 
question 2
so<00:01:29.659> 216<00:01:32.390> divided<00:01:33.390> by<00:01:33.990> 9

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
so 216 divided by 9

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.120 
so 216 divided by 9
let's<00:01:35.909> change<00:01:36.119> pens<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.650> want<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.890> know<00:01:37.979> how

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
let's change pens so I want to know how

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.969 
let's change pens so I want to know how
many<00:01:38.189> times<00:01:38.520> does<00:01:38.700> 9<00:01:38.939> fit<00:01:39.270> into<00:01:39.390> 216<00:01:40.320> again<00:01:40.770> not

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
many times does 9 fit into 216 again not

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.980 
many times does 9 fit into 216 again not
easy<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.460> do<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.670> our<00:01:41.759> head<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.390> need<00:01:42.600> to

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
easy to do in our head so we need to

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.330 
easy to do in our head so we need to
work<00:01:43.229> through<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.710> slowly

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
work through it slowly

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.760 
work through it slowly
how<00:01:45.030> many<00:01:45.210> nines<00:01:45.390> fit<00:01:45.600> into<00:01:45.750> two<00:01:45.960> well<00:01:46.470> it

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
how many nines fit into two well it

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.649 
how many nines fit into two well it
doesn't<00:01:46.979> fit<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.369> at<00:01:47.490> all<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.119> I'm<00:01:48.329> gonna<00:01:48.420> put

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
doesn't fit in at all so I'm gonna put

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.859 
doesn't fit in at all so I'm gonna put
down<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> 0<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.409> carry<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.130> 2<00:01:50.460> over<00:01:50.909> here<00:01:50.939> how

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
down a 0 and carry that 2 over here how

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.620 
down a 0 and carry that 2 over here how
many<00:01:52.049> times<00:01:52.290> does<00:01:52.470> 9<00:01:52.680> fit<00:01:53.040> into<00:01:53.159> 21<00:01:53.790> or<00:01:54.240> knowing

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
many times does 9 fit into 21 or knowing

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.440 
many times does 9 fit into 21 or knowing
my<00:01:54.750> times<00:01:55.020> tables<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.740> know<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.640> 9<00:01:56.850> fits<00:01:57.210> into

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
my times tables I know that 9 fits into

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.200 
my times tables I know that 9 fits into
21<00:01:57.990> at<00:01:58.200> least<00:01:58.530> 2<00:01:59.040> times<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.759> we<00:01:59.969> have<00:02:00.180> a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
21 at least 2 times and we have a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.800 
21 at least 2 times and we have a
remainder<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:01.020> 3<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.430> carried<00:02:02.969> out<00:02:03.119> 3<00:02:03.450> over

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
remainder of 3 so I carried out 3 over

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.889 
remainder of 3 so I carried out 3 over
how<00:02:04.649> many<00:02:04.829> times<00:02:05.100> does<00:02:05.280> 9<00:02:05.579> fit<00:02:05.909> into<00:02:06.060> 36<00:02:06.659> it

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
how many times does 9 fit into 36 it

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.190 
how many times does 9 fit into 36 it
goes<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.590> 4<00:02:08.280> times<00:02:08.610> with<00:02:09.420> no<00:02:09.690> remainder

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
goes in 4 times with no remainder

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.190 
goes in 4 times with no remainder
and<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.530> means<00:02:10.879> 216<00:02:11.879> divided<00:02:12.300> by<00:02:12.510> 9

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
and that means 216 divided by 9

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.050 
and that means 216 divided by 9
is<00:02:13.819> 24<00:02:16.069> great<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.400> let's<00:02:17.580> have<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.760> look<00:02:17.849> at

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
is 24 great so let's have a look at

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.449 
is 24 great so let's have a look at
question<00:02:18.390> 3

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
question 3

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.960 
question 3
so<00:02:20.750> 210<00:02:21.750> divided<00:02:22.170> by<00:02:22.319> 6<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.459> number<00:02:23.790> we're

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
so 210 divided by 6 so the number we're

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.300 
so 210 divided by 6 so the number we're
dividing<00:02:24.390> into<00:02:24.690> goes<00:02:24.900> here<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.739> number<00:02:26.099> I'm

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
dividing into goes here the number I'm

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.180 
dividing into goes here the number I'm
dividing<00:02:26.340> with<00:02:27.090> goes<00:02:27.599> here<00:02:27.989> how<00:02:28.800> many<00:02:29.010> times

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
dividing with goes here how many times

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.729 
dividing with goes here how many times
the<00:02:29.370> six<00:02:29.610> fits<00:02:29.819> fit<00:02:30.390> into<00:02:30.540> -<00:02:30.780> well<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.380> doesn't

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
the six fits fit into - well it doesn't

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.680 
the six fits fit into - well it doesn't
so<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:31.950> put<00:02:32.190> down<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.340> zero<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:32.970> I'm<00:02:33.180> gonna<00:02:33.360> carry

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
so I put down a zero and I'm gonna carry

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.770 
so I put down a zero and I'm gonna carry
that<00:02:33.810> 2<00:02:34.200> over<00:02:34.610> how<00:02:35.610> many<00:02:35.819> times<00:02:36.090> does<00:02:36.269> 6<00:02:36.569> fit

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
that 2 over how many times does 6 fit

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.000 
that 2 over how many times does 6 fit
into<00:02:36.900> 21<00:02:37.560> well<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.459> goes<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.970> 3<00:02:39.720> times<00:02:39.989> 3<00:02:40.830> times

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
into 21 well it goes in 3 times 3 times

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.420 
into 21 well it goes in 3 times 3 times
6<00:02:41.370> is<00:02:41.459> 18<00:02:42.230> which<00:02:43.230> means<00:02:43.440> we<00:02:43.830> have<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.010> remainder

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
6 is 18 which means we have a remainder

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.750 
6 is 18 which means we have a remainder
of<00:02:44.580> 3<00:02:44.930> how<00:02:45.930> many<00:02:45.959> times<00:02:46.410> does<00:02:46.620> 6<00:02:46.950> fit<00:02:47.220> into<00:02:47.370> 30

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
of 3 how many times does 6 fit into 30

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.819 
of 3 how many times does 6 fit into 30
it<00:02:48.120> goes<00:02:48.780> in<00:02:49.049> 5<00:02:49.709> times<00:02:50.069> so<00:02:50.849> 210<00:02:51.750> divided<00:02:52.319> by<00:02:52.530> 6

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
it goes in 5 times so 210 divided by 6

00:02:52.829 --> 00:03:03.199 
it goes in 5 times so 210 divided by 6
is<00:02:53.599> 35<00:02:55.910> example<00:02:56.910> 4<00:02:57.239> I<00:02:58.130> want<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.220> do<00:03:00.799> 236<00:03:02.209> divided

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
is 35 example 4 I want to do 236 divided

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.650 
is 35 example 4 I want to do 236 divided
by<00:03:03.390> 4<00:03:05.090> 236<00:03:06.090> divided<00:03:06.870> by<00:03:07.019> 4<00:03:07.370> so<00:03:08.370> how<00:03:09.150> many<00:03:09.299> times

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
by 4 236 divided by 4 so how many times

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.520 
by 4 236 divided by 4 so how many times
does<00:03:09.840> 4<00:03:10.140> fit<00:03:10.530> into<00:03:10.769> -<00:03:11.069> well<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:11.730> doesn't<00:03:12.410> so<00:03:13.410> I'm

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
does 4 fit into - well it doesn't so I'm

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.800 
does 4 fit into - well it doesn't so I'm
gonna<00:03:13.650> carry<00:03:14.069> that<00:03:14.190> 2<00:03:14.640> over<00:03:14.970> how<00:03:15.420> many<00:03:15.599> times

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
gonna carry that 2 over how many times

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.309 
gonna carry that 2 over how many times
does<00:03:15.959> 4<00:03:16.260> fit<00:03:16.530> into<00:03:16.680> 36<00:03:17.310> or<00:03:17.760> sorry<00:03:18.030> for<00:03:18.750> fit<00:03:19.200> into

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
does 4 fit into 36 or sorry for fit into

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.699 
does 4 fit into 36 or sorry for fit into
23<00:03:20.220> it<00:03:21.030> fits<00:03:21.329> in<00:03:21.510> 5<00:03:21.840> times<00:03:22.459> 5<00:03:23.459> times<00:03:23.519> 4<00:03:24.060> is<00:03:24.090> 20

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
23 it fits in 5 times 5 times 4 is 20

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.910 
23 it fits in 5 times 5 times 4 is 20
leaving<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.799> remainder<00:03:25.950> of<00:03:26.310> 3<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.769> then<00:03:28.769> how

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
leaving a remainder of 3 and then how

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.840 
leaving a remainder of 3 and then how
many<00:03:29.069> times<00:03:29.280> does<00:03:29.430> 4<00:03:29.790> fit<00:03:30.090> into<00:03:30.209> 36<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:31.139> goes<00:03:31.500> in

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
many times does 4 fit into 36 it goes in

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.470 
many times does 4 fit into 36 it goes in
9<00:03:32.850> times

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
9 times

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:42.440 
9 times
so<00:03:33.840> 4<00:03:34.760> into<00:03:36.470> 236<00:03:37.470> goes<00:03:38.750> 59<00:03:39.750> times<00:03:40.880> last<00:03:41.880> example

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
so 4 into 236 goes 59 times last example

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:51.430 
so 4 into 236 goes 59 times last example
of<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:42.690> this<00:03:43.079> punch<00:03:45.980> 868<00:03:48.049> 868<00:03:49.069> divided<00:03:50.069> by<00:03:50.220> 7

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
of the this punch 868 868 divided by 7

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.729 
of the this punch 868 868 divided by 7
so<00:03:52.440> how<00:03:53.400> many<00:03:53.459> times<00:03:53.910> does<00:03:54.150> 7<00:03:54.510> fit<00:03:54.930> into<00:03:55.049> 8<00:03:55.290> it

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
so how many times does 7 fit into 8 it

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.879 
so how many times does 7 fit into 8 it
goes<00:03:55.859> in<00:03:56.340> once<00:03:56.880> leaving<00:03:57.420> a<00:03:57.630> remainder<00:03:57.780> of<00:03:58.290> warm

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
goes in once leaving a remainder of warm

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.670 
goes in once leaving a remainder of warm
so<00:03:59.400> I<00:03:59.459> carry<00:03:59.910> that<00:04:00.120> remainder<00:04:00.599> over<00:04:00.930> how<00:04:01.470> many

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
so I carry that remainder over how many

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.729 
so I carry that remainder over how many
times<00:04:01.950> does<00:04:02.160> 7<00:04:02.459> fit<00:04:02.849> into<00:04:03.000> 16<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:04.170> goes<00:04:04.500> in

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
times does 7 fit into 16 it goes in

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.809 
times does 7 fit into 16 it goes in
twice<00:04:05.359> leaving<00:04:06.359> a<00:04:06.420> remainder<00:04:06.569> of<00:04:06.870> 2<00:04:07.170> because<00:04:08.010> 7

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
twice leaving a remainder of 2 because 7

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.839 
twice leaving a remainder of 2 because 7
times<00:04:08.849> 2<00:04:09.269> is<00:04:09.299> 14<00:04:09.560> but<00:04:10.560> we<00:04:10.680> have<00:04:10.829> 60<00:04:11.280> in<00:04:11.340> here<00:04:11.609> so

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
times 2 is 14 but we have 60 in here so

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.319 
times 2 is 14 but we have 60 in here so
it's<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.060> remainder<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:13.579> carry<00:04:14.579> that<00:04:14.760> 2<00:04:15.000> over

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
it's a remainder to carry that 2 over

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.469 
it's a remainder to carry that 2 over
how<00:04:15.660> many<00:04:15.810> times<00:04:16.079> does<00:04:16.260> 7<00:04:16.590> fit<00:04:16.950> into<00:04:17.099> 28<00:04:17.789> it

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
how many times does 7 fit into 28 it

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:26.470 
how many times does 7 fit into 28 it
goes<00:04:18.810> in<00:04:19.049> for<00:04:19.680> x<00:04:20.039> so<00:04:21.169> 868<00:04:22.169> divided<00:04:23.010> by<00:04:23.599> 7<00:04:24.599> is<00:04:25.370> 120

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
goes in for x so 868 divided by 7 is 120

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.890 
goes in for x so 868 divided by 7 is 120
four<00:04:27.370> so<00:04:28.370> there's<00:04:28.670> five<00:04:29.030> examples<00:04:29.420> for<00:04:29.810> you

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
four so there's five examples for you

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
questions six to ten a little bit longer

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.930 
questions six to ten a little bit longer
because<00:04:42.590> we<00:04:42.770> have<00:04:43.010> some<00:04:43.250> extra<00:04:43.490> digits<00:04:43.820> but
