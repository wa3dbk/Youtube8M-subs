SEA SPECIALTY OF NHA TRANG: GRAPE SEAWEED

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.720
You must have seen or
 tasted seaweed already.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.280
There is a kind of seaweed 
that is less known.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.340
It’s grape seaweed, a specialty of 
Nha Trang city, Khanh Hoa.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.040
Let’s go to learn about
the craft of seaweed farming.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.460
Hello. I’m Duc Bao from S Vietnam.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.780
I’m here to learn about
 the craft of grape seaweed farming.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.620
I’m harvesting it.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.620
You look like practicing diving.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.600
To harvest it, I must be in seawater.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.000
Do you know how grape seaweed looks like?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.260
I have never seen it before.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.000
Just go into the water with me, 
and you’ll know it.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
- Please show me!
- Okay.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.780
Each job has its difficulties.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.420
How cold the water is!

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.840
I’ve just touched something.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.900
It’s grape seaweed.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.560
It turns out that.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.160
How to harvest it?

00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:00.040
Pluck the seaweeds that are from 6-8 cm long.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.940
I cannot pluck the ones lying deeper.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.640
This part is for sale.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.660
- It is edible, isn’t it?
- Yes.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.140
Is it served raw or cooked?

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.120
It is served raw.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.760
Really? Let me try it.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.260
Come on.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.180
It’s a little bit oily and salty.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.780
We’ll pick some more.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.620
This is our fruit after staying in water for a while.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.380
It looks impressive, doesn’t it?

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.460
Preliminary processing of the seaweed
 is the next step.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.380
This is a centrifuge.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.980
The water is used to keep the seaweed longer.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.780
This is dried grape seaweed.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.280
When using, you should soak it in water 
for 3 minutes.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.660
And then it will get its original shape back.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.780
Really?

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.540
It’s unbelievable.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.800
Can you distinguish between 
dried and fresh grape seaweed?

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.120
I cannot tell any differences between them.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.140
Just take a rest in the hammock!

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.100
I’m using grape seaweed
 for another purpose.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.900
With slime, grape seaweed 
can be used as facial mask.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.900
Girls and women must be 
very interested in this.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.380
My facial skin is now 
as soft and smooth as baby’s skin.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.800
Don’t believe it? Just try!

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.560
If you want to get this experience,
 go with S Vietnam to Nha Trang.
