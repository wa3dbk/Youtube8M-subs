Southern<00:00:03.419> California<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:05.009> I<00:00:05.400> decided<00:00:05.790> to

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
Southern California and I decided to

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.579 
Southern California and I decided to
make<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.150> video<00:00:06.359> for<00:00:06.569> you<00:00:06.810> guys<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:07.259> give<00:00:07.410> you<00:00:07.500> a

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
make a video for you guys to give you a

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.379 
make a video for you guys to give you a
better<00:00:07.740> an<00:00:07.950> idea<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.460> what<00:00:09.030> you're<00:00:09.179> buying

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
better an idea of what you're buying

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.009 
better an idea of what you're buying
here<00:00:10.910> from<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.030> photos<00:00:12.420> it's<00:00:12.719> pretty

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
here from the photos it's pretty

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.350 
here from the photos it's pretty
difficult<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.620> tell<00:00:13.889> because<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.059> mirror

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
difficult to tell because of the mirror

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.560 
difficult to tell because of the mirror
finish<00:00:15.660> on<00:00:15.960> these<00:00:16.910> it's<00:00:17.910> very<00:00:18.060> difficult<00:00:18.300> to

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
finish on these it's very difficult to

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.599 
finish on these it's very difficult to
photograph<00:00:18.949> so<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:19.980> thought<00:00:20.189> if<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:20.430> made<00:00:20.580> a

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
photograph so I thought if we made a

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.769 
photograph so I thought if we made a
video<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:21.060> might<00:00:21.180> make<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.570> easier<00:00:21.779> for<00:00:22.199> people

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
video it might make it easier for people

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.990 
video it might make it easier for people
basically<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.439> purple<00:00:25.890> here<00:00:26.760> and

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
basically this is the purple here and

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.569 
basically this is the purple here and
this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.019> mirror<00:00:28.380> purple<00:00:29.150> it's<00:00:30.150> really<00:00:30.539> nice

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
definitely stands out it's pretty

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.389 
definitely stands out it's pretty
obvious<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.670> not<00:00:36.030> black<00:00:36.510> people<00:00:37.399> often

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
