00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hello and welcome to the latest issue of Chip Tactics 

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:08.129
 Casting man repro lash 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:10.889
 11% Terrans serve here 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.030
 Portus is reasonably too Werner for that reason even this time 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.460
 have to be more exciting than the normal percent 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.390
 Videos of me 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.809
 you can see directly that a PDA and WWF sent 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.029
 Immediately before the enemy base to build my first barrack with it 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.149
 the books I'm going to directly on 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.049
 be built in front of the enemy base the whole thing must be faster 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.600
 right here on a plateau 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.830
 why the yields are blowing smooches so that percent arrives quickly 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.570
 but at the same time that would not be seen even by the enemy here 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.490
 nobody would stop for the first five minutes 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.470
 Accordingly, a relatively well-suited job 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.980
 Immediately after the first attack, I immediately have the Smith Mara family 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.200
 started in the now at 3 EnBW start it 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.180
 to collect 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.250
 WWF itself is only one built and after the first brand and the 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.619
 Rossoneri are done 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.110
 to really guarantee that the adventure 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.980
 fastest goes 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.780
 both the brand is finished with it, whether it occurs, explains Brand 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.480
 so that you can then start directly with the production of the BKA 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.700
 beautiful normal play should be noticed that you check me 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.980
 also no snob directly build their depot 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.100
 because you liked Löw first time installed 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.340
 that is why it is completely unnecessary to increase the said 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.000
 achieved here at the mirror 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.399
 the literary always with the version in addition 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.300
 With 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.300
 Apparently, everything at BDF is about Bern 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.140
 percentage 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.330
 to build a bunker 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.490
 How do you build percent although at once you for grades and wanted to do that 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.940
 Vomiting he did not quite arrive 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.000
 next to a shaky leg the percent tenant gets ready 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:14.899
 and then it takes a lot of who looks nice to see 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:18.799
 that here a single tree is blocking my way Schäffner Tussen will be like that 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.839
 but in any case it is in the place 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.829
 very bad thing » 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.979
 So rich you can see how the Zealots are trying to build the bunker 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:31.979
 but image lending the unbelievably high damage 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:37.729
 just in the bunker are hardly aware to make additionally he wants to lose a lot 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:40.809
 Time around the bunker repaired by five percent of the time and again 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.540
 Water is as long as opponents have not stopped something bigger 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.540
 actually no chance to destroy that percentage point 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.309
 Here you can see nothing, I do not have to pay attention to WWF 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:57.749
 which is pretty much July because you could certainly have more bunkers 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:00.749
 build and make it easier for five games 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.829
 but watch out something like it happens to facilitate WWF lost 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.309
 Federer still leads in Zugzwang 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:12.510
 did his bid to destroy my pass but there you see 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:14.189
 stop in the fight 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.369
 Poppers against Ferrer 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:21.269
 the lover advantage of the drama itself, the opponent to some extent 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.229
 plays well 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:26.229
 MuscleNerd direction that I realize you should just go 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:32.889
 and who can not do much now is still as many pilots as it is 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.879
 somehow possible 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.569
 borken-burlo after 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.929
 Radio plays and then maybe March's confidence can defend itself 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:45.189
 because he bothered me better 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:48.359
 He knows very well that when he drives me off he won 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.109
 but it will not come to that 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.889
 I now have 11 4 liters 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:01.179
 no wonder then 

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:04.189
 always had any throne throne 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.779
 as she dives here threatened to fill in no time 

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:14.069
 Frey is not going to use a bunker normal inserts so I'm not quite 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.480
 so for my show has to do 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.819
 the too lazy 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:21.219
 but here you can see the advantage that you have all the GAM has them pavements 

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.870
 he has 14 dead 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.189
 it is 400,000 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:32.530
 Percent 4 Tenant and Themar Percent 50-50 Saskia Sinner Parbat 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.150
 no chance of getting on the asphalt in the controversial bonus payments 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.490
 maybe stick to it 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.710
 lay there so that I come from my opponent 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.760
 Of course, what do you want to have the feeling that it was in May? 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:49.580
 someday also clear that this can not be 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.960
 the surprising in the sense of God extremely effective 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.960
 against sidewalks 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.020
 Here, a bit earlier, the blacksmiths helped him save me 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.639
 say little that it is and comes with it 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.900
 as you could on other videos but there is not 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.330
 but it is really extremely difficult in CIS because you are actually the one 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.250
 Whole corner must be better than the driver player around there as a professional player 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.520
 to have the chance
