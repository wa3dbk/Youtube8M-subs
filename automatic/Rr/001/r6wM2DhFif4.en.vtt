00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
what they are first let's take a look at

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.800 
what they are first let's take a look at
the<00:02:12.230> vasoactive<00:02:12.650> complex<00:02:13.580> alright<00:02:14.420> so<00:02:14.720> you

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
the vasoactive complex alright so you

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.030 
the vasoactive complex alright so you
have<00:02:15.110> health<00:02:16.040> citrulline<00:02:16.670> arginine<00:02:17.860> you<00:02:18.860> have

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
have health citrulline arginine you have

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.450 
have health citrulline arginine you have
l-arginine<00:02:19.930> resveratrol<00:02:21.070> which<00:02:22.070> is<00:02:22.100> pretty

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
l-arginine resveratrol which is pretty
