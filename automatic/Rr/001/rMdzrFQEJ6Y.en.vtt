with purple foods I love to eat them and
I<00:02:07.340> can<00:02:07.580> think<00:02:07.700> of

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
I can think of

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.929 
I can think of
plenty<00:02:10.179> of<00:02:10.209> other<00:02:10.539> purple<00:02:10.989> foods<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:12.730> are

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:12.939 
plenty of other purple foods that are

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:14.550 
plenty of other purple foods that are
just<00:02:12.969> really<00:02:13.540> enjoyable<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:13.989> it<00:02:14.200> just<00:02:14.379> makes

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
just really enjoyable and it just makes

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.220 
just really enjoyable and it just makes
it<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.799> most<00:02:15.250> beautiful<00:02:15.629> purpose<00:02:16.629> purplish

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
it the most beautiful purpose purplish

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.399 
it the most beautiful purpose purplish
bluish<00:02:17.620> black<00:02:17.769> color<00:02:18.459> at<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.780> end<00:02:19.959> so<00:02:20.230> it's

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
bluish black color at the end so it's

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.240 
bluish black color at the end so it's
really<00:02:20.739> great<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.480> making<00:02:22.480> this<00:02:22.659> is<00:02:23.230> can<00:02:23.950> vary

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
really great and making this is can vary

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.069 
really great and making this is can vary
slightly<00:02:24.549> depending<00:02:24.879> on<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.510> season<00:02:25.870> whether

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
slightly depending on the season whether

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.410 
slightly depending on the season whether
you<00:02:26.290> want<00:02:26.469> it<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.650> be<00:02:26.769> room<00:02:27.700> temperature<00:02:27.969> in

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
you want it to be room temperature in

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.720 
you want it to be room temperature in
the<00:02:28.510> winter<00:02:28.900> or<00:02:29.170> if<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:29.799> want<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.129> to<00:02:30.250> be<00:02:30.430> a

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
the winter or if you want it to be a

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.550 
the winter or if you want it to be a
really<00:02:31.540> cold<00:02:32.549> treat<00:02:33.549> during<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.150> summer<00:02:34.560> so

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
really cold treat during the summer so

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.490 
really cold treat during the summer so
if<00:02:35.859> it<00:02:36.340> is<00:02:36.689> winter<00:02:37.689> time<00:02:37.719> it's<00:02:38.139> probably<00:02:38.260> gonna

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
if it is winter time it's probably gonna

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.990 
if it is winter time it's probably gonna
be<00:02:38.650> at<00:02:38.799> least<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.099> little<00:02:39.219> bit<00:02:39.370> cold<00:02:39.639> if<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:39.849> use

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
be at least a little bit cold if you use

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.509 
be at least a little bit cold if you use
frozen<00:02:40.239> blueberries<00:02:40.629> but<00:02:41.500> say<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.340> were

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
frozen blueberries but say you were

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.929 
frozen blueberries but say you were
gonna<00:02:42.639> use<00:02:43.049> bananas<00:02:44.049> the<00:02:44.889> you<00:02:45.400> could<00:02:45.579> freeze

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:45.939 
gonna use bananas the you could freeze

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.789 
gonna use bananas the you could freeze
one<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:46.659> the<00:02:46.750> bananas

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
one of the bananas

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.399 
one of the bananas
and<00:02:48.269> put<00:02:49.269> that<00:02:49.299> in<00:02:49.689> there<00:02:49.870> with<00:02:50.079> the<00:02:50.260> other

and put that in there with the other
unripe<00:02:50.769> bananas<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.510> also<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.599> can<00:02:52.900> add<00:02:53.079> ice

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
unripe bananas and also you can add ice

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.110 
unripe bananas and also you can add ice
instead<00:02:53.769> of<00:02:54.010> water<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.549> it<00:02:55.439> so<00:02:56.439> just<00:02:56.879> one<00:02:57.879> other

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
instead of water to it so just one other

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.690 
instead of water to it so just one other

don't<00:03:07.480> add<00:03:07.599> too<00:03:07.840> much<00:03:08.049> so<00:03:08.349> let's<00:03:08.500> say<00:03:08.739> 520

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
don't add too much so let's say 520

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.490 
don't add too much so let's say 520
calories<00:03:09.730> for<00:03:10.180> this<00:03:10.269> whole<00:03:10.480> thing<00:03:10.750> 530<00:03:11.609> and
