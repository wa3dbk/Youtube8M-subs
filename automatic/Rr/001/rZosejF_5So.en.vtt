00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
we're gonna turn the heat a little bit

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.020 
we're gonna turn the heat a little bit
and<00:03:47.450> simmer<00:03:48.450> for<00:03:48.810> about<00:03:48.959> five<00:03:49.500> minutes<00:03:49.829> um<00:03:50.340> the

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
and simmer for about five minutes um the

and simmer for about five minutes um the
water<00:03:51.329> from<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.870> mushroom<00:03:52.379> is<00:03:52.500> gonna<00:03:52.739> help<00:03:53.099> to

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
water from the mushroom is gonna help to

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.190 
water from the mushroom is gonna help to
cook<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:53.819> spinach<00:03:54.150> so<00:03:54.599> you<00:03:54.660> don't<00:03:54.870> even<00:03:54.959> need

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
cook the spinach so you don't even need

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.789 
cook the spinach so you don't even need
to<00:03:55.379> add<00:03:55.530> more<00:03:55.799> water<00:03:56.010> to<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:57.870> that's<00:03:58.049> it<00:03:58.230> so
