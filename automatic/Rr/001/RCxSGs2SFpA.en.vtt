00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
us right from the get-go said we want to

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.780 
us right from the get-go said we want to
go<00:05:08.810> with<00:05:08.990> this<00:05:09.110> geothermal<00:05:09.550> heating<00:05:10.550> and

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
go with this geothermal heating and

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.580 
go with this geothermal heating and
cooling<00:05:10.940> system<00:05:11.510> it<00:05:11.690> was<00:05:11.840> the<00:05:11.930> first<00:05:11.960> hotel<00:05:12.290> in

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
cooling system it was the first hotel in

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.320 
cooling system it was the first hotel in
Canada<00:05:12.950> that<00:05:13.160> had<00:05:13.370> that

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
Canada that had that

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.589 
Canada that had that
it's<00:05:16.169> a<00:05:16.470> basically<00:05:17.159> wells<00:05:17.849> we<00:05:18.150> do<00:05:18.300> underneath

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
it's a basically wells we do underneath

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.170 
it's a basically wells we do underneath
the<00:05:18.930> skin<00:05:19.710> of<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:19.979> earth<00:05:20.159> that<00:05:20.370> creates<00:05:20.939> some

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
the skin of the earth that creates some

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.450 
the skin of the earth that creates some
either<00:05:21.569> eat<00:05:21.870> in<00:05:22.080> the<00:05:22.289> winter<00:05:22.560> or<00:05:22.590> cold<00:05:23.159> in<00:05:23.340> the

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
either eat in the winter or cold in the

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.929 
either eat in the winter or cold in the
summer<00:05:24.439> so<00:05:25.439> there's<00:05:25.919> many<00:05:26.250> things<00:05:26.370> like<00:05:26.759> that

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:26.939 
summer so there's many things like that

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:30.030 
summer so there's many things like that
at<00:05:27.120> DN<00:05:27.629> a--<00:05:27.659> do<00:05:27.780> they<00:05:27.900> make<00:05:28.050> a<00:05:28.080> difference

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
at DN a-- do they make a difference

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.970 
at DN a-- do they make a difference
so<00:05:30.640> I<00:05:30.670> guess<00:05:30.910> that<00:05:30.940> differentiates<00:05:31.840> a<00:05:32.290> bit<00:05:32.770> the

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
so I guess that differentiates a bit the

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.530 
so I guess that differentiates a bit the
experience<00:05:33.490> you<00:05:33.670> would<00:05:33.760> typically<00:05:34.120> get<00:05:34.390> in

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
experience you would typically get in

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.860 
experience you would typically get in
the<00:05:34.630> three<00:05:34.810> star<00:05:34.990> hotel
