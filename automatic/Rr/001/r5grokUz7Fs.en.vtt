machine the acceleration as well it's
really<00:01:36.160> good<00:01:36.580> because<00:01:36.700> under<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.270> 1600

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
really good because under the 1600

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
when it comes to the handling as well

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.780

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
when you hit into the corners it really

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.490 
when you hit into the corners it really
go<00:01:45.910> to<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.240> apex<00:01:46.600> where<00:01:46.870> you<00:01:47.020> want<00:01:47.230> it<00:01:47.380> to

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
go to the apex where you want it to

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.170 
go to the apex where you want it to
reach<00:01:47.650> and<00:01:48.190> you're<00:01:48.400> able<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:48.670> just<00:01:48.910> rather

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
reach and you're able to just rather

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.770 
reach and you're able to just rather
than

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.660 

till<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.050> car<00:01:52.320> just<00:01:52.560> talks<00:01:52.860> back<00:01:53.160> and

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
till the car just talks back and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.610 
till the car just talks back and
actually<00:01:54.060> fits<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.900> the<00:01:54.990> power<00:01:55.230> onto

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
actually fits in on to the power onto

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.280 
actually fits in on to the power onto
the<00:01:55.920> tarmac<00:01:56.190> I<00:01:56.670> really<00:01:57.420> do<00:01:57.570> enjoy<00:01:57.690> it<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.080> is<00:01:58.260> a

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the tarmac I really do enjoy it it is a

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.580 
the tarmac I really do enjoy it it is a
bit<00:01:58.470> of<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.620> fun<00:01:58.890> car<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.160> drive

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.880 

naturally<00:02:06.520> I<00:02:06.850> kind<00:02:07.180> of<00:02:07.270> judgment<00:02:07.869> and

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
naturally I kind of judgment and

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.480 
naturally I kind of judgment and
good<00:02:09.100> off

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
good off

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.340 
good off
we<00:02:10.730> feel<00:02:10.910> like<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:11.120> dune<00:02:11.420> buggy<00:02:11.720> and

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.290 

surprisingly<00:02:15.350> it's<00:02:15.680> not<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.610> it's<00:02:16.940> actually

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
surprisingly it's not and it's actually

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.630 
surprisingly it's not and it's actually
quite<00:02:17.480> well<00:02:17.810> grounded<00:02:18.110> from<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.130> performance

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
quite well grounded from a performance

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.240 
quite well grounded from a performance
point<00:02:19.790> of<00:02:19.940> view<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.270> drives<00:02:20.540> very<00:02:20.720> well<00:02:21.260> and

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
point of view it drives very well and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.480 
point of view it drives very well and
surprisingly<00:02:22.880> it<00:02:23.210> handles<00:02:23.870> like<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.080> go-kart

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
surprisingly it handles like a go-kart

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:34.580 
surprisingly it handles like a go-kart
it<00:02:25.490> sticks<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.390> road

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.780 

when<00:02:35.590> we<00:02:35.680> saw<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.920> Sigma<00:02:36.280> this<00:02:36.400> morning<00:02:36.700> I

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
when we saw the Sigma this morning I

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.880 
when we saw the Sigma this morning I
certainly<00:02:37.150> thought<00:02:37.450> this<00:02:37.690> was<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:38.050> naughty<00:02:38.590> car

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
certainly thought this was a naughty car

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.680 
certainly thought this was a naughty car
a<00:02:38.920> very<00:02:39.310> small<00:02:39.700> toy<00:02:40.000> car<00:02:40.270> that<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:40.570> can

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
a very small toy car that you can

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.970 
a very small toy car that you can
actually<00:02:40.930> pick<00:02:41.080> up<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.350> put<00:02:41.530> in<00:02:41.680> your<00:02:41.800> pocket

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
actually pick up and put in your pocket

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.640 
actually pick up and put in your pocket
and<00:02:42.430> walk<00:02:42.640> away<00:02:42.910> with<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.210> but<00:02:43.900> I<00:02:44.290> was<00:02:44.470> quite

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
and walk away with it but I was quite

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.500 
and walk away with it but I was quite
surprising<00:02:45.070> gentle<00:02:45.460> by<00:02:45.520> handling<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.120> way<00:02:46.360> it

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
surprising gentle by handling the way it

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.270 
surprising gentle by handling the way it
looks<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:47.200> really<00:02:47.260> drives<00:02:47.740> well<00:02:47.950> out<00:02:48.100> of<00:02:48.130> a

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
looks it really drives well out of a

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.820 
looks it really drives well out of a
1600<00:02:48.880> it's<00:02:49.030> nice<00:02:49.210> light<00:02:49.570> weight<00:02:49.600> but<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.710> only
