one<00:00:28.109> or<00:00:28.260> whatever<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:29.519> just<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:30.090> such

a<00:00:30.300> intricate<00:00:30.869> material<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:31.980> pretty

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
a intricate material it's pretty

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.100 
a intricate material it's pretty
ridiculous

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
ridiculous

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.190 
ridiculous
it's<00:00:34.950> definitely<00:00:35.399> like<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> knit<00:00:35.989> upper<00:00:36.989> if<00:00:37.110> you

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
it's definitely like a knit upper if you

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.069 
it's definitely like a knit upper if you
guys<00:00:37.350> haven't<00:00:37.739> seen<00:00:38.390> these<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.629> person<00:00:39.989> before

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
guys haven't seen these in person before

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.380 
guys haven't seen these in person before
it's<00:00:40.440> pretty<00:00:40.710> pretty<00:00:41.550> ridiculous<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.239> very

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
it's pretty pretty ridiculous and very

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.850 
it's pretty pretty ridiculous and very
lightweight<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.940> it's<00:00:44.940> definitely<00:00:45.300> a

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
lightweight and it's definitely a

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.170 
lightweight and it's definitely a
breathable<00:00:46.860> material<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.850> think<00:00:48.059> that

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
breathable material and I think that

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.330 
breathable material and I think that
that's<00:00:48.329> probably<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.829> best<00:00:49.860> part<00:00:50.190> about

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
that's probably the the best part about

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.850 
that's probably the the best part about
it<00:00:50.520> now<00:00:50.789> then<00:00:51.300> here's<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.870> chiku's<00:00:52.260> or<00:00:52.800> the

from<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.680> distance<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.220> can<00:01:26.250> see<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.869> part

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
from a distance you can see so one part

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.569 
from a distance you can see so one part
of<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.350> shoe<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:29.009> love<00:01:29.189> again

extremely<00:01:30.240> lightweight<00:01:30.689> actually<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
extremely lightweight actually the the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.539 
extremely lightweight actually the the
checkers<00:01:32.280> are<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.820> think<00:01:33.119> probably<00:01:33.450> lighter

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
checkers are I think probably lighter

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.130 
checkers are I think probably lighter
it's<00:01:35.549> close<00:01:35.909> between<00:01:36.180> those<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.780> Lunars

a<00:01:58.320> shoe<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:58.860> actually<00:01:59.100> wear

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
a shoe that you can actually wear

without socks which I thought was

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.630 
without socks which I thought was

what he thought of these they're very
snug<00:02:33.519> and<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:35.260> downside<00:02:35.769> for<00:02:36.010> me<00:02:36.040> like<00:02:36.430> if<00:02:36.700> you

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
right here is super duper tight and it

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.640 
right here is super duper tight and it
may<00:02:42.909> like<00:02:43.299> it<00:02:43.329> really<00:02:44.049> kind<00:02:44.260> of<00:02:44.349> uncomfortable

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
may like it really kind of uncomfortable

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.210 
may like it really kind of uncomfortable
for<00:02:44.980> me<00:02:45.099> so<00:02:45.340> that<00:02:45.939> area<00:02:46.269> right<00:02:47.200> here<00:02:47.260> too<00:02:47.980> tight

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
for me so that area right here too tight

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.240 
for me so that area right here too tight
and<00:02:48.569> it<00:02:49.569> maybe<00:02:49.930> be<00:02:50.349> I<00:02:50.379> don't<00:02:50.650> know<00:02:50.709> why<00:02:50.919> but

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
and it maybe be I don't know why but

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.129 
and it maybe be I don't know why but
because<00:02:51.879> the<00:02:52.060> arc<00:02:52.209> of<00:02:52.510> my<00:02:52.659> foot<00:02:52.900> or<00:02:53.019> something

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
because the arc of my foot or something

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.300 
because the arc of my foot or something
makes<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.620> bigger<00:02:53.799> there<00:02:54.010> I'm<00:02:54.129> not<00:02:54.250> sure

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
I guess of these sneakers so something

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.830 
I guess of these sneakers so something
that<00:03:10.480> would<00:03:10.629> wear<00:03:10.810> these<00:03:10.930> shoes<00:03:11.310> casually

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
that would wear these shoes casually

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.289 
that would wear these shoes casually
these<00:03:13.840> ones<00:03:14.079> fit<00:03:14.680> too<00:03:14.829> snug<00:03:15.129> for<00:03:15.489> me<00:03:15.609> I<00:03:15.819> mean

these ones fit too snug for me I mean

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:17.640 
these ones fit too snug for me I mean
obviously<00:03:16.419> if<00:03:16.810> you're<00:03:16.959> running<00:03:17.290> with<00:03:17.409> them<00:03:17.530> it

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
obviously if you're running with them it

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.740 
obviously if you're running with them it
might<00:03:17.799> be<00:03:17.919> good<00:03:18.069> and<00:03:18.459> obviously<00:03:18.669> that's<00:03:19.479> the

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
might be good and obviously that's the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.050 
might be good and obviously that's the
main<00:03:19.930> attraction<00:03:20.739> of<00:03:20.829> those<00:03:20.979> guys<00:03:21.190> so<00:03:21.459> I'm

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
main attraction of those guys so I'm

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.610 
main attraction of those guys so I'm
sure<00:03:22.329> that<00:03:22.359> those<00:03:22.840> actually<00:03:23.349> are<00:03:23.440> really

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
sure that those actually are really

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.710 
sure that those actually are really
really<00:03:23.949> good<00:03:24.340> for<00:03:24.549> runners<00:03:24.879> but<00:03:25.090> for<00:03:25.359> me<00:03:25.449> again

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
really good for runners but for me again

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.789 
really good for runners but for me again
that<00:03:25.870> there<00:03:26.079> was<00:03:26.169> a<00:03:26.229> little<00:03:26.439> bit<00:03:26.560> of

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
that there was a little bit of

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.550 
that there was a little bit of
discomfort<00:03:27.389> out<00:03:28.389> of<00:03:28.569> all<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.959> three<00:03:29.109> I'd<00:03:29.349> say

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
discomfort out of all the three I'd say

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.349 
discomfort out of all the three I'd say
that<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:30.040> chukkas<00:03:30.549> are<00:03:30.699> the<00:03:30.849> choucas<00:03:31.209> or

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
that the chukkas are the choucas or

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:32.399 
that the chukkas are the choucas or
whatever<00:03:31.629> you<00:03:31.780> want<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:31.959> call<00:03:32.079> them<00:03:32.229> more

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:32.409 
whatever you want to call them more

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.559 
whatever you want to call them more
definitely<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.949> most<00:03:33.069> comfortable<00:03:33.579> I<00:03:33.760> was

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569

tried<00:03:51.819> them<00:03:51.970> on<00:03:52.090> yet<00:03:52.829> but<00:03:53.829> I<00:03:54.099> actually<00:03:54.430> do<00:03:54.939> if<00:03:55.090> I

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
tried them on yet but I actually do if I

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.270 
tried them on yet but I actually do if I
had<00:03:55.329> to<00:03:55.389> compare<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:56.199> three<00:03:56.229> like<00:03:56.769> in<00:03:56.949> in<00:03:57.189> a

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
had to compare the three like in in a

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.369 
had to compare the three like in in a
tear<00:03:57.519> I<00:03:57.549> definitely<00:03:58.090> would<00:03:58.209> say<00:03:58.419> the<00:03:59.139> the

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
tear I definitely would say the the

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.839 
tear I definitely would say the the
checkers<00:03:59.739> are<00:03:59.919> the<00:04:00.009> most<00:04:00.189> comfortable<00:04:00.430> then

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
checkers are the most comfortable then

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.569 
checkers are the most comfortable then

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
you got the the Flyknit Lunars and then

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.610 
you got the the Flyknit Lunars and then
you<00:04:04.120> have<00:04:04.239> the<00:04:04.359> flying<00:04:04.569> it<00:04:04.689> frees<00:04:04.959> somebody

might<00:04:07.389> might<00:04:08.040> disagree<00:04:09.040> but<00:04:09.909> this<00:04:10.389> is<00:04:10.509> just<00:04:10.720> my

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
might might disagree but this is just my

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.179

opinion on them on the matter for

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:13.610 
opinion on them on the matter for
somebody<00:04:12.430> that's<00:04:12.549> not<00:04:12.819> a<00:04:12.849> runner<00:04:13.090> and
