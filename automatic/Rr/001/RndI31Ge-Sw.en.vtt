00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.240
 hello friends a warm greeting from your 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.580
 coach marcelo today accompany me 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.260
 milk what we're going to work the part 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.090
 upper abdomen 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.640
 the abdomen area like any other 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.260
 muscle you have to work it then but 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.119
 I like it, you can find it 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.800
 on my back what I like 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.410
 to do is divide the muscle and 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.029
 work them separately today we are going to 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.699
 work only the top 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.710
 doing crunch is but first 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.769
 main I always have something that the 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.190
 people call my attention most of 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:41.769
 90% people do them in the exercise 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.320
 branch rap for example latino is going to 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.120
 show and I do not recommend that they do 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.830
 in this way because Latin is 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.750
 showing the wrong way to do 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.370
 crouch is how you can talk about you is 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.129
 bending the neck and looking at the 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.229
 knees is a very much spoken way 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.269
 why because we put a lot of pressure on 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.129
 the neck and we do not concentrate on the 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.559
 upper part of the abdomen that is where 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.180
 I want them to work ok then what 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.440
 let's do let's demonstrate the way 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.280
 correct to crochet 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.500
 to three different types of people for 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.440
 the beginners we are going to put the 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.120
 Right hands in front of you and 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.250
 you're going to give your hands to the ceiling like 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.170
 you can see this part for this is the 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.300
 beginners way I will take away the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.640
 little hands towards the ceiling and his neck is 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.160
 always straight and part of me concentrates 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.560
 upper abdomen now for the 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.610
 the intermediates we will put our hands 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.290
 behind the head and we raise the part 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.730
 upper body enter into 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.670
 up and the look always towards the 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.590
 roof and for the most advanced we are going to 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.530
 lift your legs and lety is going to 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.720
 touch the faint or lower part of 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.820
 legs and his neck is always 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.590
 right now I can rest 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.440
 then we're going to do that we're going to 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.020
 do a set of 20 repetitions per 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.510
 exercise and for better results it 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.000
 you can repeat these three to five sets 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.090
 well, digitally, we're going with the 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.840

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.870
