00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.150
 I believe that the evolution of the species 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.510
 human in the generally accepted sense 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.639
 is over darwin has defined the evolution 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.200
 in two words the offspring and the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.480
 change of facts that she can 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.109
 translate this definition into language 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.449
 modern 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.270
 evolution is genetics and more 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.970
 the time that's all there is and this 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.400
 continues but most people when 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.869
 he talks about evolution refer to this 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.119
 that darwin calls the selection 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.340
 natural that denotes the differences 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.739
 hereditary, whether or not 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.530
 reproduction before its keyword 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.530
 differences without difference there is no 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.640
 devolution 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.710
 I think natural selection 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.250
 ceased to operate because of this 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.140
 difference 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.030
 andry are three centuries in london and 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.910
 also in paris two children out of three 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.399
 did not reach the age of 21 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.190
 today 99% or more of the new 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.539
 born are still alive at 21 years old there 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.920
 is no difference in the chances of 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.530
 survival books 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.030
 finally today the evolution is 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.650
 translated by a change in the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.330
 frequency of certain genes when we get 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.689
 walks the streets of london 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.180
 Paris 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.799
 we see that the genetic profile of 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.180
 London residents who is very 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.330
 different from what it was in my 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.330
 childhood 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.909
 it was very rare to come across a black to 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.140
 london in the 50's 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.520
 today almost half of 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.670
 London residents are not 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.560
 of European origin ehf eyes when we 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.509
 observe the children of london one of whom 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.220
 parents is a black of the Caribbean 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.900
 half of them have another 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.310
 parent white bucket concretely the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.189
 barrier between these two groups has 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.280
 gone we are witnessing a great miscegenation 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.689
 that causes genetic change 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.820
 considerable in london not stud and this 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.890
 it's the evolution 6 pins formerly 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.750
 evolution accentuated the differences 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.090
 between people today 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.430
 curiously she tends to bring them closer 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.020
 as they mix 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.969
 maybe the big change 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.969
 evolution leads to bini for me tais
