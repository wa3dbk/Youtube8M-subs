00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.060
 while a German team

 who this Merkel's actor Martin Lauer the inventor of the competition

 her most important team member curiously her self-driving research car Handyman 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.290
 from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.289
 every day training test drives evaluations 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.039
 the researchers are facing scientific challenges 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:51.570
 will be waived for their performance 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.810
 For the first time he also had to be Gnome's author along with others 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.810
 Vehicles show what it can do 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.070
 It is so that all the communication between vehicles still has problems 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.640
 can prepare because we could not know it with other vehicles 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.070
 with our own vehicles 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.870
 and just because the question of driving the vehicle so accelerate and slow down 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.380
 Also there you have to look that we are really for sure 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.270
 they work on the technique of revision 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.540
 in future, the car of tomorrow will control itself 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.909
 then this comes 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.700
 Automobile car 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.360
 see what 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.240
 then understand that they exist 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.229
 in what it understands underneath should guarantee that no drive 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.369
 would like and this maneuver then moves out around 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.620
 and it is like that 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.620
 long-term protection accident-free drives 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.520

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.850
 UL 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.890
 they should learn cars 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.850
 Into the human intuitively Freezers model 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.780
 5 helpless at first but Martin Lauer has programmed the software like this 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.400
 that the computer learns from mistakes in the end drives the car correctly and as at 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.399
 Driving students helps a reward 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:15.790
 when I feed here also at the World Association Doria or something but 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:19.679
 of course this is mathematically modeled, that is, the whole becomes 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:23.359
 case pictured above corporate numbers provides such a number especially 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:27.569
 is great then it is just very high rewards the number is small 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.479
 or even negative numbers that can interpret the punishment of 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:33.239
 his 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.050
 the caterpillars 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.319
 So now has to learn 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.439
 especially learning to see 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.439
 For that, the researchers drive again and again for dispute 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.049
 The laser scanner and cameras are created 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.999
 b the federal government 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.999
 calculated as in the scenarios 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.479
 Picture Henning meyer-veer 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.479
 traffic situations 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.230
 long ago no future, the autonomous pure packing 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.489
 since March 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.719
 while 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:05.760
 the PS 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.000
 and motion sensors, the vehicle calculates its position 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.749
 Dr 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:17.099
 today, small self decides well 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.989
 the system is already much faster than human drivers today 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:21.970
 means we see 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.910
 Nr with a speed of a few milliseconds 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.160
 because as a human you literally become the moment of terror when you govern 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.400
 that is, if we can perceive names as well as humans 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.659
 can get wet in a few years 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.659
 then we have the speed advantage 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:42.819
 with the moment of shock of the drivers, there is still Paris today 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:49.009
 the future decides the car one of the first that communicates with others 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:52.029
 knows exactly how the traffic is limited 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:58.089
 The electric cars ride in a row without traffic jams and save them quietly 

00:03:58.089 --> 00:04:01.089
 and safer when he killed people 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:09.349
 that is precisely the challenge researchers have in the competition Iran has 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.450
 several hundred million Bernd Edtbauer was bitten 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.389
 be justified 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.689
 while they say their car has to drive a convoy 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:24.759
 and that with the help of the data of the vehicles the competition 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.779
 Benzema was and his son's communications market 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.830
 what was that missing? 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.300
 The authors assume work in the brakes 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.899
 Competition had to address safety to a person for emergency handling 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.330
 nevertheless the communication is 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.419
 not to forget 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.509
 The objectives Shipping company of the border control Recipes Riding Saleh prevails in the 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.720
 Netherlands does not create all cars 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.560
 Keep as close a distance as possible 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.439
 to transmit correctly 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:06.289
 that projects and drives faster again Rank displace green spaces 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.020
 The communication fails should they be able to go 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.550
 this is still the challenge in the future with the help of communication 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.770
 to drive in a convoy 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.400
 3 4 percent 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.270
 that gets the German team to feel 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.960
 a truck driver they are now no signal 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.270
 50 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.029
 at the Moselle Berlin 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:33.550
 the car almost stops but then keeps enough distance 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.389
 the position determination via wireless LAN and radar functions 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:46.419
 TAKKT no convoy trips are stoked 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.600
 whether they won that they learn later for human rights 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.970
 For us it was the first time he drove something with the new cooperative 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:59.319
 that they have been the first time in the evening and for that 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:03.100
 Your recruiter certainly then also consider the integration can 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:06.099
 in the further research so it is already a pulse 4 and 7 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:09.469
 I am firmly convinced that it makes sense 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:14.610
 not even 20 years will say that his car in itself so rare cases 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.610
 after the plane or train 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.680
 Smoke detector 12 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.979
 Capello stops 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:25.960
 Can a father teams from all over Europe have won them 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.400
 the Karlsruher are no longer one step closer to their visions of the traffic of the future
