00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 hey what's off the welcome 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.350
 to my very first live.com terry 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.660
 a round here on domination 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.830
 storefront just as is the map the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.389
 I do not really like that at all though 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.799
 I figured I'll try 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.240
 to record my live.com terry for 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:26.099
 you enemy satcom what was up there 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:28.199
 but one I believe and ok I have to 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.970
 the time to focus briefly runs quite 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.650
 good so far the start-five kills already 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.790
 time made 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.880
 I play all the ak 12 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.920
 muffler magazin attitude I think 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.940
 So without a backlash I play I find myself 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.160
 actually really cool is the case 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.450
 that no idea should be on everyone 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.520
 If you do not, do it around here if I am 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.420
 now in the middle of the map then runs 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.420
 I will definitely die 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.340
 sorry people only now a live 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.100
 concert is coming because I know the live 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.090
 come ace you celebrate me most of all 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.860
 but I wanted to stop me first so 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.570
 a tick import goes two otherwise 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:15.780
 I'm gonna shit totally oh my 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.710
 god that a burden I'm worth 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.390
 I thought I was dead 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.100
 ok i think i should pack this one 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.290
 take along where you live faster 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.820
 regenerated again 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:32.990
 it's kind of red for a long time 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.990
 I find ok 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:41.329
 where are the opponents i have no idea 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:46.640
 I do not shit up there 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:47.990
 you do not get hung up so people walk 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.240
 do not expect too much from me 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.979
 I doubt that I have a camp now 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.170
 reach track live there would once so 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.170
 difficult dominance as I think 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.810
 but now they really need it 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:12.950
 naked I see people I do not see 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:15.250
 often do not know where is behind 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.250
 is one 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.959
 ok service build now i have zero 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.239
 I suppose I have him on maybe 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.049
 once played 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.410
 I usually go out there because 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:33.590
 which is as big as we lose 10 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.340
 Okay then we're going right here 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:41.660
 I have long been a god's champion 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.459
 it is already close to now special 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.700
 chill people now I have to be defensive 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.850
 play shit no matter how long it takes 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.510
 main thing camps track i would be like this 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.510

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:17.750

 I already have 17 0 age I have to 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:34.340
 play really defensive I'm so nervous 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:36.790
 now we lose a run 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.740

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.850

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:47.870

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:57.500
 By the way, the teams loose the rendels 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:00.140

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.240

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.650
 here and there and on the 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.650
 wait a bit for the opponents 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.920
 OK 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.579
