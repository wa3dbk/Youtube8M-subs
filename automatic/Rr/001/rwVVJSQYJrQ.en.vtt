00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.360 
it's a really nice view I there are so

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.640 
it's a really nice view I there are so
many<00:00:08.420> crystals<00:00:10.990> what's<00:00:11.990> causing<00:00:12.349> the

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
many crystals what's causing the

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.070 
many crystals what's causing the
crystals

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
crystals

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.599

what<00:00:15.559> is<00:00:15.650> the<00:00:15.740> experience<00:00:16.070> e1<00:00:16.430> that<00:00:16.490> would

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
what is the experience e1 that would

what is the experience e1 that would
cause<00:00:16.820> crystals<00:00:17.480> that's<00:00:17.750> the<00:00:17.930> question<00:00:18.230> he's

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
cause crystals that's the question he's

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.820 
cause crystals that's the question he's
experimenting<00:00:19.160> with<00:00:19.310> this<00:00:19.460> crystal<00:00:19.759> magic

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
experimenting with this crystal magic

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.679 
experimenting with this crystal magic
what<00:00:21.830> is<00:00:21.980> safe<00:00:22.279> what<00:00:22.609> is<00:00:22.730> unique<00:00:23.090> about<00:00:23.240> seed

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
what is safe what is unique about seed

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.390

to give to to the right in the direction
are<00:00:42.579> you<00:00:42.700> doing<00:00:43.000> these<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:48.250> guess<00:00:48.489> are<00:00:48.640> you

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
are you doing these I guess are you

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.470 
are you doing these I guess are you
asking<00:00:49.210> asking<00:00:49.390> are<00:00:49.899> you<00:00:50.110> just<00:00:50.530> musing

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
asking asking are you just musing

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:01.250 
asking asking are you just musing
conjecture<00:00:55.500> stop<00:00:56.500> it<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:59.680> light<00:01:00.040> the<00:01:00.250> way

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
conjecture stop it like light the way

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:11.279 
conjecture stop it like light the way
I'm<00:01:02.260> so<00:01:02.470> scared<00:01:02.739> to<00:01:02.800> look<00:01:02.890> at<00:01:03.010> my<00:01:03.129> Chad<00:01:10.110> keep<00:01:11.110> on

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
I'm so scared to look at my Chad keep on

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.550 
I'm so scared to look at my Chad keep on
trying<00:01:11.619> bro<00:01:11.890> can't<00:01:12.490> try<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:12.940> dark<00:01:13.479> magic<00:01:14.170> shit

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
trying bro can't try the dark magic shit

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.359 
trying bro can't try the dark magic shit
with<00:01:14.860> me

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
with me

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.300

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
keep on trying there's a glowing thing

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.060 
keep on trying there's a glowing thing
over<00:01:18.550> no<00:01:18.670> that's<00:01:18.850> just<00:01:18.940> a<00:01:19.180> thing<00:01:19.710> hmm

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
over no that's just a thing hmm

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.120 
over no that's just a thing hmm
I<00:01:21.100> feel<00:01:21.700> like<00:01:21.850> these<00:01:22.030> lights<00:01:22.360> of<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.630> key

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
I feel like these lights of the key

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:32.600 
I feel like these lights of the key
you're<00:01:24.130> leading<00:01:24.310> me<00:01:24.429> somewhere<00:01:27.600> yeah<00:01:30.660> yeah

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
you're leading me somewhere yeah yeah

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.469 
you're leading me somewhere yeah yeah
okay<00:01:33.610> feel<00:01:33.789> like<00:01:33.880> this<00:01:34.000> is<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.119> way<00:01:34.179> that<00:01:34.360> they

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
okay feel like this is the way that they

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:43.109 
okay feel like this is the way that they
led<00:01:34.660> me<00:01:34.690> before<00:01:36.539> yeah<00:01:39.000> maybe<00:01:41.369> some<00:01:42.369> dots<00:01:42.729> but

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
led me before yeah maybe some dots but

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.929 
led me before yeah maybe some dots but
these<00:01:43.270> dots<00:01:43.630> supposed<00:01:43.960> to<00:01:44.049> be<00:01:44.259> for<00:01:44.939> there's

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
these dots supposed to be for there's

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.130 
these dots supposed to be for there's
that<00:01:47.130> follow<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.310> dots

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
that follow the dots

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.660 
that follow the dots
there's<00:01:50.140> no<00:01:50.290> not<00:01:50.439> that's<00:01:50.710> this<00:01:50.860> way<00:01:51.009> let's<00:01:51.490> ask

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
there's no not that's this way let's ask

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.440 
there's no not that's this way let's ask
to<00:01:51.759> be<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:51.939> wrong<00:01:52.090> way<00:01:54.600> maybe<00:01:55.600> I<00:01:57.119> look<00:01:58.119> up<00:01:58.299> and

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
to be the wrong way maybe I look up and

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.380 
to be the wrong way maybe I look up and
I<00:01:58.479> see<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.689> mechanism<00:01:58.810> one<00:01:59.259> level<00:01:59.439> up

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.169 

there<00:02:04.390> are<00:02:04.509> a<00:02:04.570> lot<00:02:04.750> of<00:02:04.869> dots<00:02:05.170> here

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.890 

oh<00:02:08.319> this<00:02:09.319> is<00:02:09.470> new<00:02:09.679> this<00:02:11.019> is<00:02:12.019> fake

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
oh this is new this is fake

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.569 
oh this is new this is fake

maybe there's this open somehow with

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.809 
maybe there's this open somehow with
another<00:02:16.790> lever

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
another lever

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.030 
another lever
there's<00:02:19.819> old<00:02:19.939> many<00:02:20.269> many<00:02:20.599> dots<00:02:20.870> around<00:02:21.590> that

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
there's old many many dots around that

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.849 
there's old many many dots around that
bookcase<00:02:22.879> in<00:02:23.090> particular<00:02:24.099> there's<00:02:25.099> a<00:02:25.159> thing

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.509 

giant<00:02:40.909> selkie<00:02:41.359> okay<00:02:42.249> there's<00:02:43.249> this<00:02:43.310> like

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
giant selkie okay there's this like

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.660 
giant selkie okay there's this like
treadmill<00:02:43.969> thing<00:02:44.650> it's<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.739> collapsible<00:02:46.099> stair

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
treadmill thing it's a collapsible stair

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:55.660 
treadmill thing it's a collapsible stair
there's<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.540> ladder<00:02:47.780> okay<00:02:48.909> yeah<00:02:52.749> sure<00:02:54.609> what<00:02:55.609> are

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
there's a ladder okay yeah sure what are

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:04.780 
there's a ladder okay yeah sure what are
you<00:02:55.760> are<00:02:56.599> you<00:02:56.659> the<00:02:56.959> one<00:02:57.079> doing<00:02:57.409> those<00:03:03.730> did<00:03:04.730> you

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
do him into him of the Giants I was

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.039 
do him into him of the Giants I was
hoping<00:03:10.849> the<00:03:11.030> lever<00:03:11.269> would<00:03:11.510> keep<00:03:11.749> you<00:03:11.900> looking
