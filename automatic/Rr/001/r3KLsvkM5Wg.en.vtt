00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
website and the reason I decided to make

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.289 
website and the reason I decided to make
a<00:01:12.990> website<00:01:13.229> was<00:01:13.680> because<00:01:14.070> there<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.729> only<00:01:14.820> so

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
a website was because there is only so

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.960

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
because videos take a really long time

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.210 
because videos take a really long time
to<00:01:20.460> make<00:01:20.640> much<00:01:21.119> more<00:01:21.420> than<00:01:22.049> an<00:01:22.439> article<00:01:22.979> with
