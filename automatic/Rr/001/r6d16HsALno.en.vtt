ingredients are mixed together nicely

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.300 
ingredients are mixed together nicely
you<00:01:10.080> can<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.380> tip<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.770> with<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> plain

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.999 
flour and then mix it all together and
it<00:01:13.770> should<00:01:13.979> kind<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.460> form<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:15.000> dough<00:01:15.750> like

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
it should kind of form a dough like

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.190 
it should kind of form a dough like
consistency<00:01:17.009> which<00:01:17.700> isn't<00:01:18.060> too<00:01:18.240> hard<00:01:18.869> but<00:01:19.140> not

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
consistency which isn't too hard but not

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
too soft like that and then you can add

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.750 
too soft like that and then you can add
in<00:01:21.180> your<00:01:21.360> egg

half<00:01:33.070> into<00:01:33.700> little<00:01:34.000> cubes<00:01:34.240> and<00:01:34.659> these<00:01:35.440> are

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
half into little cubes and these are

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.109 
half into little cubes and these are
going<00:01:35.619> to<00:01:35.710> be<00:01:35.800> the<00:01:35.890> chocolate<00:01:36.100> chips<00:01:36.490> so<00:01:36.820> then

just pop them into your mixture I like
doing<00:01:40.540> this<00:01:40.600> better<00:01:40.780> because<00:01:40.990> they're<00:01:41.590> bigger

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
doing this better because they're bigger

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.410 
doing this better because they're bigger
instead<00:01:42.400> of<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.640> regular<00:01:42.790> shop-bought

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
instead of the regular shop-bought

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
well this is just what I like to do so

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.870 
well this is just what I like to do so
mix<00:01:47.320> them<00:01:47.470> in<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:47.800> then<00:01:48.009> you<00:01:48.130> can<00:01:48.280> grease<00:01:48.550> your

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
mix them in and then you can grease your

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.510 
mix them in and then you can grease your
pan<00:01:48.909> and<00:01:49.509> just<00:01:50.080> plot<00:01:50.560> all<00:01:50.860> of<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.130> mixture

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
pan and just plot all of the mixture

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.719 
pan and just plot all of the mixture
onto<00:01:52.149> the<00:01:52.630> pan<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:53.080> spread<00:01:53.200> it<00:01:53.409> out<00:01:53.500> evenly<00:01:53.729> my

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
onto the pan and spread it out evenly my

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.270 
onto the pan and spread it out evenly my
baking<00:01:55.090> tin<00:01:55.300> is<00:01:55.540> quite<00:01:55.840> long<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:56.619> thin<00:01:56.890> so<00:01:57.070> my

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
baking tin is quite long and thin so my

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.889 
baking tin is quite long and thin so my
brownies<00:01:57.580> came<00:01:57.759> out<00:01:57.909> quite<00:01:58.149> thin<00:01:58.390> but<00:01:58.420> you<00:01:58.660> can

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
brownies came out quite thin but you can

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.419 
brownies came out quite thin but you can
also<00:01:59.229> use<00:01:59.380> a<00:01:59.560> smaller<00:01:59.890> dish<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:00.310> your

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
also use a smaller dish and your

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.370 
also use a smaller dish and your
brownies<00:02:00.700> will<00:02:00.820> be<00:02:00.940> thicker<00:02:01.149> then<00:02:01.960> pop<00:02:02.200> them

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
brownies will be thicker then pop them

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.290 
brownies will be thicker then pop them
in<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.590> oven<00:02:02.770> for<00:02:02.890> eight<00:02:03.310> minutes<00:02:03.580> once<00:02:04.149> your

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
put them in the microwave to melt once

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.990

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
checking on them because chocolate can

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.750 
checking on them because chocolate can
burn<00:02:14.800> really<00:02:15.250> quickly<00:02:15.550> if<00:02:15.640> you're<00:02:15.700> not

make<00:02:23.350> sure<00:02:23.650> that<00:02:23.890> there's<00:02:24.069> not<00:02:24.160> too<00:02:24.220> much

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
make sure that there's not too much

is<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.860> doesn't<00:02:26.890> really<00:02:27.220> matter<00:02:27.459> because<00:02:27.730> they

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
is it doesn't really matter because they

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.750 
is it doesn't really matter because they
harden<00:02:28.930> up<00:02:29.110> in<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.590> fridge<00:02:29.860> anyway<00:02:30.250> so<00:02:30.459> don't

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
harden up in the fridge anyway so don't

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.430 
harden up in the fridge anyway so don't
worry<00:02:30.910> about<00:02:31.030> that<00:02:31.299> and<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:31.989> really<00:02:32.230> don't

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
worry about that and you really don't

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.810 
worry about that and you really don't
want<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.680> over<00:02:32.950> bake<00:02:33.130> them<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:33.640> make<00:02:33.790> sure
