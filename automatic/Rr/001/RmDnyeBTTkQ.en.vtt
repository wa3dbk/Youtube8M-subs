00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850

do that I'm just gonna talk about the
stupid<00:00:16.410> ones<00:00:16.619> based<00:00:17.369> on<00:00:17.609> design<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.000> how<00:00:18.359> well

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
stupid ones based on design and how well

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.420 
stupid ones based on design and how well
they<00:00:18.779> changed<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.410> from<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.740> original<00:00:20.279> design

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
they changed it from the original design

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.210 
they changed it from the original design
not<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.270> much<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.689> how<00:00:21.779> strong<00:00:22.170> they<00:00:22.320> are<00:00:22.350> only

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
not so much and how strong they are only

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.980 
not so much and how strong they are only
one<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:23.730> list<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:24.210> based<00:00:24.449> on<00:00:24.660> strength

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
one on this list is based on strength

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.990 
one on this list is based on strength
'fl<00:00:25.230> you'll<00:00:25.410> know<00:00:25.619> which<00:00:25.800> one<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.099> all<00:00:26.670> of

'fl you'll know which one it is all of
the<00:00:27.119> Megas<00:00:27.420> have<00:00:27.630> good<00:00:27.840> stats<00:00:28.170> well<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.039> is

the Megas have good stats well that is

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.620 
the Megas have good stats well that is
the<00:00:29.369> whole<00:00:29.550> point<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.269> mega<00:00:30.510> evolution

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
the whole point of the mega evolution

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.530 
the whole point of the mega evolution
thing<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.769> wasn't<00:00:32.219> just<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.669> give<00:00:32.820> scissor<00:00:33.210> way

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
thing it wasn't just to give scissor way

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.110 
thing it wasn't just to give scissor way
bigger<00:00:33.899> clamps<00:00:34.590> what<00:00:35.070> I'm<00:00:35.130> trying<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.520> say<00:00:35.790> is

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
bigger clamps what I'm trying to say is

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.610 
bigger clamps what I'm trying to say is
that<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:36.480> hard<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.750> judge<00:00:36.989> how<00:00:37.020> bad<00:00:37.410> they<00:00:37.590> are

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
that it's hard to judge how bad they are

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.410 
that it's hard to judge how bad they are
based<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.129> stats<00:00:38.460> when<00:00:38.700> they<00:00:38.790> all<00:00:38.969> have<00:00:39.239> good

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
based on stats when they all have good

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.450 
based on stats when they all have good
stats<00:00:39.780> for<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.170> most<00:00:40.410> part<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:40.980> it's<00:00:41.160> hard<00:00:41.399> to

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
stats for the most part so it's hard to

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.430 
stats for the most part so it's hard to
just<00:00:41.730> say<00:00:41.940> which<00:00:42.180> ones<00:00:42.480> are<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.750> worst<00:00:42.960> since

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
just say which ones are the worst since

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.500 
just say which ones are the worst since
they're<00:00:43.620> all<00:00:43.770> decent<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.550> instead<00:00:44.940> these<00:00:45.450> are

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
they're all decent so instead these are

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:53.160 
they're all decent so instead these are
the<00:00:45.870> top<00:00:46.140> five<00:00:46.460> stupidest<00:00:47.460> mega<00:00:47.700> evolutions

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.560 

number<00:00:54.170> five<00:00:54.410> mega<00:00:54.920> Ampharos<00:00:55.490> okay<00:00:56.210> I<00:00:56.240> have<00:00:56.450> to

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
number five mega Ampharos okay I have to

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.660 
number five mega Ampharos okay I have to
admit<00:00:56.600> I<00:00:57.020> kind<00:00:57.050> of<00:00:57.470> like<00:00:57.620> this<00:00:57.800> mega<00:00:58.070> evolution

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
admit I kind of like this mega evolution

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.600 
admit I kind of like this mega evolution
it<00:00:58.940> just<00:00:59.330> looks<00:00:59.600> so<00:00:59.870> damn<00:01:00.260> fabulous<00:01:00.680> but<00:01:01.490> they

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
it just looks so damn fabulous but they

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.430 
it just looks so damn fabulous but they
didn't<00:01:01.910> really<00:01:02.120> change<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.870> design<00:01:03.020> that

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
didn't really change the design that

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.130 
didn't really change the design that
much<00:01:03.620> they<00:01:04.100> just<00:01:04.370> added<00:01:04.730> hair<00:01:05.120> head<00:01:05.870> a<00:01:05.900> little

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
much they just added hair head a little

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.790 
much they just added hair head a little
tail

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
tail

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.530 
tail
they<00:01:06.980> just<00:01:07.220> made<00:01:07.400> Ampharos<00:01:07.940> ascend<00:01:08.300> to<00:01:08.450> the

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
they just made Ampharos ascend to the

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.540 
they just made Ampharos ascend to the
next<00:01:08.840> level<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:09.230> become<00:01:09.320> a<00:01:09.560> very<00:01:09.830> stylish

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
next level and become a very stylish

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.820 
next level and become a very stylish

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
just dare mega manectric is one of them

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.909

when you go through each mega evolution
it's<00:05:02.069> just<00:05:02.340> like<00:05:02.550> finally<00:05:03.060> he's<00:05:03.569> a<00:05:03.599> dragon

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
it's just like finally he's a dragon

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.460 
it's just like finally he's a dragon
yeah<00:05:04.710> yeah<00:05:05.520> they<00:05:05.729> really<00:05:05.970> made<00:05:06.270> this<00:05:06.470> finally

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
yeah yeah they really made this finally

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.640 
yeah yeah they really made this finally
he's<00:05:07.680> a<00:05:07.710> dragon<00:05:08.099> and<00:05:08.479> majestic<00:05:09.479> yeah<00:05:10.229> that<00:05:10.500> one

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
he's a dragon and majestic yeah that one

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.740 
he's a dragon and majestic yeah that one
a<00:05:10.860> lot<00:05:11.220> of<00:05:11.340> third<00:05:11.580> gen<00:05:11.910> Pokemon<00:05:12.389> got<00:05:12.539> mega

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
a lot of third gen Pokemon got mega

a lot of third gen Pokemon got mega
evolutions<00:05:13.380> Pokemon<00:05:14.069> like<00:05:14.280> banette<00:05:14.699> and

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.790 
evolutions Pokemon like banette and
absol<00:05:15.300> had<00:05:15.479> some<00:05:15.660> wasted<00:05:16.080> potential<00:05:16.650> and

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
absol had some wasted potential and

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.740

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
needed a mega evolution I guess

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.629 
needed a mega evolution I guess
manectric<00:05:19.380> needed<00:05:19.800> to<00:05:19.919> be<00:05:20.039> a<00:05:20.069> bit<00:05:20.280> stronger

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
manectric needed to be a bit stronger

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.040 
manectric needed to be a bit stronger
there<00:05:21.030> probably<00:05:21.389> would<00:05:21.569> have<00:05:21.630> been<00:05:21.750> better<00:05:21.960> to

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
there probably would have been better to

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.540 
there probably would have been better to

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
give manectric and actual third

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.610 
give manectric and actual third
