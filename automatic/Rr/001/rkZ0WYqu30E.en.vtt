00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
 but 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.970
 and everyone 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.970
 and that 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.740
 with 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:19.789
 and is that nobody has endured this football 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.789
 use nothing more 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.420
 friends as they are today I have a 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.600
 legendary recipe that grannies 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.400
 they always carried them out and in addition 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.220
 rain because my mom always told me 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.680
 they eat a lot of gelatin so they grow 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.640
 the nails and that the hair grows later 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.710
 the truth is so the grenetina that then 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.019
 it is the same as the gelatine that 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.900
 we make so delicious colors and 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:55.080
 festive is excellent for our 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.809
 organism that we will not see anything that is the 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.479
 Collagen Collagen is the most protein 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.589
 abundant from our body and from 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:06.750
 of the 25 years we started to stop 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.880
 produce it like me then it's when 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.200
 There are so many little things that touch us like 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.329
 a loss of 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.610
 skin elasticity pains in 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:17.689
 joints eye problems and 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.689
 even of teeth and gums 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.890
 and when we ingest it 2 helps soften 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.960
 the lines of expression to grow the 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.570
 strong hair and inhabitant to have nails 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.340
 very healthy strengthens bones very 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.039
 important especially also in the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.590
 women when we have babies or 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.770
 hormones or menopause those bones 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.960
 as they are not as firm as 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.929
 they wanted and they have also done 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.929
 studies where it says that the grenetina 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:49.170
 they will not believe it I said nothing can not 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.909
 be true but it does help 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.399
 eliminate them the retina is a compound 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.369
 elaborated from the skin and bones of 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:00.909
 several animals its main element is 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.530
 the protein called tail first that 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.409
 I do not want to teach them how to make a gel 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.240
 home that is done so fast is so 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.810
 easy to do and this will help us 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.540
 when we finish our hair there 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.610
 have the damages of commercial gels 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.890
 that sometimes in addition to leaving receipts 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.010
 so as not to undermine the health of the hair day 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.640
 to day and good 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.810
 to see things for this recipe we are going to 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.349
 need 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.689
 grenetina that is gelatin without knowing what 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:34.280
 that we are going to use is a spoonful 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:36.950
 grenetina soup we are going to boil a 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.650
 liter of water when the water has already started 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.250
 to bubble is already boiling is to add 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.879
 a tablespoon of the grenetina and 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.489
 let's stir to dissolve 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.900
 everything all the powder should not have 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.290
 no lump anything 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.989
 when it is completely dissolved 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.689
 polvito no longer there is no group they are going to 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.519
 put inside a container in no 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:05.280
 stop the revolver because if not 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.489
 they are staying we are going to put them 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.470
 refrigerator our gel and here I have 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.379
 another I did last night because 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.510
 they will leave it one night or at least four 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:19.430
 hours in the restrictor and I'm going to 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.430
 take out my guel that is ready 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.010
 this is my gel that I already made and they lend it 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.800
 the whole family children girls for 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.230
 brothers cousins â€‹â€‹friends of the neighbor all 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.490
 world and this is pretty much the 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:39.630
 consistency is a jelly that goes to 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:41.700
 have entities do yes and we use it 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.700
 like a gel in the hair and the truth is 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.550
 Have your hair fixed in place 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.290
 especially for boys girls who 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.750
 they make those little tails later so that 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.790
 Do not use so much chemical in your 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.000
 hair a rangel but not only 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.489
 let's think about using something for the 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.120
 hair use this wonderful protein 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:06.690
 for the hair we are also going to take 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:10.110
 daily a glass with water a tecito 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:13.140
 of water and we are going to put grenetina 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.330
 there will be many people in your country who 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.540
 Say differently but it is this pulpit 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.950
 what we use to do 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.610
 I'm going to take a spoonful 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.610
 I'm going to put here 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:33.070
 wait a lot so that if we say everything 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.070
 because they go from we do 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.150
 we remove the grenetina in on an envelope 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.009
 is equivalent to two portions in half that 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.410
 one reaches the preterite for 2000 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.430
 you must get it you can take it to any 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.610
 time of the day 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.100
 fasting bastards true and good my 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.220
 friends I hope this recipe will 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:00.220
 it works your query pleased to 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.250
 your doctor is not everything for everyone and not for 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.590
 being natural does not mean that I do not go 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:09.420
 to have an adverse reaction avoid the 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:13.930
 Little bird sing me the daisy 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:19.570
 I'm going to present to you songs 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:22.259
 so that they put their hands and that is what gives me 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.259
 a lot of tenderness
