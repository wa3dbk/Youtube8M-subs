00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
to clean and it was apparent that that's

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.500 
to clean and it was apparent that that's
the<00:01:04.290> direction<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:04.770> needed<00:01:04.980> to<00:01:05.040> go<00:01:05.390> it<00:01:06.390> was<00:01:06.480> a

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
the direction we needed to go it was a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.970 
the direction we needed to go it was a
really<00:01:06.810> great<00:01:06.900> experience<00:01:07.110> because<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
really great experience because the

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.340 
really great experience because the
first<00:01:08.160> time<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.700> took<00:01:08.910> a<00:01:08.970> shower<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.510> walked

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
first time that I took a shower I walked

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.870 
first time that I took a shower I walked
in<00:01:10.590> there<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.920> was<00:01:11.010> like<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.160> was<00:01:11.370> standing

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
in there and it was like I was standing

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.850 
in there and it was like I was standing
in<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.210> middle<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.750> room<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.410> so<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.740> was

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
in the middle of a room and so it was

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.140 
in the middle of a room and so it was
really<00:01:14.070> odd<00:01:14.310> because<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:14.640> were<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:14.850> used<00:01:15.030> to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
really odd because we were so used to

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.300 
really odd because we were so used to
having<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.510> small<00:01:15.870> space<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.890> was<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
having a small space it was just the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.070 
having a small space it was just the
weirdest<00:01:17.700> feeling<00:01:17.730> it's<00:01:18.450> like<00:01:18.510> walking<00:01:18.780> into

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
weirdest feeling it's like walking into

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.530 
weirdest feeling it's like walking into
you<00:01:19.470> know<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:20.040> big<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.760> know<00:01:20.850> bedroom<00:01:21.420> and
