00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
killing machine you can but there's also

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.320 
killing machine you can but there's also
a<00:03:22.860> lot<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:23.010> depth<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.370> his<00:03:23.610> skill<00:03:23.880> tree<00:03:24.060> like<00:03:24.240> he

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
a lot of depth to his skill tree like he

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.970 
a lot of depth to his skill tree like he
has<00:03:24.420> this<00:03:24.540> one<00:03:24.750> skill<00:03:24.990> called<00:03:25.140> overheat<00:03:25.680> where

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
has this one skill called overheat where

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.070 
has this one skill called overheat where
the<00:03:26.400> longer<00:03:26.700> you<00:03:26.790> hold<00:03:26.970> down<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.330> trigger<00:03:27.570> the

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
the longer you hold down the trigger the

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.290 
the longer you hold down the trigger the
faster<00:03:28.590> your<00:03:28.710> fire<00:03:28.950> rate<00:03:29.220> will<00:03:29.370> get<00:03:29.550> so<00:03:29.850> you

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
faster your fire rate will get so you

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.490 
faster your fire rate will get so you
might<00:03:30.480> change<00:03:30.720> from<00:03:30.930> like<00:03:31.050> oh<00:03:31.140> I'm<00:03:31.230> just<00:03:31.410> guy

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
grasslands the gun system I think will

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.190 
grasslands the gun system I think will
be<00:03:59.820> one<00:03:59.940> of<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.090> most<00:04:00.210> exciting<00:04:00.570> for<00:04:00.930> four

newcomers as well because we had 87
bazillion<00:04:05.220> guns<00:04:05.400> in<00:04:05.520> the<00:04:05.580> first<00:04:05.730> game<00:04:05.880> and

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
bazillion guns in the first game and

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.550 
bazillion guns in the first game and
those<00:04:06.090> were<00:04:06.270> awesome<00:04:06.420> but<00:04:07.020> we<00:04:07.110> took<00:04:07.230> them<00:04:07.320> even

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
those were awesome but we took them even

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.170 
those were awesome but we took them even
further<00:04:07.740> because<00:04:08.010> now<00:04:08.280> they<00:04:08.490> look<00:04:08.760> much<00:04:08.970> more

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
further because now they look much more

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.460 
further because now they look much more
different<00:04:09.360> from<00:04:09.510> one<00:04:09.690> another<00:04:09.720> bubble<00:04:10.200> to<00:04:10.320> see

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
different from one another bubble to see

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.750 
different from one another bubble to see
the<00:04:10.620> manufacturer<00:04:11.250> parts<00:04:11.490> that<00:04:11.580> have<00:04:11.670> made

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
the manufacturer parts that have made

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.310 
the manufacturer parts that have made
them<00:04:11.940> up<00:04:12.030> and<00:04:12.180> they<00:04:12.240> fire<00:04:12.510> much<00:04:12.780> difference<00:04:13.140> so

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
them up and they fire much difference so

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.410 
them up and they fire much difference so
as<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.860> saw<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.130> Vlad<00:04:14.520> off<00:04:14.700> mini<00:04:15.030> guns<00:04:15.270> they

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
as you saw the Vlad off mini guns they

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.580 
as you saw the Vlad off mini guns they
sort<00:04:15.600> of<00:04:15.630> are<00:04:15.750> slow<00:04:15.960> to<00:04:15.990> spin<00:04:16.260> up<00:04:16.290> and<00:04:16.500> then

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
sort of are slow to spin up and then

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.020 
sort of are slow to spin up and then
they<00:04:16.650> get<00:04:16.770> really<00:04:16.890> fast<00:04:17.220> that<00:04:17.670> we<00:04:17.790> call<00:04:17.910> the

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
they get really fast that we call the

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.840 
they get really fast that we call the
bullet<00:04:18.660> hose<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:19.590> TD<00:04:19.890> or<00:04:20.010> guns<00:04:20.250> when<00:04:20.730> you

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
bullet hose the TD or guns when you

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.310 
bullet hose the TD or guns when you
reload<00:04:21.150> them<00:04:21.330> you<00:04:21.420> throw<00:04:21.690> them<00:04:21.810> like<00:04:21.989> grenades

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
reload them you throw them like grenades

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.680 
reload them you throw them like grenades
the<00:04:22.860> Bandit<00:04:23.580> guns<00:04:23.730> just<00:04:23.940> have<00:04:24.060> very<00:04:24.360> large

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
the Bandit guns just have very large

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.860 
the Bandit guns just have very large
clips<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:26.040> tour<00:04:26.310> guns

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
clips the the tour guns

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.719 
clips the the tour guns
rashad<00:04:27.260> every<00:04:27.590> single<00:04:27.949> shot<00:04:28.100> from<00:04:28.250> a<00:04:28.370> tour<00:04:28.550> gun

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
rashad every single shot from a tour gun

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.879 
rashad every single shot from a tour gun
is<00:04:28.910> an<00:04:29.000> explosive<00:04:29.570> gyro<00:04:29.960> jet<00:04:30.290> rocket<00:04:30.500> and

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
is an explosive gyro jet rocket and

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.920 
is an explosive gyro jet rocket and
having<00:04:31.820> that<00:04:31.850> actual<00:04:32.300> difference<00:04:32.630> in<00:04:32.750> terms

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
having that actual difference in terms

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.689 
having that actual difference in terms
of<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.080> way<00:04:33.169> they<00:04:33.199> fire<00:04:33.620> will<00:04:34.250> be<00:04:34.340> even<00:04:34.580> more

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
of the way they fire will be even more

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:35.800 
of the way they fire will be even more
interesting<00:04:34.940> when<00:04:35.150> you<00:04:35.240> can<00:04:35.389> buy<00:04:35.479> it<00:04:35.540> with<00:04:35.690> all

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
interesting when you can buy it with all

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.510 
interesting when you can buy it with all
the<00:04:35.960> statistical<00:04:36.560> differentiation<00:04:37.250> that<00:04:37.400> you

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
the statistical differentiation that you

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.370 
the statistical differentiation that you
had<00:04:37.639> in<00:04:37.729> the<00:04:37.790> first<00:04:37.910> game<00:04:38.150> so<00:04:38.330> every<00:04:38.720> 2<00:04:38.990> no<00:04:39.350> 2

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
had in the first game so every 2 no 2

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.110 
had in the first game so every 2 no 2
guns<00:04:39.650> will<00:04:39.770> look<00:04:39.919> the<00:04:40.040> same<00:04:40.070> you'll<00:04:40.610> feel<00:04:40.940> the

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
guns will look the same you'll feel the

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.580 
guns will look the same you'll feel the
same<00:04:41.270> even<00:04:41.570> when<00:04:41.720> you've<00:04:42.229> got<00:04:42.380> all<00:04:42.500> that

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
same even when you've got all that

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.110 
same even when you've got all that
statistical<00:04:43.040> variation<00:04:43.100> added<00:04:43.850> in<00:04:43.970> there

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
statistical variation added in there

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.960 
statistical variation added in there
it's<00:04:44.240> going<00:04:44.330> to<00:04:44.419> be<00:04:44.510> awesome<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:45.490> I<00:04:46.490> think<00:04:46.850> I

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
it's going to be awesome and I think I

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.550 
it's going to be awesome and I think I
think<00:04:47.210> one<00:04:47.330> of<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.510> main<00:04:47.540> components<00:04:48.470> that

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
think one of the main components that

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.170 
think one of the main components that
made<00:04:48.770> Borderlands<00:04:49.250> such<00:04:49.370> a<00:04:49.400> success<00:04:49.940> what's

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
made Borderlands such a success what's

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.050 
made Borderlands such a success what's
the<00:04:50.389> cooperative<00:04:50.930> play<00:04:51.080> but<00:04:51.889> you<00:04:52.010> tweak<00:04:52.880> the

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
the cooperative play but you tweak the

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.969 
the cooperative play but you tweak the
lid<00:04:53.210> a<00:04:53.419> few<00:04:53.690> things<00:04:53.960> to<00:04:54.290> make<00:04:54.650> it<00:04:54.710> a<00:04:54.860> better

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
lid a few things to make it a better

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.890 
lid a few things to make it a better
experience<00:04:55.130> for<00:04:55.669> players<00:04:55.880> so<00:04:56.210> they<00:04:56.300> can<00:04:56.479> play

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
experience for players so they can play

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.480 
experience for players so they can play
together<00:04:57.080> even<00:04:57.590> better<00:04:57.770> could<00:04:58.070> you<00:04:58.100> could<00:04:58.460> you

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
together even better could you could you

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.610 
together even better could you could you
go<00:04:58.699> through<00:04:58.910> those<00:04:59.120> um<00:04:59.750> well<00:05:00.080> we've<00:05:00.199> added<00:05:00.440> the

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
go through those um well we've added the

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.920 
go through those um well we've added the
ability<00:05:00.919> for<00:05:01.220> split-screen<00:05:01.850> games<00:05:02.630> to<00:05:02.810> go

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
ability for split-screen games to go

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.629 
ability for split-screen games to go
online<00:05:03.110> which<00:05:03.530> was<00:05:03.830> never<00:05:04.220> in<00:05:04.310> the<00:05:04.370> first<00:05:04.520> game

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
online which was never in the first game

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:05.980 
online which was never in the first game
but<00:05:04.760> our<00:05:04.850> community<00:05:05.240> really<00:05:05.449> wanted<00:05:05.690> it<00:05:05.780> so<00:05:05.900> we

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
but our community really wanted it so we

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.930 
but our community really wanted it so we
added<00:05:06.139> that<00:05:06.320> in<00:05:06.500> we've<00:05:07.220> got<00:05:07.370> even<00:05:07.550> more<00:05:07.699> sort

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
added that in we've got even more sort

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.400 
added that in we've got even more sort
of<00:05:07.970> co-op<00:05:08.360> multiplayer<00:05:08.750> stuff<00:05:09.169> we'll<00:05:09.320> be

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
of co-op multiplayer stuff we'll be

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.570 
of co-op multiplayer stuff we'll be
talking<00:05:09.560> about<00:05:09.740> in<00:05:09.889> the<00:05:09.949> future<00:05:10.220> but<00:05:10.370> it's<00:05:10.430> a

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
talking about in the future but it's a

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.279 
talking about in the future but it's a
really<00:05:10.789> big<00:05:11.090> priority<00:05:11.720> for<00:05:11.780> us<00:05:11.900> because<00:05:12.080> the

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:12.289 
really big priority for us because the

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:13.900 
really big priority for us because the
first<00:05:12.470> game<00:05:12.680> was<00:05:12.830> so<00:05:13.010> fun<00:05:13.400> and<00:05:13.639> co-op

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
first game was so fun and co-op

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.580 
first game was so fun and co-op
obviously<00:05:14.389> and<00:05:14.570> yeah<00:05:15.050> that's<00:05:15.199> that's<00:05:15.350> one<00:05:15.500> of

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
obviously and yeah that's that's one of

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.439 
obviously and yeah that's that's one of
our<00:05:15.680> big<00:05:15.830> priorities<00:05:16.220> I<00:05:16.400> understand<00:05:17.270> that

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
our big priorities I understand that

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:18.939 
our big priorities I understand that
that<00:05:17.780> there<00:05:18.050> will<00:05:18.199> be<00:05:18.229> better<00:05:18.530> quest

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
that there will be better quest

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.040 
that there will be better quest
alignment<00:05:19.550> so<00:05:19.699> you<00:05:19.760> don't<00:05:19.970> have<00:05:20.150> to<00:05:20.330> you<00:05:20.930> know

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
alignment so you don't have to you know

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.260 
alignment so you don't have to you know
stuck<00:05:21.590> in<00:05:21.710> different<00:05:22.039> places<00:05:22.430> and<00:05:22.850> you<00:05:23.120> can

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
stuck in different places and you can

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.820 
stuck in different places and you can
still<00:05:23.479> play<00:05:23.660> together<00:05:23.840> yeah<00:05:24.500> we're<00:05:24.710> still

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
still play together yeah we're still

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.200 
still play together yeah we're still
working<00:05:24.949> out<00:05:25.190> the<00:05:25.220> specifics<00:05:25.789> of<00:05:25.940> how<00:05:26.060> we're

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
when you when you start playing

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.770 
when you when you start playing
borderlands<00:05:40.490> 2<00:05:40.760> yeah<00:05:41.300> we're<00:05:41.479> still<00:05:41.630> figuring

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
borderlands 2 yeah we're still figuring

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.450 
borderlands 2 yeah we're still figuring
out<00:05:41.960> what<00:05:42.139> those<00:05:42.229> will<00:05:42.440> be<00:05:42.470> it's<00:05:43.310> something

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
out what those will be it's something

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.770 
out what those will be it's something
we're<00:05:43.669> really<00:05:43.700> interested<00:05:44.090> in<00:05:44.330> and<00:05:44.479> if<00:05:44.510> we<00:05:44.630> can

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
we're really interested in and if we can

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.420 
we're really interested in and if we can
do<00:05:44.870> it<00:05:45.020> we<00:05:45.050> will<00:05:45.289> we're<00:05:46.070> just<00:05:46.160> trying<00:05:46.400> to

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
do it we will we're just trying to

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.770 
do it we will we're just trying to
figure<00:05:46.550> out<00:05:46.639> exactly<00:05:47.060> what<00:05:47.330> that<00:05:47.450> is<00:05:47.599> and

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
figure out exactly what that is and

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.909 
figure out exactly what that is and
making<00:05:48.050> sure<00:05:48.200> that<00:05:48.229> it's<00:05:48.500> something<00:05:48.680> that's

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
making sure that it's something that's

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.100 
making sure that it's something that's
really<00:05:49.130> rewarding<00:05:49.280> but<00:05:50.090> you<00:05:50.300> know<00:05:50.389> not<00:05:50.570> game

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
really rewarding but you know not game

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.409 
really rewarding but you know not game
breaking<00:05:51.320> or<00:05:51.560> anything<00:05:51.889> like<00:05:51.919> that<00:05:52.180> so<00:05:53.180> I<00:05:53.210> I

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
breaking or anything like that so I I

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.980 
breaking or anything like that so I I
heard<00:05:53.990> a<00:05:54.169> date<00:05:54.410> fiscal<00:05:55.160> 2<00:05:55.310> 2013<00:05:56.180> that<00:05:56.810> you're

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
aiming for where you at and development

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.939 
aiming for where you at and development
right<00:05:59.150> now<00:05:59.180> and<00:05:59.539> how's<00:06:00.110> the<00:06:00.139> code<00:06:00.530> feeling

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:00.949 
right now and how's the code feeling

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:02.650 
right now and how's the code feeling
back<00:06:01.130> home<00:06:01.340> and<00:06:01.580> when<00:06:01.760> you're<00:06:01.970> trying<00:06:02.389> it<00:06:02.570> out

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
back home and when you're trying it out

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.379 
back home and when you're trying it out
it's<00:06:03.289> actually<00:06:03.380> fiscal<00:06:03.830> 2012<00:06:04.310> which<00:06:05.210> which

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
it's actually fiscal 2012 which which

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.379 
it's actually fiscal 2012 which which
includes<00:06:05.660> you<00:06:05.780> know<00:06:05.870> part<00:06:06.050> of<00:06:06.080> 2013<00:06:06.550> but<00:06:07.550> it's

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
includes you know part of 2013 but it's

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:10.000 
includes you know part of 2013 but it's
feeling<00:06:08.690> great<00:06:08.840> it's<00:06:09.560> cool<00:06:09.740> because<00:06:09.860> I've

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010 
feeling great it's cool because I've

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.140 
feeling great it's cool because I've
been<00:06:10.039> talking<00:06:10.310> to<00:06:10.340> the<00:06:10.460> QA<00:06:10.639> guys<00:06:10.910> who<00:06:11.090> are

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
been talking to the QA guys who are

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.790 
been talking to the QA guys who are
driving<00:06:11.300> the<00:06:11.539> demo<00:06:11.690> and<00:06:11.870> stuff<00:06:12.020> and<00:06:12.229> they<00:06:12.380> say

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
driving the demo and stuff and they say

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.770 
driving the demo and stuff and they say
it's<00:06:12.949> one<00:06:13.130> of<00:06:13.220> the<00:06:13.280> most<00:06:13.430> fun<00:06:14.240> games<00:06:14.270> to

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
it's one of the most fun games to

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.800 
it's one of the most fun games to
actually<00:06:15.710> play<00:06:16.340> test<00:06:16.580> and<00:06:16.820> it's<00:06:17.180> very<00:06:17.539> easy<00:06:17.690> to

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
actually play test and it's very easy to

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.240 
actually play test and it's very easy to
play<00:06:17.990> test<00:06:18.199> a<00:06:18.289> game<00:06:18.410> then<00:06:18.590> it<00:06:18.710> gets<00:06:18.770> old<00:06:18.979> but

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
play test a game then it gets old but

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.640 
play test a game then it gets old but
evidently<00:06:19.520> the<00:06:20.090> code<00:06:20.300> is<00:06:20.479> really<00:06:20.690> is<00:06:20.870> is<00:06:21.110> solid

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
evidently the code is really is is solid

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.740 
evidently the code is really is is solid
and<00:06:21.830> just<00:06:22.190> the<00:06:22.280> mechanics<00:06:22.370> or<00:06:22.849> so<00:06:23.120> there's<00:06:23.630> so

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
and just the mechanics or so there's so

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.450 
and just the mechanics or so there's so
much<00:06:23.870> emergence<00:06:24.410> within<00:06:24.740> the<00:06:24.830> system<00:06:25.190> so<00:06:25.370> the

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
much emergence within the system so the

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.010 
much emergence within the system so the
AI<00:06:25.610> is<00:06:25.820> doing<00:06:26.150> so<00:06:26.270> many<00:06:26.419> crazy<00:06:26.599> things<00:06:26.780> like

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
AI is doing so many crazy things like

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.439 
AI is doing so many crazy things like
calling<00:06:27.410> for<00:06:27.560> backup<00:06:27.710> you<00:06:28.310> know<00:06:28.430> running<00:06:29.270> for

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:31.099 
cover you know you can blow larm arms

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.680 
cover you know you can blow larm arms
off<00:06:31.250> loaders<00:06:31.580> and<00:06:31.610> the<00:06:31.849> the<00:06:32.180> surveyors<00:06:32.630> are

come in and reconstruct their arms it's

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:36.219 
come in and reconstruct their arms it's
such<00:06:34.909> an<00:06:35.030> emergent<00:06:35.539> game<00:06:35.690> full<00:06:35.930> of<00:06:35.960> all<00:06:36.110> these

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:36.229 
such an emergent game full of all these

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.959 
such an emergent game full of all these
cool<00:06:36.440> systems<00:06:36.890> that<00:06:37.099> it<00:06:37.460> always<00:06:37.640> plays<00:06:37.909> a

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:37.969 
cool systems that it always plays a

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:40.120 
cool systems that it always plays a
little<00:06:38.120> bit<00:06:38.330> differently<00:06:38.719> so<00:06:39.140> it's<00:06:39.919> been<00:06:40.099> a

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
little bit differently so it's been a

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.959 
little bit differently so it's been a
lot<00:06:40.280> of<00:06:40.340> fun<00:06:40.550> that<00:06:40.700> just

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:40.969 
lot of fun that just

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:42.159 
lot of fun that just
every<00:06:41.209> time<00:06:41.360> we<00:06:41.419> get<00:06:41.509> a<00:06:41.569> new<00:06:41.689> build<00:06:41.869> to<00:06:41.989> just

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.169 
every time we get a new build to just

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:43.419 
every time we get a new build to just
run<00:06:42.319> in<00:06:42.439> and<00:06:42.559> test<00:06:42.769> stuff<00:06:42.919> out<00:06:43.069> and<00:06:43.219> say<00:06:43.339> it's

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:43.429 
run in and test stuff out and say it's

00:06:43.429 --> 00:06:45.339 
run in and test stuff out and say it's
always<00:06:43.610> been<00:06:43.729> really<00:06:43.849> cool<00:06:44.059> really<00:06:45.019> looking

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:45.349 
always been really cool really looking
