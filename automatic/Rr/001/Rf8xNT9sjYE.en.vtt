close the lid on your igniter wires when
the<00:00:35.900> systems<00:00:36.260> in<00:00:36.379> use<00:00:36.590> so<00:00:37.190> if<00:00:37.280> it's<00:00:37.400> used<00:00:37.610> in<00:00:37.730> a

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
the systems in use so if it's used in a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.670 
the systems in use so if it's used in a
wet<00:00:37.940> environment<00:00:38.150> and<00:00:39.050> then<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:39.230> rain<00:00:39.379> falls

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
wet environment and then the rain falls

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.710 
wet environment and then the rain falls
down<00:00:39.769> onto<00:00:40.129> it<00:00:40.160> will<00:00:40.670> just<00:00:40.820> run<00:00:41.000> off<00:00:41.150> the<00:00:41.330> top

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
down onto it will just run off the top

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.070 
down onto it will just run off the top
surface<00:00:41.960> of<00:00:42.260> the<00:00:42.350> lid<00:00:42.970> so<00:00:43.970> if<00:00:44.059> I<00:00:44.150> open<00:00:44.300> receiver

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
surface of the lid so if I open receiver

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.660 
surface of the lid so if I open receiver
here<00:00:45.320> you<00:00:45.830> can<00:00:45.949> see<00:00:46.070> we<00:00:46.190> have<00:00:46.280> a<00:00:46.309> strong

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
here you can see we have a strong

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.390 
here you can see we have a strong
argument<00:00:47.510> in<00:00:47.870> front<00:00:48.140> panel<00:00:48.440> or<00:00:48.620> your<00:00:49.190> Q

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
argument in front panel or your Q

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.160 
argument in front panel or your Q
connections<00:00:49.909> you<00:00:50.150> display<00:00:50.540> your<00:00:50.570> controls

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
connections you display your controls

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.680 
connections you display your controls
your<00:00:51.890> arming<00:00:52.280> key<00:00:52.489> and<00:00:52.909> your<00:00:53.210> fire<00:00:53.449> mode

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
your arming key and your fire mode

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.840 
your arming key and your fire mode
selector<00:00:53.720> switch

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.310 

so<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:02.059> receiver<00:01:02.300> can<00:01:02.540> operate<00:01:02.930> in<00:01:03.050> five

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
so the receiver can operate in five

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.340 
so the receiver can operate in five
distinct<00:01:03.800> firing<00:01:04.220> modes<00:01:04.690> the<00:01:05.690> first<00:01:05.900> one<00:01:06.140> and

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
distinct firing modes the first one and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.290 
distinct firing modes the first one and
probably<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.799> simplest<00:01:07.310> one<00:01:07.430> is<00:01:07.670> single<00:01:08.090> fire

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
probably the simplest one is single fire

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.530 
probably the simplest one is single fire
mode<00:01:08.619> now<00:01:09.619> all<00:01:09.920> that<00:01:10.340> happens<00:01:10.700> here<00:01:10.760> is<00:01:11.150> when<00:01:11.479> I

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
mode now all that happens here is when I

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.570 
mode now all that happens here is when I
pratik<00:01:12.080> use<00:01:12.260> one<00:01:12.530> through<00:01:12.920> twenty<00:01:13.130> on<00:01:13.490> the

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
pratik use one through twenty on the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.690

all the way up to almost 10 minutes so

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.670 
all the way up to almost 10 minutes so
here<00:03:04.850> I'm<00:03:05.060> going<00:03:05.240> to<00:03:05.330> demonstrate<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:05.960> in<00:03:06.050> same

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
here I'm going to demonstrate it in same

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.100 
here I'm going to demonstrate it in same
time<00:03:06.950> mode<00:03:07.220> with<00:03:07.760> a<00:03:07.790> point<00:03:08.090> 0<00:03:08.390> 5<00:03:08.630> second<00:03:09.020> delay

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
sequencer button on the transmitter you

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.270 
sequencer button on the transmitter you
can<00:03:14.840> see<00:03:14.990> that<00:03:15.170> sequence<00:03:15.590> ripping<00:03:16.100> through

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
can see that sequence ripping through

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:24.970 
can see that sequence ripping through
the<00:03:16.370> receiver<00:03:16.660> very<00:03:17.660> quickly

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.710 

so<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.580> final<00:03:25.790> mode<00:03:26.000> that<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.270> receiver<00:03:26.569> can

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
so the final mode that the receiver can

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.420 
so the final mode that the receiver can
operate<00:03:27.050> in<00:03:27.200> so<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.680> different<00:03:28.040> time<00:03:28.190> delay

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
operate in so the different time delay

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.610 
operate in so the different time delay
between<00:03:28.580> each<00:03:28.760> queue<00:03:29.120> now<00:03:30.019> this<00:03:30.170> time<00:03:30.349> delay

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
between each queue now this time delay

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.020 
between each queue now this time delay
as<00:03:30.739> I've<00:03:30.890> mentioned<00:03:31.010> can<00:03:31.580> be<00:03:31.610> changed<00:03:31.970> from

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
as I've mentioned can be changed from

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.229 
as I've mentioned can be changed from
between<00:03:32.390> zero<00:03:32.750> seconds<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.500> ten<00:03:33.709> minutes<00:03:34.239> so

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
between zero seconds and ten minutes so

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.460 
between zero seconds and ten minutes so
I've<00:03:35.390> now<00:03:35.540> programmed<00:03:35.900> in<00:03:36.050> some<00:03:36.260> random

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
I've now programmed in some random

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.190 
I've now programmed in some random
delays<00:03:36.920> between<00:03:37.580> each<00:03:37.700> queue<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.959> I'll<00:03:39.110> now

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
delays between each queue and I'll now

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.839 
delays between each queue and I'll now
set<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:39.590> receiver<00:03:39.890> off<00:03:40.160> and<00:03:40.370> you<00:03:40.550> should<00:03:40.580> be

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
set the receiver off and you should be

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.270 
set the receiver off and you should be

control the receivers either
individually<00:04:25.850> or<00:04:26.120> together<00:04:27.010> so<00:04:28.010> for<00:04:28.190> example

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
individually or together so for example

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.610 
individually or together so for example
here<00:04:28.910> I<00:04:29.060> program<00:04:29.570> both<00:04:29.750> receiver<00:04:30.230> one<00:04:30.410> on

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
here I program both receiver one on

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.220 
here I program both receiver one on
receiver<00:04:31.370> two<00:04:31.580> with<00:04:32.300> transmitter<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:33.020> slide

transmitter for instance to position two
now<00:04:53.320> you'll<00:04:54.320> see<00:04:54.500> that<00:04:54.620> when<00:04:54.830> I<00:04:54.950> press<00:04:55.160> buttons

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
now you'll see that when I press buttons

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.760 
now you'll see that when I press buttons
on<00:04:55.790> the<00:04:55.910> transmitter

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.260 

another<00:05:05.190> interesting<00:05:05.669> feature<00:05:05.820> of<00:05:06.000> these

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
another interesting feature of these

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.970 
another interesting feature of these
receivers<00:05:06.750> is<00:05:06.990> that<00:05:07.590> they<00:05:07.680> can<00:05:07.800> actually

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
receivers is that they can actually

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.750 
receivers is that they can actually
learn<00:05:08.280> to<00:05:08.760> separate<00:05:09.270> transmitter<00:05:09.780> addresses

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
learn to separate transmitter addresses

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.370 
learn to separate transmitter addresses
so<00:05:11.760> for<00:05:12.060> example<00:05:12.449> here<00:05:12.690> I<00:05:12.810> programmed

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
so for example here I programmed

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.320 
so for example here I programmed
receiver<00:05:13.889> one<00:05:14.160> with<00:05:14.790> a<00:05:14.820> transmitter<00:05:15.210> and

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
receiver one with a transmitter and

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.840 
receiver one with a transmitter and
slide<00:05:15.600> switch<00:05:15.840> position<00:05:16.290> one<00:05:16.580> receiver<00:05:17.580> two

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
slide switch position one receiver two

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.490 
slide switch position one receiver two
with<00:05:18.540> the<00:05:18.630> slice<00:05:18.840> would<00:05:19.020> stay<00:05:19.199> in<00:05:19.260> position

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
with the slice would stay in position

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.340 
with the slice would stay in position
two<00:05:19.949> and<00:05:20.180> then<00:05:21.180> with<00:05:21.540> the<00:05:21.660> slide<00:05:21.840> with<00:05:22.020> simple

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
two and then with the slide with simple

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.980 
two and then with the slide with simple
three<00:05:22.919> I<00:05:23.100> programmed<00:05:23.910> both<00:05:24.120> receiver<00:05:24.600> one<00:05:24.780> and

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
three I programmed both receiver one and

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.920 
three I programmed both receiver one and
receiver<00:05:25.710> two<00:05:26.120> so<00:05:27.120> what<00:05:27.270> this<00:05:27.389> means<00:05:27.449> is<00:05:27.870> that

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
receiver two so what this means is that

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.950 
receiver two so what this means is that
I'll<00:05:28.169> be<00:05:28.290> able<00:05:28.350> to<00:05:28.560> control<00:05:28.889> receiver<00:05:29.220> one<00:05:29.610> in

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
I'll be able to control receiver one in

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.080 
I'll be able to control receiver one in

so<00:06:35.780> on<00:06:35.810> and<00:06:36.080> so<00:06:36.229> forth<00:06:36.470> up<00:06:36.830> to<00:06:36.889> your<00:06:37.340> maximum

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:37.699 
so on and so forth up to your maximum

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:41.290 
so on and so forth up to your maximum
number<00:06:37.760> of<00:06:38.000> receivers<00:06:39.789> so<00:06:40.789> I'm<00:06:41.090> going<00:06:41.270> to

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
number of receivers so I'm going to

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.180 
number of receivers so I'm going to
press<00:06:41.539> one<00:06:41.990> button<00:06:42.020> on<00:06:42.500> the<00:06:42.590> remote<00:06:42.710> control

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
press one button on the remote control

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.520 
press one button on the remote control
now<00:06:43.220> to<00:06:43.639> start<00:06:43.820> the<00:06:43.940> sequencer<00:06:44.449> you're<00:06:45.350> going

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
now to start the sequencer you're going

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.110 
now to start the sequencer you're going
to<00:06:45.620> see<00:06:45.740> the<00:06:45.860> sequencer<00:06:46.280> flow<00:06:46.490> smoothly<00:06:46.850> from

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 
to see the sequencer flow smoothly from

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.290 
to see the sequencer flow smoothly from
one<00:06:47.210> receiver<00:06:47.690> on<00:06:47.960> to<00:06:48.350> the<00:06:48.470> next<00:06:49.210> so<00:06:50.210> I'll

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.300 
one receiver on to the next so I'll

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.990 
one receiver on to the next so I'll
demonstrate<00:06:50.419> this<00:06:50.780> now<00:06:54.460> so<00:06:55.460> you<00:06:55.550> can<00:06:55.669> see<00:06:55.699> that

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 
demonstrate this now so you can see that

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.790 
demonstrate this now so you can see that
flowed<00:06:56.240> very<00:06:56.270> smoothly<00:06:56.870> from<00:06:57.050> one<00:06:57.139> on<00:06:57.560> to<00:06:57.710> the

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 
flowed very smoothly from one on to the

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.770 
flowed very smoothly from one on to the
next<00:06:57.979> and<00:06:58.580> it<00:06:58.729> would<00:06:58.820> continue<00:06:59.090> doing<00:06:59.240> that<00:06:59.570> up

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
next and it would continue doing that up

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.860 
next and it would continue doing that up
to<00:06:59.930> your<00:07:00.020> maximum<00:07:00.320> number<00:07:00.680> of<00:07:00.710> receivers<00:07:01.870> it's

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870 
to your maximum number of receivers it's

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.360 
to your maximum number of receivers it's
worth<00:07:03.080> noting<00:07:03.500> though<00:07:03.530> that<00:07:03.650> this<00:07:03.919> function

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.370 
worth noting though that this function

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.279 
worth noting though that this function
only<00:07:04.699> works<00:07:04.910> with<00:07:05.120> the<00:07:05.150> same<00:07:05.389> time<00:07:05.660> sequencer

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:06.289 
only works with the same time sequencer

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:08.350 
only works with the same time sequencer
it<00:07:07.100> won't<00:07:07.340> work<00:07:07.550> with<00:07:07.789> the<00:07:07.880> different<00:07:08.210> time

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360 
it won't work with the different time

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.240 
it won't work with the different time
sequencer<00:07:08.960> because<00:07:09.650> each<00:07:09.800> successive

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.250 
sequencer because each successive

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.219 
sequencer because each successive
receiver<00:07:10.729> doesn't<00:07:11.479> know<00:07:11.570> how<00:07:11.750> long<00:07:11.930> to<00:07:11.960> wait

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:12.229 
receiver doesn't know how long to wait

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:16.670 
receiver doesn't know how long to wait
before<00:07:12.289> stop

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.900 

so<00:07:17.680> in<00:07:17.800> the<00:07:17.860> same<00:07:18.040> way<00:07:18.160> that<00:07:18.280> the<00:07:18.400> sequencer

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:18.910 
so in the same way that the sequencer

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.370 
so in the same way that the sequencer
can<00:07:18.940> be<00:07:19.150> made<00:07:19.270> to<00:07:19.420> flow<00:07:19.630> smoothly<00:07:19.930> from<00:07:20.290> one

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:20.380 
can be made to flow smoothly from one

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.620 
can be made to flow smoothly from one
receiver<00:07:20.890> to<00:07:21.010> the<00:07:21.040> next<00:07:21.400> you<00:07:22.120> can<00:07:22.270> do<00:07:22.360> the<00:07:22.450> same

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:22.630 
receiver to the next you can do the same

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.530 
receiver to the next you can do the same
with<00:07:22.780> step<00:07:23.110> fire<00:07:23.320> function<00:07:24.210> so<00:07:25.210> all<00:07:25.390> I<00:07:25.420> have

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:25.540 
with step fire function so all I have

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.930 
with step fire function so all I have
done<00:07:25.570> here<00:07:25.870> is<00:07:26.080> set<00:07:26.740> receiver<00:07:27.160> 1<00:07:27.340> into<00:07:27.730> step

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:27.940 
done here is set receiver 1 into step

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.060 
done here is set receiver 1 into step
bar<00:07:28.150> mode<00:07:28.390> and<00:07:28.570> receiver<00:07:29.110> 2<00:07:29.290> into<00:07:29.650> step<00:07:29.860> bar

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:30.070 
bar mode and receiver 2 into step bar

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.390 
bar mode and receiver 2 into step bar
mode<00:07:30.330> and<00:07:31.330> now<00:07:31.660> each<00:07:32.440> successive<00:07:32.890> time<00:07:33.220> I

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:33.400 
mode and now each successive time I

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.850 
mode and now each successive time I
press<00:07:33.640> the<00:07:33.790> step<00:07:34.000> bar<00:07:34.240> button<00:07:34.710> you<00:07:35.710> will<00:07:35.830> see

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:35.860 
press the step bar button you will see

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.090 
press the step bar button you will see
that<00:07:36.070> the<00:07:36.190> next<00:07:36.520> cue<00:07:36.790> in<00:07:37.060> sequence<00:07:37.540> aspiring

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:38.100 
that the next cue in sequence aspiring

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.410 
that the next cue in sequence aspiring
and<00:07:39.100> when<00:07:39.250> it<00:07:39.370> reaches<00:07:39.670> the<00:07:39.790> end<00:07:39.910> of<00:07:40.060> receiver

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:40.420 
and when it reaches the end of receiver

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.040 
and when it reaches the end of receiver
one<00:07:40.660> more<00:07:41.620> smoothly<00:07:41.950> on<00:07:42.220> to<00:07:42.370> receiver<00:07:42.700> tube

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.050
