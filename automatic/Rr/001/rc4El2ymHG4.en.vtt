00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:20.270
 but a very important question more 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.150
 important as it may seem 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:28.220
 When we prayed Jesus taught us to 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:32.419
 time for heaven father 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.149
 our heavenly father who is in heaven 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.620
 I know that a certain activity in 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.410
 split too much 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.270
 the Holy Trinity we speak of 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.840
 God, we're talking about God, father God. 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.510
 son of god holy spirit one by ones 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.329
 but it was not God who gave me for us on 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.899
 was not the father who died for us in the 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.960
 cross even if mariza ah tÃ¡ 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:01.699
 priest passion is a heresy to 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:06.940
 idea that God died on the cross was not 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:13.400
 jesus who died on the cross jesus is not 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:16.550
 who grants it the gifts of the holy spirit 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.890
 which bestows the gifts is not the spirit 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.439
 saint who adopts us as children we 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.110
 we were adopted by the father 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:27.140
 now the bible has its reasons god had 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.860
 their reasons for putting their lives in 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.829
 terms 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:37.549
 and we have to obey and honor God 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:39.409
 as he revealed himself to us, 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.539
 Of course when we talk about God, no. 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.460
 We are talking about someone to 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:50.420
 incomprehensible to our minds and 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:54.070
 eternal and infinite he is perfect 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:58.630
 perfect light to 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.909
 he is just he is and compassionate wanted 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:09.310
 merciful he loving that he is 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:12.810
 Dear God, is there any attempt? 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.580
 that we have to define what 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.400
 so we have to understand 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.630
 God is in many advocates I do not think 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.390
 that there is good technology boils down to 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.540
 define who god who god is not he not 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:35.470
 it's limited it's not stingy it's not 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:38.260
 A liar to him is not just that he does not 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.560
 There are two words because when I say 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.239
 infinite I'm talking about something that I 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.830
 I understand as a word but as a concept 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.580
 it's not the head either because my 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:53.050
 head goes up to a certain limit is 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.930
 suit and land ahead will not end 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:59.730
 but the eternal behind has never had its origin 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:04.920
 this is not also the head is not logical 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:09.850
 but extrapolates what my ability to 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.940
 imagine what it is we want to look at 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.980
 for the holy spirit I do not believe I believe 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.290
 that we should pray to the father because 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:22.060
 That's how Jesus taught us to pray. 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:25.690
 our father that is in heaven 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:29.260
 in no time at all 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:35.590
 The Bible directs us to pray for 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:38.829
 spirit we pray for the father but they 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.690
 But Jesus lives in the heart, yes. 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:44.560
 holy spirit both father and son 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:47.320
 come to dwell in us by holy spirit 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.780
 and then we start getting into 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.850
 complicated definitions manager 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.799
 understanding this, is not it? 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.950
 but we should not look at the 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:04:00.280
 holy spirit we look for god father 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:04.350
 in the name of jesus by the power of the spirit 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.350
 holy this is the right way
