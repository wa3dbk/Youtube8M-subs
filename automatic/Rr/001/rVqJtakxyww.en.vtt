212<00:04:28.090> Bayern<00:04:28.330> I<00:04:28.630> think<00:04:28.990> if<00:04:29.110> Byron<00:04:29.380> had<00:04:29.650> been<00:04:30.160> a

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
212 Bayern I think if Byron had been a

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.060 
212 Bayern I think if Byron had been a
little<00:04:30.400> bit<00:04:30.610> further<00:04:30.910> in<00:04:31.390> there<00:04:31.720> in<00:04:32.530> their

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
little bit further in there in their

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.890 
little bit further in there in their
preseason<00:04:33.550> if<00:04:33.940> they'd<00:04:34.120> had<00:04:34.300> all<00:04:34.480> young<00:04:34.630> a

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
preseason if they'd had all young a

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.200 
preseason if they'd had all young a
major<00:04:35.440> majority<00:04:36.370> of<00:04:36.400> their<00:04:36.550> big<00:04:36.730> stars<00:04:37.000> are

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
major majority of their big stars are

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.520 
major majority of their big stars are
just<00:04:37.390> kind<00:04:37.480> of<00:04:37.600> flying<00:04:37.810> in<00:04:37.990> this<00:04:38.140> morning<00:04:38.500> to

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
just kind of flying in this morning to

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.320 
just kind of flying in this morning to
make<00:04:38.740> a<00:04:38.800> bit<00:04:39.250> of<00:04:39.370> a<00:04:39.430> cameo<00:04:39.820> appearance<00:04:39.850> but

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
make a bit of a cameo appearance but

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.480 
make a bit of a cameo appearance but
it's<00:04:40.510> still<00:04:40.660> a<00:04:40.720> very<00:04:40.960> strong<00:04:41.350> team<00:04:41.650> that<00:04:42.100> Byron

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
it's still a very strong team that Byron

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.580 
it's still a very strong team that Byron
has<00:04:42.670> here<00:04:42.970> but<00:04:43.150> I<00:04:43.180> think<00:04:43.240> if<00:04:43.510> they<00:04:43.660> were<00:04:43.720> two

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
has here but I think if they were two

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.170 
has here but I think if they were two
three<00:04:44.890> weeks<00:04:45.040> further<00:04:45.430> along<00:04:45.760> in<00:04:45.820> their

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
three weeks further along in their

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.420 
three weeks further along in their
preseason<00:04:46.630> then<00:04:47.020> it<00:04:47.140> could<00:04:47.320> be<00:04:47.500> it<00:04:48.160> could<00:04:48.190> have

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
preseason then it could be it could have

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.950 
preseason then it could be it could have
been<00:04:48.490> a<00:04:48.550> little<00:04:48.760> bit<00:04:48.970> a<00:04:49.210> little<00:04:49.270> little<00:04:49.720> bit

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
been a little bit a little little bit

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.780 
been a little bit a little little bit
more<00:04:50.140> difficult<00:04:50.380> task<00:04:50.950> for<00:04:51.070> the<00:04:51.220> ulcers<00:04:51.550> and<00:04:51.700> I

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
more difficult task for the ulcers and I
