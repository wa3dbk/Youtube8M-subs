00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.539
 good we end up for a little video 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.829
 where I 'm going to do a demonstration for 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:25.239
 play with the ps3 controller on the new 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:29.419
 batman batman arkham city 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:32.540
 so for that you will need of course 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:37.160
 the game so I'm talking about the one 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:39.649
 this crush arkham city that came out there 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.899
 few days ago December 13 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.399
 so this is again on the mac then 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.409
 that it's been a while since 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.519
 is on the consoles so for those who 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:50.239
 would like to play with the ps3 controller 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.539
 you will see in any case it is 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.850
 much simpler there is not much 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.010
 thing to do is all the keys 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.710
 are already configured you will see you 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.109
 are going to be super happy so you 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.400
 download the game once you have it 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:14.470
 game for me i'm going to show you that it 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:18.110
 happens on bone x 10 points 8 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.550
 it's my laguiole I'm looking for 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.520
 a name 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.500
 so once you have that try 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.130
 on previous versions I do not know 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.250
 not if it works but I think so 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:35.990
 so it will take a controller 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:38.500
 the usb cable of ps3 and that's it 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:45.050
 so for that you activate bluetooth 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:51.730
 hop you see here except that nothing is 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:02:00.040
 switched on then you plug your cable 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:02:02.750
 on the mac and you plug the controller 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.570
 then you will see that the bottom controller is 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.110
 flash what is normal is 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.759
 that she is charging so as in my 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.310
 video 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.980
 one of my first videos the process 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.390
 exactly the same you press the 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:24.049
 ps button of the joystick you stay 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:32.659
 pressed on it and you unplug the cable 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:36.079
 usb and watch how bluetooth has 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:37.159
 reacted too little carrick puts himself that wants 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.470
 to say that it's normal 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:43.190
 and there you see that playstation 3 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.950
 controller so there the seers of mamad 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.250
 is no longer lights at all I believe 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.690
 that can happen that come on 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.730
 I am patient but slow that everything 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.989
 so goes off once you have 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.989
 do this you run the game 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.209
 so for those who wish you 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.720
 can change the graphics it goes 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.200
 no problem I left everything at 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.370
 minimum but you can put them 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:23.150
 maybe not at the maximum but 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:25.609
 improve and that's it the game launches and 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.099
 here and you will see that the game is going 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.510
 directly detect your controller and go 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.949
 not you proposed to press enter 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.800
 on the keyboard 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:37.570
 but of course 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.570
 star I believe or believe 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.780
 star up 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.709
 I 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.420
 and that's it and you see that bahia 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.890
 the buttons the bear and buttons the 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:05.640
 xbox 360 but it works as well 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:10.430
 it's the radioactive crau with roy I 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.430
 do I select same thing 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.890
 taklha 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:27.820
 so for the future I will make you 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:30.560
 maybe a video also of dunes 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.360
 wait and see you campus everything she 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.520
 added while altered the place by where 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:40.940
 the ball came back from the court as well 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:44.630
 that on the impact herlin up so a whole 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.020
 and already nothing to do you are no longer 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.520
 to play 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.520
 he does not need to type very well 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.630
 nothing of a bad being it is healthy fourmiz 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:05:03.160

00:04:51.630 --> 00:05:07.350
 So here she is seeking hop on 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.430

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.740
 so here 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:15.430
 and for the future I will perhaps make you 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.650
 a video wii on a motorcycle game that 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.560
