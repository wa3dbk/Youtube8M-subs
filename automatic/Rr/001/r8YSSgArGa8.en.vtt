machine on the thickest setting now I'm

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:48.189 
machine on the thickest setting now I'm
going<00:00:46.969> to<00:00:47.030> run<00:00:47.210> this<00:00:47.329> back<00:00:47.569> through<00:00:47.600> here<00:00:48.140> and

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
going to run this back through here and

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.979 
going to run this back through here and
make<00:00:48.289> it<00:00:48.379> incredibly<00:00:49.219> thin<00:00:49.579> one<00:00:50.420> thing<00:00:50.600> I<00:00:50.719> love

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
make it incredibly thin one thing I love

make it incredibly thin one thing I love
about<00:00:51.019> this<00:00:51.440> technique<00:00:51.920> is<00:00:52.159> you<00:00:52.579> don't<00:00:52.909> have

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
about this technique is you don't have

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.029 
about this technique is you don't have
to<00:00:53.239> be<00:00:53.359> precise<00:00:53.809> you<00:00:54.350> can<00:00:54.499> see<00:00:54.679> how<00:00:54.800> this<00:00:54.979> is

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
to be precise you can see how this is

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.130 
to be precise you can see how this is
going<00:00:55.309> off<00:00:55.579> at<00:00:55.729> an<00:00:55.819> angle<00:00:55.940> it<00:00:56.479> just<00:00:56.510> doesn't

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
going off at an angle it just doesn't

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.709 
going off at an angle it just doesn't
matter<00:00:57.319> mokume<00:00:57.920> gane<00:00:57.949> a<00:00:58.159> is<00:00:58.429> very<00:00:58.760> freeform

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
matter mokume gane a is very freeform

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.869 
matter mokume gane a is very freeform
and<00:00:59.899> it's<00:01:00.859> very<00:01:01.280> it's<00:01:02.409> just<00:01:03.409> not<00:01:03.949> as<00:01:04.129> rigid<00:01:04.460> or

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
and it's very it's just not as rigid or

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.480 
and it's very it's just not as rigid or
precise<00:01:05.420> as<00:01:05.689> a<00:01:05.719> lot<00:01:05.990> of<00:01:06.140> other<00:01:06.320> techniques<00:01:06.860> now

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
precise as a lot of other techniques now

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.999 
precise as a lot of other techniques now
I'm<00:01:07.610> just<00:01:07.790> resection<00:01:08.540> apply<00:01:09.079> and<00:01:09.409> what<00:01:09.829> I'll

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
I'm just resection apply and what I'll

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.999 
I'm just resection apply and what I'll
do<00:01:10.189> is<00:01:10.310> pile<00:01:10.610> this<00:01:10.880> back<00:01:11.119> up<00:01:11.829> even<00:01:12.829> these

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
do is pile this back up even these

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.090 
do is pile this back up even these
pieces<00:01:13.280> that<00:01:13.520> are<00:01:13.759> not<00:01:14.390> quite<00:01:14.719> the<00:01:14.899> right<00:01:15.100> what

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
pieces that are not quite the right what

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.440 
pieces that are not quite the right what
you<00:01:16.219> might<00:01:16.369> think<00:01:16.610> of<00:01:16.729> as<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:16.969> right<00:01:17.149> size<00:01:17.420> and

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
you might think of as the right size and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.550 
you might think of as the right size and
shape<00:01:17.710> pile<00:01:18.710> those<00:01:18.979> up<00:01:19.219> and<00:01:19.490> now<00:01:20.270> I<00:01:20.930> have<00:01:21.259> lots

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
shape pile those up and now I have lots

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.100 
shape pile those up and now I have lots
and<00:01:21.770> lots<00:01:21.950> of<00:01:22.100> layers<00:01:22.399> of<00:01:22.700> stripes<00:01:23.060> what<00:01:23.990> you

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
and lots of layers of stripes what you

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.810 
and lots of layers of stripes what you
want<00:01:24.259> to<00:01:24.350> do<00:01:24.439> now<00:01:24.619> is<00:01:24.649> just<00:01:25.130> put<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.369> lot<00:01:25.610> of

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
want to do now is just put a lot of

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.639 
want to do now is just put a lot of
pressure<00:01:26.030> on<00:01:26.270> this<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.899> kind<00:01:27.079> of<00:01:27.200> press<00:01:27.439> the

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
pressure on this to kind of press the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.260 
pressure on this to kind of press the
air<00:01:27.829> out<00:01:28.030> and<00:01:30.130> you're<00:01:31.130> kind<00:01:31.369> of<00:01:31.490> deforming

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
air out and you're kind of deforming

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.789 
air out and you're kind of deforming
those<00:01:32.570> layers<00:01:32.960> as<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:33.380> go<00:01:35.049> okay<00:01:36.049> now<00:01:36.590> it's

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
those layers as you go okay now it's

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.190 
those layers as you go okay now it's
time<00:01:36.859> for<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.340> fun<00:01:37.570> manipulation<00:01:38.570> part<00:01:38.899> I'm

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
time for the fun manipulation part I'm

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.289 
time for the fun manipulation part I'm
going<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:39.950> use<00:01:40.189> some<00:01:40.430> tools<00:01:40.609> and<00:01:41.000> for<00:01:41.210> this

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
going to use some tools and for this

of<00:01:48.619> mikuma<00:01:49.070> gonna<00:01:49.280> even<00:01:49.670> use<00:01:50.000> a<00:01:50.030> texture<00:01:50.509> sheet

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
of mikuma gonna even use a texture sheet

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.950 
of mikuma gonna even use a texture sheet
to<00:01:51.079> manipulate<00:01:51.679> the<00:01:52.280> layers<00:01:52.520> of<00:01:52.820> clay<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:53.780> what

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
to manipulate the layers of clay so what

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.749 
to manipulate the layers of clay so what
I<00:01:54.049> want<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.289> do<00:01:54.409> is<00:01:54.560> just<00:01:54.829> start<00:01:55.130> pushing

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
I want to do is just start pushing

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.080 
I want to do is just start pushing
really<00:01:56.090> hard<00:01:56.359> into<00:01:57.170> this<00:01:57.799> clay<00:01:58.189> and<00:01:58.549> what's

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
really hard into this clay and what's

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.020 
really hard into this clay and what's
happening<00:01:59.600> is<00:01:59.810> as<00:02:00.079> I'm<00:02:00.320> pushing<00:02:00.799> I'm<00:02:01.039> making

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
happening is as I'm pushing I'm making

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.510 
happening is as I'm pushing I'm making
those<00:02:02.270> layers<00:02:02.600> push<00:02:03.380> down<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:03.950> around<00:02:04.219> each

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
those layers push down and around each

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.090 
those layers push down and around each
other<00:02:04.789> sort<00:02:05.210> of<00:02:05.299> like<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:06.109> terrain<00:02:06.499> or<00:02:06.890> or

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
something and each layer in color is

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.440 
something and each layer in color is
going<00:02:09.590> down<00:02:09.830> through<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:10.220> ones<00:02:10.429> under<00:02:10.909> it<00:02:11.030> you

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
going down through the ones under it you

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.530 
going down through the ones under it you
can<00:02:11.629> cut<00:02:11.840> this<00:02:12.019> with<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.260> blade<00:02:13.480> whatever

you want the more you manipulate it the
cooler<00:02:17.450> it's<00:02:17.629> going<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:17.930> look<00:02:18.140> in<00:02:18.439> the<00:02:18.920> end<00:02:19.099> now

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
cooler it's going to look in the end now

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.390 
cooler it's going to look in the end now
you<00:02:19.939> can<00:02:20.269> see<00:02:20.510> with<00:02:20.719> this<00:02:21.019> couple<00:02:21.859> samples

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
you can see with this couple samples

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.179 
you can see with this couple samples
here<00:02:22.879> this<00:02:23.659> was<00:02:24.019> done<00:02:24.260> with<00:02:24.500> thicker<00:02:24.799> layers

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
here this was done with thicker layers

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:27.819 
here this was done with thicker layers
of<00:02:25.609> clay<00:02:26.359> and<00:02:26.599> this<00:02:26.959> was<00:02:27.140> done<00:02:27.319> with<00:02:27.560> thinner

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
of clay and this was done with thinner

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.220 
of clay and this was done with thinner
layers<00:02:28.159> and<00:02:28.579> here<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.209> bright<00:02:29.420> green<00:02:29.659> bullets

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
layers and here the bright green bullets

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.690 
layers and here the bright green bullets
I'm<00:02:30.620> going<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.829> show<00:02:30.980> you<00:02:31.040> how<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.280> put<00:02:31.489> those

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
I'm going to show you how to put those

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.940 
I'm going to show you how to put those
in<00:02:32.000> but<00:02:32.420> I<00:02:32.450> want<00:02:32.659> you<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.870> notice<00:02:33.079> -<00:02:33.409> this<00:02:33.739> would

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
in but I want you to notice - this would

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.800 
in but I want you to notice - this would
be<00:02:33.980> an<00:02:34.159> area<00:02:34.310> where<00:02:34.489> a<00:02:34.730> green<00:02:35.120> one<00:02:35.329> was<00:02:35.510> not

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
be an area where a green one was not

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.349 
be an area where a green one was not
placed<00:02:36.260> so<00:02:37.099> what<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.430> can<00:02:37.579> do<00:02:37.730> is<00:02:37.879> take<00:02:38.120> a

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
placed so what you can do is take a

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.720 
placed so what you can do is take a
really<00:02:39.049> contrasting<00:02:39.859> color<00:02:40.069> of<00:02:40.159> clay<00:02:40.519> and

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
really contrasting color of clay and

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.660 
really contrasting color of clay and
fill<00:02:41.269> up<00:02:41.450> some<00:02:41.720> of<00:02:41.840> these<00:02:41.930> wells<00:02:42.349> and<00:02:42.709> you<00:02:43.400> just

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
fill up some of these wells and you just

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.619 
fill up some of these wells and you just
push<00:02:43.909> it<00:02:43.939> in<00:02:44.239> there<00:02:44.450> like<00:02:44.959> so<00:02:45.939> okay<00:02:46.939> and<00:02:47.209> then

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
push it in there like so okay and then

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.160 
push it in there like so okay and then
if<00:02:47.750> we<00:02:47.930> leave<00:02:48.170> some<00:02:49.120> empty<00:02:50.120> then<00:02:50.750> we'll<00:02:50.989> get

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
if we leave some empty then we'll get

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.349 
if we leave some empty then we'll get
another<00:02:51.560> different<00:02:52.069> look<00:02:52.280> now<00:02:52.879> here's<00:02:53.150> one

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
another different look now here's one

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.390 
another different look now here's one
that<00:02:53.510> I've<00:02:53.659> already<00:02:54.079> filled<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.829> I've

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
that I've already filled and I've

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.030 
that I've already filled and I've
already<00:02:55.819> left<00:02:56.569> some<00:02:56.900> of<00:02:57.019> them<00:02:57.169> empty<00:02:57.409> and<00:02:57.799> then

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
already left some of them empty and then

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.619 
already left some of them empty and then
what<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:58.250> did<00:02:58.370> was<00:02:58.639> I<00:02:58.760> just<00:02:58.790> went<00:02:59.030> back<00:02:59.359> and

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
around to fill up the air to force out

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.909 
around to fill up the air to force out
the<00:03:04.639> air<00:03:04.819> and<00:03:05.120> fill<00:03:05.329> up<00:03:05.480> any<00:03:05.689> pockets<00:03:06.290> we're

using a planned pattern instead of a
random<00:03:39.109> pattern<00:03:39.590> I<00:03:39.979> have<00:03:40.220> my<00:03:40.609> three<00:03:40.879> colors<00:03:41.180> of

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
random pattern I have my three colors of

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:42.969 
random pattern I have my three colors of
clay<00:03:41.449> already<00:03:41.870> conditioned<00:03:42.379> on<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.650> thickest

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:42.979 
clay already conditioned on the thickest

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:45.490 
clay already conditioned on the thickest
setting<00:03:43.129> I've<00:03:43.459> stacked<00:03:44.120> those<00:03:44.449> up<00:03:44.720> so<00:03:44.959> that

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
setting I've stacked those up so that

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.710 
setting I've stacked those up so that
it's<00:03:45.680> three<00:03:45.949> layers<00:03:46.099> thick<00:03:46.549> I<00:03:46.760> ran<00:03:47.269> that<00:03:47.479> back

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
it's three layers thick I ran that back

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.180 
it's three layers thick I ran that back
through<00:03:47.930> on<00:03:48.109> the<00:03:48.199> thickest<00:03:48.530> setting<00:03:48.680> and<00:03:49.010> made

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
through on the thickest setting and made

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.039 
through on the thickest setting and made
nine<00:03:49.489> layers<00:03:49.760> you<00:03:50.359> want<00:03:50.510> to<00:03:50.569> have<00:03:50.690> at<00:03:50.840> least

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
nine layers you want to have at least

I've used whatever I could get my hands
on<00:04:02.239> to<00:04:02.479> make<00:04:02.900> a<00:04:02.930> nice<00:04:03.319> dent<00:04:03.859> down<00:04:04.280> through<00:04:04.549> this

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669 
on to make a nice dent down through this

clay<00:04:05.409> once<00:04:06.409> your<00:04:06.590> pattern<00:04:07.010> is<00:04:07.159> established

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
clay once your pattern is established

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.869 
clay once your pattern is established
you<00:04:08.810> do<00:04:09.049> not<00:04:09.319> press<00:04:10.010> this<00:04:10.189> back<00:04:10.370> together<00:04:10.549> to

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
you do not press this back together to

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.309 
you do not press this back together to
fill<00:04:11.060> up<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.329> holes<00:04:11.509> like<00:04:11.810> we<00:04:11.989> did<00:04:12.169> before

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
fill up the holes like we did before

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.589 
fill up the holes like we did before
we're<00:04:12.889> going<00:04:12.979> to<00:04:13.040> leave<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.340> holes<00:04:13.549> open<00:04:14.120> so

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
we're going to leave the holes open so

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.839 
we're going to leave the holes open so
that<00:04:14.629> they<00:04:14.930> become<00:04:15.379> part<00:04:15.409> of<00:04:15.769> the<00:04:15.859> pattern<00:04:16.250> now

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:16.849 
that they become part of the pattern now

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:18.640 
that they become part of the pattern now
I'm<00:04:16.970> going<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.180> shave<00:04:17.449> with<00:04:17.479> my<00:04:17.870> really<00:04:18.199> sharp

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
I'm going to shave with my really sharp

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.069 
I'm going to shave with my really sharp
blade<00:04:18.949> I've<00:04:19.280> got<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:20.000> slightly<00:04:20.329> bent<00:04:20.720> so<00:04:20.959> it

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
blade I've got it slightly bent so it

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.420 
blade I've got it slightly bent so it
cuts<00:04:21.320> down<00:04:21.500> through<00:04:21.769> the<00:04:21.859> surface<00:04:22.070> of<00:04:22.310> the

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
cuts down through the surface of the

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.659 
cuts down through the surface of the
clay<00:04:22.580> and<00:04:22.969> I'm<00:04:23.330> being<00:04:23.690> extremely<00:04:24.349> careful

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
clay and I'm being extremely careful

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.310 
clay and I'm being extremely careful
okay<00:04:25.669> so<00:04:25.729> now<00:04:26.210> what's<00:04:26.630> cool<00:04:26.810> about<00:04:27.080> this

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
okay so now what's cool about this

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.879 
okay so now what's cool about this
method

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
method

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.390 
method
is<00:04:27.949> even<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:28.789> shavings<00:04:29.389> become<00:04:29.960> useful<00:04:30.469> the

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
is even the shavings become useful the

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.489 
is even the shavings become useful the
shaving<00:04:31.909> can<00:04:32.090> go<00:04:32.270> onto<00:04:32.539> an<00:04:33.050> already

00:04:33.489 --> 00:04:33.499 
shaving can go onto an already

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:35.739 
shaving can go onto an already
conditioned<00:04:34.009> piece<00:04:34.219> of<00:04:34.400> clay<00:04:34.639> this<00:04:35.330> one<00:04:35.539> just

00:04:35.739 --> 00:04:35.749 
conditioned piece of clay this one just

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:37.360 
conditioned piece of clay this one just
happens<00:04:36.080> to<00:04:36.139> have<00:04:36.259> some<00:04:36.590> gold<00:04:36.830> leaf<00:04:37.069> which

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
happens to have some gold leaf which

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.269 
happens to have some gold leaf which
shines<00:04:37.699> nicely<00:04:38.389> through<00:04:38.629> those<00:04:38.779> holes<00:04:39.110> and<00:04:39.499> so

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:40.279 
shines nicely through those holes and so

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:42.999 
shines nicely through those holes and so
you<00:04:40.370> can<00:04:40.610> use<00:04:40.939> the<00:04:41.419> shavings<00:04:41.930> as<00:04:42.139> well<00:04:42.620> as<00:04:42.860> the

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 
you can use the shavings as well as the

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:44.860 
you can use the shavings as well as the
slab<00:04:43.310> and<00:04:43.639> just<00:04:43.789> keep<00:04:43.999> cutting<00:04:44.270> down<00:04:44.599> through

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
slab and just keep cutting down through

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
got a method using a texture sheet I've

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.010 
got a method using a texture sheet I've
rolled<00:05:04.699> out<00:05:04.849> four<00:05:05.150> different<00:05:05.300> colors<00:05:05.719> of<00:05:05.750> clay

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
rolled out four different colors of clay

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.330 
rolled out four different colors of clay
through<00:05:06.409> the<00:05:06.500> thickest<00:05:06.860> setting<00:05:06.979> on<00:05:07.219> the

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
through the thickest setting on the

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.850 
through the thickest setting on the
pasta<00:05:07.370> machine<00:05:08.000> and<00:05:08.180> stacked<00:05:08.870> those<00:05:09.169> up<00:05:09.379> now

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
pasta machine and stacked those up now

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.140 
pasta machine and stacked those up now
here's<00:05:10.099> the<00:05:10.250> fun<00:05:10.460> part<00:05:10.490> you<00:05:10.909> want<00:05:11.090> to

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
here's the fun part you want to

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.879 
here's the fun part you want to
experiment<00:05:11.509> even<00:05:12.020> with<00:05:12.169> the<00:05:12.289> order<00:05:12.620> that<00:05:12.770> you

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
experiment even with the order that you

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.070 
experiment even with the order that you
stack<00:05:13.219> them<00:05:13.490> because<00:05:14.210> just<00:05:14.240> changing<00:05:14.990> the

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
stack them because just changing the

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.809 
stack them because just changing the
order<00:05:15.409> can<00:05:15.650> give<00:05:15.860> a<00:05:16.099> dramatically<00:05:16.699> different

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:16.819 
order can give a dramatically different

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:18.850 
order can give a dramatically different

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
appearance even though it's the same

appearance even though it's the same
colors<00:05:19.539> stack<00:05:20.539> those<00:05:20.750> up<00:05:20.930> run<00:05:21.229> them<00:05:21.319> through

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
colors stack those up run them through

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:22.749 
colors stack those up run them through
the<00:05:21.500> pasta<00:05:21.860> machine<00:05:21.919> on<00:05:22.279> the<00:05:22.400> thickest

the pasta machine on the thickest

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:25.149 
the pasta machine on the thickest
setting<00:05:22.909> then<00:05:23.659> cut<00:05:23.900> that<00:05:24.050> in<00:05:24.199> half<00:05:24.229> stack<00:05:25.009> it

setting then cut that in half stack it

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:26.890 
setting then cut that in half stack it
again<00:05:25.400> and<00:05:25.699> go<00:05:25.879> back<00:05:26.180> through<00:05:26.210> on<00:05:26.810> the

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
again and go back through on the

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.600 
again and go back through on the
thickest<00:05:27.259> setting<00:05:27.379> so<00:05:27.919> that<00:05:28.099> you<00:05:28.189> have<00:05:28.400> eight

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
thickest setting so that you have eight

we're going to texture it I'm just using

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:36.040 
we're going to texture it I'm just using
