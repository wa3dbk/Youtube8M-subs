00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
video but it's proving to be a little

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.150 
video but it's proving to be a little
more<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.519> challenge<00:00:14.759> than<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.299> expected

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
more of a challenge than I expected

fighting<00:00:21.000> vehicles<00:00:21.830> today<00:00:22.830> we're<00:00:23.189> going<00:00:23.310> to

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
fighting vehicles today we're going to

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.519

look<00:00:23.550> at<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.000> primary<00:00:24.539> weapons<00:00:24.900> as<00:00:25.170> their

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
look at the primary weapons as their

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.589 
look at the primary weapons as their
unique<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.189> ife<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.880> not<00:00:27.119> shared<00:00:27.390> with

both<00:00:33.120> armor<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.840> infantry<00:00:34.640> first<00:00:35.640> we'll<00:00:36.059> look

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
both armor and infantry first we'll look

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.280 
both armor and infantry first we'll look
at<00:00:36.480> how<00:00:36.510> these<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.050> munitions<00:00:37.710> affect<00:00:38.160> armor

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
at how these a munitions affect armor

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.680 
at how these a munitions affect armor
the<00:00:40.290> high-explosive<00:00:40.980> rounds<00:00:41.430> work<00:00:42.090> much<00:00:42.510> like

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the high-explosive rounds work much like

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.869 
the high-explosive rounds work much like
they<00:00:42.870> did<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.079> battlefield<00:00:43.530> 3<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:44.129> feel<00:00:44.430> less

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
they did in battlefield 3 but feel less

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.930 
they did in battlefield 3 but feel less
powerful<00:00:45.260> this<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.890> default<00:00:47.219> ammunition

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
powerful this is the default ammunition

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.459 
powerful this is the default ammunition
you'll<00:00:48.059> start<00:00:48.329> with<00:00:48.510> until<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.050> unlock<00:00:49.170> the

you'll start with until you unlock the
rest<00:00:49.680> they<00:00:50.640> do<00:00:50.969> 3<00:00:51.300> damage<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.840> armor<00:00:52.199> with<00:00:52.410> a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
rest they do 3 damage to armor with a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.040 
rest they do 3 damage to armor with a
direct<00:00:52.800> hit<00:00:53.090> unlike<00:00:54.090> battlefield<00:00:54.600> 3<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.960> do

projectiles move slower and drop faster

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.700 
projectiles move slower and drop faster
than<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> other<00:01:03.329> rounds<00:01:03.780> put<00:01:04.019> their<00:01:04.199> reliable

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
than the other rounds put their reliable

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
damage versus armor and infantry make

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.000 
damage versus armor and infantry make
them<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> great<00:01:07.740> general<00:01:08.100> purpose<00:01:08.580> ammunition

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
them a great general purpose ammunition

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.969 
them a great general purpose ammunition
the<00:01:11.010> armor-piercing<00:01:11.850> rounds<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> higher

the armor-piercing rounds have a higher
muzzle<00:01:14.250> velocity<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.000> there<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.360> less<00:01:15.720> drop

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
muzzle velocity in there for less drop

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.609 
muzzle velocity in there for less drop
lead<00:01:16.619> time<00:01:16.890> than<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.610> high<00:01:17.880> explosive<00:01:18.360> round

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
lead time than the high explosive round

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.499 
lead time than the high explosive round
making<00:01:19.619> them<00:01:19.890> more<00:01:20.100> useful<00:01:20.490> at<00:01:20.670> long<00:01:20.850> range<00:01:21.150> I

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
making them more useful at long range I

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.499 
making them more useful at long range I
also<00:01:22.049> deal<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:22.860> damaged<00:01:23.340> armor<00:01:23.850> making<00:01:24.360> them

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
also deal for damaged armor making them

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.539 
also deal for damaged armor making them
more<00:01:24.659> useful<00:01:25.080> for<00:01:25.259> anti-tank<00:01:25.799> purposes<00:01:26.310> and

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
more useful for anti-tank purposes and

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.120 
more useful for anti-tank purposes and
the<00:01:27.060> other<00:01:27.240> ammunition<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.869> available<00:01:28.290> they

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
the other ammunition is available they

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.710 
the other ammunition is available they
do<00:01:29.189> not<00:01:29.280> benefit<00:01:29.850> from<00:01:29.909> critical<00:01:30.420> strikes

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
do not benefit from critical strikes

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.810 
do not benefit from critical strikes
like<00:01:30.990> they<00:01:31.110> did<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.229> battlefield<00:01:31.740> 3<00:01:31.799> we<00:01:32.640> found

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
like they did in battlefield 3 we found

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.109 
like they did in battlefield 3 we found
they<00:01:33.060> did<00:01:33.240> for<00:01:33.570> damage<00:01:33.930> at<00:01:34.110> all<00:01:34.409> angles<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
they did for damage at all angles in the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.390 
they did for damage at all angles in the
last<00:01:36.329> game<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.350> ran<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.799> anti-tank

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
last game if you ran the anti-tank

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.359 
last game if you ran the anti-tank
rounds<00:01:38.640> they<00:01:39.600> were<00:01:39.659> absolutely<00:01:40.369> devastating

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
rounds they were absolutely devastating

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.580 
rounds they were absolutely devastating
if<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.759> could<00:01:41.970> flank<00:01:42.270> an<00:01:42.509> enemy<00:01:42.899> vehicle<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
if you could flank an enemy vehicle and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.310 
if you could flank an enemy vehicle and
shoot<00:01:43.950> them<00:01:44.100> directly<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> rear<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.320> guess

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
shoot them directly in the rear I guess

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.460 
shoot them directly in the rear I guess
those<00:01:46.560> days<00:01:46.799> are<00:01:47.040> long<00:01:47.070> gone<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.840> canister
