this<00:00:00.989> does<00:00:01.680> not<00:00:01.709> come<00:00:02.100> in<00:00:02.190> a<00:00:02.280> retail<00:00:02.580> box<00:00:02.939> so

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
this does not come in a retail box so

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.650 
this does not come in a retail box so
though<00:00:03.300> it<00:00:03.419> will<00:00:03.570> for<00:00:03.929> you<00:00:04.110> this<00:00:04.890> is<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.759> ocz

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
though it will for you this is the ocz

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.810 
though it will for you this is the ocz
vertex<00:00:07.639> 3<00:00:08.639> so<00:00:09.389> this<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:09.960> very<00:00:10.320> very<00:00:11.160> exciting

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
vertex 3 so this is a very very exciting

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.160 
vertex 3 so this is a very very exciting
product<00:00:12.269> because<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:13.280> comes<00:00:14.280> as<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:15.170> successor

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
product because it comes as a successor

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.769 
product because it comes as a successor

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
and as a worthy successor to the vertex

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.130 
and as a worthy successor to the vertex

largely in part largely due to the fact

largely in part largely due to the fact
that<00:01:07.560> they<00:01:07.710> used<00:01:07.890> aceite<00:01:08.280> 36<00:01:08.760> gigabit<00:01:09.180> per

changes<00:01:13.770> all<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.820> gives<00:01:15.090> us<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.360> new

really a compelling value at just over 6
hundred<00:02:09.630> dollars<00:02:09.899> or<00:02:10.080> maybe<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.350> like

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
hundred dollars or maybe it's like

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.620 
hundred dollars or maybe it's like
eighteen<00:02:10.860> hundred<00:02:11.130> dollars<00:02:11.400> Rita<00:02:11.700> it's<00:02:12.270> very

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
eighteen hundred dollars Rita it's very

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.290 
eighteen hundred dollars Rita it's very
very<00:02:12.930> high<00:02:13.230> it's<00:02:13.620> far<00:02:14.310> more<00:02:14.370> than<00:02:14.700> double<00:02:15.210> the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
very high it's far more than double the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.650 
very high it's far more than double the
price<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.750> 240<00:02:16.290> whereas<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> 240<00:02:17.340> is

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
price of the 240 whereas a 240 is

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.120 
price of the 240 whereas a 240 is
approximately<00:02:18.660> double<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.050> price<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.530> 120

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
approximately double the price of a 120

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.880 
approximately double the price of a 120
and<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.970> should<00:02:21.210> be<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.870> 120<00:02:22.740> is

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
and so it should be and 120 is

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.980 
and so it should be and 120 is
approximately<00:02:23.670> double<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.090> price<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.630> and

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
approximately double the price of it and

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.840 
approximately double the price of it and

it<00:02:38.610> uses<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:39.000> se23<00:02:39.390> interface<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.020> if<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.170> want

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
it uses a se23 interface so if you want

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.050 
it uses a se23 interface so if you want
to<00:02:40.380> come<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.590> have<00:02:40.709> a<00:02:40.770> closer<00:02:41.040> look<00:02:41.370> at<00:02:41.580> the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
to come and have a closer look at the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.670 
to come and have a closer look at the
interface<00:02:42.450> here<00:02:42.720> there's<00:02:43.230> your<00:02:43.410> state<00:02:43.650> of

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
interface here there's your state of

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.410 
interface here there's your state of
power<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.250> there's<00:02:44.730> your<00:02:44.820> state<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.270> three

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
power and there's your state of three

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.210 
power and there's your state of three
interface<00:02:45.780> which<00:02:46.020> looks<00:02:46.260> exactly<00:02:46.680> like<00:02:46.890> say

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
interface which looks exactly like say

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.110 
interface which looks exactly like say
22<00:02:47.400> because<00:02:48.330> all<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:50.070> changes<00:02:50.550> that<00:02:50.850> have

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
22 because all of the changes that have

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.210 
22 because all of the changes that have
gone<00:02:51.150> on<00:02:51.330> are<00:02:51.810> actually<00:02:52.320> on<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.800> side<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.070> the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
gone on are actually on this side of the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.920 
gone on are actually on this side of the
interface<00:02:53.520> rather<00:02:53.970> than<00:02:54.209> on<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.390> connector

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
interface rather than on the connector

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.449 
interface rather than on the connector
themselves<00:02:55.440> you've<00:02:55.860> got<00:02:56.100> all<00:02:56.220> of<00:02:56.250> your

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
themselves you've got all of your

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.860 
themselves you've got all of your
standard<00:02:56.910> mounting<00:02:57.270> holes<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:57.690> you've<00:02:57.840> got

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
standard mounting holes so you've got

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.590 
standard mounting holes so you've got
your<00:02:58.050> sides<00:02:58.470> here<00:02:59.040> as<00:02:59.190> well<00:02:59.820> as<00:03:00.030> your<00:03:00.270> bottom

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
your sides here as well as your bottom

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.820 
your sides here as well as your bottom
mounting<00:03:00.930> hole<00:03:01.080> so<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.290> means<00:03:01.560> you'll<00:03:01.709> be

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
mounting hole so that means you'll be

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.740 
mounting hole so that means you'll be
able<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.190> mount<00:03:02.489> this<00:03:02.670> in<00:03:02.880> pretty<00:03:03.390> much<00:03:03.450> any

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
able to mount this in pretty much any

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.070 
able to mount this in pretty much any
laptop<00:03:04.410> as<00:03:04.650> long<00:03:04.830> as<00:03:04.980> it<00:03:05.100> doesn't<00:03:05.280> take<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:06.080> very

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
laptop as long as it doesn't take a very

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.490 
laptop as long as it doesn't take a very
small<00:03:07.440> 1.8<00:03:08.310> inch<00:03:08.580> SSD<00:03:09.239> or<00:03:09.570> if<00:03:10.320> it<00:03:10.470> has

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
small 1.8 inch SSD or if it has

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.009 
small 1.8 inch SSD or if it has
non-standard<00:03:11.340> mounting<00:03:11.760> which<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.270> very<00:03:12.810> very

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
non-standard mounting which is very very

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.360 
non-standard mounting which is very very
rare<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:13.470> pretty<00:03:13.709> much<00:03:13.830> will<00:03:13.980> fit<00:03:14.130> in<00:03:14.220> any

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
rare so pretty much will fit in any

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.789 
rare so pretty much will fit in any
laptop<00:03:14.820> and<00:03:15.060> with<00:03:15.360> an<00:03:15.480> adapter<00:03:15.750> it'll<00:03:16.560> fit<00:03:16.769> in

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
laptop and with an adapter it'll fit in

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.210 
laptop and with an adapter it'll fit in
pretty<00:03:17.130> much<00:03:17.280> any<00:03:17.690> desktop<00:03:18.799> in<00:03:19.799> terms<00:03:20.070> of

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
pretty much any desktop in terms of

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.420 
pretty much any desktop in terms of
other<00:03:20.459> changes<00:03:21.030> ocz<00:03:21.810> well<00:03:22.590> okay<00:03:22.980> let's<00:03:23.190> let's

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
other changes ocz well okay let's let's

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.740 
other changes ocz well okay let's let's
talk<00:03:23.549> about<00:03:23.670> things<00:03:23.850> that<00:03:23.970> aren't<00:03:24.209> changes<00:03:24.600> so

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
talk about things that aren't changes so

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.630 
talk about things that aren't changes so
it<00:03:24.840> still<00:03:25.080> supports<00:03:25.470> trim<00:03:25.769> which<00:03:26.250> means<00:03:26.519> that

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
it still supports trim which means that

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.970 
it still supports trim which means that
if<00:03:26.880> you're<00:03:27.000> running<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.510> Windows<00:03:27.780> 7<00:03:28.080> OS<00:03:28.410> it

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
if you're running the Windows 7 OS it

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.180 
if you're running the Windows 7 OS it
will<00:03:29.220> automatically<00:03:30.150> clean<00:03:30.959> up<00:03:31.140> any<00:03:31.410> deleted

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
will automatically clean up any deleted

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.880 
will automatically clean up any deleted
data<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.989> optimize<00:03:33.989> it<00:03:34.260> so<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:34.620> you're<00:03:34.830> not

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
data and optimize it so that you're not

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.640 
data and optimize it so that you're not
going<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.310> experience<00:03:35.760> any<00:03:35.970> slowdown<00:03:36.750> as<00:03:37.019> the

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
going to experience any slowdown as the

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.340 
going to experience any slowdown as the
SSD<00:03:38.130> gets<00:03:38.489> into<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.239> what<00:03:39.630> is<00:03:39.720> called<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.989> used

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
SSD gets into a what is called a used

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.920 
SSD gets into a what is called a used
state<00:03:40.950> okay<00:03:41.670> so<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.940> does<00:03:42.090> feature<00:03:42.299> trim<00:03:42.720> and

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
state okay so it does feature trim and

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.250 
state okay so it does feature trim and
is<00:03:43.560> also<00:03:43.769> fully<00:03:44.730> raid<00:03:45.090> capable<00:03:45.720> now<00:03:45.900> this<00:03:46.110> is

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
is also fully raid capable now this is

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.900 
is also fully raid capable now this is
something<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.650> pretty<00:03:47.040> much<00:03:47.190> everyone<00:03:47.549> puts

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
something that pretty much everyone puts

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.699 
something that pretty much everyone puts
on<00:03:48.150> their<00:03:48.329> SSD<00:03:48.780> packaging<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:49.470> it's<00:03:49.560> always

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
on their SSD packaging and it's always

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.100 
on their SSD packaging and it's always
been<00:03:49.920> a<00:03:49.950> little<00:03:50.100> bit<00:03:50.310> confusing<00:03:50.940> to<00:03:51.299> me<00:03:51.450> but

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
been a little bit confusing to me but

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.800

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
still be just fine for consumer level

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.150 
still be just fine for consumer level

consumer level use it comes with a

three-year warranty and as I mean

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.559 
three-year warranty and as I mean
between<00:04:20.259> failure<00:04:20.620> of<00:04:21.210> 2<00:04:22.210> million<00:04:22.780> hours<00:04:23.530> ok<00:04:24.280> so

between failure of 2 million hours ok so

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.580 
between failure of 2 million hours ok so
