the speed that she had coming out of
that<00:01:20.620> triple<00:01:21.190> that's<00:01:21.550> what<00:01:21.850> shows<00:01:22.150> that<00:01:22.540> that

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
that triple that's what shows that that

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:34.350 
that triple that's what shows that that
real<00:01:23.440> strength<00:01:24.040> and<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.730> triple<00:01:25.240> well<00:01:25.480> done

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:46.630 

you

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.020 

triple<00:01:47.640> toe<00:01:47.850> that's<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.780> more<00:01:49.680> difficult

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
triple toe that's a more difficult

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.910 
triple toe that's a more difficult
triple<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.329> when<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.630> do<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> jump<00:01:52.229> like<00:01:52.469> a

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
triple is when you do a jump like a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.620 
triple is when you do a jump like a
double<00:01:53.340> or<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.579> split<00:01:54.060> jump<00:01:54.299> or<00:01:54.479> something

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
double or a split jump or something

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.870 
double or a split jump or something
before<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.829> triple<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.340> makes<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.729> even

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
before the triple that makes it even

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.109 
before the triple that makes it even
more<00:01:57.060> difficult<00:01:57.270> because<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.289> says<00:01:58.530> a

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
more difficult because it says a

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.370 
more difficult because it says a
different<00:02:00.119> entrance<00:02:00.390> rather<00:02:00.840> than<00:02:01.049> just

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
different entrance rather than just

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:16.809 
different entrance rather than just
concentrating<00:02:02.220> on<00:02:02.220> a<00:02:02.369> triple

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:30.660 

you

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.610 

that's<00:02:31.670> one<00:02:31.940> of<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.150> hard<00:02:32.390> one<00:02:32.660> going<00:02:33.500> from

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
that's one of the hard one going from

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.980 
that's one of the hard one going from
the<00:02:33.800> back<00:02:34.040> outside<00:02:34.430> edge<00:02:34.940> with<00:02:35.210> no<00:02:35.390> support<00:02:35.900> of

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
the back outside edge with no support of

the back outside edge with no support of
the<00:02:36.140> topic<00:02:36.590> makes<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.220> triple<00:02:37.580> loop<00:02:37.700> very

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
the topic makes the triple loop very

00:02:38.030 --> 00:03:13.390 
the topic makes the triple loop very
difficult<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:39.230> was<00:02:39.530> clean

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.270 

one<00:03:14.400> more<00:03:14.640> triple<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.120> come<00:03:15.769> but<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:16.950> essence

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
one more triple to come but the essence

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.280 
one more triple to come but the essence
of<00:03:17.370> this<00:03:17.549> program<00:03:17.760> is<00:03:18.060> not<00:03:18.269> only<00:03:18.329> the<00:03:18.629> gums<00:03:18.989> but

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
of this program is not only the gums but

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.929 
of this program is not only the gums but
the<00:03:19.409> really<00:03:19.590> beautiful<00:03:19.860> line<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.579> she<00:03:20.730> has

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:20.939 
the really beautiful line that she has

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.360 
the really beautiful line that she has
the<00:03:21.629> security<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.349> the<00:03:22.409> maturity<00:03:23.040> that<00:03:23.189> she

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
the security and the maturity that she

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.569 
the security and the maturity that she
is<00:03:23.459> great<00:03:23.670> look<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.659> arm<00:03:24.840> will<00:03:25.079> be<00:03:25.200> dead
