00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:12.249
 I think you should know about me 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.249
 without specializing in fact 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.389
 we consciously knew 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.730
 but if we did the sentences that 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.820
 nominations 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.820
 work on it 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.170
 Not certainly in that way 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.170
 we created the world again 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.680
 the commission hopes he 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.430
 in the wake of this secret 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.410
 but then you have to choose a language 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.410
 honestly not entirely legal 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.050
 this is called the beginning 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.220
 but I found 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.530
 I'm going to understand what happened. 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.530
 its 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.270
 himself shrinking 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.770
 to control everything 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.160
 I hate telling you
