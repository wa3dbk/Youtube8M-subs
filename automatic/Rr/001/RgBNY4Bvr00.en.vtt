00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.570
 Take advantage of the possibilities of modern beats technique for beautiful 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.570
 women 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.710
 if you want to do outdoor portraits, you have Kant's different ones 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.050
 possibilities 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.519
 they can use the available daylight as a light source 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.990
 or on the other hand, they can light their pictures with flash 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.610
 They have the choice whether they use the built-in small flash 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.890
 an optional speed grief 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.910
 4 do this recording here with the Speedlite 580 EGS 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.760
 is the largest and most powerful flash unit that can and will do more 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.790
 We take the pictures with a 55 to 2 net 50 millimeter telephoto lens 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.600
 to make the light color a little warmer I have a ran Ilter 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.650
 Glued slides in front of the flash unit 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.620
 because the shades a little warmer 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.620
 we are taking a few pictures now 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.980
 you painted about that position 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.680
 Look that way 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.790
 This also fits the background course 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.189
 Dr ob Eck 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.189
 can still a bit big now I'll turn a little bit more 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:20.990
 here 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.240
 That's good 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.240
 why another direction is great 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.890
 Class they cared for comes number 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.030
 that's OK that's better it's class 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.670
 yes that's him, he's a very good student and that's very lively that's good 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.740
 stand 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.869
 we had the flash unit right on the camera with these shots now 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.740
 gives a relatively flat light 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.299
 An interesting way to solve the flash of the Camorra 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.180
 is an optional cable 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.180
 push it instead it goes directly into the PC show 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.860
 They put the flash in the other end of the cable 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.310
 Of course it takes a bit of skill to do that 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.280
 both parts can hold so that the flash in the subject lit and they 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.280
 on the other hand, make the right image with the camera 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.709
 so about that again I think the flash meant high 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:20.949
 yes, when you change that again a bit 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.299
 slightly change the focal length 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.949
 and there make BÃ¼hler 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.019
 Yes, okay 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.019
 Yes Perfect 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:34.329
 and one last thing 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.329
 wonderful Commons still do that 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.379
 now I had the chamber the other way round 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.499
 that is bad 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.509
 with the unleashed detached from the Camorra flashing 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.839
 Light up your motif much softer and more pleasant 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:53.759
 the picture looks much more plastic and realistic
