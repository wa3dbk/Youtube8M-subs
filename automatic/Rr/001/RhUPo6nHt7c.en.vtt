00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
before I was looking up a glitch on the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.240 
before I was looking up a glitch on the
Zelda<00:00:35.550> wiki<00:00:35.850> or<00:00:36.120> whatever<00:00:36.710> janehamlett<00:00:37.710> calm

and<00:00:38.550> yes<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.329> works

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
and yes this works

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.330 
and yes this works
oh<00:00:40.160> my<00:00:41.160> god<00:00:41.309> Murphy

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.240 

so<00:00:46.840> let's<00:00:47.840> see<00:00:48.230> if<00:00:48.290> it's<00:00:48.560> the<00:00:48.710> same<00:00:48.890> as<00:00:48.950> the

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
so let's see if it's the same as the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.810 
so let's see if it's the same as the
original

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
original

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.030 
original
there<00:00:49.970> should<00:00:50.120> be<00:00:50.150> an<00:00:50.300> extra<00:00:50.780> tree<00:00:51.170> I'm<00:00:51.920> not

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
there should be an extra tree I'm not

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.040 
there should be an extra tree I'm not
sure<00:00:52.190> which<00:00:52.340> one<00:00:52.580> of<00:00:52.610> these<00:00:52.820> it<00:00:53.000> is<00:00:53.120> if<00:00:53.840> it's

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
sure which one of these it is if it's

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.610 
sure which one of these it is if it's
even<00:00:54.320> meas<00:00:54.640> no<00:00:55.640> party<00:00:56.060> is<00:00:56.180> a<00:00:56.210> crate<00:00:57.110> on<00:00:57.320> top<00:00:57.500> of

web page well it's pretty much exactly
the<00:01:37.670> same<00:01:37.780> so<00:01:38.780> bla<00:01:39.320> bla<00:01:39.890> time<00:01:40.729> should<00:01:40.910> not<00:01:40.940> be

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
the same so bla bla time should not be

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.670 
the same so bla bla time should not be
free<00:01:41.330> for<00:01:41.540> you<00:01:41.630> a<00:01:41.720> check<00:01:42.020> a<00:01:42.050> notebook

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
you'd have to check that actually yeah

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.400 
you'd have to check that actually yeah
yeah<00:01:44.270> when<00:01:44.450> he<00:01:44.539> paused<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.869> game<00:01:44.899> pressing

start so like whatever it will say the
time<00:01:47.479> and<00:01:48.159> and<00:01:49.659> we<00:01:50.659> have<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:50.810> do<00:01:50.960> is<00:01:51.140> on<00:01:51.280> unpause

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
time and and we have to do is on unpause

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.109 
time and and we have to do is on unpause
keep<00:01:54.950> pausing<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:55.340> I'm<00:01:55.430> pausing<00:01:55.790> in<00:01:55.909> to<00:01:56.000> us

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
keep pausing and I'm pausing in to us

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.620 
keep pausing and I'm pausing in to us
exactly<00:01:56.840> free<00:01:57.140> 49<00:01:58.840> where<00:01:59.840> does<00:01:59.930> it<00:02:00.049> say<00:02:00.170> that

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
exactly free 49 where does it say that

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.260 
exactly free 49 where does it say that
yeah<00:02:02.630> this<00:02:03.470> as<00:02:03.979> soon<00:02:04.220> as<00:02:04.280> it<00:02:04.400> turns<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.670> free<00:02:04.880> 49

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
yeah this as soon as it turns to free 49

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.310 
yeah this as soon as it turns to free 49
you<00:02:05.570> pause<00:02:05.810> unpause<00:02:06.350> pause<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:07.040> pause<00:02:08.320> so

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
you pause unpause pause and pause so

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.990 
you pause unpause pause and pause so
basically<00:02:09.560> important<00:02:10.010> was<00:02:10.130> twice<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.790> then

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
basically important was twice and then

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.820 
basically important was twice and then
you<00:02:11.209> unpause<00:02:11.780> and<00:02:12.080> take<00:02:12.230> out<00:02:12.350> your<00:02:12.470> Kareena

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
you unpause and take out your Kareena

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.360 
you unpause and take out your Kareena
but<00:02:13.730> well<00:02:13.850> I<00:02:13.880> found<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.989> is<00:02:15.350> that<00:02:16.130> it's

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
but well I found that is that it's

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.720 
but well I found that is that it's
harder<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.030> pause<00:02:17.269> buffer<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:18.019> teeny<00:02:18.799> bit<00:02:19.010> just

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
harder to pause buffer a teeny bit just

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.130 
harder to pause buffer a teeny bit just
because<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.060> way<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.540> buttons<00:02:20.720> are<00:02:20.989> I<00:02:21.019> guess

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
because the way the buttons are I guess

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.440 
because the way the buttons are I guess
and<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:22.040> game<00:02:22.190> actually<00:02:22.459> pauses<00:02:23.150> on<00:02:23.269> and

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
and that the game actually pauses on and

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.479 
and that the game actually pauses on and
unpause<00:02:23.989> as<00:02:24.170> faster<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:24.709> doesn't<00:02:25.040> original

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
unpause as faster that doesn't original

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.380 
unpause as faster that doesn't original
so<00:02:26.209> I<00:02:26.239> had<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:26.840> keep<00:02:27.140> guessing

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
so I had to keep guessing

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.850 
so I had to keep guessing
like<00:02:31.360> like<00:02:32.360> manually<00:02:32.900> draw<00:02:33.260> an<00:02:33.350> error<00:02:33.530> by

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
like like manually draw an error by
