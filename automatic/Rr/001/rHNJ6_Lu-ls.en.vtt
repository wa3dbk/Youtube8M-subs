 welcome to iphone parts repair 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.819
 dot nl 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.160
 instruction videos follow us on youtube 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.740
 facebook and twitter 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.090
 here is the iphone 6 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.490
 step 1 puts the iphone 6 out of step 2 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.510
 remove the two pentalobe screws 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.640
 At the bottom 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.750
 if you do not have a pentalobe screwdriver 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.070
 to have 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.070
 take a quick look at our website 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.059
 step 3 grab the suction cup and drop the screen 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.920
 a little bit up 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.660
 now there is enough space for the 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.280
 Pride target the bottom of the screen 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.280
 detach from the frame 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.250
 now lift the screen 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.579
 step 4 delete the next five 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.879
 screws on this metal plate and 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.089
 remove the metal plate 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.610
 step 5 below we link the screen 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.440
 in principle it is not necessary but because 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.750
 the battery is glued rather firmly 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.180
 it is safer to take just the four cables 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.930
 and the screen temporarily 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.930
 safe to store 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.060
 step 6 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.159
 remove the two screws from this 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.430
 metal plate that runs out of battery 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.430
 place 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.220
 much that we put the metal on 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.220
 hate and love battery connector up 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.170
 step 7 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.560
 now remove the battery using 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.560
 the tools 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.220
 was the battery with no possibility 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.840
 come off 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.810
 you can choose the back 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.790
 of heating the cases with a hair dryer 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.980
 however, do this no longer than 1 or 2 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.030
 minutes otherwise you will damage the internal 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.030
 parts by the heat 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.439
 try to leave as much glue as possible 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.890
 so that you can use it again later 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.890
 can use 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.340
 You should it anyway 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.200
 they use to remove all the glue then 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.000
 some double-sided tape to the new one 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.060
 battery will be back in place 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.060
 to hold 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.720
 step 8 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.580
 grab your new battery and I do first 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.409

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.800

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.470

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.520
 plug your screen william press all screen 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.160

 back in the right place if it's right 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.270
 hear and feel them click 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.840
 just like you run out of a lego block 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.840
 place struct 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:20.100
 step 11 screw the metal plate with the 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.100
 five screws back in place 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.830
