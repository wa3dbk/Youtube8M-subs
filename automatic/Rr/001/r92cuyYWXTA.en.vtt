I have UAV jammer just anomaly TV and
deep<00:00:33.059> impact<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.320> choose<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> balls<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
deep impact so I choose the balls to the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.729 
deep impact so I choose the balls to the
wall<00:00:35.700> because<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.270> know<00:00:36.390> without<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.809> then

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
wall because you know without it then

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.990 
wall because you know without it then

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
you can't really get them and see them

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.850 
you can't really get them and see them
but<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.329> can't<00:00:39.360> destroy<00:00:40.079> them<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:40.680> kind

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
but you can't destroy them so it's kind

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.889 
but you can't destroy them so it's kind
of<00:00:40.950> set<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:42.379> next<00:00:43.379> one<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.559> got<00:00:44.210> that<00:00:45.210> one<00:00:45.420> where

of set the next one I got that one where

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.760 
of set the next one I got that one where
is<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.200> there<00:00:46.530> we<00:00:46.649> go<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:47.360> got<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.600> shotgun<00:00:49.140> for<00:00:49.680> my

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
okay I like it with a scope works pretty

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.630 
okay I like it with a scope works pretty
good<00:01:01.579> and<00:01:03.650> see<00:01:04.650> if<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.799> person<00:01:05.070> also<00:01:05.189> got<00:01:05.460> bomb

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.899 
good and see if a person also got bomb
squad<00:01:05.939> game<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.510> deep<00:01:07.170> impact<00:01:07.500> it's<00:01:08.400> like<00:01:08.610> you

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
squad game and deep impact it's like you

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.240 
squad game and deep impact it's like you
use<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> shotgun<00:01:09.360> clear<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.049> building<00:01:10.439> like

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250

use the shotgun clear on a building like
a<00:01:11.310> sniper<00:01:11.520> building<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.180> then<00:01:12.270> once<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.630> go

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
a sniper building and then once you go

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.440 
a sniper building and then once you go
in<00:01:12.930> my<00:01:13.110> lap<00:01:13.290> plaza<00:01:13.590> i'm<00:01:14.460> 21<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:14.970> then<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.299> can

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
in my lap plaza i'm 21 and then you can

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.440 
in my lap plaza i'm 21 and then you can
start<00:01:15.630> smashing<00:01:16.049> from<00:01:16.200> there<00:01:16.670> so<00:01:17.670> we're

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
start smashing from there so we're

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.330 
start smashing from there so we're
pretty<00:01:18.750> good<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.259> then<00:01:19.409> for<00:01:19.650> my<00:01:19.770> sniper<00:01:20.070> class

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
pretty good and then for my sniper class

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.649 
pretty good and then for my sniper class
I<00:01:20.810> like<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.049> m40<00:01:22.860> sniper<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.610> think<00:01:24.540> it's<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
I like the m40 sniper I think it's the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.510 
I like the m40 sniper I think it's the
best<00:01:24.810> one<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.290> game<00:01:25.560> some<00:01:25.890> more<00:01:26.009> assets<00:01:26.400> I

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
best one in the game some more assets I

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.020 
best one in the game some more assets I
accurate<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:28.229> pretty<00:01:28.799> good<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.610> use<00:01:29.790> that

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
accurate and pretty good so I use that

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.350 
accurate and pretty good so I use that
with<00:01:30.829> claymores<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.310> know<00:01:32.460> Seth<00:01:32.700> sniper<00:01:33.119> spot

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
with claymores you know Seth sniper spot

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.319 
with claymores you know Seth sniper spot
do<00:01:34.049> TV<00:01:34.200> jammer<00:01:34.729> so<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.850> know<00:01:35.970> like<00:01:36.119> you're

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
do TV jammer so you know like you're

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.999 
do TV jammer so you know like you're
snapping<00:01:36.540> they'll<00:01:36.840> come<00:01:37.320> after<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.829> know

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
snapping they'll come after you know

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.929 
snapping they'll come after you know
they<00:01:38.220> are<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.060> then<00:01:39.930> iron<00:01:40.770> lung<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.820> no

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
they are and then iron lung so you no

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.389 
they are and then iron lung so you no
longer<00:01:43.009> sniper<00:01:44.009> breaths<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:46.009> when<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.130> guess<00:01:47.310> I

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
longer sniper breaths so when I guess I

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.120 
longer sniper breaths so when I guess I
goes<00:01:47.670> back<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.939> these<00:01:48.030> ones<00:01:48.210> when<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.600> got<00:01:49.130> just

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
goes back to these ones when I got just

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.670 
goes back to these ones when I got just
