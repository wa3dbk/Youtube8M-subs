00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 age than the truth so that it works very 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.390
 well in the market the netbooks so that 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.770
 evolve so that more and more 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.330
 people who want to take them to 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.130
 any side work from a bar and 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.860
 others need good connections 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.780
 wireless good 3g connections and still 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.500
 perhaps in latin america of argentina not 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.359
 we have a 3g network really speaking 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.590
 seriously the really powerful you 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.750
 you have in the us in europe 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.490
 we want we have the presentation we are going to 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.490
 see the presentation 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:45.290
 in general between 300 and a thousand dollars 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.250
 approximately he just showed his 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.250
 size and weight 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.610
 apparently it was really a surprise 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.809
 they are francisco the truth is that they look 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.230
 very well this is really going to change the 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.230
 flight 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:11.560
 combines the iphone of the access level to 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.560
 Internet 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.110
 really changed the world with the itunes 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.180
 revolutionized first with the habits of 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.259
 world of music the same will happen 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.090
 now with this device they are going to 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.480
 work with publishers against 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.660
 other music distribution companies 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.700
 to access music videos and 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.150
 books the same thing he's doing 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.020
 together with here we can see then the 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.620
 ipad 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:52.700
 this new blue guitar 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:55.160
 with alexis alexis this could be having 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.140
 a new phone what replaces 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.290
 perhaps to the cellular telephone if it is that 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.420
 it is achieved that people carry it over 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.160
 all the time because with that TV with 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.220
 that ipad 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.050
 you can connect by phone but 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.360
 without paying because you can not connect to 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.320
 through the internet 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.540
 with skype for example not really 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.600
 This neighborhood revolutionizes several markets 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.220
 revolutionizes as well as revolutionized 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.470
 also the iphone does not revolutionize the 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.000
 cell phone market the 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.550
 Telcos market revolutionizes the 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.760
 editorial market and I encourage you to say 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.320
 this the story will say not how it ends 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.450
 this but I encourage you to say that at 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.240
 cell phone market is going to 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.120
 complicate the publishing market is going to 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.270
 save that because this will make 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.800
 many people are tempted for example to 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.270
 insert the credit card while 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.200
 connected to the internet and to buy a 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.150
 digital book 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.500
 online that maybe before I would not buy you 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.510
 with this in two seconds you will see a 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.980
 catalog of millions of books and 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.200
 You will suddenly be tempted with a book and 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.030
 like how low in 60 seconds you're going to put 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.030
 the card and what are you going to buy it
