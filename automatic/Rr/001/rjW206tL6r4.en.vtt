00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
village of the PIR and it is dark it's

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.659 
village of the PIR and it is dark it's
also<00:00:19.369> got<00:00:19.609> a<00:00:19.640> built-in<00:00:20.150> camera<00:00:21.220> in<00:00:22.220> this<00:00:22.369> part

also got a built-in camera in this part
you<00:00:23.029> put<00:00:23.210> an<00:00:23.359> SD<00:00:23.480> card<00:00:23.660> I<00:00:24.169> think<00:00:24.410> the<00:00:24.740> maximum

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
you put an SD card I think the maximum

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.099 
you put an SD card I think the maximum
size<00:00:25.279> is<00:00:25.339> 4<00:00:25.849> gig<00:00:26.089> you<00:00:26.300> actually<00:00:26.539> got<00:00:26.660> a<00:00:26.689> 2<00:00:26.839> gig

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
size is 4 gig you actually got a 2 gig

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.890 
size is 4 gig you actually got a 2 gig
supplied<00:00:27.769> with<00:00:28.009> it<00:00:28.189> so<00:00:29.089> you<00:00:29.150> put<00:00:29.329> that<00:00:29.359> in<00:00:29.509> and

supplied with it so you put that in and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.109 
supplied with it so you put that in and

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
then you can turn that bit in any

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.750 
then you can turn that bit in any
direction<00:00:32.329> you<00:00:32.689> like<00:00:33.310> once<00:00:34.310> somebody<00:00:34.640> goes

direction you like once somebody goes
into<00:00:34.969> the<00:00:35.120> field<00:00:35.239> the<00:00:35.510> PIR<00:00:35.989> the<00:00:36.440> camera<00:00:36.770> will

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
into the field the PIR the camera will

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.619 
into the field the PIR the camera will
actually<00:00:37.129> start<00:00:37.340> filming<00:00:37.610> if<00:00:38.239> he's<00:00:38.390> dere

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
actually start filming if he's dere

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.360 
actually start filming if he's dere
lights<00:00:38.899> obviously<00:00:39.469> won't<00:00:39.680> lights<00:00:39.920> off<00:00:40.129> but<00:00:40.280> it

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
lights obviously won't lights off but it

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.549 
lights obviously won't lights off but it
will<00:00:40.550> still<00:00:40.820> film<00:00:41.090> these<00:00:41.899> are<00:00:42.079> a<00:00:42.109> really<00:00:42.350> cheap

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
will still film these are a really cheap

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.229 
will still film these are a really cheap
way<00:00:42.710> for<00:00:42.739> texting<00:00:43.309> your<00:00:43.370> property<00:00:43.850> people

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
way for texting your property people

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.490 
way for texting your property people
think<00:00:44.420> these<00:00:44.510> are<00:00:44.570> just<00:00:44.809> a<00:00:44.870> security<00:00:45.109> light

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
think these are just a security light

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.290 
think these are just a security light
they<00:00:46.070> don't<00:00:46.280> realize<00:00:46.579> that<00:00:46.609> the<00:00:46.879> got<00:00:47.030> a<00:00:47.059> built

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
they don't realize that the got a built

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.720 
they don't realize that the got a built
in<00:00:47.510> camera<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:48.710> camera<00:00:48.890> can<00:00:49.160> be<00:00:49.190> used<00:00:49.460> for<00:00:49.699> a

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
in camera the camera can be used for a

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.689 
in camera the camera can be used for a
video<00:00:50.000> or<00:00:50.420> it<00:00:50.539> can<00:00:50.660> also<00:00:50.719> take<00:00:51.079> stills

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
video or it can also take stills

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.099 
video or it can also take stills
depending<00:00:52.699> on<00:00:52.850> what<00:00:52.969> you<00:00:53.059> set<00:00:53.239> it<00:00:53.359> to<00:00:53.510> you<00:00:53.989> can

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
depending on what you set it to you can

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.259 
depending on what you set it to you can
also<00:00:54.230> set<00:00:54.590> the<00:00:54.679> time<00:00:54.710> and<00:00:55.219> the<00:00:55.309> date<00:00:55.519> in<00:00:56.030> this

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
also set the time and the date in this

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.450 
also set the time and the date in this
camera<00:00:56.480> so<00:00:56.899> you<00:00:57.079> always<00:00:57.260> have<00:00:57.469> that<00:00:57.679> on<00:00:58.309> the

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
camera so you always have that on the

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.209 
camera so you always have that on the
actual<00:00:58.730> footage<00:00:59.059> that<00:00:59.449> you<00:00:59.539> film<00:01:00.100> so<00:01:01.100> we're

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
actual footage that you film so we're

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:02.590 
actual footage that you film so we're
not<00:01:01.309> going<00:01:01.489> to<00:01:01.550> mount<00:01:01.730> this<00:01:01.879> up<00:01:02.179> there<00:01:02.420> we're

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
not going to mount this up there we're

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.639 
not going to mount this up there we're
not<00:01:02.690> going<00:01:02.809> to<00:01:02.870> put<00:01:02.960> it<00:01:03.050> in<00:01:03.109> the<00:01:03.199> exact<00:01:03.469> same

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
not going to put it in the exact same

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:04.900 
not going to put it in the exact same
position<00:01:03.800> it's<00:01:04.160> gonna<00:01:04.309> be<00:01:04.430> slightly<00:01:04.640> lower

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
position it's gonna be slightly lower

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.540 
position it's gonna be slightly lower
down<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:05.449> to<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.600> left<00:01:05.720> of<00:01:06.020> that<00:01:06.140> one<00:01:06.460> so<00:01:07.460> I'm

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
down and to the left of that one so I'm

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.440 
down and to the left of that one so I'm
just<00:01:07.670> going<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:07.850> undo<00:01:08.090> those<00:01:08.270> two<00:01:08.540> screws<00:01:10.450> and

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
just going to undo those two screws and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.140 
just going to undo those two screws and
then<00:01:11.570> we<00:01:11.720> can<00:01:11.870> lift<00:01:12.020> that<00:01:12.110> terminal<00:01:12.920> out<00:01:13.880> of

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
then we can lift that terminal out of

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.880 
then we can lift that terminal out of
there<00:01:14.390> that<00:01:14.750> makes<00:01:14.960> it<00:01:15.110> a<00:01:15.140> lot<00:01:15.260> easier<00:01:15.320> for

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
there that makes it a lot easier for

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.870 
there that makes it a lot easier for
installing<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:17.390> actual<00:01:17.660> back<00:01:17.870> players<00:01:18.880> I'm

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
installing the actual back players I'm

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.310 
installing the actual back players I'm
just<00:01:20.000> gonna<00:01:20.120> pop<00:01:20.300> this<00:01:20.390> in<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.630> position

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
just gonna pop this in the position

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.630 
just gonna pop this in the position
where<00:01:21.410> I<00:01:21.470> want<00:01:21.620> it<00:01:21.830> and<00:01:21.890> I'm<00:01:22.070> just<00:01:22.190> gonna<00:01:22.310> spot

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
where I want it and I'm just gonna spot

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.640 
where I want it and I'm just gonna spot
food<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:23.270> fixing<00:01:23.780> goals<00:01:26.230> an<00:01:27.230> apple<00:01:27.530> some

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
food to fixing goals an apple some

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.290 
food to fixing goals an apple some
safety<00:01:27.860> glasses<00:01:28.010> on<00:01:28.370> and<00:01:28.580> I'm<00:01:28.940> not<00:01:29.090> going<00:01:29.240> to

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
safety glasses on and I'm not going to

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.970 
safety glasses on and I'm not going to
drill<00:01:29.480> the<00:01:29.600> correct<00:01:29.840> size<00:01:29.990> all<00:01:30.170> using<00:01:30.830> this

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
drill the correct size all using this

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:43.260 
drill the correct size all using this
SDS<00:01:31.490> drill

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.389 

so<00:01:44.079> now<00:01:44.200> unscrew<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.710> back<00:01:44.860> placed<00:01:45.250> in

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
so now unscrew the back placed in

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:53.170 
so now unscrew the back placed in
position

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.570 

so<00:01:54.170> this<00:01:54.410> is<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:54.560> consumer<00:01:55.070> unit<00:01:55.340> and<00:01:55.490> you<00:01:55.550> can

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
so this is a consumer unit and you can

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.220 
so this is a consumer unit and you can
see<00:01:55.700> that<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.090> downstairs<00:01:56.510> lights<00:01:56.870> are

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
see that the downstairs lights are

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.800 
see that the downstairs lights are
clearly<00:01:57.650> identified<00:01:58.490> but<00:01:59.300> you<00:01:59.480> should<00:01:59.660> never

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
clearly identified but you should never

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.500 
switch and then once we've been to check
that<00:02:12.680> that<00:02:12.860> circuit<00:02:13.340> is<00:02:13.460> isolated<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.300> we've

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
that that circuit is isolated and we've

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.750 
that that circuit is isolated and we've
proved<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:14.960> it<00:02:15.080> is<00:02:15.230> dead<00:02:15.500> we<00:02:16.100> can<00:02:16.280> then<00:02:16.430> walk

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
proved it it is dead we can then walk

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.330 
proved it it is dead we can then walk
off<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.240> MCB<00:02:17.780> using<00:02:18.380> a<00:02:18.530> lock<00:02:18.740> off<00:02:21.100> so<00:02:22.100> I<00:02:22.130> can

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
off the MCB using a lock off so I can

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.180 
off the MCB using a lock off so I can
now<00:02:22.430> put<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.730> padlock<00:02:22.940> through<00:02:23.720> there<00:02:24.190> and

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
now put the padlock through there and

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.470 
now put the padlock through there and
there's<00:02:25.400> not<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.610> chance<00:02:25.850> of<00:02:26.150> anybody

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
there's not a chance of anybody

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.810 
there's not a chance of anybody
switching<00:02:27.320> that<00:02:27.380> circuit<00:02:27.890> back<00:02:28.070> on<00:02:28.280> whilst<00:02:28.640> we

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
switching that circuit back on whilst we

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.710 
switching that circuit back on whilst we
are<00:02:28.940> working<00:02:29.150> on<00:02:29.450> it

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
are working on it

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.660 
are working on it
there's<00:02:30.500> an<00:02:30.590> extra<00:02:30.830> precaution<00:02:30.950> we're<00:02:31.550> just

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
there's an extra precaution we're just

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.190 
there's an extra precaution we're just
going<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:31.850> put<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.060> label<00:02:32.360> on<00:02:32.630> there<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:32.990> says

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
going to put a label on there that says

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.800 
going to put a label on there that says
do<00:02:33.380> not<00:02:33.560> switch<00:02:33.830> on<00:02:34.090> it's<00:02:35.090> a<00:02:35.180> good<00:02:35.330> idea<00:02:35.450> doing

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
do not switch on it's a good idea doing

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.750 
do not switch on it's a good idea doing
this<00:02:36.080> if<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.920> live<00:02:37.100> in<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.280> house<00:02:37.459> where

this if you live in a house where

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.000 
this if you live in a house where
somebody<00:02:38.390> may<00:02:38.540> come<00:02:38.780> in<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.170> switch<00:02:39.800> the

that's<00:02:42.260> now<00:02:42.350> isolated<00:02:42.950> electricity<00:02:43.610> so<00:02:43.820> we

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
that's now isolated electricity so we

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.850 
that's now isolated electricity so we
