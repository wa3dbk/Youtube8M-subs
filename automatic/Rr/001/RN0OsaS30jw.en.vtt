on owned roots that that reminds me of
back<00:01:36.820> in<00:01:37.030> Burgundy<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.920> think<00:01:39.130> that's<00:01:39.400> for

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
back in Burgundy and I think that's for

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.660 
back in Burgundy and I think that's for
me<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.420> most<00:01:40.660> important<00:01:41.470> thing<00:01:41.500> is<00:01:41.860> that

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
me the most important thing is that

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.300 
me the most important thing is that
