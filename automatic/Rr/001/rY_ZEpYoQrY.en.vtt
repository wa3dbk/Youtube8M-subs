00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.170 

I'm<00:01:40.409> still<00:01:40.680> messing<00:01:41.040> with<00:01:41.190> this<00:01:41.310> formula<00:01:41.940> I

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
I'm still messing with this formula I

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.969 
I'm still messing with this formula I
think<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.080> needs<00:01:43.260> to<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.650> a<00:01:43.770> touch

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
think it needs to be just a touch

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.800 
think it needs to be just a touch
