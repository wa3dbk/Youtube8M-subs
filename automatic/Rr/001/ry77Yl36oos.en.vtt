back of the figure as well
now<00:02:27.450> these<00:02:27.630> arms<00:02:27.960> will<00:02:28.170> articulate<00:02:28.770> at<00:02:29.610> the

also after the elbow joints the arms

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.760 
also after the elbow joints the arms
will<00:02:35.700> articulate<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.810> is<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.320> same<00:02:37.560> for

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
will articulate and that is the same for

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.340 
will articulate and that is the same for
both<00:02:37.800> arms<00:02:38.310> both<00:02:38.820> you<00:02:39.090> can't<00:02:39.390> rotate<00:02:39.750> or<00:02:40.320> move

there<00:02:54.960> we<00:02:55.080> can<00:02:55.230> see<00:02:55.440> we<00:02:55.620> have<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.040> Omnitrix

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
there we can see we have the Omnitrix

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.000 
there we can see we have the Omnitrix
symbol<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.390> Omni<00:02:57.990> your<00:02:58.170> waist<00:02:58.470> this<00:02:58.770> time

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
symbol is Omni your waist this time

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.460 
symbol is Omni your waist this time
quite<00:02:59.490> unusual<00:03:00.240> as<00:03:00.450> we<00:03:00.630> usually<00:03:01.020> get<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.320> on

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
quite unusual as we usually get the on

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.100 
quite unusual as we usually get the on
trips<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.520> chest<00:03:02.790> area<00:03:03.030> but<00:03:03.510> still<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:04.080> is

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
trips to the chest area but still it is

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.310 
trips to the chest area but still it is
cool<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.770> am<00:03:04.950> quite<00:03:05.430> liking<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.120> now<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:06.960> legs

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.270 
articulated at the waist and at the knee
joints<00:03:47.820> as<00:03:47.940> well<00:03:47.970> going<00:03:48.330> so<00:03:48.630> we<00:03:48.810> have<00:03:48.989> one<00:03:49.980> two

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
joints as well going so we have one two

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.750 
joints as well going so we have one two
three<00:03:50.540> four<00:03:51.540> points<00:03:52.290> of<00:03:52.440> articulation<00:03:52.760> either

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
three four points of articulation either

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.670 
three four points of articulation either
side<00:03:53.970> so<00:03:54.239> we<00:03:54.690> have<00:03:54.720> eight<00:03:55.110> points<00:03:55.560> of

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
side so we have eight points of

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.790 
side so we have eight points of
articulation<00:03:56.150> in<00:03:57.150> total<00:03:57.660> on<00:03:57.840> this<00:03:57.989> figure<00:03:58.380> as

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
articulation in total on this figure as

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.640 
articulation in total on this figure as
we<00:03:59.160> can't<00:03:59.520> move<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.209> head<00:04:00.420> but<00:04:00.660> still<00:04:01.050> that

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
we can't move the head but still that

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.800 
we can't move the head but still that
that<00:04:02.370> really<00:04:02.550> does<00:04:02.820> not<00:04:03.030> matter<00:04:03.270> at<00:04:03.540> all

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
that really does not matter at all

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.560 
that really does not matter at all
as<00:04:04.440> this<00:04:04.770> figure<00:04:05.220> is<00:04:05.610> a<00:04:05.850> pretty<00:04:06.390> awesome

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
as this figure is a pretty awesome

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.670 
as this figure is a pretty awesome
looking<00:04:07.410> thing<00:04:07.860> so<00:04:08.760> six<00:04:09.420> pounds<00:04:09.780> 99<00:04:10.290> here<00:04:10.560> in

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680
