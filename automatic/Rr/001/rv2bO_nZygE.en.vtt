00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:04.060
 and let's now talk a bit about the news of our market after 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.879
 So much news about Chinese cars now seems like it's time to see 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.630
 products that really can change their image here, check out the team of 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.630
 gomes to show projects 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:25.049
 It's up to you how every Brazilian should have been very curious about this 

00:00:25.049 --> 00:00:28.020
 new Chinese brand that has just arrived in Brazil 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.420
 the direct good since in good Portuguese as I believe that lava really stay 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.450
 known 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.760
 and look at this first contact with the j3 the car that is already in the dealerships 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.950
 you can say yes that he put models and means of a new better 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.090
 condition here in brazil the launch of the first direct brand models 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.920
 happened on the day and I gave 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.290
 another day 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.730
 event occurred on March 18 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.360
 in which the 46 concessionaires were opened at the same time 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.380
 this offensive against the competition is part of the entrepreneur's strategy 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.839
 Sergio Habib 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.310
 and brings the Chinese brand to Brazil after the experience it acquired in command of the 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.210
 ciptran and also with the commercialization of luxury cars like 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.210
 the ones with the martim are already waiting 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.120
 axÃ© that brings another way to market cars that maybe scares 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.650
 some consumers and attracts so many consumers, the fact is that 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.440
 features endless finishing versions and offers a unique 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.660
 serial items 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.940
 both in the sedan christened the turret while in the rest 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.910
 the j3 offers abs brakes and electronic braking control 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.740
 it picks up the double on the front headlights with height adjustment 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.490
 reverse sensors 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.870
 among other items that can please a more 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.800
 the leader 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.370
 as all these valves are more timid 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.840
 compared to competitors and fueled only with gasoline and 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.840
 with five-speed manual transmission 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.709
 beyond the competitive price the j3 comes with a six year warranty 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.999
 for owners who carry out periodic revisions every 5 thousand 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:17.939
 kilometers rolled 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.989
 in my opinion j3 is already a good alternative that in the Brazilian market 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:27.279
 for those looking for a car of this size and in the range of 35 to 40 thousand reais 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:31.439
 because only by the package of equipment that it brings as standard items already 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:36.049
 justifies the price that is charged for it, not to mention the good guarantee of 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.709
 six years factory 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.190
 what is lacking for j3 as any model of a brand new is knowing the resistance 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.760
 him in the lead to lead a time of mileage to see how he 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.060
 after a certain time of use we'll follow to tell 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.340
 you
