want anything bad to happen so we played
it<00:03:45.920> safe<00:03:46.160> because<00:03:46.910> at<00:03:47.060> this<00:03:47.240> point<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.780> track

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
it safe because at this point the track

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.530 
it safe because at this point the track
only<00:03:48.260> asks<00:03:48.440> for<00:03:48.650> D<00:03:48.890> buffs<00:03:49.160> it's<00:03:50.060> totally
