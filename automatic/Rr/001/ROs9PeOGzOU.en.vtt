easily and you'll see how simple it is

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.729 
easily and you'll see how simple it is
so<00:00:50.460> let's<00:00:50.640> get<00:00:50.760> started<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.539> we'll<00:00:52.079> build

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
so let's get started and we'll build

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.439 
so let's get started and we'll build
this<00:00:52.920> up<00:00:52.980> kind<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.670> from<00:00:53.820> scratch<00:00:54.120> we'll<00:00:54.329> have

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
this up kind of from scratch we'll have

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.240 
this up kind of from scratch we'll have
the<00:00:54.600> video<00:00:54.809> here<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.199> first<00:00:55.440> place<00:00:55.680> but

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
the video here in the first place but

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.709 
the video here in the first place but
we'll<00:00:56.399> definitely<00:00:56.489> write<00:00:56.850> all<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.270> CSS

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
we'll definitely write all of the CSS

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.130 
we'll definitely write all of the CSS
that<00:00:57.899> lets<00:00:58.140> us<00:00:58.320> do<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.770> video<00:00:59.370> watermark<00:01:00.140> so

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
that lets us do this video watermark so

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.380 
that lets us do this video watermark so
just<00:01:01.500> starting<00:01:01.859> out<00:01:02.010> then<00:01:02.340> all<00:01:02.609> I've<00:01:02.940> done<00:01:03.180> is

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
just starting out then all I've done is

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.960 
just starting out then all I've done is
I've<00:01:03.539> placed<00:01:03.690> an<00:01:04.350> html5<00:01:05.010> video<00:01:05.339> element<00:01:05.850> on

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
I've placed an html5 video element on

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.330 
I've placed an html5 video element on
the<00:01:06.060> page<00:01:06.270> I've<00:01:07.140> given<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.619> class<00:01:08.040> of

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the page I've given this a class of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.149 
the page I've given this a class of
video<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.299> we<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.689> target<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.380> if<00:01:10.560> we<00:01:10.920> need<00:01:10.950> to

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
video so we can target it if we need to

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.310 
video so we can target it if we need to
I<00:01:11.580> guess<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.479> case<00:01:12.540> we'll<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.049> give<00:01:13.200> it

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
I guess in this case we'll just give it

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.289 
I guess in this case we'll just give it
a<00:01:13.470> width<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.490> hundred<00:01:14.850> percent<00:01:14.939> or

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
a width of a hundred percent or

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.960 
a width of a hundred percent or
something<00:01:15.799> and<00:01:16.799> here<00:01:17.100> for<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> source<00:01:17.700> we've

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
something and here for the source we've

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.480 
something and here for the source we've
just<00:01:18.150> got<00:01:18.270> an<00:01:18.360> mp4<00:01:18.930> file<00:01:19.229> here<00:01:19.530> called<00:01:19.560> Katz

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
just got an mp4 file here called Katz

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.300 
just got an mp4 file here called Katz
mp4<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.659> that's<00:01:21.960> within<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.409> video<00:01:22.830> folder

background<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:41.549> I'm<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:41.970> placing

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
background that I'm going to be placing

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.899 
background that I'm going to be placing
onto<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.990> video<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.619> then<00:01:44.189> we<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> CSS

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
onto the video and then we have a CSS

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.350 
onto the video and then we have a CSS
directory<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.479> contains<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.380> file<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.970> CSS

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
directory that contains the file the CSS

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.760 
directory that contains the file the CSS
father<00:01:48.600> we're<00:01:48.780> going<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.960> be<00:01:49.020> basically

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
father we're going to be basically

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.190 
father we're going to be basically
writing<00:01:50.040> our<00:01:50.220> Styles<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.720> that's<00:01:51.990> already

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
writing our Styles in so that's already

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.620 
writing our Styles in so that's already
linked<00:01:52.619> into<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.100> document<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:53.880> we're<00:01:54.060> pretty

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
linked into the document so we're pretty

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.330 
linked into the document so we're pretty
much<00:01:54.930> ready<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.320> go<00:01:55.470> here<00:01:55.860> as<00:01:56.009> long<00:01:56.130> as<00:01:56.189> you

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
much ready to go here as long as you

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.300 
much ready to go here as long as you
have<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.850> following<00:01:57.380> you'll<00:01:58.380> be<00:01:58.890> good<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.189> go

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
have the following you'll be good to go

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.179 
have the following you'll be good to go
so<00:02:00.119> let's<00:02:00.450> first<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.290> all<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:01.619> tidy<00:02:01.890> up<00:02:02.009> this

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
so let's first of all just tidy up this

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.730 
so let's first of all just tidy up this
video<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.540> width<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.469> hundred

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
video so it's a width of a hundred

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.100 
video so it's a width of a hundred
percent<00:02:05.090> so<00:02:06.090> we're<00:02:06.240> going<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.390> target<00:02:06.930> that

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
percent so we're going to target that

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.699 
percent so we're going to target that
video<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.920> say<00:02:08.129> width<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.670> 100%<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.780> let's<00:02:10.560> go

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
video and say width of 100% and let's go

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.559 
video and say width of 100% and let's go
ahead<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.430> have<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.819> look<00:02:11.940> at<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:12.450> there

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
ahead and have a look at this so there

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.340 
ahead and have a look at this so there
we<00:02:12.660> go

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
we go

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.080 
we go
nicely<00:02:13.770> fit<00:02:13.980> into<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.250> page<00:02:14.430> now<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:14.880> we<00:02:14.970> can

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
nicely fit into the page now so we can

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.630 
nicely fit into the page now so we can
work<00:02:15.240> with<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.860> goal<00:02:17.010> here<00:02:17.040> then<00:02:17.430> is

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
work with it so the goal here then is

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.730 
work with it so the goal here then is
obviously<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.240> have<00:02:18.420> our<00:02:18.600> watermark<00:02:19.290> placed

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
obviously to have our watermark placed

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.280 
obviously to have our watermark placed
just<00:02:20.400> down<00:02:20.700> here<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.360> then<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:21.900> can<00:02:22.020> position

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
just down here and then you can position

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.580 
just down here and then you can position
it<00:02:22.470> where<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.740> need<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.720> do<00:02:24.960> this<00:02:25.200> what

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
it where you need to so to do this what

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.750 
it where you need to so to do this what
we're<00:02:25.710> gonna<00:02:25.800> do<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.220> we're<00:02:26.340> gonna<00:02:26.400> place<00:02:26.730> a

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
we're gonna do is we're gonna place a

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.930 
we're gonna do is we're gonna place a
video<00:02:27.000> wrapper<00:02:27.480> around<00:02:28.080> this<00:02:28.640> it's<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.700> little

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
video wrapper around this it's a little

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.520 
video wrapper around this it's a little
bit<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.180> extra<00:02:30.510> markup<00:02:30.960> but<00:02:31.080> if<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.350> are

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
bit of extra markup but if you are

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.640 
bit of extra markup but if you are
working<00:02:31.800> with<00:02:32.070> say<00:02:32.430> some<00:02:33.330> kind<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.810> additional

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
working with say some kind of additional

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.100 
working with say some kind of additional
content<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.790> need<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:36.060> add<00:02:36.210> on<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.960> this

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
content that you need to add on to this

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.740 
content that you need to add on to this
then<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:38.160> guess<00:02:38.430> it's<00:02:38.610> worth<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.600> let's

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
then I guess it's worth it so let's

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.290 
then I guess it's worth it so let's
create<00:02:40.020> that<00:02:40.110> video<00:02:40.590> wrapper<00:02:41.070> div<00:02:41.670> here<00:02:42.060> and

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
create that video wrapper div here and

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.750 
create that video wrapper div here and
let's<00:02:42.930> put<00:02:43.140> our<00:02:43.260> video<00:02:43.530> inside<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.460> this

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
let's put our video inside of this

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.630 
let's put our video inside of this
wrapper<00:02:45.180> like<00:02:45.960> so<00:02:46.320> let's<00:02:46.920> just<00:02:47.130> indent<00:02:47.460> this

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
wrapper like so let's just indent this

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.230 
wrapper like so let's just indent this
properly<00:02:48.650> there<00:02:49.650> we<00:02:49.770> are<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:50.550> nothing<00:02:51.150> will

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
properly there we are so nothing will

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.640 
properly there we are so nothing will
have<00:02:51.360> changed<00:02:51.390> now<00:02:51.870> we<00:02:51.900> just<00:02:52.200> have<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.380> wrapper

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
have changed now we just have a wrapper

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.980 
have changed now we just have a wrapper
around<00:02:52.920> our<00:02:53.250> video<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:54.060> we<00:02:54.270> can<00:02:54.420> target<00:02:54.630> this

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
around our video and we can target this

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.620 
around our video and we can target this
obviously<00:02:55.650> within<00:02:55.830> our<00:02:56.220> CSS<00:02:56.670> file<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.600> let's

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
obviously within our CSS file so let's

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.770 
obviously within our CSS file so let's
start<00:02:58.050> with<00:02:58.200> this<00:02:58.380> so<00:02:58.770> we're<00:02:58.950> gonna<00:02:59.070> say<00:02:59.280> video

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
start with this so we're gonna say video

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.900 
start with this so we're gonna say video
wrapper<00:03:00.780> now<00:03:01.650> because<00:03:02.310> we're<00:03:02.490> going<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.790> be

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
wrapper now because we're going to be

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.470 
wrapper now because we're going to be
absolutely<00:03:03.650> positioning<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:05.160> pseudo<00:03:06.000> element

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
absolutely positioning a pseudo element

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.090 
absolutely positioning a pseudo element
and<00:03:06.720> if<00:03:06.810> you're<00:03:07.200> not<00:03:07.380> quite<00:03:07.560> sure<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:07.920> is

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
and if you're not quite sure that is

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.400 
and if you're not quite sure that is
we'll<00:03:08.310> explain<00:03:08.640> in<00:03:08.850> a<00:03:08.910> moment<00:03:09.140> inside<00:03:10.140> of<00:03:10.290> this

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
we'll explain in a moment inside of this

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.280 
we'll explain in a moment inside of this
video<00:03:10.560> wrapper<00:03:10.980> we<00:03:11.640> need<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:12.030> give<00:03:12.300> a<00:03:12.570> position

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
video wrapper we need to give a position

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.590 
video wrapper we need to give a position
of<00:03:13.530> relative<00:03:13.800> that's<00:03:14.460> all<00:03:14.760> we<00:03:14.880> need<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.060> do<00:03:15.270> for

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
of relative that's all we need to do for

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.320 
of relative that's all we need to do for
our<00:03:15.690> video<00:03:15.930> wrapper<00:03:16.430> rather<00:03:17.430> than<00:03:17.760> inject

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
our video wrapper rather than inject

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.480 
our video wrapper rather than inject
some<00:03:18.600> additional<00:03:19.020> content<00:03:19.590> into<00:03:19.920> here<00:03:20.190> for

some additional content into here for

example an image element what we're

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.230 
example an image element what we're
going<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.590> be<00:03:22.680> doing<00:03:22.860> is<00:03:23.220> using<00:03:23.580> a<00:03:23.850> pseudo

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
going to be doing is using a pseudo

that's<00:03:26.150> within<00:03:27.150> your<00:03:27.420> page<00:03:27.750> but<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.260> doesn't

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
that's within your page but it doesn't

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.460 
that's within your page but it doesn't
actually<00:03:28.770> exist<00:03:29.490> in<00:03:29.670> your<00:03:29.940> markup<00:03:30.450> so<00:03:31.260> we're

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
actually exist in your markup so we're

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.960 
actually exist in your markup so we're
going<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.620> create<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:32.190> by<00:03:32.400> saying<00:03:32.640> video

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
going to create that by saying video

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.590 
going to create that by saying video
wrapper<00:03:33.350> before<00:03:34.350> like<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:35.520> and<00:03:35.910> then<00:03:36.360> we<00:03:36.450> can

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
wrapper before like so and then we can

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.600 
wrapper before like so and then we can
put<00:03:37.410> whatever<00:03:37.590> we<00:03:37.770> need<00:03:38.010> in<00:03:38.040> here<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.490> that's

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
put whatever we need in here and that's

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.430 
put whatever we need in here and that's
going<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:38.850> generate<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:39.360> that<00:03:39.720> content<00:03:40.230> for

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
going to generate that that content for

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.580 
going to generate that that content for
us<00:03:40.670> so<00:03:41.670> we<00:03:41.910> set<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.270> content<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:43.080> nothing

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
us so we set the content to nothing

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.860 
us so we set the content to nothing
because<00:03:43.830> we<00:03:44.070> don't<00:03:44.460> actually<00:03:44.640> have<00:03:44.880> any<00:03:45.060> text

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
because we don't actually have any text

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.900 
because we don't actually have any text
you<00:03:45.930> can<00:03:46.320> write<00:03:46.740> hello<00:03:46.950> in<00:03:47.280> here<00:03:47.490> or<00:03:47.640> whatever

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
you can write hello in here or whatever

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.880 
you can write hello in here or whatever
you<00:03:48.000> want<00:03:48.180> but<00:03:48.270> it's<00:03:48.450> a<00:03:48.510> bit<00:03:48.630> pointless<00:03:48.930> we're

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
you want but it's a bit pointless we're

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.100 
you want but it's a bit pointless we're
going<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.100> be<00:03:50.190> adding<00:03:50.640> a<00:03:50.840> width<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:52.020> a<00:03:52.080> height

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
going to be adding a width and a height

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.960 
going to be adding a width and a height
to<00:03:52.530> this<00:03:52.650> element<00:03:53.160> we're<00:03:53.340> going<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.520> be<00:03:53.640> adding

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
to this element we're going to be adding

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.270 
to this element we're going to be adding
a<00:03:54.060> background<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.750> this<00:03:54.900> but<00:03:55.680> first<00:03:56.040> of<00:03:56.220> all

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
a background to this but first of all

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.070 
a background to this but first of all
let's<00:03:56.610> just<00:03:56.880> set<00:03:57.150> this<00:03:57.300> up<00:03:57.510> so<00:03:57.780> we<00:03:57.870> can<00:03:57.990> at

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
let's just set this up so we can at

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.330 
let's just set this up so we can at
least<00:03:58.200> see<00:03:58.770> it<00:03:58.920> on<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.220> page<00:03:59.430> working<00:04:00.320> so

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
least see it on the page working so

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.260 
least see it on the page working so
let's<00:04:02.340> give<00:04:02.940> this<00:04:03.270> a<00:04:03.510> width<00:04:04.110> of<00:04:04.430> 20<00:04:05.430> pixels<00:04:05.610> and

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
let's give this a width of 20 pixels and

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.750 
let's give this a width of 20 pixels and
let's<00:04:06.780> give<00:04:06.930> this<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.170> high<00:04:07.470> of<00:04:07.710> 20<00:04:08.130> pixels<00:04:08.370> as

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
let's give this a high of 20 pixels as

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.140 
let's give this a high of 20 pixels as
well<00:04:08.970> let's<00:04:09.870> give<00:04:10.050> this<00:04:10.170> a<00:04:10.230> background<00:04:11.150> color

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
well let's give this a background color

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.020 
well let's give this a background color
of<00:04:12.420> red<00:04:12.960> just<00:04:13.770> so<00:04:13.830> we<00:04:13.980> can<00:04:14.100> see<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:14.460> basically

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
of red just so we can see it basically

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.780 
of red just so we can see it basically
and<00:04:15.840> also<00:04:16.140> obviously<00:04:16.560> which<00:04:17.280> is<00:04:17.489> really

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
and also obviously which is really

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.370 
and also obviously which is really
important<00:04:18.180> is<00:04:18.299> giving<00:04:18.570> this<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.870> position<00:04:19.260> of

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
important is giving this a position of

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.170 
important is giving this a position of
absolute<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.250> allows<00:04:20.460> us<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.670> control

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
absolute and that allows us to control

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.270 
absolute and that allows us to control
the<00:04:21.239> position<00:04:21.720> of<00:04:21.989> this<00:04:22.169> within<00:04:22.919> that<00:04:23.070> video

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
the position of this within that video

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.280 
the position of this within that video
wrapper<00:04:23.850> and<00:04:24.210> remember<00:04:24.690> that's<00:04:24.870> why<00:04:25.080> we're

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
wrapper and remember that's why we're

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.840 
wrapper and remember that's why we're
given<00:04:25.500> this<00:04:25.620> a<00:04:25.680> position<00:04:26.130> of<00:04:26.220> relative<00:04:26.640> so

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
given this a position of relative so

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.990 
given this a position of relative so
that

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
that

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.120 
that
doesn't<00:04:27.330> float<00:04:27.630> off<00:04:27.840> somewhere<00:04:28.290> and<00:04:28.680> it<00:04:28.860> stays

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
doesn't float off somewhere and it stays

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.000 
doesn't float off somewhere and it stays
within<00:04:29.430> that<00:04:29.550> video<00:04:29.790> wrapper<00:04:30.350> so<00:04:31.350> let's<00:04:31.770> say

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
within that video wrapper so let's say

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.430 
within that video wrapper so let's say
we<00:04:32.190> want<00:04:32.370> this<00:04:32.490> to<00:04:32.730> be<00:04:32.760> 20<00:04:33.690> pixels<00:04:33.960> from<00:04:34.350> the

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
we want this to be 20 pixels from the

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.190 
we want this to be 20 pixels from the
right<00:04:34.560> and<00:04:35.520> we<00:04:35.730> want<00:04:35.910> this<00:04:36.000> to<00:04:36.060> be<00:04:36.240> 20<00:04:36.930> pixels

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
right and we want this to be 20 pixels

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.550 
right and we want this to be 20 pixels
from<00:04:37.920> the<00:04:38.130> bottom<00:04:38.580> and<00:04:38.960> I<00:04:39.960> think<00:04:40.230> that's<00:04:40.440> about

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
from the bottom and I think that's about

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.200 
from the bottom and I think that's about
it<00:04:40.710> for<00:04:40.890> now<00:04:41.100> let's<00:04:41.340> just<00:04:41.580> check<00:04:41.760> this<00:04:41.820> out

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
it for now let's just check this out

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.570 
it for now let's just check this out
let's<00:04:42.600> just<00:04:42.840> refresh<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.590> there<00:04:44.070> you<00:04:44.190> can<00:04:44.340> see

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
let's just refresh and there you can see

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.060 
let's just refresh and there you can see
that<00:04:44.790> little<00:04:45.030> red<00:04:45.620> square<00:04:46.620> that<00:04:46.830> we've<00:04:46.920> just

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
that little red square that we've just

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.000 
that little red square that we've just
created<00:04:47.180> so<00:04:48.180> that<00:04:48.210> at<00:04:48.450> least<00:04:48.690> gives<00:04:49.530> us<00:04:49.860> an

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
created so that at least gives us an

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.560 
created so that at least gives us an
indication<00:04:50.460> that<00:04:50.700> we've<00:04:50.940> correctly

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
indication that we've correctly

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.390 
indication that we've correctly
positioned<00:04:52.200> that<00:04:52.350> element<00:04:52.740> and<00:04:53.130> we<00:04:53.250> can

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
positioned that element and we can

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.180 
positioned that element and we can
replace<00:04:53.640> this<00:04:54.090> now<00:04:54.300> with<00:04:54.540> that<00:04:54.690> logo<00:04:55.140> so<00:04:56.040> how

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
replace this now with that logo so how

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.040 
replace this now with that logo so how
do<00:04:56.250> we<00:04:56.430> how<00:04:56.730> do<00:04:56.790> we<00:04:56.940> sort<00:04:57.210> of<00:04:57.300> replace<00:04:57.720> this

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
do we how do we sort of replace this

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.770 
do we how do we sort of replace this
without<00:04:58.980> using<00:04:59.280> some<00:04:59.610> kind<00:04:59.790> of<00:04:59.910> image<00:05:00.210> element

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
without using some kind of image element

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.420 
without using some kind of image element
well<00:05:01.470> in<00:05:01.560> this<00:05:01.680> case<00:05:01.860> what<00:05:02.070> we're<00:05:02.160> going<00:05:02.280> to<00:05:02.310> do

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
well in this case what we're going to do

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.610 
well in this case what we're going to do
is<00:05:02.520> we're<00:05:02.640> going<00:05:02.730> to<00:05:02.790> use<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.210> background

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
is we're going to use the background

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.040 
is we're going to use the background
attribute<00:05:04.850> to<00:05:05.850> actually<00:05:06.150> place<00:05:06.360> a<00:05:06.390> background

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
attribute to actually place a background

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.280 
attribute to actually place a background
here<00:05:07.140> rather<00:05:07.560> than<00:05:07.830> an<00:05:07.950> actual<00:05:08.430> image<00:05:08.610> element

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
here rather than an actual image element

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.290 
here rather than an actual image element
so<00:05:10.290> let's<00:05:10.470> go<00:05:10.560> ahead<00:05:10.680> and<00:05:11.030> set<00:05:12.030> up<00:05:12.150> our

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
so let's go ahead and set up our

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.940 
so let's go ahead and set up our
background<00:05:12.780> this<00:05:13.290> is<00:05:13.350> going<00:05:13.620> to<00:05:13.680> be<00:05:13.860> a<00:05:14.070> URL<00:05:14.580> so

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
background this is going to be a URL so

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.500 
background this is going to be a URL so
instead<00:05:16.950> of<00:05:17.010> this<00:05:17.280> background<00:05:17.520> color<00:05:17.790> of<00:05:18.060> red

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
instead of this background color of red

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.950 
instead of this background color of red
we're<00:05:19.290> gonna<00:05:19.410> set<00:05:19.680> a<00:05:19.710> URL<00:05:20.070> here<00:05:20.240> so<00:05:21.240> it<00:05:21.810> was

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
we're gonna set a URL here so it was

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.780 
we're gonna set a URL here so it was
just<00:05:22.080> spelled<00:05:22.410> background<00:05:22.800> quickly<00:05:23.220> so<00:05:23.700> we're

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
just spelled background quickly so we're

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.490 
just spelled background quickly so we're
gonna<00:05:23.880> go<00:05:24.030> back<00:05:24.180> a<00:05:24.240> directory<00:05:24.810> into<00:05:25.200> our<00:05:25.290> image

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
gonna go back a directory into our image

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.740 
gonna go back a directory into our image
directory<00:05:26.280> and<00:05:26.520> then<00:05:27.030> we're<00:05:27.180> gonna<00:05:27.270> pull<00:05:27.600> in

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
directory and then we're gonna pull in

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.920 
directory and then we're gonna pull in
logo<00:05:28.350> dot<00:05:28.590> PNG<00:05:28.910> now<00:05:29.910> the<00:05:29.970> actual<00:05:30.480> width<00:05:30.720> and

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
logo dot PNG now the actual width and

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:37.219 
logo dot PNG now the actual width and
height<00:05:31.200> of<00:05:31.590> this<00:05:31.860> logo<00:05:32.669> is<00:05:33.570> 44<00:05:34.350> pixels<00:05:35.010> by<00:05:36.229> 65

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
height of this logo is 44 pixels by 65

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.140 
height of this logo is 44 pixels by 65
pixels<00:05:37.530> we<00:05:38.190> can<00:05:38.310> look<00:05:38.460> at<00:05:38.550> how<00:05:38.669> we<00:05:38.729> can<00:05:38.940> scale

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
pixels we can look at how we can scale

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.510 
pixels we can look at how we can scale
this<00:05:39.540> down<00:05:39.600> in<00:05:40.020> a<00:05:40.110> moment<00:05:40.290> as<00:05:40.620> well<00:05:40.650> using<00:05:41.430> the

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
this down in a moment as well using the

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.210 
this down in a moment as well using the
background<00:05:41.760> size<00:05:42.419> attribute<00:05:42.950> so<00:05:43.950> let's

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
background size attribute so let's

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.680 
background size attribute so let's
refresh<00:05:44.370> this<00:05:44.820> and<00:05:45.060> you<00:05:45.120> can<00:05:45.240> see<00:05:45.390> that<00:05:45.510> that

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
refresh this and you can see that that

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.750 
refresh this and you can see that that
logo<00:05:46.080> has<00:05:46.320> now<00:05:46.500> been<00:05:46.800> hurt<00:05:47.280> in<00:05:47.430> its<00:05:47.550> right

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
logo has now been hurt in its right

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.330 
logo has now been hurt in its right
place<00:05:47.940> so<00:05:48.750> we've<00:05:48.900> pretty<00:05:49.140> much<00:05:49.290> finished<00:05:49.770> this

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
place so we've pretty much finished this

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.010 
place so we've pretty much finished this
already<00:05:50.729> if<00:05:50.970> you're<00:05:51.150> happy<00:05:51.540> with<00:05:51.570> this<00:05:51.810> at

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
already if you're happy with this at

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.900 
already if you're happy with this at
this<00:05:52.140> point<00:05:52.470> you<00:05:52.800> can<00:05:53.010> finish<00:05:53.490> and<00:05:53.760> you're

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
this point you can finish and you're

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:54.110 
this point you can finish and you're
done

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
done

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.909 
done
but<00:05:54.840> what<00:05:54.960> we're<00:05:55.080> gonna<00:05:55.169> do<00:05:55.350> now<00:05:55.530> is<00:05:55.560> look<00:05:55.830> at

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
but what we're gonna do now is look at

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.280 
but what we're gonna do now is look at
resizing<00:05:56.610> this<00:05:56.790> ideally<00:05:57.570> you'd<00:05:57.720> want<00:05:57.750> to<00:05:58.080> pull

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
resizing this ideally you'd want to pull

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.200 
resizing this ideally you'd want to pull
in<00:05:58.410> your<00:05:58.440> logo<00:05:58.800> at<00:05:59.040> the<00:05:59.070> size<00:05:59.400> you<00:05:59.640> wanted<00:06:00.090> it

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
in your logo at the size you wanted it

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.150 
in your logo at the size you wanted it
on<00:06:00.270> your<00:06:00.330> video<00:06:00.690> but<00:06:01.320> if<00:06:01.410> for<00:06:01.530> some<00:06:01.590> reason<00:06:02.040> you

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
on your video but if for some reason you

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.370 
on your video but if for some reason you
can't<00:06:02.520> do<00:06:02.729> that<00:06:02.880> we'll<00:06:03.240> look<00:06:03.390> at<00:06:03.540> now<00:06:03.660> resizing

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
can't do that we'll look at now resizing

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.030 
can't do that we'll look at now resizing
it<00:06:04.610> so<00:06:05.610> in<00:06:06.510> fact<00:06:06.750> to<00:06:07.020> start<00:06:07.500> with<00:06:07.650> let's<00:06:07.890> give

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
it so in fact to start with let's give

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.420 
it so in fact to start with let's give
this<00:06:08.190> an<00:06:08.370> opacity<00:06:08.940> just<00:06:09.600> so<00:06:10.590> we<00:06:10.860> can<00:06:10.979> see<00:06:11.250> that

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
this an opacity just so we can see that

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.240 
this an opacity just so we can see that
a<00:06:11.460> little<00:06:11.729> bit<00:06:11.910> fainter<00:06:12.560> this<00:06:13.560> just<00:06:13.770> probably

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
a little bit fainter this just probably

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.950 
a little bit fainter this just probably
ensures<00:06:14.700> that<00:06:14.729> it<00:06:15.060> doesn't<00:06:15.330> interfere<00:06:15.720> with

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
ensures that it doesn't interfere with

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.680 
ensures that it doesn't interfere with
the<00:06:16.140> content<00:06:17.000> you<00:06:18.000> know<00:06:18.120> that<00:06:18.330> you're<00:06:18.450> playing

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
the content you know that you're playing

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.050 
the content you know that you're playing
in<00:06:18.900> the<00:06:18.990> video<00:06:19.229> just<00:06:19.590> so<00:06:19.919> it's<00:06:20.100> a<00:06:20.550> little<00:06:20.880> bit

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
in the video just so it's a little bit

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.719 
in the video just so it's a little bit
less<00:06:21.600> intrusive<00:06:22.350> when<00:06:22.800> the<00:06:22.919> users<00:06:23.520> watching

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
less intrusive when the users watching

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:28.820 
less intrusive when the users watching
the<00:06:23.970> video<00:06:24.650> so<00:06:25.760> now<00:06:26.760> to<00:06:26.820> resize<00:06:27.330> this<00:06:27.830> what

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
the video so now to resize this what

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:29.990 
the video so now to resize this what
we're<00:06:28.919> gonna<00:06:29.040> be<00:06:29.160> doing<00:06:29.430> is<00:06:29.580> we're<00:06:29.820> going<00:06:29.940> to

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
we're gonna be doing is we're going to

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.240 
we're gonna be doing is we're going to
be<00:06:30.120> using<00:06:30.570> the<00:06:30.750> background<00:06:31.290> size<00:06:31.860> property

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
be using the background size property

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.650 
be using the background size property
and<00:06:32.700> we're<00:06:32.820> going<00:06:32.940> to<00:06:33.000> say<00:06:33.120> that<00:06:33.150> we<00:06:33.390> want<00:06:33.510> this

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 
and we're going to say that we want this

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.469 
and we're going to say that we want this
to<00:06:33.870> cover<00:06:34.169> the<00:06:34.410> area<00:06:34.620> of<00:06:34.950> our<00:06:35.729> element<00:06:36.300> this

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 
to cover the area of our element this

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.779 
to cover the area of our element this
before<00:06:37.050> pseudo-element<00:06:37.560> and<00:06:38.070> by<00:06:38.580> the<00:06:38.640> way

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:38.789 
before pseudo-element and by the way

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:40.879 
before pseudo-element and by the way
what<00:06:39.000> we<00:06:39.120> can<00:06:39.330> actually<00:06:39.690> do<00:06:39.840> is<00:06:39.990> inspect

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:40.889 
what we can actually do is inspect

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:43.309 
what we can actually do is inspect
the<00:06:41.310> element<00:06:41.729> here<00:06:42.120> if<00:06:42.389> we<00:06:42.660> just<00:06:42.810> go<00:06:42.960> into<00:06:43.080> the

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:43.319 
the element here if we just go into the

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.890 
the element here if we just go into the
body<00:06:43.530> the<00:06:44.310> wrapper<00:06:44.759> you<00:06:45.210> can<00:06:45.360> see<00:06:45.660> that

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
body the wrapper you can see that

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.900 
body the wrapper you can see that
pseudo-element<00:06:46.740> they<00:06:47.190> have<00:06:47.310> been<00:06:47.460> put<00:06:47.729> into

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910 
pseudo-element they have been put into

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.850 
pseudo-element they have been put into
the<00:06:48.150> markup<00:06:48.569> it<00:06:48.780> doesn't<00:06:48.990> actually<00:06:49.080> exist<00:06:49.349> on

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
the markup it doesn't actually exist on

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.700 
the markup it doesn't actually exist on
the<00:06:49.949> page<00:06:50.159> but<00:06:50.789> it<00:06:50.909> is<00:06:51.090> being<00:06:51.509> rendered<00:06:51.810> so

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710 
the page but it is being rendered so

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.559 
the page but it is being rendered so
that's<00:06:52.860> where<00:06:53.069> that<00:06:53.190> is<00:06:53.250> let's<00:06:54.150> go<00:06:54.300> ahead<00:06:54.330> and

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:54.569 
that's where that is let's go ahead and

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:56.990 
that's where that is let's go ahead and
start<00:06:54.810> resizing<00:06:55.199> this<00:06:55.560> now<00:06:55.740> so<00:06:56.580> let's<00:06:56.789> say<00:06:56.970> I

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 
start resizing this now so let's say I

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.020 
start resizing this now so let's say I
want<00:06:57.360> the<00:06:57.659> width<00:06:58.259> of<00:06:58.500> the<00:06:58.949> video<00:06:59.190> to<00:06:59.310> change<00:06:59.819> in

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.030 
want the width of the video to change in

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.580 
want the width of the video to change in
the<00:07:00.090> height<00:07:00.270> of<00:07:00.300> the<00:07:00.569> video<00:07:00.780> to<00:07:00.870> change<00:07:01.229> I<00:07:01.440> need

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
the height of the video to change I need

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.399 
the height of the video to change I need
to<00:07:01.680> calculate<00:07:02.250> the<00:07:02.840> proportions<00:07:03.840> that<00:07:03.960> the

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:04.409 
to calculate the proportions that the

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:06.499 
to calculate the proportions that the
correct<00:07:04.680> proportions<00:07:05.250> for<00:07:05.430> this<00:07:05.580> so<00:07:06.419> I'm

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:06.509 
correct proportions for this so I'm

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:08.029 
correct proportions for this so I'm
going<00:07:06.629> to<00:07:06.690> type<00:07:06.870> in<00:07:07.020> the<00:07:07.110> original<00:07:07.530> width<00:07:07.770> and

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 
going to type in the original width and

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:11.149 
going to type in the original width and
the<00:07:08.099> height<00:07:08.129> on<00:07:08.729> this<00:07:09.389> handy<00:07:10.349> tool<00:07:10.379> just<00:07:10.949> head

00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:11.159 
the height on this handy tool just head

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:13.520 
the height on this handy tool just head
over<00:07:11.190> to<00:07:11.370> this<00:07:11.460> page<00:07:11.789> -<00:07:12.120> to<00:07:12.569> do<00:07:12.990> this<00:07:13.110> yourself

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.530 
over to this page - to do this yourself

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.260 
over to this page - to do this yourself
if<00:07:13.680> you<00:07:13.800> need<00:07:13.979> to<00:07:14.159> and<00:07:14.699> we're<00:07:14.819> gonna<00:07:14.909> give<00:07:15.120> it<00:07:15.210> a

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270 
if you need to and we're gonna give it a

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.210 
if you need to and we're gonna give it a
new<00:07:15.509> width<00:07:15.750> so<00:07:16.409> the<00:07:16.440> width<00:07:16.680> I<00:07:16.800> want<00:07:16.949> to<00:07:17.039> give<00:07:17.130> it

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 
new width so the width I want to give it

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.730 
new width so the width I want to give it
as<00:07:17.310> say<00:07:17.460> 25<00:07:18.169> pixels<00:07:19.169> and<00:07:19.289> I'm<00:07:19.380> gonna<00:07:19.470> hit

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:19.740 
as say 25 pixels and I'm gonna hit

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.339 
as say 25 pixels and I'm gonna hit
resize<00:07:20.250> that<00:07:20.909> gives<00:07:21.120> me<00:07:21.270> the<00:07:21.449> new<00:07:21.659> height<00:07:21.990> and

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:22.349 
resize that gives me the new height and

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:24.890 
resize that gives me the new height and
that<00:07:22.409> keeps<00:07:22.860> that<00:07:23.039> image<00:07:23.370> in<00:07:23.520> proportion<00:07:24.180> this

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 
that keeps that image in proportion this

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.749 
that keeps that image in proportion this
is<00:07:25.080> thirty<00:07:25.319> six<00:07:25.650> point<00:07:25.830> nine<00:07:25.949> three<00:07:26.130> so<00:07:26.639> we'll

00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:26.759 
is thirty six point nine three so we'll

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:30.529 
is thirty six point nine three so we'll
go<00:07:26.940> for<00:07:27.150> 37<00:07:28.020> pixels<00:07:28.530> so<00:07:29.490> the<00:07:29.849> new<00:07:30.000> width<00:07:30.210> in<00:07:30.419> is

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:30.539 
go for 37 pixels so the new width in is

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:34.370 
go for 37 pixels so the new width in is
25<00:07:31.139> and<00:07:31.530> that<00:07:32.490> the<00:07:33.000> new<00:07:33.270> height<00:07:33.569> is<00:07:33.840> thirty

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:34.380 
25 and that the new height is thirty

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.339 
25 and that the new height is thirty
seven<00:07:34.620> so<00:07:35.400> let's<00:07:35.430> add<00:07:35.789> that<00:07:36.000> in<00:07:36.270> and<00:07:36.810> now

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:37.349 
seven so let's add that in and now

00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:39.050 
seven so let's add that in and now
because<00:07:37.620> we've<00:07:37.949> given<00:07:38.130> this<00:07:38.340> background<00:07:38.819> size

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.060 
because we've given this background size

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.149 
because we've given this background size
of<00:07:39.210> cover<00:07:39.539> if<00:07:40.169> we<00:07:40.349> just<00:07:40.530> get<00:07:40.710> rid<00:07:40.919> of<00:07:40.979> this

00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:41.159 
of cover if we just get rid of this

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:43.010 
of cover if we just get rid of this
temporarily<00:07:41.699> you'll<00:07:42.060> see<00:07:42.330> that<00:07:42.509> it's<00:07:42.750> not

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.020 
temporarily you'll see that it's not

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.709 
temporarily you'll see that it's not
going<00:07:43.169> to<00:07:43.229> quite<00:07:43.349> work<00:07:43.469> out<00:07:44.030> it's<00:07:45.030> sort<00:07:45.599> of

00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:45.719 
going to quite work out it's sort of

00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:47.570 
going to quite work out it's sort of
being<00:07:45.900> cut<00:07:46.169> off<00:07:46.380> here<00:07:46.650> because<00:07:47.310> it's<00:07:47.430> not

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:47.580 
being cut off here because it's not

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.899 
being cut off here because it's not
fitting<00:07:47.880> into<00:07:48.469> that<00:07:49.469> element<00:07:50.009> so<00:07:50.159> if<00:07:50.669> we<00:07:50.789> give

00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:50.909 
fitting into that element so if we give

00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:52.459 
fitting into that element so if we give
a<00:07:50.940> background<00:07:51.389> size<00:07:51.599> of<00:07:51.750> color<00:07:52.020> and<00:07:52.319> we

00:07:52.459 --> 00:07:52.469 
a background size of color and we

00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:55.309 
a background size of color and we
refresh<00:07:52.889> you<00:07:53.520> can<00:07:53.550> see<00:07:53.669> that<00:07:53.940> nicely<00:07:54.509> now<00:07:54.719> fit

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 
refresh you can see that nicely now fit

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:59.719 
refresh you can see that nicely now fit
into<00:07:55.620> that<00:07:56.250> element<00:07:56.759> so<00:07:58.190> with<00:07:59.190> all<00:07:59.340> that<00:07:59.490> done

00:07:59.719 --> 00:07:59.729 
into that element so with all that done

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.059 
into that element so with all that done
that<00:07:59.789> is<00:08:00.240> pretty<00:08:00.599> much<00:08:00.870> how<00:08:00.930> we<00:08:01.259> add<00:08:01.620> a

00:08:02.059 --> 00:08:02.069 
that is pretty much how we add a

00:08:02.069 --> 00:08:04.909 
that is pretty much how we add a
watermark<00:08:02.669> to<00:08:03.090> html5<00:08:03.870> video<00:08:04.169> without

00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:04.919 
watermark to html5 video without

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:07.189 
watermark to html5 video without
actually<00:08:05.279> modifying<00:08:05.880> the<00:08:06.210> original<00:08:06.330> video

00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 
actually modifying the original video

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:09.830 
actually modifying the original video
