yeah<00:03:04.319> look<00:03:05.280> at<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.430> acceleration<00:03:05.940> out<00:03:06.090> of

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
yeah look at the acceleration out of

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:14.309 
yeah look at the acceleration out of
that<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.630> bear<00:03:06.840> Williams<00:03:07.140> oh<00:03:07.230> look<00:03:07.530> at<00:03:07.620> that

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:23.190 

not<00:03:14.530> yep

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.080 

so<00:03:24.200> 190<00:03:24.739> feet<00:03:24.890> off<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.069> water<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.640> masters

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
so 190 feet off the water that masters

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:33.040 
so 190 feet off the water that masters
it<00:03:28.420> I<00:03:30.940> think<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.030> outside<00:03:32.330> holes<00:03:32.510> are<00:03:32.630> 100<00:03:32.930> in

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
it I think the outside holes are 100 in

00:03:33.050 --> 00:04:37.790 
it I think the outside holes are 100 in
the<00:03:33.140> middle<00:03:33.410> sections<00:03:34.220> 98

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.200 

thought<00:04:38.400> about<00:04:38.520> maybe<00:04:39.300> seven<00:04:40.050> or<00:04:40.110> eight<00:04:40.229> knots

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
thought about maybe seven or eight knots

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.600 
thought about maybe seven or eight knots
of<00:04:42.210> breeze<00:04:42.270> right<00:04:42.659> now<00:04:42.870> in<00:04:43.259> san<00:04:43.470> diego<00:04:43.590> bay<00:04:43.860> i'm
