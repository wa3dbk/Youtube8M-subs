00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.330
 android insiders we will introduce dear 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.599

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.340
 they themselves advised us to play a duet which 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.769
 advised us a man with a nickname true 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.440
 vincent really enjoyed it all 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.900
 Our editors often want to 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.609
 launch the smartphone into the wall now 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.609
 offer to look at his duet 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.730
 the design is pretty psychedelic 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.010
 especially background image animation in 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.989
 gray and black colors do not distract more 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.370
 on the contrary helps to focus exactly 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.770
 on what's happening on the screen 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.540
 smartphone music for the game wrote 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.000
 australian composer steam shell 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.309
 the soundtrack of the game is pretty nice i would 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.840
 even said atmospheric coupe with design 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.970
 the game world is the atmosphere itself 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.340
 created if not gloomy then 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.960
 certain tense play by the way 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.350
 better in headphones does not help 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.350
 distracted 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.229
 our task is to press left and right 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.450
 part of the screen rotate a pair of connected 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.979
 between each other balls for something to 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.869
 prevent them from facing obstacles 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.770
 rotating at the right time and in the right 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.719
 direction and so the whole gameplay 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.759
 if that captures the beginning of the 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:27.039
 will not be bored too soon and level by level 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.469
 to rotate the balls left and right 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.520
 for flyby blocks square and 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.069
 rectangular shape 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.840
 they are located at different distances in 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:37.299
 different places and a little knack and 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.310
 attention will not prevent the complexity of the game all 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.590
 squares increase and increase 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.509
 the rectangles start to shake falls 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.429
 move the music we mentioned 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:49.619

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.619
 Game process at least 10 15 seconds 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.960
 yes yes no comment 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.700
 because it irritates this toy sometimes 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.890
 quite provoking 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.900
 diverse sayings or desire 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.090
 send an innocent smartphone 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.530
 somewhere present in a duet and 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.960
 opportunity to spend some money 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.880
 really a little just 100 rubles and 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.190
 just one time to get pretty 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.260
 a significant number of buns for those who 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.180

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.460
 daily missions and other levels 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.890
 which can be fine to occupy rare 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.750
 free moments but advertising will be gone 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.700
 basic version of google play duet 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.620
 absolutely free but sometimes 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.810
 this or that ad is shown 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.240
 it does not interfere with the gameplay 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.930
 but on this we all play good 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.820
