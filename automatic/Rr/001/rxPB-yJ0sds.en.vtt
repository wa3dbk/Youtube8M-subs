a<00:00:31.330> sport<00:00:31.750> version<00:00:31.990> of<00:00:32.259> the<00:00:32.409> same<00:00:33.309> shock

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
a sport version of the same shock

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.910 
a sport version of the same shock
absorber<00:00:33.969> for<00:00:33.999> the<00:00:34.210> Alfa<00:00:34.449> Romeo<00:00:34.679> there's<00:00:35.679> two

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
absorber for the Alfa Romeo there's two

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.290 
absorber for the Alfa Romeo there's two
different<00:00:36.069> adjustment<00:00:36.609> mechanisms<00:00:37.179> that

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
different adjustment mechanisms that

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.790 
different adjustment mechanisms that
they<00:00:37.420> used<00:00:37.659> on<00:00:37.780> Coney<00:00:38.019> shock<00:00:38.260> absorbers<00:00:38.769> and

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
they used on Coney shock absorbers and

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.590 
they used on Coney shock absorbers and
they<00:00:38.979> are<00:00:39.129> interchangeable<00:00:39.370> so<00:00:39.999> you<00:00:40.089> may<00:00:40.329> find

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
they are interchangeable so you may find

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.529 
they are interchangeable so you may find
it<00:00:40.809> from<00:00:41.199> one<00:00:41.469> application<00:00:41.829> to<00:00:42.249> the<00:00:42.399> other<00:00:42.539> the

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539 
it from one application to the other the

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.110 
it from one application to the other the
first<00:00:43.870> method<00:00:44.440> is<00:00:44.589> just<00:00:45.159> a<00:00:45.370> simple<00:00:45.760> collapse

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
first method is just a simple collapse

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.459 
first method is just a simple collapse
of<00:00:46.269> the<00:00:46.329> shock<00:00:46.539> absorber<00:00:46.989> engages<00:00:47.409> the

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
of the shock absorber engages the

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.349 
of the shock absorber engages the
adjuster<00:00:47.920> and<00:00:48.069> you<00:00:48.460> can<00:00:48.639> twist<00:00:48.909> it<00:00:49.120> to<00:00:49.239> your

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 
adjuster and you can twist it to your

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:51.329 
adjuster and you can twist it to your
desired<00:00:49.690> setting<00:00:49.929> the<00:00:50.620> second<00:00:51.039> one<00:00:51.129> you<00:00:51.249> have

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.339 
desired setting the second one you have

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:53.189 
desired setting the second one you have
to<00:00:51.429> extend<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:51.850> shock<00:00:52.059> absorber<00:00:52.569> remove<00:00:53.079> a

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
to extend the shock absorber remove a

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.889 
to extend the shock absorber remove a
spacer<00:00:53.710> then<00:00:54.339> collapse<00:00:54.760> it<00:00:54.999> adjust<00:00:55.690> to<00:00:55.749> your

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
spacer then collapse it adjust to your

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:56.459 
spacer then collapse it adjust to your
setting

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
setting

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.069

reinstall<00:00:57.339> the<00:00:57.399> spacer<00:00:57.999> and<00:00:58.120> then<00:00:58.659> put<00:00:58.959> it

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
reinstall the spacer and then put it

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.779 
reinstall the spacer and then put it
into<00:00:59.289> the<00:00:59.379> vehicle<00:00:59.530> now<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.399> first<00:01:00.579> one<00:01:00.699> I'm

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
into the vehicle now the first one I'm

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.819 
into the vehicle now the first one I'm
going<00:01:00.879> to<00:01:00.940> demonstrate<00:01:01.089> is<00:01:01.569> on<00:01:01.749> the<00:01:02.079> pony

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
going to demonstrate is on the pony

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.880 
going to demonstrate is on the pony
classic<00:01:03.339> for<00:01:03.519> the<00:01:03.549> FMA<00:01:03.999> oh<00:01:04.079> this<00:01:05.079> one<00:01:05.289> is<00:01:05.500> the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
classic for the FMA oh this one is the

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.090 
classic for the FMA oh this one is the
twist<00:01:06.700> style<00:01:07.420> so<00:01:07.810> we<00:01:07.930> simply<00:01:08.289> bottom<00:01:08.979> the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
twist style so we simply bottom the

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.639 
twist style so we simply bottom the
shock<00:01:09.280> absorber<00:01:09.810> turn<00:01:10.810> it<00:01:10.960> slowly<00:01:11.170> until<00:01:11.530> you

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
shock absorber turn it slowly until you

the other way

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.779 
the other way
you<00:01:32.380> can<00:01:32.560> count<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.859> number<00:01:32.890> of<00:01:33.159> terms<00:01:33.490> to

you can count the number of terms to

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:40.319 
you can count the number of terms to

gauge your setting the other method uses
the<00:01:40.359> spacer<00:01:40.899> for<00:01:41.469> that<00:01:41.619> one<00:01:41.799> you<00:01:41.979> extend<00:01:42.369> the

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
the spacer for that one you extend the

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.080 
the spacer for that one you extend the
shock<00:01:42.640> absorber<00:01:43.060> all<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.299> way<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:45.820> is<00:01:45.999> the

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
shock absorber all the way this is the

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.989 
shock absorber all the way this is the
spacer<00:01:46.479> here<00:01:46.509> it's<00:01:47.140> just<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.409> rubber<00:01:47.950> block<00:01:48.340> has

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:48.999 
spacer here it's just a rubber block has

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:52.620 
spacer here it's just a rubber block has
a<00:01:49.030> cut<00:01:49.299> in<00:01:49.450> it<00:01:49.539> you<00:01:49.869> remove<00:01:50.079> that<00:01:50.140> then<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:52.479> can

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
a cut in it you remove that then you can

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.880 
a cut in it you remove that then you can
collapse<00:01:52.899> the<00:01:53.170> shock<00:01:53.380> absorber<00:01:55.619> turn<00:01:56.619> into

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
collapse the shock absorber turn into

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.370 
collapse the shock absorber turn into
you<00:01:56.979> feel<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.249> adjuster<00:01:57.549> engage<00:01:58.289> and<00:01:59.289> then

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
you feel the adjuster engage and then

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.169
