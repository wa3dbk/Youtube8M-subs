00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.870
 Hello friends, I have today 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:12.059
 great mood finally i 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:17.330
 completed the ford on level 4 and opened 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:20.609
 elephant as we see I have already hired 20 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.660
 very long hired well let's 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:28.230
 look here are beautiful elephants who are 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.269
 don't remember the characteristics let's again 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.279
 we'll see 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:36.510
 battle elephant first level 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:40.559
 base value 580 damage 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.250
 still artifacts give plus 203 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:52.170
 to damage protective equipment points 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:56.539
 health 3500 range 3 speed 09 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:01.879
 instead of army 3 the cost of construction 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:03.120
 30,000 sand and 500 gold time 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.140
 construction 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:11.540
 15 minutes well, as we see so interesting 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:17.210
 unit if to compare 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:22.290
 the barracks are ours but a little bit better 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:26.460
 damage to health is slightly weaker on 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:30.930
 thousand and range 3 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:36.659
 the best and the speed a little better place 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:40.740
 army 15 cost 30 thousand well and 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:44.399
 It built a little faster scrapped Well 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.939
 I propose to go to the arena to enter the arena 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.689
 by the way, let me show you a bunch 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:56.090
 I'm just so glad that finally 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:02:00.649
 completed these elephants like a little bit 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.890
 What is my goal dastin? 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:07.680
 a bunch 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:11.680
 I have 500 staff capacity that 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:16.060
 I built this 20 level 6 phone 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.379
 forty five mages sixth level 20 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:24.120
 elephants and three heroes 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:30.639
 I think to attack the city at least from 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:34.269
 60th level because it makes no sense 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:35.170
 little show something so let's go 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.469
 into the arena 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:42.670
 let's see who we can here 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:47.590
 find honestly the first time I attack 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:52.500
 elephants and do not know what to demolish well here 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:56.069
 friends advised to demolish guns 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:00.269
 try to see what happens 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:04.629
 something very interesting in the arena 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:07.510
 weak players this is for us 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:14.669
 player not 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:18.329
 my and 3 in the leave will take out and start 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:26.040
 I don't know where is this from somewhere 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:32.669
 let's get started let's get started 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:37.569
 let's get out of here how to see the walls 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:42.870
 pumped I don't know my bad 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:47.169
 foreboding for some reason that the city I do not 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.840
 let's break a hundred percent well, let's see 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:56.049
 what is he up to 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:04:01.989
 as you can see the elephants smashed already the tower 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:06.189
 principle of death is not much left but I 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:10.389
 I think that one hundred percent I will not break 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:14.530
 because I have not played such units yet 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:16.470
 and I do nâ€™t know how to see the elephants from 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:21.690
 serious 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:26.760
 that we have a ton I will break as they say 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.710
 and elephants need to be able to play a little 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.160
 left 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.300
 defenses can wrong i 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:40.200
 released 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:43.760
 but as if breaking through a good one can 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:50.130
 percent do not probably break well, as it were 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:54.630
 sang the first attack is good as we see 10 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:57.480
 in combat we still have units left 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:03.090
 principle incise the stars 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:07.980
 the city is broken the time is enough and 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:13.350
 unit 6 unit somewhere there is clothes 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:19.710
 Score 5 I do not see there, but that's all 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:22.640
 principle as we can see level 63 can i 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:27.930
 wrong somewhere landed 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:31.040
 elephants but this is such a first attack i think 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:35.150
 turned out well we will try 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:38.790
 further better to fight he wish friends 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:43.050
 rather open the elephant who else does not 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:48.870
 opened as we see really like by 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:53.220
 they are good for me but minus the fact that in one 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:57.630
 the barracks are more precisely ford for a long time being built 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:06:01.080
 these 20 elephants i built 5 hours 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:05.220
 it is clear that magic is literally 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:09.090
 half an hour got settled but elephants are very 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:13.250
 long so all thank you friends for 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.250
 view and all bye
