00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.320
 Hi, I am Ciderhelm, welcome to the "Final Glory Focus Hero". 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.220
 Today we are concerned about the genius mage who can summon the stars: "The Witch Stars." 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.780
 The witch actress can illuminate the front of the team, summoning the stars as a gunfire attack, or conducting long-range reconnaissance. 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.580
 Although she is more vulnerable, she is well suited to fight at the farthest point on the battlefield. 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.600
 The hero of Sinhales, "The Light of Julia" will attack her basic attack. 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.600
 Change to spells that deal primarily with Crystal damage, and increase damage with the crystal power of Sparks. 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.220
 In addition, when her basic attack hits an enemy, it will make the other party briefly. 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:38.260
 Xerox's first skill, "Sacred Stars," will create small stars at the target location, causing explosive crystal damage to nearby enemies. 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.120
 This star will stay on the battlefield for a few seconds. 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.040
 Although it does not continue to cause damage, it still provides a small range of views around. 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:54.360
 If Stars uses this skill for an existing star, the star will become a supernova, causing more damage to a wider range of enemies. 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.700
 Pointing to the "Sacred Stars" will significantly increase the scope of its casting. 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.540
 I recommend learning the "Sacred Stars" at the first level, upgrading it first, and in almost all cases you should first fill it up. 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.240
 Xerox's second skill, "Core Collapse," triggers a chain reaction at a nearby location. 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.460
 After a short delay, enemies in the area will be dizzy and suffer Crystal damage. 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.020
 Clicking on "Core Collapse" extends the time of dizziness and significantly reduces skill cooldown. 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.577
 I recommend learning "core collapse" at level 2 and upgrading to the second overall position. 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:31.380
 And in the case of survival is more important than increasing the damage, then first point it to full, otherwise you should first let the ultimate skill reach the highest level. 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.620
 Xinglux's ultimate skill, "Star Storm," will shoot several stars across the map to attack enemies along the way. 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.340
 The foremost star will pass through all targets, causing crystal damage. 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.280
 However, the subsequent stars will detonate and cause a range of crystal damage to the first hit enemy. 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.880
 Star damage to non-heroes will be greatly reduced. 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.400
 In addition, the stars will not cause damage to the building, but the subsequent stars will still hit the building. 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.020
 Upgrading "Star Storm" increases the number of subsequent stars, causing more damage and making it harder for the enemy to avoid them. 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.760
 I suggest that if you want to cause the most damage, you should fill all the third steps of this skill. 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.920
 When using Stars as a mage, it is highly recommended that you focus on the crystal tree. 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.340
 Start with "Frost Burning" and then immediately turn to "Travel Boots". 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.200
 The increase in the range of these two items when they are filled with "Sacred Stars" will make it easier for you to keep your distance. 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.840
 If you are most used to staying at a distance, I suggest you equip with "Crystal Fragments", "Winding Device" and "Fracture Myth", which will make her shine. 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.600
 If you prefer close combat, or can't avoid melee, then "aftershocks" and "alternating currents" are powerful additional equipment. 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.900
 When using Stars, you must be proficient in certain steps. 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.360
 Please note that I am very careful to step closer to place the stars, and then immediately retreat during the formation of the stars. 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.466
 Because the crystal star is extremely fragile, 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.960
 Learning to wave forward and backward is often the key to life and death, especially in the face of agile assassins. 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.480
 Before the battle broke out, I was careful to find a strategic location where stars could be placed. 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.333
 The bushes and the hubs here are ideal locations for new stars. 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.840
 Because the stars provide a vision for your team, there is also the opportunity to use supernovas to deal with close enemies. 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.180
 The flower enchanted rabbit was trapped, and Yadan and I went to rescue. As Yadan launches extreme skills, please pay attention to my skills. 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.860
 I have already put down a star and will soon cast a "core collapse" to stun Catherine and Cosca. 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.880
 As a result, it is almost guaranteed that the subsequent supernova will hit the other side. 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.880
 Immediately after the combination of stun and supernova, I immediately took the "Star Storm" and gave the other party a devastating blow. 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.500
 Hit another star, and the "Light of Zalia" attack enhanced by "aftershocks" ended the fate of Catherine. 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.520
 Yadan launched the "War of War", allowing us to quickly approach Sol in the retreat. 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.860
 Please pay attention to how I aim at the attack. Because Stars' skills are delayed, they all need to be carefully aimed at moving targets. 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.900
 After Yadan issued a "charge", even if Sol was so close to the other church, he still had no chance to escape. 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.820
