00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
in here this one on mine I actually have

a 7 point 4 volt five thousand milliamp
hour<00:01:39.780> battery<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.350> that's<00:01:40.530> one<00:01:40.650> thousand<00:01:40.950> more

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.609 
hour battery so that's one thousand more
milliamps<00:01:41.700> then<00:01:42.450> Tony's<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.259> little<00:01:43.500> bit

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.469 
milliamps then Tony's it's a little bit
heavier<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.610> see<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.939> still<00:01:45.149> fits

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
heavier but as you can see it still fits

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.060

pretty<00:04:06.940> cool<00:04:07.240> so<00:04:07.480> I'll<00:04:07.600> probably<00:04:07.840> gear<00:04:08.170> up<00:04:08.320> a

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
pretty cool so I'll probably gear up a

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.100 
pretty cool so I'll probably gear up a
little<00:04:09.520> bit<00:04:09.700> in<00:04:09.820> the<00:04:09.910> future<00:04:10.030> but<00:04:10.690> right<00:04:10.750> now

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
winged ESC it's real quick main concern

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.130 
winged ESC it's real quick main concern
was<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.350> vented<00:04:42.130> motor<00:04:42.900> so<00:04:43.900> if<00:04:44.020> you're

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
was the vented motor so if you're

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.230 
was the vented motor so if you're
running<00:04:44.530> out<00:04:44.680> in<00:04:44.890> like<00:04:45.430> a<00:04:45.460> backyard<00:04:46.030> or

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
running out in like a backyard or

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.730 
running out in like a backyard or
someone<00:04:46.570> with<00:04:46.690> a<00:04:46.720> lot<00:04:46.900> of<00:04:46.930> gravel<00:04:47.350> rocks<00:04:47.590> I

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
someone with a lot of gravel rocks I

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.050 
someone with a lot of gravel rocks I
probably<00:04:47.950> wouldn't<00:04:48.280> recommend<00:04:48.580> it<00:04:48.820> but<00:04:49.000> if

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
probably wouldn't recommend it but if

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.060 
probably wouldn't recommend it but if
you're<00:04:49.240> running<00:04:49.390> on<00:04:49.660> road<00:04:49.960> or<00:04:50.200> if<00:04:50.950> you're

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
you're running on road or if you're

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.310 
you're running on road or if you're

actually<00:04:55.000> keeps<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.300> motor<00:04:55.450> pretty<00:04:55.750> cool

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
actually keeps the motor pretty cool

I<00:05:02.610> not<00:05:03.610> sure<00:05:03.850> the<00:05:04.120> timing<00:05:04.450> he's<00:05:04.690> running<00:05:05.020> but

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
I not sure the timing he's running but

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.170 
I not sure the timing he's running but
it's<00:05:05.380> real<00:05:05.650> quick<00:05:05.950> I<00:05:06.130> mean<00:05:06.160> like<00:05:06.580> he<00:05:06.940> doesn't
