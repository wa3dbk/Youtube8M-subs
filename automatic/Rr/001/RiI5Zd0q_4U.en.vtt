00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.120
 hi everyone then 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.790
 we will see how to connect flow 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.990
 rocard 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.059
 here we use for fishing at 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.300
 lure not of the very holy year to drac 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.650
 we'll see that so it's fitting it's 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.900
 very simple who holds well they spend 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.990
 well in the rings and to complicate 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.070
 business are to our carbon stream 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:36.120
 with with this one must make a loop 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:39.420
 to then resume our braids on 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:45.870
 will spend the braid in the loop as 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:49.469
 we're going to enlist our press on 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.989
 resumed Christmas 15 to 20 cm we're still going 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:01:00.829
 him our press around the flowers at 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:00.829
 carbon made a dozen laps 1 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.570
 where else would it turn twelve years ago and 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.250
 a dozen then with the rest of 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.410
 our is we will go back in the other 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.540
 always meaning to remake a dozen 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.620
 turns it's exciting finally little less 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.620
 I do a dozen 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.729
 in gold finkie dozens then we go 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:43.219
 iron our 13 in the loop as 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:49.490
 so this is going to give us that we're going 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:58.250
 take all our arms we'll shoot but 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:02:02.709
 good she pulls well then consultant 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.709
 resumes well that of a chef tilt 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.150
 normally I do that teeth that's 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.360
 give a try we 're pretty much that 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.360
 still 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.709
 so it was very good but it goes 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:27.040
 everywhere it is the sweet voice and rather 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:30.290
 well done then we will cut the rest 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.430
 the balls the braid normally for 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.670
 see if you have done well your 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.100
 know them it 'll do about that 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.170
 you have one on one side there is fluoride 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.950
 carbon and water that there is a stub 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.889
 press so here's this bah on this 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.959
 video I explained to you how to close 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:51.650
 their very strong agreement to carbon no 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:55.100
 more influential to carbon in 60 hundredths 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:59.769
 and a crisis for our upcoming sport 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:02.980
 stipulates to make 13 hundredths 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.980
 Hello everyone
