00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
after doing that so I thought that was

after doing that so I thought that was
effective<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.550> use<00:02:56.580> this<00:02:56.880> comb<00:02:57.150> first<00:02:57.510> because

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
effective to use this comb first because

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:07.680 
effective to use this comb first because
normally<00:02:58.080> i<00:02:58.140> just<00:02:58.320> use<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.620> other<00:02:58.739> pink<00:02:59.040> one

the<00:05:47.420> ground<00:05:47.450> was<00:05:47.840> not<00:05:48.080> happy<00:05:48.500> I<00:05:48.680> thought<00:05:49.670> it

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
the ground was not happy I thought it

00:05:49.790 --> 00:06:06.340 
the ground was not happy I thought it
was<00:05:49.850> spring

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.920 

alright<00:06:07.070> so<00:06:07.280> I<00:06:07.370> pinned<00:06:07.760> up<00:06:07.910> some<00:06:08.090> back<00:06:10.930> and

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
alright so I pinned up some back and

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.450 
alright so I pinned up some back and
this<00:06:12.080> is<00:06:12.200> what<00:06:12.380> I'm<00:06:12.470> left<00:06:12.650> with<00:06:12.830> I<00:06:15.340> think<00:06:16.340> it

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460

looks<00:06:16.490> right<00:06:16.910> I<00:06:19.720> actually<00:06:20.720> think<00:06:21.020> this<00:06:21.230> style

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
looks right I actually think this style
