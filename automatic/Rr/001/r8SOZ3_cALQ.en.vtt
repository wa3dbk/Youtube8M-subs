00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
offense now the next spot has to do with

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.010 
offense now the next spot has to do with
this<00:01:11.490> ledge<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.060> there<00:01:12.540> are<00:01:12.600> two<00:01:12.689> ways<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.840> get

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
this ledge and there are two ways to get

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.450 
this ledge and there are two ways to get
up<00:01:13.140> there<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.680> either<00:01:13.770> jump<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.310> from

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
up there you can either jump on it from

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.980 
up there you can either jump on it from
the<00:01:14.580> plane<00:01:14.880> min<00:01:15.150> map<00:01:15.360> which<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.780> don't<00:01:15.840> really

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the plane min map which I don't really

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.390 
the plane min map which I don't really
suggest<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.590> know<00:01:16.710> you're<00:01:16.860> open<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.220> pretty

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
suggest you know you're open to pretty

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.340 
suggest you know you're open to pretty
much<00:01:17.580> every<00:01:17.850> direction<00:01:18.000> what<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.810> do<00:01:18.930> suggest

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
much every direction what I do suggest

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.840 
much every direction what I do suggest
is<00:01:19.680> breaking<00:01:20.009> through<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.220> glass<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.700> just

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
is breaking through the glass and just

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.580 
is breaking through the glass and just
safely<00:01:21.150> running<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.659> now<00:01:22.229> everyone<00:01:22.560> knows

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
safely running to it now everyone knows

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.080 
safely running to it now everyone knows
about<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.130> spot<00:01:23.400> but<00:01:23.670> what<00:01:23.820> people<00:01:23.939> don't

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
about this spot but what people don't

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.820 
about this spot but what people don't
know<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.840> there's<00:01:25.140> actually<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.439> wallbang

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
know is that there's actually a wallbang

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.350 
know is that there's actually a wallbang
spot<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.280> kill<00:01:26.490> people<00:01:26.640> planning<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.210> ball

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
spot to kill people planning the ball

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.300 
spot to kill people planning the ball
might<00:01:27.540> be<00:01:27.720> now<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.530> particularly<00:01:28.950> useful

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
might be now this is particularly useful

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.219 
might be now this is particularly useful
when<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.939> 1v1<00:01:30.270> situation<00:01:30.390> they<00:01:31.020> have<00:01:31.140> two
