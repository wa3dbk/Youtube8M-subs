00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.799
 It will be a serious problem 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.439
 We who live in Japan with four seasons 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.609
 Consume energy to gain comfort 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.609
 I have lived in control of the company freely 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.700
 But does comfort mean keeping a company? 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.329
 For example 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.480
 A hot summer day festival set to a comfortable temperature with viacom 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.250
 Then 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.200
 People who stay indoors for a long time feel cold 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.200
 People who come home from outside feels hot 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.130
 You should want to go out with Atsugi and go out for the cold in midwinter 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.500
 It is very hot and uncomfortable when entering a heated place such as an underground mall 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.770
 While feeling 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.710
 It does not repeat temperature control of intimacy in the room 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.530
 Is not it 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.430
 Feelings may differ depending on the amount of exercise and church 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.040
 There 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.180
 It is bad for the environment and can be called a vicious circle 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.620
 Sakai 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.030
 About a certain class developed for the American world 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.740
 Environmentally friendly Adjust the body surface temperature to a comfortable state 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.350
 Give me 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.980
 It is each wonderful material 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.600
 What is important to meet comfort It is the same exercise 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.270
 is not it 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.370
 Doha round doha increase the surface of Gifu 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.240
 If you feel that it is uncomfortable if you keep it 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.390
 There is none 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.390
 The same trust is the skin surface temperature 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.300
 Work to control 33 degrees that human beings feel most comfortable 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.300
 there is 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.680
 Hatano also responds to sudden environmental changes in sports, not even summer 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.680
 Even at home I hear the comfortable temperature firmly 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.270
 The secret of the outburst is from that day 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.379
 When it gets hot, extra heat quickly becomes strong 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.459
 Release the stored heat 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.319
 Conducted as you can see if you go home with thermography 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.120
 Material and general layer using outbursts 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.120
 There is a difference 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.539
 Comfortable life 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:28.919
 Environment 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.919
 I start with something I can do 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:36.909
 Record temperature control comfortably 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.189
 Temperature control inside clothes out last 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:42.509
 It's not too hot or too sub 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:45.509
 We will provide you with the comfort you want 

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:47.149
