00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
so as you can see by my calculations

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.370 
so as you can see by my calculations
here<00:00:08.450> triangulation<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.809> most<00:00:10.050> definitely

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
here triangulation is most definitely

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.089 
here triangulation is most definitely
the<00:00:10.920> key<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.519> this<00:00:11.670> particular<00:00:12.059> project<00:00:12.540> I

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
the key to this particular project I

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.829 
the key to this particular project I
triangle<00:00:14.099> has<00:00:14.250> three<00:00:14.280> sides<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.420> if<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:15.630> take

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
triangle has three sides and if you take

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.720 
triangle has three sides and if you take
each<00:00:16.080> side<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:16.830> put<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.039> into<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> ball

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
each side and you put it into a ball

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.840 
each side and you put it into a ball
then<00:00:18.060> you're<00:00:18.240> gonna<00:00:18.390> happen<00:00:19.550> all<00:00:20.550> right<00:00:20.730> who

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
then you're gonna happen all right who

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.679 
then you're gonna happen all right who

saying<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.280> triangle<00:00:44.879> has<00:00:45.000> three<00:00:45.030> sides

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
saying to for triangle has three sides

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.380 
saying to for triangle has three sides
and<00:00:46.079> there<00:00:47.039> are<00:00:47.129> next<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.579> square<00:00:48.000> which<00:00:48.210> has

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
and there are next to a square which has

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.240 
and there are next to a square which has
four<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.110> if<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.410> put<00:00:49.590> them<00:00:49.770> together<00:00:49.860> you

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
four and if you put them together you

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.139 
four and if you put them together you
get<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:51.030> eight<00:00:51.360> sides<00:00:51.750> right<00:00:52.590> there<00:00:53.149> maybe

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
get like eight sides right there maybe

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.660 
get like eight sides right there maybe
it's<00:00:54.360> seven<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.890> have<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.370> get<00:00:56.550> my
