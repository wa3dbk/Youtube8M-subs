didn't<00:00:03.810> believe<00:00:03.899> that<00:00:04.350> my<00:00:04.500> concept<00:00:05.069> of<00:00:05.460> the

responders<00:00:09.120> works<00:00:09.809> so<00:00:10.590> i<00:00:10.620> made<00:00:10.889> this<00:00:11.280> little

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
responders works so i made this little

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.240 
responders works so i made this little
robot<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.330> test<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:13.170> kept<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.980> very

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
robot to test it I kept it very

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.660 
robot to test it I kept it very
minimalistic<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:16.490> result<00:00:17.490> isn't

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
minimalistic so the result isn't

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.570 
minimalistic so the result isn't
influenced<00:00:18.650> so<00:00:19.650> what<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:19.920> have<00:00:20.070> here<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.490> a

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
influenced so what we have here is a

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.089 
influenced so what we have here is a
chant<00:00:21.029> t10<00:00:21.539> Rhodri<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:23.720> 34,000<00:00:24.720> 12<00:00:25.170> or<00:00:25.680> hit

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
chant t10 Rhodri with 34,000 12 or hit

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.939 
chant t10 Rhodri with 34,000 12 or hit
points<00:00:26.460> are<00:00:26.609> armored<00:00:26.970> whatever<00:00:27.650> that<00:00:28.650> is

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
points are armored whatever that is

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.209 
points are armored whatever that is
supposed<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.550> catch<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.150> rail<00:00:30.510> shots<00:00:31.219> then

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
supposed to catch the rail shots then

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.229 
supposed to catch the rail shots then
behind<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:33.090> we<00:00:33.480> have<00:00:33.660> two<00:00:34.530> glass<00:00:35.399> blocks<00:00:35.760> one

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
behind this we have two glass blocks one

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.090 
behind this we have two glass blocks one
as<00:00:36.989> connection<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.450> one<00:00:39.450> as<00:00:39.780> buffer<00:00:40.170> zone<00:00:40.410> so

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
as connection and one as buffer zone so

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.700 
as connection and one as buffer zone so
fifty<00:00:41.550> percent<00:00:41.910> or<00:00:42.329> chance<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:43.020> the

fifty percent or chance that the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.520 
fifty percent or chance that the
electroplate<00:00:44.280> goes<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.260> should<00:00:46.260> be

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
electroplate goes and this should be

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.000 
electroplate goes and this should be
kept<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.180> fifty<00:00:48.180> percent<00:00:48.480> chance<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.050> this

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
kept and fifty percent chance that this

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.610 
kept and fifty percent chance that this
goes<00:00:50.309> also<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.329> we<00:00:51.480> should<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.960> all<00:00:52.350> cases

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
goes also but we should in all cases

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.569 
goes also but we should in all cases
keep<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:54.000> white<00:00:54.660> block<00:00:55.219> that<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.550> course

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
keep the white block that is of course

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.930 
keep the white block that is of course
if<00:00:56.940> they<00:00:57.750> don't<00:00:57.989> hit<00:00:58.199> any<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.770> these<00:00:59.609> blocks

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
if they don't hit any of these blocks

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.410 
if they don't hit any of these blocks

pretty interesting isn't it so in some

pretty interesting isn't it so in some
cases<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.719> electroplate<00:02:56.290> cottage<00:02:56.739> which

cases the electroplate cottage which
caused<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.239> right<00:02:58.599> block<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:59.290> be<00:02:59.500> broken<00:03:00.090> but

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
caused the right block to be broken but

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.959 
caused the right block to be broken but
we<00:03:01.389> always<00:03:01.750> had<00:03:02.439> these<00:03:03.069> blocks<00:03:03.430> left<00:03:03.699> and

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:05.969 
we always had these blocks left and

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:10.589 
we always had these blocks left and
sometimes<00:03:06.969> we<00:03:07.810> also<00:03:08.049> had<00:03:08.799> a<00:03:09.030> glass<00:03:10.030> block<00:03:10.359> left

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
sometimes we also had a glass block left

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.129 
sometimes we also had a glass block left
which<00:03:11.109> proves<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:13.120> road<00:03:13.329> rocket<00:03:13.569> it<00:03:13.840> on

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
which proves that the road rocket it on

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.059 
which proves that the road rocket it on
and<00:03:14.469> not<00:03:14.859> the<00:03:15.250> electroplating<00:03:16.379> what<00:03:17.379> would

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
and not the electroplating what would

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.300 
and not the electroplating what would
happen<00:03:18.400> if<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.780> shield<00:03:20.010> wouldn't<00:03:21.010> be

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
happen if the shield wouldn't be

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.770 
happen if the shield wouldn't be
calculated<00:03:22.239> well<00:03:23.199> we<00:03:23.439> got<00:03:23.909> eight<00:03:24.909> blocks<00:03:25.389> of

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
calculated well we got eight blocks of

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.009 
calculated well we got eight blocks of
t10<00:03:26.739> armor<00:03:27.189> worth<00:03:27.669> of<00:03:27.849> damage<00:03:28.209> of<00:03:28.479> the<00:03:28.540> road

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
t10 armor worth of damage of the road

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.129 
t10 armor worth of damage of the road
the<00:03:29.439> road<00:03:29.590> rocket<00:03:29.889> shot<00:03:30.099> this<00:03:31.030> is<00:03:31.359> one<00:03:31.870> block

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
the road rocket shot this is one block

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.939 
the road rocket shot this is one block
of<00:03:32.349> armor<00:03:32.739> this<00:03:33.519> isn't<00:03:34.329> really<00:03:34.629> any<00:03:34.780> hour<00:03:35.019> so

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:35.949 
of armor this isn't really any hour so

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:39.059 
of armor this isn't really any hour so
we<00:03:36.400> still<00:03:36.669> would<00:03:36.939> have<00:03:36.970> eight<00:03:37.389> blocks<00:03:38.069> worth

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
we still would have eight blocks worth

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.640 
we still would have eight blocks worth
of<00:03:39.280> damage<00:03:39.609> but<00:03:40.239> this<00:03:40.840> doesn't<00:03:41.229> get<00:03:41.319> applied

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
of damage but this doesn't get applied

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.539 
of damage but this doesn't get applied
because<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.849> shield<00:03:43.120> absorbs<00:03:43.629> it<00:03:44.189> so<00:03:45.189> i<00:03:45.220> hope

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
because the shield absorbs it so i hope

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.520 
because the shield absorbs it so i hope
