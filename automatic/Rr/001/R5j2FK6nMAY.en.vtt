00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.830 
just a simple plastic package obviously
they<00:00:25.650> don't<00:00:25.800> really<00:00:25.920> need<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.699> know<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:27.810> a

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
they don't really need you know like a

they don't really need you know like a
vault<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.380> store<00:00:28.590> these<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.769> considering<00:00:29.279> it

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
vault to store these in considering it

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.859 
vault to store these in considering it
is<00:00:29.460> actually<00:00:29.670> made<00:00:29.939> out<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.210> TPU<00:00:30.720> material

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
is actually made out of a TPU material

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.990 
is actually made out of a TPU material
which<00:00:31.740> means<00:00:31.949> not<00:00:32.070> only<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:32.369> flexible<00:00:32.820> but

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
which means not only it's flexible but

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.670 
which means not only it's flexible but
it's<00:00:33.090> actually<00:00:33.390> quite<00:00:33.510> shock<00:00:33.989> absorbent<00:00:34.590> as

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
it's actually quite shock absorbent as

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.590 
it's actually quite shock absorbent as
well<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.489> we're<00:00:35.610> going<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.790> go<00:00:35.880> ahead<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.090> toss

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
well so we're going to go ahead and toss

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.410 
well so we're going to go ahead and toss
the<00:00:36.899> phone<00:00:37.350> inside<00:00:38.190> right<00:00:38.489> now<00:00:38.520> generally

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
the phone inside right now generally

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.880 
the phone inside right now generally
with<00:00:39.510> TPU<00:00:39.840> cases<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.290> like<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.530> kind<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.739> start

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
with TPU cases I like to kind of start

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.350 
with TPU cases I like to kind of start
at<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.100> bottom<00:00:41.280> i'll<00:00:41.610> go<00:00:41.670> ahead<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.850> refocus

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
at the bottom i'll go ahead and refocus

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.779 
at the bottom i'll go ahead and refocus
this<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.809> see<00:00:42.989> why<00:00:43.789> generally

this so you can see why generally
speaking<00:00:44.910> if<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.329> just<00:00:45.510> kind<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.870> throw<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
speaking if you just kind of throw the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.049 
speaking if you just kind of throw the
your<00:00:46.739> phone<00:00:46.980> into<00:00:47.340> these<00:00:47.460> cases<00:00:47.940> without

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
your phone into these cases without

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.819 
your phone into these cases without
paying<00:00:48.390> attention<00:00:48.450> sometimes<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.649> holes

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
paying attention sometimes the holes

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.139 
paying attention sometimes the holes
don't<00:00:50.010> always<00:00:50.280> line<00:00:50.489> up<00:00:50.520> that's<00:00:50.820> not<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.030> say

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
don't always line up that's not to say

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.279 
don't always line up that's not to say
that<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.360> cutouts<00:00:51.690> aren't<00:00:51.930> actually

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
that the cutouts aren't actually

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
i'm at least around the edges the black

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.609 
i'm at least around the edges the black
on<00:01:11.880> green<00:01:12.240> contrast<00:01:12.960> looks<00:01:13.140> absolutely

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
on green contrast looks absolutely

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.380 
on green contrast looks absolutely
amazing<00:01:14.220> i<00:01:14.400> really<00:01:14.700> really<00:01:14.790> like<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.240> when

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
amazing i really really like it and when

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.690 
amazing i really really like it and when
we<00:01:15.479> turn<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.840> around<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.799> actually<00:01:17.009> brings<00:01:17.430> out

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
we turn it around it actually brings out

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.090 
we turn it around it actually brings out
those<00:01:17.850> etched<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.509> lines<00:01:18.570> those<00:01:19.470> circuitry

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
those etched in lines those circuitry

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.700 
those etched in lines those circuitry
etched<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.549> lines<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:21.150> lot<00:01:21.450> more<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.140> i<00:01:22.439> think

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
etched in lines a lot more and i think

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.740 
etched in lines a lot more and i think
it<00:01:22.770> looks<00:01:22.920> absolutely<00:01:23.130> fantastic<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:24.150> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750

just<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.250> little<00:01:56.610> bit<00:01:56.700> bigger<00:01:56.880> now<00:01:57.060> i<00:01:57.090> don't

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
just a little bit bigger now i don't

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.350 
just a little bit bigger now i don't
really<00:01:57.509> think<00:01:58.049> i<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.969> larger<00:01:59.969> than<00:02:00.090> average

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
really think i have larger than average

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.289 
really think i have larger than average
thumbs<00:02:01.020> but<00:02:01.829> i<00:02:02.100> do<00:02:02.219> find<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.850> little<00:02:03.060> bit

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
thumbs but i do find it a little bit

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.660 
thumbs but i do find it a little bit
difficult<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.960> not<00:02:03.990> as<00:02:04.350> natural<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.189> try<00:02:05.520> and

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
difficult and not as natural to try and

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.730 
difficult and not as natural to try and
access<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.210> power<00:02:06.390> button<00:02:06.689> considering<00:02:07.560> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
access the power button considering the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.469 
access the power button considering the
the<00:02:08.009> hole<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.369> just<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.550> little<00:02:09.030> bit<00:02:09.119> too<00:02:09.270> small

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
the hole is just a little bit too small

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.240 
the hole is just a little bit too small
for<00:02:09.780> my<00:02:09.869> liking<00:02:10.080> perhaps<00:02:10.560> if<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.800> was<00:02:10.950> maybe

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
for my liking perhaps if it was maybe

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.010 
for my liking perhaps if it was maybe
maybe<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.430> centimeter<00:02:12.670> wider<00:02:13.150> or<00:02:13.570> a<00:02:13.600> half<00:02:13.900> a

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
maybe a centimeter wider or a half a

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.930 
maybe a centimeter wider or a half a
centimeter<00:02:14.380> wider<00:02:14.620> on<00:02:14.860> each<00:02:15.070> side<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.850> would

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
centimeter wider on each side it would

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.670 
centimeter wider on each side it would
have<00:02:16.060> been<00:02:16.120> perfect<00:02:16.780> but<00:02:16.900> still<00:02:17.200> it's<00:02:17.560> not

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
have been perfect but still it's not

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.470 
have been perfect but still it's not
hindering<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.280> ability<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.910> actually<00:02:19.060> access

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
hindering the ability to actually access

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.810 
hindering the ability to actually access
the<00:02:19.780> power<00:02:19.990> button<00:02:20.230> at<00:02:20.470> all<00:02:20.710> so<00:02:21.070> really<00:02:21.700> that's

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
the power button at all so really that's

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.370 
the power button at all so really that's
more<00:02:22.120> aesthetics<00:02:22.660> than<00:02:22.780> anything<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.200> more

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
more aesthetics than anything a more

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.500 
more aesthetics than anything a more
kind<00:02:23.650> of<00:02:23.770> my<00:02:23.890> personal<00:02:24.580> preference<00:02:24.820> but<00:02:25.390> as

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
kind of my personal preference but as

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.790 
kind of my personal preference but as
you<00:02:25.600> can<00:02:25.690> see<00:02:25.900> if<00:02:26.140> we<00:02:26.290> can<00:02:26.410> actually<00:02:26.650> get<00:02:26.740> a

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
you can see if we can actually get a

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.130 
you can see if we can actually get a
closer<00:02:27.100> look<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.580> I'll<00:02:27.670> just<00:02:27.790> refocus<00:02:28.480> you

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
closer look and I'll just refocus you

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.250 
closer look and I'll just refocus you
can<00:02:29.260> see<00:02:29.530> here<00:02:30.209> how<00:02:31.209> awesome<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.870> looks<00:02:31.900> with

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
can see here how awesome it looks with

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.250 
can see here how awesome it looks with
those<00:02:32.440> etched<00:02:32.709> in<00:02:32.980> lines<00:02:33.790> there<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.870> sort<00:02:35.170> of

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
those etched in lines there to sort of

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.990 
those etched in lines there to sort of
simulate<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.950> circuit<00:02:36.430> board<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.730> think<00:02:36.940> it

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
simulate a circuit board and I think it

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.100 
simulate a circuit board and I think it
looks<00:02:37.150> really<00:02:37.360> cool<00:02:37.600> this<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:37.840> kind<00:02:37.990> of<00:02:38.020> like

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
looks really cool this is kind of like

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.340 
looks really cool this is kind of like

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
really really cool stuff here now as you

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.180 
really really cool stuff here now as you
can<00:02:42.970> see<00:02:43.030> also<00:02:43.630> it<00:02:44.170> is<00:02:44.320> a<00:02:44.350> bit<00:02:44.560> recessed<00:02:44.980> or<00:02:45.130> it

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
can see also it is a bit recessed or it

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.250 
can see also it is a bit recessed or it
recesses<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:45.850> camera<00:02:46.630> there<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:46.930> if<00:02:47.050> you<00:02:47.140> do

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
recesses the camera there so if you do

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.990 
recesses the camera there so if you do
happen<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.620> have<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.130> down<00:02:48.550> like<00:02:48.760> that<00:02:48.940> and

maybe there's some dirt and grime on the
table<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.820> don't<00:02:51.940> really<00:02:52.030> have<00:02:52.209> to<00:02:52.300> worry<00:02:52.420> too

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
table you don't really have to worry too

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.900

my<00:03:31.630> own<00:03:31.780> accord<00:03:32.110> I<00:03:32.350> think<00:03:32.860> last<00:03:33.100> year<00:03:33.250> at<00:03:33.430> some

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
my own accord I think last year at some

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.289 
my own accord I think last year at some
point<00:03:33.880> a<00:03:34.030> case<00:03:34.810> for<00:03:35.320> my<00:03:35.440> galaxy<00:03:35.860> s3<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.459> the

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
point a case for my galaxy s3 and the

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.390 
point a case for my galaxy s3 and the
edge<00:03:37.450> was<00:03:37.720> a<00:03:37.750> little<00:03:38.049> bit<00:03:38.140> loose<00:03:38.410> on<00:03:38.709> but<00:03:39.310> it

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
edge was a little bit loose on but it

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.800 
edge was a little bit loose on but it
looks<00:03:39.610> like<00:03:39.670> they've<00:03:39.880> really<00:03:40.209> redone<00:03:40.690> the

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
looks like they've really redone the

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.500 
looks like they've really redone the
design<00:03:41.170> and<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:42.459> it's<00:03:42.670> just<00:03:42.880> perfect<00:03:43.180> now<00:03:43.450> I

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
design and and it's just perfect now I

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.759 
design and and it's just perfect now I
can't<00:03:43.750> say<00:03:43.870> enough<00:03:43.900> good<00:03:44.079> stuff<00:03:44.320> about<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.739> I

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
can't say enough good stuff about and I

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.199 
can't say enough good stuff about and I
just<00:03:44.950> think<00:03:45.130> it<00:03:45.220> looks<00:03:45.370> so<00:03:45.610> like<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:45.970> color

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
just think it looks so like the color

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.569 
just think it looks so like the color
looks<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:46.630> perfect<00:03:46.989> in<00:03:47.920> contract<00:03:48.340> with<00:03:48.459> the

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
looks so perfect in contract with the

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.940 
looks so perfect in contract with the
black<00:03:48.820> phone<00:03:49.570> there<00:03:49.870> anyways<00:03:50.650> like<00:03:50.799> I
