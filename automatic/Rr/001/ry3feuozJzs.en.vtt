00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.730
 hello i am i like to take and also 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.690
 pretty long and i want cawley 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:16.299
 I would like to learn sewing very well 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.210
 and I am a beginner and a community so far 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.740
 we are the target fabric team and 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.150
 of course, because we want the bike 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.699
 make the world a bit easier and 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.250
 show you how simple things very 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.750
 can implement quickly and thus would 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.750
 I say have fun watching 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.440
 I would like to make diaper beauty 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.910
 that is if the historical the 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.770
 Wickel documents to which we later still 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.880
 but I want to come 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.219
 like to know how to do this 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.600
 insane plastic wipes 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:01:08.310
 particles can not miss not 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:01:12.090
 so you can pack so wonderfully 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:16.330
 well so what can i do like the things here 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.459
 clean as the hot yes I would 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.959
 it even folding as winding the 

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:21.310
 wipes no idea what you can 

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:23.110
 you definitely creative here 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.420
 let off steam so that means that you are 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.979
 Now you can tinker with everyone here 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.610
 Of course, playing stuff is great as well 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.869
 can you handle best or you best 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.369
 can the season on the fabric de 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:39.369
 order yes of course you can too 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.700
 the popular handkerchief bag with it 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.700
 do 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.920
 I show me how to do the white 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.300
 could be with the different formats 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.410
 Do all the nutrients if you once 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.690
 the principle understood 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.790
 franzis iss also stored for the city 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.380
 rattle and instruction you can 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.140
 The counter is always listening to everything 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.510
 Now how to do that so step 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.250
 1 you mean only two pieces 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:10.710
 Fabric is one of them a bit longer than 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:13.890
 the other one you put behind the mask 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.209
 and this cut guide though 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.450
 really fit that i do not want any now 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.550
 bags is the fabric of the ok because it - 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.970
 how exactly do I say that now 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.750
 This example is almost two pieces 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.700
 Plug 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.560
 Do you put upright on the right side that is called the 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.540
 beautiful side inside each other 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.890
 from this next with a centimeter 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.110
 distance the side cm distance this side 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:43.110
 then crashed so exactly and then you have 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:46.320
 So here you see when it will be 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.769
 you overthrow that and so did that 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.510
 on the right and on the left one emerges 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.550
 that's the end of it when you are 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.070
 now as here a deco band 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.340
 then you want to do that 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:02.160
 now and / or the next step is 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.080
 that you see here 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.580
 Here I once put down and 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.470
 Here me just put under and the 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:14.370
 side with a zigzag stitch 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:17.090
 silvered and the side and then comes 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.090
 As a third step , this part is done 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.090
 and 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:34.900
 they say that and so, and then you're stuck 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:36.819
 the fixed and next here and here 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.739
 the two short times again with 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.680
 one centimeter he was stuck with 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.599
 Adjustments inserted stitch so map 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.330
 stings and realizes here 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.040
 little with the formula 1 do not pass 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.620
 apart from that they are here 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.680
 is fixed and then shortened the whole 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.400
 and get these bags so feasible 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.400
 again very short step only 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.739
 remaining he cut of a short 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.329
 something a bit longer side me 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.450
 right on the right for me 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:10.120
 together and as a free 2 is drews 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.590
 I would like the center in welcome 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.209
 that a little bit apart that 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.750
 Here are these pages emerge and approach 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:21.070
 then stop again steppe down with six 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.780
 Stitch and then I turn back the 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.520
 nice site on the nice side because 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.270
 it is supposed to be supported later 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.820
 how does that work and do it here? 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.490
 these for the opening phase are the 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.810
 make festive back and forth, and drews 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.020
 then I have this here 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.220
 ideally in the size in the me 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.220
 usually rausholen in front of Stecher 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.340
 have fun easily while watching and 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.340
 Here we go
