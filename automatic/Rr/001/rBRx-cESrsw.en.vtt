00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.780
 What could be better than having fun in an amusement park? Being happy 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.450
 town. Chris Sawyer, a Scottish developer and a well-known father knows this 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.660
 we already have the Transport Tycoon series and the object of our retro review. RollerCoaster 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.510
 Tycoon 2 is a simulation game in which we take control over the happy one 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.970
 town. The goal of the game is to build using limited resources 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.710
 self-sufficient theme park and develop it while maximizing it 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.270
 contentment of visitors. The game was presented in a projection 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.770
 isometric and was in a straight line a sequel to being based on the same 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.980
 the Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 engine, issued in 1999. 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.020
 At first glance, it can be stated that the RCT interface and style is inspired 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.170
 he was the previous creation of Mr. Sawyer. When in the late 90s of the twentieth century to shops 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.750
 hit the first part, the graphics were already archaic. In 2002, when he appeared on the shelves 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.020
 sequel, she even rode dinosaurs. And yet she gotten brilliant reviews, because 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.700
 where she was ailing in terms of graphics, she definitely made up for it 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.130
 playability. What always made the most impression on me is how 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.220
 despite its two-dimensional nature, the game allowed us to operate in 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.110
 three-dimensional space. Of course, lazy players can take advantage of 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.460
 ready-made templates, but real engineers have the option 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.440
 hand-built tracks for your roller coasters. It's not 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.730
 simple task, because the queue too boring or intense will deter potential 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.530
 guests, but the satisfaction of creating the project is amazing. As 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.710
 the important thing about setting the attractions is keeping contentment 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.830
 visitors. We need to make sure that they have access to toilets, stores from 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.950
 food, rubbish bins and benches, otherwise they hide the wallets into their pockets and 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.400
 they will come back home. We must also take care of your promotion by purchasing campaigns 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.030
 advertising and encouraging buyers with low prices. But this is just the beginning, 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.510
 because we can not forget about employing cleaners, bodyguards, 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.030
 mechanics who will repair the attractions, adjust each of the queues 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.000
 to our needs, thematic decorating our park and so on. 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.460
 The lunapark manager has no time to rest. 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.570
 The big advantage of the game is despite its complexity and its affordability. Down 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.680
 we have dozens of advanced tools for you 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.560
 demanding, but even players who just want to sit down and click, without 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.440
 the problem will be found in its simple interface. Sometimes the places are too simple, 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.980
 the best example is the main menu from which we can choose only 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.070
 start the game or tutorial, load it started earlier 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.730
 gameplay, jump into the option or leave the title. Rollercoaster is suffering 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.470
 for the lack of campaign mode - we have dozens of scenarios to choose from 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.230
 some inspired by real theme parks, as well as the sandbox mode 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.670
 allowing you to play without limits. 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.760
 And there are also music and sound effects. These, I admit without beating, 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.960
 they cry for heaven to vengeance. The game itself does not contain background music, 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.400
 but each of the attractions we build gives us the choice to run 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.990
 one of many thematic and typical paths for funfairs. For 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.120
 climate in the ears we will also be shouting the passengers of the queues, the noise 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.990
 talking strollers and a mechanical thud 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.240
 wagons. Such a mix means that after a few minutes we completely sink into 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.900
 experience and on our own skin we experience this specific heavy and 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.840
 noisy atmosphere. 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.140
 The only functionality I have always missed was due to 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.950
 the two-dimensional nature of the title was the ability to jump into the queue and drive around 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.490
 from the passenger's perspective. He could do it a lot of Theme Park World as well 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.230
 three-dimensional RollerCoaster Tycoon 3. However, the last one lacked much 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.490
 to his older two-dimensional brothers and he was definitely from the trilogy 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.640
 the weakest. 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.560
 The second RollerCoaster has two additions, Wacky Worlds and Time 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.540
 Twister. These offered players new scenarios, stylistic elements and 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.120
 the queue. There is also a new version of the series: RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.670
 for the Nintendo 3DS console, which premiere is expected at the end 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.570
 2012. 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.020
 If you want to experience the atmosphere of a funfair without 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.190
 having to leave the house and vomit on the pavement, RollerCoaster 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.640
 Tycoon 2 is an almost perfect solution and absorbs even after 10 years 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.050
 without change. 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.060
 Ah, and let's not forget about my favorite game. 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:37.730
