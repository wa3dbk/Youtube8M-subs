you're welcome salutations oh look this
fish<00:02:01.510> has<00:02:01.540> that's<00:02:02.020> about<00:02:02.350> solid<00:02:02.890> waste<00:02:03.160> on<00:02:03.490> it

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
fish has that's about solid waste on it

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.040 
fish has that's about solid waste on it
first<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:05.620> burn<00:02:05.980> the<00:02:06.190> solid<00:02:06.610> waste<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.240> then

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
first you burn the solid waste and then

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.310 
first you burn the solid waste and then
it<00:02:08.440> gets<00:02:09.100> turned<00:02:09.460> into<00:02:09.670> energy<00:02:09.869> much<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.170> same

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
it gets turned into energy much the same

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.030 
it gets turned into energy much the same
way<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:13.660> fossil<00:02:14.080> fuels<00:02:14.350> is<00:02:14.590> turned<00:02:14.830> into

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
way that fossil fuels is turned into

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:40.740 
way that fossil fuels is turned into
energy<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.920> go<00:02:24.490> away<00:02:24.910> Oh

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750

nice help does someone need help oh
thank<00:02:51.230> god<00:02:51.530> it's<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.630> alternate<00:02:53.630> energy

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
thank god it's the alternate energy

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.500 
thank god it's the alternate energy
source<00:02:54.380> of<00:02:54.560> solid<00:02:55.070> waste<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.850> way<00:02:56.180> much

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
source of solid waste is the way much

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.180 
source of solid waste is the way much
better<00:02:56.690> than<00:02:57.080> any<00:02:57.260> other<00:02:57.500> alternative<00:02:57.740> energy

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
better than any other alternative energy
