this is bothersome

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.240 
this is bothersome
it<00:02:01.660> could<00:02:01.869> be<00:02:01.990> trimmed<00:02:02.259> off<00:02:02.410> but<00:02:02.830> it<00:02:02.920> does<00:02:03.100> not

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
it could be trimmed off but it does not

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.020 
it could be trimmed off but it does not
affect<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.850> vehicle<00:02:04.420> in<00:02:04.509> any<00:02:04.690> way<00:02:06.030> so

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
affect the vehicle in any way so

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.430 
affect the vehicle in any way so
basically<00:02:07.330> what<00:02:07.539> it<00:02:07.630> comes<00:02:07.660> down<00:02:07.990> to<00:02:08.050> is<00:02:08.289> of

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
basically what it comes down to is of

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.220
