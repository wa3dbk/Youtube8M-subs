with us it'd be kind of fun to watch and
run<00:01:50.250> around<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.759> be<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> noob<00:01:51.180> because<00:01:51.450> I'm

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
run around and be a noob because I'm

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.030 
run around and be a noob because I'm
pretty<00:01:51.659> sure<00:01:51.930> he<00:01:52.049> has<00:01:52.259> very<00:01:52.530> little<00:01:52.740> knowledge

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
pretty sure he has very little knowledge

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.609 
pretty sure he has very little knowledge
of<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.610> Minecraft<00:01:54.000> world<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:55.470> would<00:01:55.560> be

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
of the Minecraft world and that would be

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.920 
of the Minecraft world and that would be
kind<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.860> fun<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.219> mess<00:01:56.670> with<00:01:56.759> him<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.840> can

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
kind of fun to mess with him and you can

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.050 
kind of fun to mess with him and you can
get<00:01:58.020> some<00:01:58.200> invisibility<00:01:58.649> potions<00:01:59.159> out<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.670> need

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
get some invisibility potions out I need

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.520 
get some invisibility potions out I need
to<00:02:00.149> have<00:02:00.240> no<00:02:00.450> clue<00:02:00.780> what<00:02:00.899> was<00:02:01.020> going<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.439> I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
to have no clue what was going on so I

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.929 
to have no clue what was going on so I
think<00:02:01.890> that's<00:02:02.159> gonna<00:02:02.280> be<00:02:02.340> fun<00:02:02.549> once<00:02:02.729> we<00:02:02.850> get

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
think that's gonna be fun once we get

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.190 
think that's gonna be fun once we get
him<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.149> there<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.780> will<00:02:03.840> probably<00:02:03.990> happen

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
him on there so it will probably happen

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.139 
him on there so it will probably happen
someday<00:02:04.530> I'm<00:02:04.770> not<00:02:04.920> sure<00:02:05.100> when<00:02:05.280> but<00:02:05.490> I'll<00:02:05.939> try

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
someday I'm not sure when but I'll try

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.540 
someday I'm not sure when but I'll try
to<00:02:06.649> expedite<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.129> get<00:02:08.250> them<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.429> there

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
to expedite that and get them on there

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.190 
to expedite that and get them on there
