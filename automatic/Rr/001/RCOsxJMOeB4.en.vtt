blue airlines and today we're taking a
look<00:00:10.509> at<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:12.070> run<00:00:12.369> cam<00:00:12.700> fpv<00:00:13.419> camera<00:00:13.900> now<00:00:14.199> this

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 
look at the run cam fpv camera now this

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.560 
look at the run cam fpv camera now this
is<00:00:14.379> by<00:00:14.589> security-camera<00:00:15.129> 2000<00:00:16.119> it's<00:00:16.330> their

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
is by security-camera 2000 it's their

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.109 
is by security-camera 2000 it's their
line<00:00:16.810> of<00:00:16.990> fpv<00:00:17.470> cameras<00:00:17.949> that<00:00:18.730> they've<00:00:18.910> now

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
line of fpv cameras that they've now

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.290 
line of fpv cameras that they've now
renamed<00:00:19.630> as<00:00:19.960> the<00:00:20.170> run<00:00:20.500> cam<00:00:20.890> line<00:00:21.300> this

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
renamed as the run cam line this

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.890 
renamed as the run cam line this
particular<00:00:22.630> camera<00:00:23.050> is<00:00:23.320> the<00:00:23.500> pzo<00:00:23.919> for<00:00:24.369> 20<00:00:24.900> h

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
particular camera is the pzo for 20 h

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.950 
particular camera is the pzo for 20 h
and<00:00:26.710> what's<00:00:27.429> different<00:00:27.490> is<00:00:28.060> this<00:00:28.720> is<00:00:28.929> a

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
and what's different is this is a

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.120 
and what's different is this is a
plastic<00:00:29.740> housing<00:00:30.189> now<00:00:31.770> versus<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:32.920> standard

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
plastic housing now versus the standard

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.340 
plastic housing now versus the standard
metal<00:00:33.580> housing<00:00:33.850> that<00:00:34.180> you<00:00:34.300> could<00:00:34.480> get<00:00:34.660> with

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
metal housing that you could get with

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.480 
metal housing that you could get with
some<00:00:35.500> of<00:00:35.590> these<00:00:35.650> cameras<00:00:36.040> so<00:00:36.190> you're<00:00:36.310> going<00:00:36.400> to

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.490 
some of these cameras so you're going to

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.470 
some of these cameras so you're going to
definitely<00:00:36.670> drop<00:00:37.030> some<00:00:37.060> weight<00:00:37.590> without

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
definitely drop some weight without

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.690 
definitely drop some weight without
sacrificing<00:00:40.480> still<00:00:41.260> some<00:00:41.650> safety<00:00:42.520> and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
sacrificing still some safety and

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.490 
sacrificing still some safety and
protection<00:00:42.820> for<00:00:43.300> the<00:00:43.360> camera<00:00:43.750> so<00:00:44.290> let's<00:00:44.410> go

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
protection for the camera so let's go

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.440 
protection for the camera so let's go
ahead<00:00:44.530> and<00:00:44.710> set<00:00:45.070> it<00:00:45.190> on<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.730> scale<00:00:46.060> and<00:00:46.270> let's

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
ahead and set it on the scale and let's

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.900 
ahead and set it on the scale and let's
see<00:00:46.630> what<00:00:46.810> it<00:00:46.930> weighs<00:00:47.080> out<00:00:47.350> at<00:00:47.910> differently

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
see what it weighs out at differently

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.090 
see what it weighs out at differently
between<00:00:49.060> the<00:00:49.300> two<00:00:49.480> all<00:00:50.260> right<00:00:50.500> so<00:00:50.680> here's<00:00:50.710> the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
between the two all right so here's the

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.770 
between the two all right so here's the
metal<00:00:51.400> housing<00:00:51.610> now<00:00:52.180> this<00:00:52.330> does<00:00:52.570> have<00:00:52.750> a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
metal housing now this does have a

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.800 
metal housing now this does have a
slightly<00:00:53.170> smaller<00:00:53.380> lens<00:00:53.980> as<00:00:54.220> the<00:00:54.460> 2.8<00:00:55.060> and<00:00:55.360> I'm

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
slightly smaller lens as the 2.8 and I'm

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.860 
slightly smaller lens as the 2.8 and I'm
going<00:00:55.930> to<00:00:55.990> be<00:00:56.050> testing<00:00:56.380> the<00:00:56.440> other<00:00:56.590> one<00:00:56.710> with<00:00:56.860> a

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
going to be testing the other one with a

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.020 
going to be testing the other one with a
2.1<00:00:58.870> lens<00:00:59.110> so<00:00:59.380> this<00:00:59.500> is<00:00:59.620> one<00:00:59.800> point<00:01:00.040> six<00:01:00.430> ounces

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
2.1 lens so this is one point six ounces

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.720 
2.1 lens so this is one point six ounces
with<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:01.990> metal<00:01:02.260> housing<00:01:02.470> and<00:01:02.950> a<00:01:03.430> little<00:01:03.640> bit

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
with the metal housing and a little bit

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.970 
with the metal housing and a little bit
of<00:01:03.760> velcro<00:01:04.000> of<00:01:04.629> a<00:01:04.750> duct<00:01:04.989> tape<00:01:05.230> all<00:01:05.590> right<00:01:05.710> go

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
of velcro of a duct tape all right go

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.530 
of velcro of a duct tape all right go
ahead<00:01:06.010> and<00:01:06.220> put<00:01:06.370> down<00:01:06.550> the<00:01:06.760> new<00:01:06.880> run<00:01:07.150> can

have pivot great you got that included
and<00:01:55.510> then<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.320> comes<00:01:56.500> with<00:01:56.799> the<00:01:56.920> wiring

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
and then it comes with the wiring

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.640 
and then it comes with the wiring
harness<00:01:57.580> bag<00:01:57.850> and<00:01:58.240> what<00:01:58.960> looks<00:01:59.110> to<00:01:59.260> be<00:01:59.350> also

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
harness bag and what looks to be also

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.590 
harness bag and what looks to be also
maybe<00:01:59.920> an<00:02:00.070> hour<00:02:00.400> block<00:02:00.640> sensor<00:02:01.060> there's<00:02:01.420> no
