00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
gaming here so that's why white played

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.640

h4 and checkmate

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.280 
h4 and checkmate
that's<00:01:53.470> why<00:01:53.710> white<00:01:54.190> played<00:01:54.490> Queen<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.570> g4

that rook must take here and after that

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.280 
that rook must take here and after that
we<00:02:23.290> have<00:02:23.470> this<00:02:23.620> brilliant<00:02:24.600> combination<00:02:25.600> rook

queen<00:02:32.739> and<00:02:32.980> rook<00:02:33.630> so<00:02:34.630> probably<00:02:36.450> white<00:02:37.450> saw

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
queen and rook so probably white saw
