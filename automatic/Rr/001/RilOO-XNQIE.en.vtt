Rises on here from dream West record a

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.980 
Rises on here from dream West record a
UK<00:00:20.990> and<00:00:21.170> in<00:00:21.770> a<00:00:21.830> previous<00:00:22.220> video<00:00:22.400> of<00:00:22.700> mine<00:00:23.030> about

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
UK and in a previous video of mine about

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.350 
UK and in a previous video of mine about
how<00:00:24.410> to<00:00:24.470> use<00:00:24.650> Windows<00:00:25.130> 7<00:00:25.490> God<00:00:25.700> modes<00:00:26.000> I

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
how to use Windows 7 God modes I

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.320 
how to use Windows 7 God modes I
stumbled<00:00:27.200> across<00:00:27.290> something<00:00:28.220> but<00:00:28.670> an<00:00:29.000> option

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
stumbled across something but an option

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.359 
stumbled across something but an option
will<00:00:29.450> allow<00:00:29.600> you<00:00:29.660> to<00:00:30.140> handle<00:00:30.369> biometric

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
will allow you to handle biometric

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.310 
will allow you to handle biometric
devices<00:00:31.790> which<00:00:32.540> are<00:00:32.689> basically<00:00:33.020> like

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
devices which are basically like

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.650 
devices which are basically like
fingerprint<00:00:34.130> readers<00:00:34.490> and<00:00:34.670> I<00:00:35.180> had<00:00:35.360> no<00:00:35.630> idea

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
fingerprint readers and I had no idea

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.750 
fingerprint readers and I had no idea
that<00:00:36.350> you<00:00:36.470> could<00:00:36.590> actually<00:00:36.829> hook<00:00:37.400> up<00:00:37.640> a

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
that you could actually hook up a

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.840 
that you could actually hook up a
fingerprint<00:00:38.450> reader<00:00:38.740> to<00:00:39.740> am<00:00:40.010> calm<00:00:40.370> your

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
fingerprint reader to am calm your

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.580 
fingerprint reader to am calm your
computer<00:00:41.300> and<00:00:41.360> use<00:00:41.570> it<00:00:41.780> with<00:00:41.930> Windows<00:00:42.200> to

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
computer and use it with Windows to

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.590 
computer and use it with Windows to
login<00:00:42.800> and<00:00:43.100> whatnot<00:00:43.489> so<00:00:44.030> I<00:00:44.060> thought<00:00:44.420> I<00:00:44.450> would

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
login and whatnot so I thought I would

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.660 
login and whatnot so I thought I would
but<00:00:44.960> you<00:00:45.110> sounded<00:00:45.410> really<00:00:45.440> cool<00:00:45.829> so<00:00:46.100> I<00:00:46.340> had

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
but you sounded really cool so I had

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.130 
but you sounded really cool so I had
look<00:00:46.880> online<00:00:47.030> I<00:00:47.239> came<00:00:47.570> across<00:00:47.690> something

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
look online I came across something

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.689 
look online I came across something
called<00:00:48.620> a<00:00:48.829> digital<00:00:49.550> persona<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:51.370> yeah<00:00:52.370> it's

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
called a digital persona and yeah it's

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.790 
called a digital persona and yeah it's
basically<00:00:53.059> a<00:00:53.180> fingerprint<00:00:53.809> reader<00:00:53.930> but<00:00:54.649> it's

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
basically a fingerprint reader but it's

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.799 
basically a fingerprint reader but it's
compatible<00:00:55.190> with<00:00:55.550> Windows<00:00:56.000> as<00:00:56.210> far<00:00:56.420> as<00:00:56.539> I<00:00:56.600> know

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
compatible with Windows as far as I know

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.680 
compatible with Windows as far as I know
and<00:00:57.079> basically<00:00:58.059> it's<00:00:59.059> just<00:00:59.239> so<00:00:59.480> what<00:00:59.600> you

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
and basically it's just so what you

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.290 
and basically it's just so what you
don't<00:00:59.840> if<00:01:00.079> you<00:01:00.399> don't<00:01:01.399> have<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:01.969> great<00:01:02.120> memory

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
don't if you don't have a great memory

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.060 
don't if you don't have a great memory
whatever<00:01:02.600> if<00:01:02.929> you<00:01:03.050> have<00:01:03.140> lots<00:01:03.350> of<00:01:03.530> passwords

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
whatever if you have lots of passwords

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.800 
whatever if you have lots of passwords
and<00:01:04.280> you<00:01:04.340> forget<00:01:04.640> them<00:01:04.820> often<00:01:05.180> you<00:01:05.690> could

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
and you forget them often you could

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.620 
and you forget them often you could
substitute<00:01:06.140> that<00:01:06.740> for<00:01:07.010> this<00:01:07.640> a<00:01:07.700> fingerprint

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
substitute that for this a fingerprint

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.860 
substitute that for this a fingerprint
reader<00:01:08.690> so<00:01:10.090> basically<00:01:11.090> just<00:01:11.240> put<00:01:11.450> your<00:01:11.540> finger

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
reader so basically just put your finger

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.540 
reader so basically just put your finger
on<00:01:11.930> man<00:01:12.170> you<00:01:12.380> log<00:01:12.770> straight<00:01:13.100> links<00:01:13.430> it

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
on man you log straight links it

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.030 
on man you log straight links it
recognizes<00:01:14.270> here<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:14.630> I<00:01:15.050> think<00:01:15.380> that<00:01:15.530> I'm

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
recognizes here and I think that I'm

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.820 
recognizes here and I think that I'm
 paid<00:01:16.730> that<00:01:17.230> do<00:01:18.230> this<00:01:18.410> video<00:01:18.740> or

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
 paid that do this video or

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.929 
 paid that do this video or
anything<00:01:19.100> molecular<00:01:19.550> by<00:01:19.700> that<00:01:19.850> I<00:01:19.880> just

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
anything molecular by that I just

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.340 
anything molecular by that I just
thought<00:01:20.180> this<00:01:20.329> was<00:01:20.479> really<00:01:20.659> cool<00:01:20.869> came<00:01:21.140> across

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
thought this was really cool came across

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.050 
thought this was really cool came across
it<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:21.979> I<00:01:22.009> thought<00:01:22.220> I<00:01:22.280> would<00:01:22.549> share<00:01:22.790> with<00:01:22.850> you

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
it and I thought I would share with you

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.679 
it and I thought I would share with you
guys<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:23.530> it's<00:01:24.530> 72<00:01:25.159> pounds<00:01:25.790> which<00:01:26.210> is<00:01:26.240> very

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.929 

quick<00:01:29.689> so<00:01:30.320> it<00:01:30.619> is<00:01:30.799> all<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:30.979> little<00:01:31.520> expensive

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
quick so it is all a little expensive

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.480 
quick so it is all a little expensive
but<00:01:32.420> at<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:32.810> same<00:01:32.930> time<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:33.500> is<00:01:33.619> it<00:01:34.070> does<00:01:34.310> look

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
but at the same time it is it does look

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.160 
but at the same time it is it does look
up<00:01:34.640> pretty<00:01:34.850> cool<00:01:35.119> for<00:01:35.630> me<00:01:35.780> I<00:01:35.810> would<00:01:36.020> have

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
up pretty cool for me I would have

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.499 
up pretty cool for me I would have
absolutely<00:01:36.320> no<00:01:36.829> need<00:01:37.100> of<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:37.490> no<00:01:37.909> need<00:01:38.149> for<00:01:38.390> this

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
absolutely no need of a no need for this

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:39.130 
absolutely no need of a no need for this
device

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
device

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.660 
device
but<00:01:40.299> either<00:01:41.299> way<00:01:41.540> came<00:01:42.229> across<00:01:42.439> it<00:01:42.770> like<00:01:43.009> below

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
but either way came across it like below

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.670 
but either way came across it like below
prevent<00:01:43.939> others<00:01:44.060> so<00:01:44.329> I'll<00:01:44.450> share<00:01:44.719> with<00:01:44.899> you<00:01:45.049> so

let's<00:02:00.140> combat<00:02:00.500> with<00:02:00.649> windows<00:02:01.159> so<00:02:01.340> that<00:02:01.460> you

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
let's combat with windows so that you

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:02.950 
let's combat with windows so that you
don't<00:02:01.729> need<00:02:01.789> to<00:02:01.850> remember<00:02:02.149> passwords<00:02:02.630> anymore

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
don't need to remember passwords anymore

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.539 
don't need to remember passwords anymore
you<00:02:03.049> just<00:02:03.079> put<00:02:03.500> your<00:02:03.619> finger<00:02:03.890> on<00:02:03.950> man<00:02:04.189> you<00:02:04.399> get

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
you just put your finger on man you get

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.630 
you just put your finger on man you get
log<00:02:04.729> straight<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:06.070> I'm<00:02:07.070> sure<00:02:07.280> for<00:02:07.430> most

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
log straight and I'm sure for most
