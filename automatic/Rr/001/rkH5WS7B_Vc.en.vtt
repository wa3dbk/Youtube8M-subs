know<00:00:46.530> kind<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.770> disassembled<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:48.180> gonna

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
know kind of disassembled just gonna

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.610 
know kind of disassembled just gonna
reassemble<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.020> I'll<00:00:49.079> go<00:00:49.230> through<00:00:49.410> some<00:00:49.590> of

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
reassemble it so I'll go through some of

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.110 
reassemble it so I'll go through some of
the<00:00:49.710> parts<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.309> comes<00:00:50.460> with<00:00:50.579> again<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
the parts that it comes with again the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.020 
the parts that it comes with again the
instruction<00:00:51.570> manual<00:00:53.239> again<00:00:56.000> most<00:00:57.000> people

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
instruction manual again most people

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.459 
instruction manual again most people
usually<00:00:57.270> do<00:00:57.539> we<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:57.780> throw<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.050> away

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
usually do we just throw that away

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.950 
usually do we just throw that away

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
we'll go over the installation and you

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.070 
we'll go over the installation and you
know<00:01:06.360> all<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.659> detailed<00:01:07.110> stuff<00:01:07.939> coming<00:01:08.939> up

that's<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.229> press<00:01:16.820> it's<00:01:17.820> got<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.030> arm<00:01:18.210> there

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
that's the press it's got the arm there

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.890 
that's the press it's got the arm there
and<00:01:19.979> all<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.520> kind<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.600> know<00:01:21.689> needs

and all this is kind of you know needs

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.100 
and all this is kind of you know needs
to<00:01:22.020> be<00:01:22.140> assembled<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:23.780> we're<00:01:24.780> getting<00:01:24.900> that

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
to be assembled so we're getting that

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.039 
to be assembled so we're getting that
later<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.920> as<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.369> see<00:01:26.580> here<00:01:26.930> it's<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
later so as you can see here it's the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.289 
later so as you can see here it's the
classic<00:01:28.290> cast<00:01:28.740> press<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> longest

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
classic cast press and the longest

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.230 
classic cast press and the longest
stroke<00:01:30.720> four<00:01:31.409> inch<00:01:32.180> stroke<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> arm<00:01:33.689> there

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
stroke four inch stroke on the arm there

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.789 
stroke four inch stroke on the arm there
supposedly<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.900> think<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.320> looked<00:01:37.500> at<00:01:37.650> some

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
supposedly I think I looked at some

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.469 
supposedly I think I looked at some
other<00:01:37.950> presses<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.960> about<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> 3.75<00:01:41.070> inch

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
other presses and about a 3.75 inch

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.260 
other presses and about a 3.75 inch
something

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
something

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.980 
something
so<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.480> just<00:01:45.600> wasn't<00:01:45.900> uh<00:01:47.060> wasn't<00:01:48.060> really<00:01:48.870> what

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
so it just wasn't uh wasn't really what

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.300 
so it just wasn't uh wasn't really what
I<00:01:49.020> needed<00:01:49.260> and<00:01:49.440> especially<00:01:49.710> because<00:01:49.950> I'm

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
I needed and especially because I'm

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.160 
I needed and especially because I'm
trying<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.700> load<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> magazine<00:01:51.240> length<00:01:51.780> which

a<00:02:51.720> teeny<00:02:52.680> piece<00:02:52.860> there<00:02:53.070> so<00:02:53.700> that's<00:02:53.820> convenient

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
a teeny piece there so that's convenient

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.570 
a teeny piece there so that's convenient
can't<00:02:55.140> attach<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.709> actually<00:02:56.070> see<00:02:56.459> the

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
can't attach that and actually see the

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.720 
can't attach that and actually see the
primers<00:02:56.940> as<00:02:57.300> you<00:02:58.220> as<00:02:59.220> you're<00:02:59.400> going<00:02:59.430> about

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
primers as you as you're going about

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.630 
primers as you as you're going about
your<00:02:59.790> business<00:03:00.390> here<00:03:01.190> unfortunately<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.580> don't

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
your business here unfortunately I don't

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.760 
your business here unfortunately I don't
think<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:03.360> works<00:03:03.660> with<00:03:04.110> exactly<00:03:04.590> what<00:03:04.709> I'm

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
think that works with exactly what I'm

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.320 
think that works with exactly what I'm
looking<00:03:05.430> at<00:03:05.520> so<00:03:05.580> I<00:03:05.760> might<00:03:05.940> have<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.180> get<00:03:06.270> a

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
looking at so I might have to get a

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.940 
looking at so I might have to get a
different<00:03:06.480> one<00:03:06.690> one<00:03:06.989> this<00:03:07.620> is<00:03:07.800> the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
different one one this is the

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.380 
different one one this is the
breech-lock<00:03:08.550> bushings<00:03:08.970> he's<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.150> really

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
breech-lock bushings he's a really

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.540 
breech-lock bushings he's a really
convenient<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:10.050> can<00:03:10.200> actually<00:03:10.380> swap<00:03:11.220> them<00:03:11.430> in

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
convenient you can actually swap them in

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.310 
convenient you can actually swap them in
and<00:03:11.700> out<00:03:11.820> so<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.120> don't<00:03:12.270> have<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.600> keep

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
and out so you don't have to keep
