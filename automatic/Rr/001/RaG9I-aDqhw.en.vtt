dialog box I'll take a brief look at
some<00:00:28.810> of<00:00:28.900> these<00:00:28.990> little<00:00:29.470> going<00:00:29.769> through<00:00:30.039> I

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:30.339 
some of these little going through I

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.670 
some of these little going through I

felt like if these tapes as I've placed
on<00:00:32.890> plan<00:00:33.190> then<00:00:33.610> it<00:00:33.730> do<00:00:33.879> look<00:00:34.030> different<00:00:34.300> but

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
on plan then it do look different but

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.529 
on plan then it do look different but
it's<00:00:35.289> kinda<00:00:35.590> hard<00:00:35.739> to<00:00:35.949> tell<00:00:36.090> really<00:00:37.090> what<00:00:37.420> is

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539

good on with these until we take a look
at<00:00:39.579> 3d<00:00:40.199> so<00:00:41.199> here<00:00:41.350> we<00:00:41.410> can<00:00:41.440> see<00:00:41.680> the<00:00:41.710> handrail

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
at 3d so here we can see the handrail

traditional tape I don't take a look at
stay<00:00:48.640> up<00:00:48.789> because<00:00:49.059> I<00:00:49.149> was<00:00:49.269> typically<00:00:49.600> where<00:00:49.719> r

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
stay up because I was typically where r

stay up because I was typically where r
elings<00:00:50.109> are<00:00:50.230> placed<00:00:50.469> we'll<00:00:51.100> take<00:00:51.309> this<00:00:51.519> and<00:00:51.850> a

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
elings are placed we'll take this and a

elings are placed we'll take this and a
lot<00:00:52.120> of<00:00:52.180> reeling<00:00:52.600> to<00:00:52.840> it<00:00:53.019> and<00:00:53.199> the<00:00:53.739> process<00:00:54.100> for

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
lot of reeling to it and the process for

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.250 
lot of reeling to it and the process for
that<00:00:54.370> is<00:00:54.489> pretty<00:00:54.699> simple<00:00:54.879> we<00:00:55.359> grab<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:55.780> arrow

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
that is pretty simple we grab the arrow

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.799 
that is pretty simple we grab the arrow
tool<00:00:56.530> or<00:00:56.829> hold<00:00:57.039> down<00:00:57.190> shift<00:00:57.460> and<00:00:57.609> click<00:00:57.850> but<00:00:58.690> we

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.300 
45ml Wade's the rails themselves let's
change<00:01:46.840> these<00:01:47.080> two<00:01:47.260> rectangular<00:01:48.570> 20<00:01:49.570> by<00:01:49.720> 20

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
change these two rectangular 20 by 20

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.310 
change these two rectangular 20 by 20
what<00:01:51.310> we'll<00:01:51.430> do<00:01:51.610> is<00:01:51.880> increase<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:52.840> number

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
what we'll do is increase the number

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.490 
what we'll do is increase the number
from<00:01:53.800> four<00:01:54.190> to<00:01:54.580> six<00:01:54.760> and<00:01:55.510> then<00:01:55.870> the<00:01:55.990> final<00:01:56.140> part

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
from four to six and then the final part

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.700 
from four to six and then the final part
is<00:01:56.860> simple<00:01:57.730> settings<00:01:58.150> so<00:01:58.480> if<00:01:58.990> we<00:01:59.260> want<00:01:59.380> to<00:01:59.500> have

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
is simple settings so if we want to have

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.290 
is simple settings so if we want to have
the<00:02:00.040> handrail<00:02:00.370> thickness<00:02:00.730> of<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:00.940> center

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
the handrail thickness of the center

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.940 
the handrail thickness of the center
line<00:02:01.450> visible<00:02:01.930> there's<00:02:02.200> also<00:02:02.350> options<00:02:02.800> here

you put the most towards the middle on
both<00:02:49.010> sides<00:02:49.340> in<00:02:49.640> this<00:02:50.239> case<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.780> only<00:02:51.110> actually

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
both sides in this case I only actually

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.110 
both sides in this case I only actually
want<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.709> right-hand<00:02:52.069> side<00:02:52.160> so<00:02:52.849> all<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:52.970> those

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
want the right-hand side so all of those

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.050 
want the right-hand side so all of those
click<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:54.349> handrail<00:02:54.680> is<00:02:54.769> placed<00:02:55.040> if<00:02:55.910> I

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
click and the handrail is placed if I

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.509 
click and the handrail is placed if I
select<00:02:56.299> this<00:02:56.480> lot<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:57.709> have<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:57.890> look<00:02:58.069> at<00:02:58.160> 3d

select this lot and have a look at 3d

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.300 
select this lot and have a look at 3d
you<00:02:59.060> can<00:02:59.239> see<00:02:59.420> what<00:02:59.569> I've<00:02:59.660> actually<00:02:59.810> created

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
you can see what I've actually created

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.410 
you can see what I've actually created
so<00:03:01.310> you<00:03:01.340> can<00:03:01.489> see<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.730> different<00:03:01.970> materials

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
so you can see the different materials

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.640 
so you can see the different materials
you<00:03:02.599> can<00:03:02.629> see<00:03:02.900> how<00:03:02.989> it's<00:03:03.140> actually<00:03:03.230> anchored

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
you can see how it's actually anchored

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.940 
you can see how it's actually anchored
and<00:03:04.370> what<00:03:05.000> i<00:03:05.030> can<00:03:05.209> do<00:03:05.360> is<00:03:05.390> always<00:03:05.629> pick<00:03:05.989> up<00:03:06.019> drop

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
and what i can do is always pick up drop

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.400 
and what i can do is always pick up drop
back<00:03:07.129> into<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.459> settings<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.269> if<00:03:08.930> i<00:03:09.049> want<00:03:09.230> to

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
back into the settings and if i want to

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.470 
back into the settings and if i want to
can<00:03:09.620> make<00:03:09.799> some<00:03:10.010> changes<00:03:10.430> so<00:03:11.000> maybe<00:03:11.180> under

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
can make some changes so maybe under

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.350 
can make some changes so maybe under
general<00:03:11.930> orders<00:03:12.590> will<00:03:12.799> put<00:03:12.950> a<00:03:12.980> value<00:03:13.190> on<00:03:13.370> the

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
general orders will put a value on the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.710 
general orders will put a value on the
bottom<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:15.110> off<00:03:15.410> that<00:03:15.590> goes<00:03:15.799> and<00:03:15.980> updates<00:03:16.720> to

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
bottom and off that goes and updates to

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.500 
bottom and off that goes and updates to
show<00:03:17.900> these<00:03:18.049> changes
