00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
hi my name is Michael thank you for

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.720 
hi my name is Michael thank you for
watching<00:00:10.110> my<00:00:10.200> video<00:00:10.559> tutorials<00:00:11.190> on<00:00:11.429> how

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
watching my video tutorials on how

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.350 
watching my video tutorials on how
thermostats<00:00:12.509> work<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:13.080> our<00:00:13.230> setup<00:00:14.360> today

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
thermostats work and our setup today

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.220 
thermostats work and our setup today
we're<00:00:15.630> going<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.839> talk<00:00:15.990> about<00:00:16.170> C<00:00:16.800> wires

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
we're going to talk about C wires

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.140 
we're going to talk about C wires
basically<00:00:19.250> AC<00:00:20.250> wire<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.320> a<00:00:22.320> connection<00:00:23.150> for

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
basically AC wire is a connection for

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.529 
basically AC wire is a connection for
the<00:00:24.300> power<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:25.199> between<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.859> RH<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.300> see

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
the power so between the RH and the see

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.929 
the power so between the RH and the see
you<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.529> your<00:00:28.680> power<00:00:28.920> coming<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.609> from<00:00:29.820> your

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
you have your power coming in from your

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.060 
you have your power coming in from your
system<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.779> will<00:00:30.960> power<00:00:31.140> your<00:00:31.470> thermostat

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
system that will power your thermostat

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.150 
system that will power your thermostat
that<00:00:32.969> way<00:00:33.149> if<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.989> batteries<00:00:34.380> go<00:00:34.590> dead<00:00:34.620> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
that way if the batteries go dead the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.180 
that way if the batteries go dead the
thermostat<00:00:35.670> will<00:00:35.790> stay<00:00:36.030> running<00:00:36.290> also<00:00:37.290> if<00:00:37.559> you

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
thermostat will stay running also if you

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.530 
thermostat will stay running also if you
have<00:00:38.309> something<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:38.760> your<00:00:38.820> thermostat<00:00:39.360> like<00:00:39.510> a

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
have something in your thermostat like a

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.139 
have something in your thermostat like a
radio<00:00:39.930> module<00:00:40.430> or<00:00:41.430> something<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:41.969> uses

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
radio module or something that uses

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.959 
radio module or something that uses
extra<00:00:42.780> power<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.710> will<00:00:43.890> power<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.550> without

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
extra power it will power that without

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.270 
extra power it will power that without
going<00:00:45.149> through<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.510> batteries<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.079> they

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
going through the batteries so they

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.500 
going through the batteries so they

as we have them when we hook them up
into<00:01:14.400> here<00:01:14.930> we<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.080> two<00:01:16.320> wires<00:01:16.820> we'll<00:01:17.820> take

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
into here we have two wires we'll take

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.870 
into here we have two wires we'll take
without<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:19.080> being<00:01:19.229> plugged<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.770> we'll<00:01:20.670> take

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
without it being plugged in we'll take

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.210 
without it being plugged in we'll take
one<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.330> wires<00:01:21.540> well<00:01:22.320> loosen<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.860> screw

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
one of the wires well loosen the screw

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.270 
one of the wires well loosen the screw
on<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.520> C<00:01:23.970> terminal<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.950> connect<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.070> wire

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
on the C terminal and connect the wire

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.910 
on the C terminal and connect the wire
there<00:01:28.400> we<00:01:29.400> also<00:01:29.610> already<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.750> wire<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
there we also already have a wire in the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.359 
there we also already have a wire in the
RH<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.700> we<00:01:33.119> have<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> jumper<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> RC<00:01:34.619> so

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
RH and we have a jumper to the RC so

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.700 
RH and we have a jumper to the RC so
what<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.610> can<00:01:35.790> do<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.320> leave<00:01:37.530> that

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
what we can do is we can leave that

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.190 
what we can do is we can leave that
jumper<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.280> loosen<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.360> RC<00:01:39.689> terminal<00:01:40.170> a

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
jumper in loosen the RC terminal a

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.270 
jumper in loosen the RC terminal a
little<00:01:40.470> bit<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.970> put<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.119> other<00:01:42.270> wire<00:01:43.280> in

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
little bit and put the other wire in

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.359 
little bit and put the other wire in
there<00:01:44.610> if<00:01:45.049> you<00:01:46.049> happen<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.500> connect<00:01:46.950> your<00:01:47.159> wet

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
there if you happen to connect your wet

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.090 
there if you happen to connect your wet
wire<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:48.450> your<00:01:48.630> RC<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.290> go<00:01:49.439> ahead<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.799> put<00:01:49.979> in

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
wire to your RC just go ahead and put in

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.960 
wire to your RC just go ahead and put in
the<00:01:50.189> RH<00:01:51.049> so<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.200> have<00:01:52.409> one<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.009> ends<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
the RH so we have one of the ends in the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.959 
the RH so we have one of the ends in the
C<00:01:54.210> as<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:55.020> Charlie<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.009> other<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.610> the
