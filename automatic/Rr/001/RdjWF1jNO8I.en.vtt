00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.250
 it's an incredible problem it is 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.250
 an epidemic 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.939
 [Music] 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.950
 a surgeon needs a map to 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.990
 to see how it should operate 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.580
 whether it must operate and if it operates 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:36.400
 to look up where the important 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:38.380
 structures I sit if you cut it away 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.090
 then it is broken and nerves that posted 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.920
 are no longer for you if you are too 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.440
 many of the urethra which removes 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.149
 deficit and the man is incontinent 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.100
 so you actually have to limit the damage 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.380
 and you can only do that if you like 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:56.140
 be well informed in advance by that 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:58.240
 henry's important structures is the the 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.680
 neurovascular bundle so the fathers one 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.450
 your strict who care for the potential of 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.560
 the man 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.720
 You can imagine if you are not through 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.220
 then it cuts out with the potential and 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.770
 once cut 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.780
 that never grows like the surgeon again 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.070
 know in advance where that nerve bundle 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.909
 then you can save it 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.920
 this is the cross section through the 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.590
 prostate and I have circled area here 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.509
 where in this case there is prostate cancer and 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.299
 here that arrow 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.969
 there is the nerve bundle 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.759
 and there is only room of about 1 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:34.420
 mm between you can imagine if you 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.369
 do not know that there is room what you say 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.049
 well take away that its the thunder man 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.969
 does a urologist sun damper he had to on 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.369
 his finger from behind that feels 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.229
 really you're the cure the g-team nerves 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.759
 he has to get out 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.259
 the man does not know that there is another 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.450
 Another monument is the other moment 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.639
 see this picture and then a good one 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.340
 find a surgeon who is passing by 

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:57.219
 who ransom the prostate from the 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.209
 nerve bundle if you do that you will achieve the 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:00.670
 potency 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:01.840
 you do not nestle and impotent for that 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.369
 the rest of his life 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.749
 not every man needs to be operated 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.189
 can wait 

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:08.560
 why would anyone have a prostate surgery 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.550
 undergo under this america 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.830
 say 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.590
 both men persecute and the beauty is 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.750
 if you get this fantastic mri far too 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.630
 combine with a surgeon who 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.810
 daring 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.670
 which can operate very accurately as you 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.630
 that combines then you have optimal 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.630
 ratio for patients

 the rest and the surgery or would be 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.170
 sitting there and detail service remote

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.370
 be able to see whether to the most 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.319
 precise operation and to further 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.110
 spelling and doing is

 smartec not so work from barning half 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.479
 hour model is and that's me now doing tony 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:34.770
 six hand so good g sllist holes 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:38.069
 mcafee the beautiful sustainable pu go in particular 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:41.069
 clear mri which a UMC here 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:42.779
 made the doctor jobs' em too 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:46.500
 and the collaboration that are with doctors 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:48.449
 have brought him arie 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.339
 all reason given also for the 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:53.129
 surgeon to be exactly like that 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:56.069
 perform the operation and there 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:57.990
 cutting where needed was making me 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:00.969
 ultimately no side effects and 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.639
 mine as before 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:05.529
 function it is fantastic it 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.360
 difference between a man who is impotent 

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:08.860
 and potent 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.110
 yes that's that they have to agree 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.489
 imagine a man who 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.899
 difference between incontinent and 

00:06:12.489 --> 00:06:15.249
 continents because it is not alone 

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:18.309
 here but also at the bottom with the 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:19.689
 urethra where thanks to mri whole 

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:23.559
 operates accurately 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:25.360
 this is the prostate right left he is 

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:27.610
 free to attach you only here 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.409
 fixed at the top that's the only thing 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.439
 part to which the prostate is still attached 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:34.119
 well then you loosen it all you want 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:36.249
 actually as long as possible 

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:37.360
 and you get the 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:40.029
 prostate 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.949
 that means here the connection with 

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:44.049
 the bladder is made of and that 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:46.209
 means that with the baton longer 

00:06:44.049 --> 00:06:47.829
 stick with being able to connect 

00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:48.879
 between the bladder and the urethra as soon as 

00:06:47.829 --> 00:06:50.819
 make that 

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:54.879
 leakage occurs less so the man has 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:55.839
 less effort to not let his pee 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:57.779
 walk 

00:06:55.839 --> 00:07:00.489
 in other words, less incontinence 

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:02.499
 and with this technique through through it 

00:07:00.489 --> 00:07:06.719
 save the urethra couple of the 

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:10.080
 nerves there is a 97 percent chance 

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:13.349
 continence and 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.840
 85% chance of potential 

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:17.849
 you can also imagine how much if 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.340
 we are going to operate this well this saves 

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:22.560
 on viagra and diapers 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.900
 incredible amount of money you can save yourself too 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.240
 imagine that if we have a top technique 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.620
 we have that instead of three 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.900
 being busy for one and a half hours with one 

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.520
 operation that also applies ruling 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.050
 the future is that they are even grandma who 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.189
 can operate remotely that he is a 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.039
 in America 

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:41.340
 patients or he operates 

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:43.620
 our top surgeon michiel sedelaar 

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:46.560
 assists during his guidance 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:51.080
 Operation process is fantastic for this 

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:55.860
 To achieve this in the radboud
