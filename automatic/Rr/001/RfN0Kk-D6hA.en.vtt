00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
when we say direct drive is that the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.290 
when we say direct drive is that the
linkage<00:00:24.770> between<00:00:24.800> the<00:00:25.160> beater<00:00:25.430> and<00:00:25.730> the

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
linkage between the beater and the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.930 
linkage between the beater and the
footboard<00:00:26.750> is<00:00:27.010> actually<00:00:28.010> solid<00:00:28.280> maybe<00:00:28.789> you

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
footboard is actually solid maybe you

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.029 
footboard is actually solid maybe you
saw<00:00:29.119> some<00:00:29.390> chain<00:00:29.690> drive<00:00:29.990> pedals<00:00:30.470> or<00:00:30.680> strap

saw some chain drive pedals or strap
driven<00:00:31.430> pedals<00:00:31.730> those<00:00:32.539> actually<00:00:32.930> have<00:00:32.960> a<00:00:33.079> lot

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
driven pedals those actually have a lot

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.350 
driven pedals those actually have a lot
of<00:00:33.350> flexibility<00:00:33.949> these<00:00:34.520> are<00:00:34.699> pretty<00:00:34.879> solid

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
of flexibility these are pretty solid

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.959 
of flexibility these are pretty solid
wherever<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:35.960> foot<00:00:36.170> board<00:00:36.379> goes<00:00:36.760> the<00:00:37.760> beater

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
wherever the foot board goes the beater

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.809 
wherever the foot board goes the beater
goes<00:00:38.269> so<00:00:39.199> it<00:00:39.260> makes<00:00:39.440> it<00:00:39.559> very<00:00:39.620> accurate<00:00:40.489> very

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:40.819 
goes so it makes it very accurate very

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:42.700 
goes so it makes it very accurate very
precise<00:00:41.329> there's<00:00:41.929> a<00:00:41.989> wide<00:00:42.199> variety<00:00:42.350> of

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
precise there's a wide variety of

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.139 
precise there's a wide variety of
adjustments<00:00:43.339> and<00:00:43.489> tweaks<00:00:43.699> you<00:00:43.850> can<00:00:43.909> make<00:00:44.030> to

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
adjustments and tweaks you can make to

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:45.969 
adjustments and tweaks you can make to
this<00:00:44.359> pedal<00:00:44.719> to<00:00:44.870> really<00:00:45.079> customize<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.739> feel

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:45.979 
this pedal to really customize the feel

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:46.959 
this pedal to really customize the feel
and<00:00:46.219> get<00:00:46.399> it<00:00:46.489> just<00:00:46.640> right

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
and get it just right

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.669 
and get it just right
first<00:00:47.479> you<00:00:47.780> can<00:00:47.899> actually<00:00:48.050> adjust<00:00:48.319> the

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:48.679 
first you can actually adjust the

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:50.919 
first you can actually adjust the
tension<00:00:48.859> of<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.219> springs<00:00:49.550> by<00:00:50.300> using<00:00:50.510> a<00:00:50.690> drum

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:50.929 
tension of the springs by using a drum

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:52.540 
tension of the springs by using a drum
key<00:00:51.139> insert<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:51.800> drum<00:00:52.010> key<00:00:52.190> right<00:00:52.519> here

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
key insert the drum key right here

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.059 
key insert the drum key right here
depending<00:00:53.539> on<00:00:53.600> which<00:00:53.839> way<00:00:54.019> you<00:00:54.050> turn<00:00:54.379> you<00:00:54.889> can

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:55.069 
depending on which way you turn you can

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:57.039 
depending on which way you turn you can
tighten<00:00:55.489> or<00:00:55.999> loosen<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.510> springs<00:00:56.809> you<00:00:56.870> can

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:57.049 
tighten or loosen the springs you can

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:58.479 
tighten or loosen the springs you can
actually<00:00:57.170> see<00:00:57.530> right<00:00:57.559> here<00:00:57.920> there's<00:00:58.129> a<00:00:58.190> gauge

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
actually see right here there's a gauge

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.239 
actually see right here there's a gauge
it<00:00:59.030> goes<00:00:59.149> up<00:00:59.449> is<00:00:59.659> going<00:00:59.780> to<00:00:59.839> be<00:00:59.899> looser<00:01:00.350> if<00:01:01.159> you

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249 
it goes up is going to be looser if you

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:02.770 
it goes up is going to be looser if you
go<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.489> other<00:01:01.519> way<00:01:01.699> it<00:01:02.389> gives<00:01:02.479> you<00:01:02.659> a<00:01:02.690> little

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
go the other way it gives you a little

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.600 
go the other way it gives you a little
more<00:01:02.989> tension<00:01:03.260> so<00:01:03.829> the<00:01:03.979> pedal<00:01:04.220> be<00:01:04.339> a<00:01:04.370> little

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
more tension so the pedal be a little

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.079 
more tension so the pedal be a little
bit<00:01:04.699> tighter

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
bit tighter

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.600 
bit tighter
another<00:01:05.540> cool<00:01:05.750> adjustment<00:01:06.320> is<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:07.040> footboard

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
another cool adjustment is the footboard

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.760 
another cool adjustment is the footboard
height<00:01:07.850> which<00:01:08.330> can<00:01:08.600> actually<00:01:08.750> be<00:01:08.960> adjusted

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
height which can actually be adjusted

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.010 
height which can actually be adjusted
independently<00:01:10.189> from<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:10.939> beater<00:01:11.270> with<00:01:11.780> a<00:01:11.810> lot

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
independently from the beater with a lot

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.830 
independently from the beater with a lot
of<00:01:12.170> other<00:01:12.259> pedals<00:01:12.680> you<00:01:13.159> can<00:01:13.399> kind<00:01:14.090> of<00:01:14.149> do<00:01:14.630> both

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
of other pedals you can kind of do both

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.389 
of other pedals you can kind of do both
but<00:01:15.200> they<00:01:15.409> are<00:01:15.530> kind<00:01:15.680> of<00:01:15.799> move<00:01:15.950> at<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:16.189> same

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
but they are kind of move at the same

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.130 
but they are kind of move at the same
time<00:01:16.670> with<00:01:17.210> this<00:01:17.329> one<00:01:17.539> you<00:01:17.630> can<00:01:17.689> do<00:01:17.930> one

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
time with this one you can do one

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.840 
time with this one you can do one
independently<00:01:18.860> from<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:19.100> other<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:19.610> in<00:01:19.729> this

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
independently from the other so in this

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.060 
independently from the other so in this
case<00:01:20.090> if<00:01:20.450> you<00:01:20.659> just<00:01:20.810> open<00:01:21.109> right<00:01:21.289> here<00:01:21.590> you<00:01:21.920> can

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
case if you just open right here you can

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.459 
case if you just open right here you can
see<00:01:22.310> you<00:01:22.609> can<00:01:22.759> adjust<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:23.270> footboard<00:01:23.840> up<00:01:24.200> and

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469 
see you can adjust the footboard up and

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:25.990 
see you can adjust the footboard up and
down<00:01:24.619> get<00:01:25.100> it<00:01:25.189> just<00:01:25.340> like<00:01:25.520> you<00:01:25.640> like<00:01:25.789> it

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
down get it just like you like it

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.520 
down get it just like you like it
another<00:01:26.450> great<00:01:26.659> adjustment<00:01:27.140> that<00:01:27.200> you<00:01:27.259> can<00:01:27.439> do

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
another great adjustment that you can do

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.380 
another great adjustment that you can do
with<00:01:27.649> these<00:01:27.740> pedals<00:01:28.130> is<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.789> pivot<00:01:29.149> point

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
with these pedals is the pivot point

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.420 
with these pedals is the pivot point
adjustment<00:01:29.990> basically<00:01:30.710> what<00:01:30.859> that<00:01:30.890> does<00:01:31.189> is

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
adjustment basically what that does is

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.899 
adjustment basically what that does is
you<00:01:31.460> open<00:01:31.729> right<00:01:32.060> here<00:01:32.329> and<00:01:32.920> you<00:01:33.920> can<00:01:34.070> move<00:01:34.280> the

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
you open right here and you can move the

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.919 
you open right here and you can move the
linkage<00:01:35.299> or<00:01:36.079> the<00:01:36.289> direct<00:01:36.590> drive<00:01:36.710> section<00:01:37.159> up

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
linkage or the direct drive section up

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.109 
linkage or the direct drive section up
for<00:01:38.929> more<00:01:39.109> direct<00:01:39.500> drive<00:01:39.710> feel<00:01:40.100> or<00:01:40.729> all<00:01:40.969> the

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
for more direct drive feel or all the

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.389

way<00:01:41.149> back<00:01:41.479> which<00:01:42.439> kind<00:01:42.710> of<00:01:42.770> emulates<00:01:43.159> what<00:01:43.280> a

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
way back which kind of emulates what a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.160 
way back which kind of emulates what a
chain<00:01:43.700> drive<00:01:43.939> pedal<00:01:44.299> feels<00:01:44.509> like<00:01:44.719> another

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
chain drive pedal feels like another

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.389 
chain drive pedal feels like another
adjustment<00:01:45.469> that<00:01:45.770> you<00:01:45.859> can<00:01:46.009> make<00:01:46.159> to<00:01:46.280> this

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
adjustment that you can make to this

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.429 
adjustment that you can make to this
pedal<00:01:46.729> is<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.270> angle<00:01:47.600> of<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:47.780> beater<00:01:47.960> the

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
pedal is the angle of the beater the

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.889 
pedal is the angle of the beater the
great<00:01:48.649> thing<00:01:48.920> it<00:01:49.130> is<00:01:49.490> independent<00:01:50.270> from<00:01:50.749> the

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
great thing it is independent from the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.529 
great thing it is independent from the
height<00:01:51.200> of<00:01:51.439> the<00:01:51.619> footplate<00:01:51.999> just<00:01:52.999> insert

right<00:01:53.689> here<00:01:53.960> with<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:54.890> drum<00:01:55.100> key<00:01:56.380> and<00:01:57.969> there's

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
right here with the drum key and there's

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:00.550 
right here with the drum key and there's
the<00:01:59.090> angle<00:01:59.359> the<00:01:59.479> beater<00:01:59.659> moving<00:02:00.049> back<00:02:00.380> and

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
the angle the beater moving back and

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.249 
the angle the beater moving back and

forth the pivoting toe clamp it's a

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.349 
forth the pivoting toe clamp it's a
great<00:02:03.439> feature<00:02:03.619> on<00:02:03.859> this<00:02:04.009> pedal<00:02:04.369> actually

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
great feature on this pedal actually

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:07.059 
great feature on this pedal actually
stays<00:02:05.600> in<00:02:05.749> the<00:02:05.810> open<00:02:06.109> position<00:02:06.259> all<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:06.859> time

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
stays in the open position all the time

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:08.830 
stays in the open position all the time
unless<00:02:07.310> you<00:02:07.579> lock<00:02:07.789> it<00:02:07.969> in<00:02:08.060> place<00:02:08.179> that<00:02:08.660> makes

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
unless you lock it in place that makes

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.389 
unless you lock it in place that makes
it<00:02:08.990> real<00:02:09.170> easy<00:02:09.410> for<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.710> to<00:02:09.830> take<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.100> pedal

pedals when I say floating cam what that

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.059 
pedals when I say floating cam what that
means<00:02:50.390> is<00:02:50.629> the<00:02:50.989> cam<00:02:51.230> is<00:02:51.530> actually<00:02:51.920> not
