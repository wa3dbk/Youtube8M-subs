00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.640
 (The wild Al Zeus appeared!) 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.600
 (You chose to wear the mountain king) Al Zeus... Is it true? ! 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.000
 Yes, my child, me, Alzeus 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.200
 God of treasure 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.600
 Creator of all things 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.600
 There is really a god! 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.600
 I-I-I didn't believe it before, but... 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.000
 Oh, my God. 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.500
 Al Zeus! 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.600
 (Atheism of the King of the Mountain has been shocked!) Wear the King of the Mountain, use the chaos! 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.300
 Please don't force me to offend God! 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.400
 (Pan Mountain King used for mercy, but failed!) 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.300
 Rest assured, my child. 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.300
 As mentioned in the book of Gaynord, 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.680
 Must wait for the absolute trainer's order 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.500
 Unless they don't have the proper badge. 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.860
 I am sorry, God. (Al Zes used the enlightenment!) 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.620
 (Peace King made a mess!) 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.400
 I will also put the cheek on the other side. 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.920
 Praise you, Al Zeus! (Al Zeus forgives you!) 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.060
 Wear the mountain king, use the sand! (The king of the mountain was influenced by Al Zeus) 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.480
 I beg you, let me teach the world the glory of Al Zeus! 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.320
 According to the book "The Egg", you don't have to worry about being caught. 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.080
 Soon, you will be free in heaven. 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.360
 There will be no more restrictions, and we will have eternal life. 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.620
 (Al Zeus passed the gospel again!) 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.280
 God, you are so wise. - Use sandpaper soon! 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.540
 Oh! Oh! my eyes! 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.980
 dry! I'm blind! 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.140
 God? Are you ok? (Peace King angered God!) 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.980
 You fucking bastard! 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.980
 what! I am so mad! 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.580
 Although I am a god, I am still a treasure! You are stupid! 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.740
 (Al Zeus is angry!) 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.320
 Will you forgive me? - Think beautiful! Destroy the dead light! 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.640
 (Al Zes decided to drop the sacred!) 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.080
 God, mentioned in the book "Surely Weng"... 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.320
 You dedicate your only egg to us... (Peace King tries to maintain his faith!) 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.940
 Oh! I know that in the book "Give me an anus", you mentioned that you are a jerk! (...but no effect!) 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.940
 I created you yeah! 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.940
 Now I am going to kill you! 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.940
 No... no, no, no, no! (You throw the ball of God!) 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.820
 (You captured God!) 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.820
 (Do you want to give it a name?) 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.020
 F...? "Dad"? 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.260
 This name is good..... 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.920
 ... ah, no, damn, lean! 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.140
 (Smelly King XD)
