decided to straighten my hair and I

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.590 
decided to straighten my hair and I
always<00:00:47.730> Flatiron<00:00:48.570> all<00:00:49.500> around<00:00:50.250> my<00:00:50.399> edges<00:00:50.820> my

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
always Flatiron all around my edges my

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.110 
always Flatiron all around my edges my
straightening<00:00:52.530> iron<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:54.440> 310<00:00:55.440> or<00:00:55.789> 320<00:00:56.789> one

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
straightening iron is on 310 or 320 one

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.000 
straightening iron is on 310 or 320 one
of<00:00:57.239> those<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:57.930> really<00:00:58.199> low<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.829> I

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
of those but it's really low like I

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.549 
of those but it's really low like I
never<00:00:59.579> put<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.090> up<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> 400<00:01:01.170> because<00:01:01.530> I

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
never put it up in the 400 because I

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.170 
never put it up in the 400 because I
realized<00:01:02.070> my<00:01:02.219> hair<00:01:02.430> does<00:01:02.550> not<00:01:02.579> need<00:01:02.940> that

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
realized my hair does not need that

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.170 
realized my hair does not need that
highly<00:01:03.449> heat<00:01:03.769> so<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.070> me<00:01:05.250> simply<00:01:05.549> chasing

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
highly heat so this is me simply chasing

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.050 
highly heat so this is me simply chasing
the<00:01:06.390> Flatiron<00:01:06.840> with<00:01:07.080> my<00:01:07.229> rat<00:01:07.530> tail<00:01:07.830> comb

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
literally a rat tail comb and it gets my

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.940 
literally a rat tail comb and it gets my
hair<00:01:10.860> super<00:01:11.640> straight<00:01:12.229> I'm<00:01:13.229> just<00:01:13.470> doing<00:01:13.740> two

you see and whenever I straighten my
hair<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.920> always<00:01:19.979> make<00:01:20.310> sure<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.490> have<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.759> body

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.969 
hair I always make sure I have a body
and<00:01:21.479> if<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.930> don't<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> bounce<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.830> loo

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
and if I don't have a bounce in the loo

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.590 
and if I don't have a bounce in the loo
it's<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.280> my<00:01:23.400> hair<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.640> will<00:01:23.880> wash<00:01:24.150> my<00:01:24.390> hair

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
it's a my hair I will wash my hair

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.649 
it's a my hair I will wash my hair
although<00:01:24.900> we're<00:01:25.200> gonna<00:01:25.350> do<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.740> trust<00:01:26.159> me<00:01:26.659> so

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
although we're gonna do it trust me so

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.719 
although we're gonna do it trust me so
this<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.049> me<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.409> flat<00:01:28.860> ironing<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.400> hair

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
this is me just flat ironing the hair

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.429 
this is me just flat ironing the hair
and<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:31.320> really<00:01:31.740> crazy<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.420> have<00:01:33.869> color

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
and it's really crazy that I have color

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.850 
and it's really crazy that I have color
on<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.920> edges<00:01:35.460> because<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.930> makes<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.439> so

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
on the edges because it makes it so

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.219 
on the edges because it makes it so
difficult<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:39.360> just<00:01:39.540> straighten<00:01:39.810> my<00:01:40.200> hair

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
difficult to just straighten my hair

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.450 
difficult to just straighten my hair
sometimes<00:01:41.130> because<00:01:41.670> my<00:01:42.500> color<00:01:43.500> I'm<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.340> ready

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
sometimes because my color I'm so ready

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.069 
sometimes because my color I'm so ready
to<00:01:44.610> cut<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.000> out<00:01:45.090> because<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.570> gotten<00:01:45.840> so

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
to cut it out because it's gotten so

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.550 
to cut it out because it's gotten so
like<00:01:46.290> dry<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.880> definitely<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:49.229> how

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
like dry but this is definitely just how

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.560 
like dry but this is definitely just how
I<00:01:49.590> straighten<00:01:50.070> my<00:01:50.159> hair<00:01:50.189> at<00:01:50.640> all<00:01:50.670> use<00:01:51.000> small

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
I straighten my hair at all use small

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.690 
I straighten my hair at all use small
sections<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.470> really<00:01:53.220> really<00:01:53.340> small

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
sections like really really small

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.460 
sections like really really small
sections<00:01:54.240> because<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.899> me<00:01:55.049> that's<00:01:55.200> how<00:01:55.350> you

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
sections because to me that's how you

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.730 
sections because to me that's how you
get<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.740> most<00:01:55.890> accurate<00:01:57.079> straightening<00:01:58.079> and

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
get the most accurate straightening and

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.880 
get the most accurate straightening and
at<00:01:59.009> this<00:01:59.219> point<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.850> am<00:02:00.090> done<00:02:00.810> done<00:02:01.229> done<00:02:01.590> and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
at this point I am done done done and

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.050 
at this point I am done done done and
done<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:04.219> never<00:02:05.219> really<00:02:05.610> feel<00:02:05.759> comfortable

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
done I never really feel comfortable

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.650 
done I never really feel comfortable
with<00:02:06.500> completely<00:02:07.500> straight<00:02:08.009> hair<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.479> that's

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
with completely straight hair so that's

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.449 
with completely straight hair so that's
