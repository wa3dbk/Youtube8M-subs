00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.280 
obviously but it's very as you can see
it's<00:03:09.100> pretty<00:03:09.280> much<00:03:09.400> instant<00:03:10.000> so<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.810> shutdown

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
it's pretty much instant so the shutdown

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.080 
it's pretty much instant so the shutdown
command<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:11.800> can<00:03:11.980> customize<00:03:12.489> that<00:03:12.730> just<00:03:12.940> like

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
command you can customize that just like

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.199 
command you can customize that just like
you<00:03:13.209> could<00:03:13.420> in<00:03:13.450> Windows<00:03:13.900> 7<00:03:14.470> Vista<00:03:14.700> XP<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:18.209> don't

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
you could in Windows 7 Vista XP I don't

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.210 
you could in Windows 7 Vista XP I don't
know<00:03:19.330> what<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.600> oh<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.930> Metro<00:03:20.650> screen<00:03:21.010> I

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
know what the oh the Metro screen I

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.729 
know what the oh the Metro screen I
should<00:03:21.489> remember<00:03:21.730> what<00:03:22.000> this<00:03:22.150> is<00:03:22.209> I<00:03:22.720> think<00:03:23.320> the

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
should remember what this is I think the

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.199 
should remember what this is I think the
Metro<00:03:24.040> screen<00:03:24.340> might<00:03:24.550> be<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.820> screen<00:03:25.060> with

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
Metro screen might be the screen with

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.110 
Metro screen might be the screen with
the<00:03:25.330> apps<00:03:25.709> so<00:03:26.709> you<00:03:26.739> can<00:03:26.980> skip<00:03:27.310> past<00:03:27.550> that<00:03:27.700> and

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
the apps so you can skip past that and

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.449 
the apps so you can skip past that and
that<00:03:29.020> will<00:03:29.230> enable<00:03:29.500> you<00:03:29.739> to<00:03:29.770> go<00:03:29.890> directly<00:03:30.250> to

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
that will enable you to go directly to

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.370 
that will enable you to go directly to
your<00:03:30.580> desktop<00:03:30.970> which<00:03:31.420> is<00:03:31.450> what<00:03:31.780> a<00:03:31.810> lot<00:03:32.110> of

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
your desktop which is what a lot of

this Metro screen with all the fancy
touchscreen<00:03:40.120> apps<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:41.440> that's<00:03:41.709> what<00:03:41.920> that<00:03:42.070> is

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
touchscreen apps so that's what that is
