once<00:05:56.670> you're<00:05:56.820> done<00:05:56.940> with<00:05:57.060> both<00:05:57.270> sides

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
once you're done with both sides

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.840 
once you're done with both sides
you're<00:05:58.200> pinning<00:05:58.470> should<00:05:58.800> look<00:05:59.040> a<00:05:59.190> bit<00:05:59.460> like

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
you're pinning should look a bit like

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.570 
you're pinning should look a bit like
this<00:06:00.330> now<00:06:01.260> if<00:06:01.380> you<00:06:01.500> made<00:06:01.650> a<00:06:01.680> mid<00:06:01.980> strip<00:06:02.250> you

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
this now if you made a mid strip you

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.490 
this now if you made a mid strip you
want<00:06:02.790> to<00:06:03.030> figure<00:06:03.510> out<00:06:03.630> which<00:06:03.960> side<00:06:03.990> you<00:06:04.380> want

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
want to figure out which side you want

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.590 
want to figure out which side you want
to<00:06:04.620> add<00:06:04.770> it<00:06:05.010> to<00:06:05.040> and<00:06:05.520> repeat<00:06:06.000> the<00:06:06.150> same<00:06:06.330> process

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
to add it to and repeat the same process

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.320 
to add it to and repeat the same process
as<00:06:07.140> we<00:06:07.170> did<00:06:07.380> with<00:06:07.710> the<00:06:07.830> zipper<00:06:08.220> position<00:06:09.210> the

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
as we did with the zipper position the

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.510 
as we did with the zipper position the
mid<00:06:09.510> strip<00:06:09.720> under<00:06:10.020> one<00:06:10.260> of<00:06:10.380> the<00:06:10.470> sides<00:06:10.740> take

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
mid strip under one of the sides take

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.450 
mid strip under one of the sides take
out<00:06:11.730> the<00:06:11.940> pins<00:06:12.240> and<00:06:12.510> repin<00:06:13.140> the<00:06:13.290> area<00:06:13.680> so<00:06:14.310> it

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
out the pins and repin the area so it

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.760 
out the pins and repin the area so it
goes<00:06:14.610> through<00:06:14.910> both<00:06:15.150> the<00:06:15.450> sweater<00:06:15.750> the<00:06:16.290> zipper
