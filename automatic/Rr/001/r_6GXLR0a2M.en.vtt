make it all hi that's fine if you want

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.720 
make it all hi that's fine if you want
to<00:02:11.599> have<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.750> high<00:02:11.959> sensitivity<00:02:12.319> but<00:02:12.860> I<00:02:12.950> do<00:02:13.040> or

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
to have a high sensitivity but I do or

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.220 
to have a high sensitivity but I do or
recommend<00:02:14.239> somewhere<00:02:14.720> in<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.930> middle

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
recommend somewhere in the middle

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.580 
recommend somewhere in the middle
because<00:02:15.560> I<00:02:15.680> do<00:02:15.739> a<00:02:15.980> seven<00:02:16.910> sensitivity

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
because I do a seven sensitivity

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.199 
because I do a seven sensitivity
anywhere<00:02:18.590> from<00:02:18.830> my<00:02:18.980> seven<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:19.520> eight<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:20.030> think

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
anywhere from my seven to eight I think

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.180 
anywhere from my seven to eight I think
that's<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.780> perfectly<00:02:21.319> fine<00:02:21.590> if<00:02:21.860> you're<00:02:21.980> new

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
that's a perfectly fine if you're new

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.040 
that's a perfectly fine if you're new
maybe<00:02:22.520> you<00:02:22.730> want<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.000> try<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.209> five<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.840> seven

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
maybe you want to try a five to seven

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.960 
maybe you want to try a five to seven
because<00:02:24.920> if<00:02:25.069> you<00:02:25.250> don't<00:02:25.430> know<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.760> pro

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
because if you don't know the pro

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.059 
because if you don't know the pro
players<00:02:26.269> they<00:02:26.540> do<00:02:26.599> use<00:02:26.959> a<00:02:26.989> lower<00:02:27.620> sensitivity

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
players they do use a lower sensitivity

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.339 
players they do use a lower sensitivity
like<00:02:28.819> around<00:02:29.000> five<00:02:29.330> because<00:02:30.050> they're<00:02:30.200> all

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
like around five because they're all

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.440 
like around five because they're all
about<00:02:30.620> getting<00:02:30.890> those<00:02:31.160> guns<00:02:31.370> gun<00:02:31.940> kills<00:02:32.239> and

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
about getting those guns gun kills and

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.720 
about getting those guns gun kills and
being<00:02:32.630> as<00:02:32.840> accurate<00:02:33.170> as<00:02:33.440> possible<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:34.280> this

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
being as accurate as possible and this

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.030 
being as accurate as possible and this
leads<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.209> my<00:02:35.510> very<00:02:35.810> next<00:02:36.110> tip<00:02:36.440> but<00:02:36.650> it's<00:02:36.769> very

very<00:02:37.459> essential<00:02:37.940> is<00:02:38.269> to<00:02:38.569> learn<00:02:39.019> your<00:02:39.350> radar

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
very essential is to learn your radar

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.039 
very essential is to learn your radar
guys<00:02:40.010> this<00:02:40.610> is<00:02:40.760> so<00:02:40.970> very<00:02:41.180> important<00:02:41.780> I<00:02:41.840> can't

always<00:02:44.120> constantly<00:02:44.660> checking<00:02:45.260> my<00:02:45.500> radar<00:02:45.860> when

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
always constantly checking my radar when

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.830 
always constantly checking my radar when
I'm<00:02:46.190> moving<00:02:46.519> around<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:47.000> map<00:02:47.030> when<00:02:47.720> I'm

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
I'm moving around the map when I'm

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.120 
I'm moving around the map when I'm
flanking<00:02:48.140> make<00:02:48.560> sure<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:48.799> learn<00:02:48.950> how<00:02:49.100> to

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
flanking make sure you learn how to

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.130 
flanking make sure you learn how to
flank<00:02:49.489> but<00:02:49.640> when<00:02:49.819> you<00:02:49.910> just<00:02:50.330> make<00:02:50.870> sure<00:02:50.930> you

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
flank but when you just make sure you

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.839 
flank but when you just make sure you
always<00:02:51.290> keep<00:02:51.470> an<00:02:51.799> eye<00:02:51.950> on<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.280> radar<00:02:52.430> because

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
always keep an eye on the radar because

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.430 
always keep an eye on the radar because
it's<00:02:53.150> what<00:02:53.330> will<00:02:53.810> show<00:02:53.959> you<00:02:54.019> where<00:02:54.319> your

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
it's what will show you where your

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.050 
it's what will show you where your

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
teammates are position and when you know

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.580 
teammates are position and when you know
we're<00:02:56.239> a<00:02:56.299> teammates<00:02:56.720> or<00:02:56.870> position<00:02:57.319> you<00:02:57.410> can

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
we're a teammates or position you can

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.620 
we're a teammates or position you can
tell<00:02:57.830> where<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.069> enemies<00:02:58.489> are<00:02:58.519> so<00:02:59.269> I'm<00:02:59.390> always

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
tell where the enemies are so I'm always

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.350 
tell where the enemies are so I'm always
constantly<00:03:00.319> checking<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:01.340> radar<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.239> it's

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
constantly checking the radar and it's

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.690 
constantly checking the radar and it's
also<00:03:02.720> reminds<00:03:03.440> me<00:03:03.530> when<00:03:03.709> it<00:03:03.830> comes<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.190> VSS

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
also reminds me when it comes to VSS

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.630 
also reminds me when it comes to VSS
make<00:03:05.390> sure<00:03:05.599> you<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.840> become<00:03:06.250> aggressive<00:03:07.250> go

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
make sure you to become aggressive go

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.100 
make sure you to become aggressive go
out<00:03:07.790> there<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.209> get<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.510> kills<00:03:08.750> while<00:03:08.989> the

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
out there and get the kills while the

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.180 
out there and get the kills while the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
VSAT is out

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.490 
VSAT is out
I<00:03:10.220> know<00:03:10.459> sometimes<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.209> V<00:03:11.359> set<00:03:11.570> can<00:03:11.900> be<00:03:11.930> not

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
I know sometimes the V set can be not
