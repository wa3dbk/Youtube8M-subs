okay<00:00:37.140> now<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.829> don't<00:00:38.250> think<00:00:38.370> that's<00:00:38.430> true<00:00:38.640> but

and minds of people so when samsung
introduces<00:00:43.280> its<00:00:44.280> new<00:00:44.700> phone<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.390> should<00:00:45.600> be

the<00:00:45.719> bottom<00:00:46.079> an<00:00:46.200> apple<00:00:46.590> would<00:00:46.890> go<00:00:47.039> higher<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the bottom an apple would go higher the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.880 
the bottom an apple would go higher the
problem<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.230> apples<00:00:49.770> earnings

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
problem is is that apples earnings

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.529 
problem is is that apples earnings
estimates<00:00:50.730> are<00:00:50.820> coming<00:00:51.090> down<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.420> when

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
estimates are coming down and when

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.209 
estimates are coming down and when
earnings<00:00:51.750> estimates<00:00:52.260> come<00:00:52.469> down<00:00:52.680> until<00:00:52.890> they

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
earnings estimates come down until they

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.529 
earnings estimates come down until they
bought<00:00:53.430> them<00:00:53.579> until<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.820> get<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> quarterly

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
bought them until you get the quarterly

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.479 
bought them until you get the quarterly
report<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.530> one<00:00:55.770> analyst<00:00:56.100> different<00:00:56.399> of

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
report you have one analyst different of

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.590 
report you have one analyst different of
the<00:00:56.550> cutting<00:00:56.850> numbers<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> same<00:00:57.270> way<00:00:57.480> they

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the cutting numbers the same way they

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.869 
the cutting numbers the same way they
have<00:00:57.629> one<00:00:57.930> after<00:00:58.770> another<00:00:58.800> bumping<00:00:59.520> numbers

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
have one after another bumping numbers

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.389 
have one after another bumping numbers
so<00:01:00.300> that's<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.809> psychology<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.829> one<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.280> a

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
so that's the psychology is one of a

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.600 
so that's the psychology is one of a
vortex<00:01:03.090> day<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.830> other<00:01:04.920> words<00:01:05.189> apples

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
vortex day so in other words apples

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.789 
vortex day so in other words apples
caught<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.060> vortex<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.780> valuation<00:01:07.470> call

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
caught in this vortex the valuation call

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.219 
caught in this vortex the valuation call
that<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.820> great<00:01:09.119> buying<00:01:09.360> opportunity<00:01:09.570> has

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
that it's a great buying opportunity has

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.840 
that it's a great buying opportunity has
really<00:01:10.590> not<00:01:10.890> played<00:01:11.250> out<00:01:11.430> right<00:01:11.729> now

could actually be hot right so we should

could actually be hot right so we should
we<00:01:41.159> switch<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.460> earnings<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.420> actually<00:01:42.720> look

we switch to earnings and actually look

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.870 
we switch to earnings and actually look

when<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:47.490> look<00:01:47.670> at<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.880> fundamentals<00:01:48.479> this

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
when we look at the fundamentals this

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.719 
when we look at the fundamentals this
actually<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.200> an<00:01:49.380> opportunity<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.130> all<00:01:50.460> come

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
actually is an opportunity of all come

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.609 
actually is an opportunity of all come
abroad<00:01:51.149> come<00:01:51.570> these<00:01:51.840> have<00:01:52.049> exposure<00:01:52.439> to

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
abroad come these have exposure to

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.980 
abroad come these have exposure to
samsung<00:01:53.399> as<00:01:53.579> well<00:01:53.759> theoretically<00:01:54.180> yes<00:01:54.720> but

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
samsung as well theoretically yes but

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.810 
samsung as well theoretically yes but
now<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.799> it's<00:01:55.920> entirely<00:01:56.189> about<00:01:56.369> Brooke<00:01:56.640> I'm

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
now and it's entirely about Brooke I'm

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.280 
now and it's entirely about Brooke I'm
started<00:01:57.180> acting<00:01:57.479> better<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.750> feel<00:01:58.020> terrible

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
started acting better I feel terrible

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.990 
started acting better I feel terrible
obviously<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.100> action<00:01:59.399> alerts<00:01:59.640> we<00:01:59.759> solder

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
obviously the action alerts we solder

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.179 
obviously the action alerts we solder
here<00:02:00.149> why<00:02:00.600> do<00:02:00.659> we<00:02:00.899> sell<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.200> because<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.740> just

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
here why do we sell it because it just

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.370 
here why do we sell it because it just
seemed<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.460> all<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.540> got<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> Apple

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
seemed like all you got is the Apple

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.920 
seemed like all you got is the Apple
side<00:02:04.560> not<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.979> not<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.600> Samsung<00:02:06.600> side<00:02:06.810> now

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
side not the not the Samsung side now

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.570 
side not the not the Samsung side now
most<00:02:07.140> samsung<00:02:07.469> introduces<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.099> product<00:02:08.429> i

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
most samsung introduces the product i

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.729 
most samsung introduces the product i
now<00:02:08.940> think<00:02:08.970> there'll<00:02:09.300> be<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.420> teardown<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
now think there'll be a teardown and the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.380 
now think there'll be a teardown and the
way<00:02:10.860> we<00:02:10.979> used<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.220> tear<00:02:11.459> down<00:02:11.489> apple<00:02:12.060> products

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
way we used to tear down apple products

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.760 
way we used to tear down apple products
and<00:02:12.540> you'll<00:02:12.750> see<00:02:12.959> broadcom<00:02:13.410> nagar

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
and you'll see broadcom nagar

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.580 
and you'll see broadcom nagar
now<00:02:14.100> everybody<00:02:14.700> knows<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:15.510> these<00:02:16.260> are<00:02:16.470> in

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
now everybody knows that these are in

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.630 
now everybody knows that these are in
there<00:02:16.740> but<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:16.950> doesn't<00:02:17.190> matter<00:02:17.310> the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
there but it doesn't matter the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.940 
there but it doesn't matter the
psychology<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.600> Samsung<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.110> positive<00:02:19.530> its

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
psychology and Samsung so positive its

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.980 
psychology and Samsung so positive its
ecology<00:02:20.280> an<00:02:20.430> apple<00:02:20.820> so<00:02:21.000> negative<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.570> you're

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
ecology an apple so negative that you're

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.420 
ecology an apple so negative that you're
going<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.170> get<00:02:22.350> that<00:02:22.560> but<00:02:22.770> then<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.040> think

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
going to get that but then I think

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.160 
going to get that but then I think
honestly<00:02:23.910> if<00:02:24.120> there<00:02:24.360> was<00:02:24.570> going<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.930> be<00:02:24.960> day

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
honestly if there was going to be day

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.510 
honestly if there was going to be day
and<00:02:25.350> I've<00:02:25.410> not<00:02:25.620> been<00:02:25.740> saying<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.100> stocks<00:02:26.340> in

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
and I've not been saying the stocks in

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.160 
and I've not been saying the stocks in
about<00:02:26.730> if<00:02:27.000> there<00:02:27.510> was<00:02:27.690> going<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.930> be<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:28.020> day

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
about if there was going to be a day

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.840 
about if there was going to be a day
that<00:02:28.200> apple<00:02:28.620> would<00:02:28.680> bottom<00:02:28.920> it's<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.610> day

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
that apple would bottom it's the day

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.660 
that apple would bottom it's the day
after<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.390> Samsung<00:02:30.930> release<00:02:31.260> where<00:02:32.010> we<00:02:32.400> then

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
after the Samsung release where we then

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.870 
after the Samsung release where we then
start<00:02:33.060> hearing<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.540> symptoms<00:02:33.990> okay<00:02:34.440> not<00:02:35.340> blow

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
start hearing the symptoms okay not blow

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.760 
start hearing the symptoms okay not blow
out<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.330> that<00:02:36.990> would<00:02:37.320> be<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.980> call<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.730> buy<00:02:38.940> a

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
out and that would be the call to buy a

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.020 
out and that would be the call to buy a
broadcom<00:02:40.770> but<00:02:40.950> more<00:02:41.100> importantly<00:02:41.490> Qualcomm

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
broadcom but more importantly Qualcomm

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.480 
broadcom but more importantly Qualcomm
because<00:02:42.300> Qualcomm<00:02:42.840> owns<00:02:43.110> 4G<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:43.980> that's

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
because Qualcomm owns 4G and that's

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.130 
because Qualcomm owns 4G and that's
nothing<00:02:45.000> else<00:02:45.180> other<00:02:45.360> than<00:02:45.480> 4g<00:02:45.930> and

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
nothing else other than 4g and

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.290 
nothing else other than 4g and
Qualcomm's<00:02:47.040> get<00:02:47.190> every<00:02:47.340> base<00:02:47.490> covered<00:02:47.520> okay

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
Qualcomm's get every base covered okay

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.810 
Qualcomm's get every base covered okay
so<00:02:48.360> we'll<00:02:48.630> keep<00:02:48.810> an<00:02:48.930> eye<00:02:49.050> out<00:02:49.080> for<00:02:49.260> tomorrow

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820
