00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.870
 person who is a carpenter of a 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.470
 person who is a hairdresser of a 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.450
 degree cleaner a lot of 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.100
 people who used to be in that 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.110
 obligation and one of the subjects 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.910
 complicated for taxpayers is 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.160
 that they gave it in order to control the 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.570
 evasion of taxes because it classified the 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.610
 natural persons in three categories 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.740
 so the taxpayer must 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.300
 analyze in detail according to your 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.740
 economic activity and volume of 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.890
 income to which of these three categories 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.290
 belong one is the category legacies 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.140
 another the category of workers counts 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.000
 own and other the category of people 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.860
 naturals that belong to the regime 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.500
 general is what leads to the day since 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.440
 he established the government of this mission 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.200
 cellular system will be determined in the 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.380
 port explained to me that already the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.479
 taxpayer can not in his statement 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.680
 of rent take the costs and deductions 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.260
 that previously formed but that already 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.140
 to be limited to costs and deductions 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.800
 that the law in the 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.009
 line and 07 this additional to that to that 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.070
 the revision was also modified in the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.410
 account then the person taxpayer 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.930
 natural in colombia today has received two 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.020
 with three big ones with the acquiring of 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.790
 tax reform 1 in the calculation of 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.880
 the retentions the source that lived it 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.910
 in 2003 2 in the calculation of the tax 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.100
 that then to live now in 2014 that 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.450
 it is the tax that it holds for 2003 and 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.400
 the other problem for many people 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.140
 that now they must declare is to define what 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.690
 type of system for calculating the 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.120
 tax must or must I use 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.340
 I'll nominate a tax gincana and 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.250
 that is to start missing a series of 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.290
 obstacles stumbling because the money 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.720
 have to begin to determine in what 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.880
 category is missing that I just 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.650
 mention second that you have to put 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.739
 the taxpayer 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.870
 now that category that the system 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.390
 must determine to calculate if it is the 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.390
 famous magnet or the famous and more magnet 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.049
 national alternative minimum tax and 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.430
 plus alternative minimum tax if 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.620
 it turns out that the person who has to 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.769
 begin now not only skill / 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.200
 category is in which my 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.870
 system has to apply and that's not what 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.040
 clear enough for people 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.780
 complicated because it increases the 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.299
 respondents and many of those people 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.940
 in quotes are ignorant in is the 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.579
 totally tributary to that 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.609
 add that obviously the 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:35.340
 tax administration for 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:37.920
 knowledge of the audience to more or 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.620
 less a year ago I had about 8 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.470
 millions and peak of natural persons 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:48.389
 who were taxpayers 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:51.209
 now with this opening to that value or 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:53.549
 a nice touch to declare is minor 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.050
 it will increase to at least 82 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.800
 millions of people 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:01.170
 I wonder with what staff with what 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.050
 international column to attend the 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.450
 guide these people I do not think the 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.930
 dian have death prepared from the 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.550
 logistic point of view to attend 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.800
 audits of this statement the doctor 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.730
 Gerardo owner is a public accountant 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.580
 tax and planning specialist 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.019

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.410
 of giving and it is worrying what is coming 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.790
 for all the people who have to 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.790
