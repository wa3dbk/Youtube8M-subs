but I think that how they handle that

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.300 
but I think that how they handle that
was<00:04:13.280> terrible<00:04:13.640> and<00:04:13.850> I<00:04:13.970> think<00:04:14.150> you<00:04:14.300> saw<00:04:15.050> the

was terrible and I think you saw the
sort<00:04:16.310> of<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:16.430> cold<00:04:16.700> callous<00:04:17.510> sort<00:04:17.959> of<00:04:18.049> subside

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
sort of the cold callous sort of subside
