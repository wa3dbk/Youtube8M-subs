going<00:02:39.540> on<00:02:40.049> zoom<00:02:40.799> is<00:02:40.950> when<00:02:41.099> you<00:02:41.189> establish<00:02:41.340> a

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
going on zoom is when you establish a

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.390 
going on zoom is when you establish a
distant<00:02:42.239> a<00:02:42.329> good<00:02:42.810> distance<00:02:43.319> zoom<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.129> when<00:02:44.280> you

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
distant a good distance zoom is when you

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.220 
distant a good distance zoom is when you
establish<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.879> distance<00:02:45.420> between<00:02:45.599> the<00:02:45.959> subject

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
establish a distance between the subject

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.589 
establish a distance between the subject
and<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.620> camera<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.790> either<00:02:48.180> move

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
and the camera and you either move

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.780 
and the camera and you either move
closer<00:02:48.989> or<00:02:49.290> farther<00:02:49.530> away<00:02:49.799> from<00:02:50.250> this<00:02:50.370> subject

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
closer or farther away from this subject

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.390 
closer or farther away from this subject
and<00:02:50.939> then<00:02:51.450> there's<00:02:51.750> dolly<00:02:52.109> now<00:02:52.859> dolly<00:02:53.159> is

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
and then there's dolly now dolly is

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.750 
and then there's dolly now dolly is
basically<00:02:53.909> a<00:02:54.150> tripod<00:02:54.900> on<00:02:55.169> a<00:02:55.260> moving<00:02:56.220> surface

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
basically a tripod on a moving surface

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.199 
basically a tripod on a moving surface
to<00:02:56.970> like<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.239> my<00:02:57.720> tripod<00:02:57.989> on<00:02:58.469> if<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.760> had<00:02:59.909> wheels

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
to like it my tripod on if it had wheels

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.289 
to like it my tripod on if it had wheels
to<00:03:00.870> capture<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.290> shot<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:02.189> where<00:03:02.370> it's<00:03:02.730> fixed

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
to capture a shot to where it's fixed

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.720 
to capture a shot to where it's fixed
but<00:03:03.599> then<00:03:03.780> again<00:03:03.930> it's<00:03:04.439> moving<00:03:04.980> it's<00:03:05.340> sort<00:03:05.639> of

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
but then again it's moving it's sort of

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.030 
but then again it's moving it's sort of
hard<00:03:05.879> to<00:03:06.000> explain<00:03:06.389> you<00:03:06.989> typically<00:03:07.319> need<00:03:07.439> a

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
hard to explain you typically need a

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.159 
hard to explain you typically need a
dolly<00:03:08.489> which<00:03:08.849> I<00:03:09.090> don't<00:03:09.209> have<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.959> that's

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:10.169 
dolly which I don't have and that's

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:11.869 
dolly which I don't have and that's
pretty<00:03:10.349> much<00:03:10.469> it<00:03:10.620> as<00:03:10.950> far<00:03:10.980> as<00:03:11.250> motion<00:03:11.609> shots

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
pretty much it as far as motion shots

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.240 
pretty much it as far as motion shots
are<00:03:12.120> concerned<00:03:12.569> next<00:03:13.439> up<00:03:13.590> is<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:13.950> rule<00:03:14.219> of

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
are concerned next up is the rule of

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.220 
are concerned next up is the rule of
thirds<00:03:14.430> rule<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.329> thirds<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.719> basically

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
thirds rule of thirds is basically

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.339 
thirds rule of thirds is basically
putting<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.189> tic-tac-toe<00:03:17.639> board<00:03:18.269> on<00:03:19.049> your

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
putting a tic-tac-toe board on your

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.649 
putting a tic-tac-toe board on your
screen<00:03:19.739> there's<00:03:20.340> nine<00:03:20.669> different<00:03:21.209> sections

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 
screen there's nine different sections

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.659 
screen there's nine different sections
to<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.019> screen<00:03:22.349> and<00:03:22.590> where<00:03:22.979> the<00:03:23.159> lines

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
to the screen and where the lines

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.939 
to the screen and where the lines
intersect<00:03:24.479> is<00:03:24.659> where<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.169> want<00:03:25.379> the<00:03:25.500> subject

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949 
intersect is where you want the subject

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.189 
intersect is where you want the subject
to<00:03:26.040> be<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:26.879> here's<00:03:27.269> a<00:03:27.329> square<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.019> square

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
to be so here's a square is a square

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.879 
to be so here's a square is a square
here's<00:03:28.769> as<00:03:28.919> well<00:03:29.479> so<00:03:30.479> on<00:03:30.659> so<00:03:30.840> forth<00:03:30.889> your

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
here's as well so on so forth your

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.550 
here's as well so on so forth your
intersection<00:03:32.669> points<00:03:33.209> are<00:03:33.329> going<00:03:33.629> to<00:03:33.780> be<00:03:33.930> here

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
intersection points are going to be here

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.860 
intersection points are going to be here
here<00:03:35.040> here<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.519> here<00:03:35.609> now<00:03:36.120> what<00:03:36.269> those<00:03:36.479> are<00:03:36.720> is
