00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.860
 yo everyone is marco I hope 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.300
 that you are well and we find ourselves 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.490
 today for another empty goal 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.070
 this time with a budget of 800 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.380
 euros so again a build 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.369
 essentially gaming oriented that goes 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.769
 to talk to people who want 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.859
 renew them also a gaming pc or 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.720
 those who learn gaming on pc 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.949
 but have a slightly higher budget 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.000
 for example young workers the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.289
 things like that what they arrange 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.820
 with their parents for that makes them 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.680
 gifts three christmas gifts etc 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.700
 after do as you want for this 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.620
 which is a little over for those 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.989
 who have a budget of 800 euros so 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.829
 always without a device without a screen 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.640
 without an operating system so 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.620
 essentially gaming oriented 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.750
 we go there we go we go into the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.360
 the subject with first of all the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.980
 processors the couple processor card 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.059
 mother if you are more at intel 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.059
 we're going to leave on two y 4460 a 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.920
 quad core processor clocked at 3.2 ghz 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:08.070
 which will cost 15 180 euros and 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.960
 we go on a motherboard msi h 97 pc 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.130
 so make an atx motherboard 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.280
 and x socket 1156 with an intel h chipset 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.540
 90 is not overclocking I know this is 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.020
 for that I did not take a chipset 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.610
 z80 May 17 h 97 which is more than enough if 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.530
 the processor is not yet closed 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.290
 usb cable 3 ports sata 6 gigabits pci 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.820
 express 3.0 four slots for ram etc 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.100
 a motherboard all cases more classic 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.710
 which costs about 90 euros if I was 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.320
 not already said I was not hurting anything 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.820
 amd if you are more amd we will leave 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.700
 earlier on a fx 8320 black edition 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.180
 so a processor opts for the clocked core 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.350
 at 3 points July 5 which costs 155 euros 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:57.930
 and a motherboard msi 970 to g46 so 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.550
 yet a motherboard 6 AM3 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.430
 more 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.590
 from the usb3 the cook motherboard 80 euros and 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.630
 that's roughly the same thing he liked 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.860
 wake 97 there is just the support of the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.420
 processor that sings otherwise the 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.770
 features are exactly the 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.020
 same 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.170
 at the level of the ram we will start again on 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.860
 of the kingston ddr3 savage raid in 2 x 4 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.990
 gigas 1600 billion breaks 9 to 60 euros 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.070
 huyghe is amply enough for 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.130
 games at the moment as I say 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.410
 you can always go to 16 giga 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.940
 so in two or three years I think 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.910
 it must become useful to have 16 giga 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.710
 ram but advance before that period 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.240
 before three years in the two years to 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.430
 come see giga it's going well 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.720
 suffice for everything you do in 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.530
 any case for gaming for the 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.540
 office automation etc 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.150
 that's enough for sure if 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.070
 you decide overnight to 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.110
 do 3d rendering with your pc 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.900
 he's going to have a little bit of trouble 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.150
 clearly even at the processor level 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.490
 then we will continue with the 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.290
 storage so storage is going on 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.150
 a ssd for a config at 800 euros on 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.240
 can start to consider having a 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.160
 ssd if you're a little shirt do not take 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.810
 not the ssd turn the ssd for example if 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.750
 you have a screen bought next to etc 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.910
 and for example was only 800 that 900 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.310
 euros and that here you have a screen to 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.440
 buy the screen costs 150 euros virey the 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.720
 ssd it's ok but if you ever 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.560
 have eight hundred to put in the tower 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.570
 considered a little test and that makes 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.310
 always happy at startup 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.630
 windows startup programs that 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.700
 will clearly changed the game 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.510
 in these cases I selected a 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.640
 crucial bx 100 years old 120 gigas that's enough 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.780
 largely for this you just put your 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.220
 programs on you do not put your 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.290
 games it's useless to put his games 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.930
 on a ssd very clearly you put 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.310
 just your programs that you use 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.190
 most often we make fun of 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.240
 all that is internet 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.430
 word processing or the stuff we 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.710
 use every day here is windows etc 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.690
 in short you put your programs do not know 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.820
 no game and at the storage level 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.310
 will go on a sega of barracuda in 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.100
 interests I'm not drawing you on 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.040
 found this hard drive on 70 80% of 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.760
 build convoi the current time the ssd 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:09.090
 listen 71 euros 72 maybe and the sega 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.710
 cost 58 euros here is high level 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.170
 now graphics card so we go that 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.490
 you are tackling the graphic part 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.140
 we're leaving tonight 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:21.270
 if you're more of a videographer on a 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:24.360
 gtx 962c gigabit so there gigabit 960 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.430
 windforce giga inquiry of video memory 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.260
 my gigabyte of video memory is ok 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.700
 become a standard within one or two years 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.930
 I think today there is little game 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.480
 use as much video memory 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.070
 but within two years I think we 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.230
 will start climbing there is a little bit of 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.700
 video memory and that kajiya okay 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.890
 really be useful so if you want 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.850
 a pc that have a little more evolutionary hard 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.020
 a little bit longer 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.160
 advise to go on versions 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.370
 kajiya graphics cards 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.730
 if you are on the side amd rather I 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.350
 advise the msi r 9 381 still gaming 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.460
 in quest giga no one in two there I 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.190
 believe that it takes a version 2 gigas my 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.450
 shares and on that in 4 gigas that will 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.280
 also a blow that also has 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.400
 very good for both games 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.650
 cards or 260 265 euros so roughly speaking 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.220
 it's the same price but there clearly I 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.840
 will recommend the MSI is 9381 which 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.440
 has performance that is superior 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.630
 at the hall at 960 from nvidia 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.300
 so the r9 380 is clearly a 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.670
 excellent report loses by the hour 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.320
 current it turns most 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.890
 games that if not all games 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.570
 in 1080p in high or even ultra donka 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.490
 maybe just witcher 3 who's going 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.710
 maybe put a little bit of trouble 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.700
 if you put all the options if 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.890
 you put them goodbye that's all 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.360
 that's okay it'll be playable surely to 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.270
 25 30 fps but you 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.800
 was not the 60 fps but otherwise it will be 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.419
 still playable in high ultra very 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.949
 clearly 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.659
 I was five-legged this one batman 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:47.759
 arkam night will have no worries all that 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:49.740
 is ugly I lol it is this then there is 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:51.629
 simple you will be more than 100 mbps to my 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.939
 opinion very clearly no concern of this 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:55.860
 point of view there you can play in 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:57.599
 good conditions very clearly good 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.620
 there 960 will also allow you to play 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:02.430
 in good conditions there is no 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:05.250
 worry but I prefer the r9 380 gaming 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.629
 high level for the price I prefer 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.139
 link 9 381 gaming 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:12.990
 but hey it only binds me then we 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:16.409
 part on a hellman case z11 so a 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.689
 case rather average format to 6 min to 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:19.830
 xx or micro-atx tea with a small 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:21.750
 window because it's always nice 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.400
 to see the inside of his case is 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.819
 at the level of food we go on 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.279
 a the epa mxf 1,650 watts so six years 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:31.259
 on 650 watts because not always 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:33.330
 for the possibility of evolution 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:37.110
 and then if you ever go on the r9 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:39.719
 380 they pump more than the 960 of the 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.940
 suddenly it's not bad to have it 650 watts 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:44.250
 always happy to have a small 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.659
 few more watts than needed 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.520
 a small margin of safety 

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:49.440
 and then suddenly it allows you if ever 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.940
 you 're evolving your components from only 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.099
 not have to change the power supply by 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.680
 example the case costs 55 euros and 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:57.599
 feeding the cost of 60 euros this 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.729
 who makes us arrive for the config 

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:01.259
 intel we come to a config to 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:03.810
 around 850 euros 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:05.909
 and if you take the option amd we come 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.610
 to a config that is 800 euros all 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:10.139
 stack here I have not talked about ventirad 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.370
 we look at those very original 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:12.629
 clearly for this price there we can 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.189
 keep the original ones if you ever 

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:15.839
 find your pc things too much you 

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:19.379
 can add a cooler cooler 

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:21.389
 master 212 evo which costs 25 or 30 euros 

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:24.900
 it does not cost much but I think 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:26.669
 the original coolers for a budget to 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.139
 800 euros are doing very well 

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:29.279
 in any case I hope this video 

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:30.779
 you will have liked do not hesitate to like 

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:32.219
 raise the league is dislocated either 

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:35.509
 dislocated and leave your comments and 

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:35.509
 on this I tell you to choo good evening
