00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello today we have repair 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.690
 acer laptop motherboard which 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.840
 has a nonstandard malfunction and 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.509
 the difficulty is that 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.009
 determine to catch the moment when 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.289
 show down smoothness difficult but 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.779
 at least a defect appears periodically and 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.109
 often let's show how he is like 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.170
 a defect we immediately connected 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.779
 flash flash drive to and to show that 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.359
 the laptop starts the moment when the defect is not 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.250
 manifested on now we try 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.110
 enable by pressing the button on 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.520
 additional panel and see what 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.260
 just happening on the key or 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.719
 literally for a split second caught fire 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.629
 light bulb and everything and the board turned off here 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.350
 in the same way now so here 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.510
 periodically until the laptop starts 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.640
 work fine one fine 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.030
 moment he can work normally either 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.210
 if you press and in the area the process to him 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.290
 processor if I right now, put pressure on your fingers 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.290
 machines, then start a new board will start work 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.730
 even now you need to push harder and so 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:23.510
 I see, you see, I have the same flash drive 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.190
 that is, and then turned off again then 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.710
 have we been looking for a problem in something 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.210
 so the board responds to deformation in 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.920
 Shima district we decide it decided immediately 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.200
 Is it not enough to change any chris ? 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.380
 points moved away and either somewhere cold 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.290
 soldering but still it didn't help 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:42.080
 that is, the option is not drunk a or some 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.710
 there are chip defects here right away and 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.330
 embarrassed by the pasha chip varied and 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.900
 it turned out that the problem is quite 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.250
 other side of the board and in a place like that 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.930
 did not even suggest now show 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:00.580
 what we turn over maternal 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.900
 fee and where do you think it is here 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.210
 the defect is hiding in this particular area 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.190
 where the deformation occurs well for sure 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.270
 some experienced craftsmen already 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.490
 faced such problems well right away 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.670
 i will say that the problem is lurking here is itan 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.770
 19 volt chokes 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.110
 bus on food processor machine 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.610
 on transistors which in particular 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.250
 CPU power implications 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:34.920
 that is, visually if you look 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:36.720
 take a closer look then the very detail this cis 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.150
 the component has no damage 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.780
 cracks or burnout there bottom or side 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.740
 or that is , by themselves and as if 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:50.190
 whole but somewhere there goes 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.870
 crack and spark may slip but 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.490
 you sincerely see something no less such a sound 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.500
 happens as if somewhere about a carp 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.270
 I will say slips and figured out that 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.880
 that's where the problem is right now 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.990
 we will try to turn on and see 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.940
 19 volt also disappears 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:09.240
 line on the processor side for this 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:14.700
 set the voltage measurement mode on 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:17.400
 voltmeter I connect the power only 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.930
 start immediately from this side we have 20 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.910
 volt 20 volt power supply 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:26.190
 connected here at the entrance to the asphalt 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.860
 here we also have 20 volts that is in 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:33.870
 minimum load voltage is not 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:37.920
 sinking down but now when we 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.630
 press the power button as you can see 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:45.390
 on the voltmeter just had a drop 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:46.650
 voltage again the same voltage 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.270
 squander that moment when we 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.100
 turn on when the load appears then 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.850
 is in this element 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.400
 we have all the problems lurking right away 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.490
 I will show that if for example we are with this 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.410
 the sides will measure then when turned on 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:05.850
 when a defect appears, the voltage is not 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.440
 falls now we will transplant then i'm for sure 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.330
 same element same choke 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.050
 which is involved as well as 19 volt 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.530
 line processor power system 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.530
 let's start soldering 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.670
 for a start we solder our damaged 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.460
 let's see the elements at least visually 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.690
 maybe something under it we will see 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.390
 maybe he 'll just crumble during 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.430
 watering and now stupid to pay 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.200
 can't see anything when we can do 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.850
 be he even 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.850
 prove yourself as a loser 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.220
 no visible damage at all 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.220
 throttle not visible not observed among 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:59.170
 May itâ€™s just simple 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.170
 lost its properties of clay exploitation 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:11.180
 it's for visual susceptibility 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:15.230
 you are klima sweet flowed even though this flux is not 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:17.950
 requires to be blinded by 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.950
 kinky not less 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.729
 all now let's turn on see what 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.729
 we succeeded after replacing the choke 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.440
 Spidey now should not already respond 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.949
 on deformation and automatically 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.949
 shut off 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.740
 as you can see the board has already started any 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:46.900
 deformation reactions no longer occur 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.880
 Here is such a non-standard case 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.470
 Of course such cases come across very 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.440
 rarely at another time it is very difficult to find 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.930
 due to the fact that reveal which of 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.820
 elements smd components can take on 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.100
 parameters aside and in doing so are 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.010
 The reason is quite difficult but not 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.660
 less in this case everything turned out 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.580
 just everyone thank you all for watching 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.710
 I hope it was interesting to subscribe to 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:11.190
 our channel and VKontakte in all 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.190
 good bye
