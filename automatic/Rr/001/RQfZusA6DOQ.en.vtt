00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.590 
what's left of it this is kind of a
twisted<00:01:31.920> heap<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.220> metal<00:01:32.399> that<00:01:33.210> has<00:01:33.360> now

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
twisted heap of metal that has now

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.870 
twisted heap of metal that has now
become<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.380> back<00:01:34.680> casing<00:01:35.280> it's<00:01:35.520> just<00:01:35.729> all

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
it I'm actually kind of surprised at how

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.429 
it I'm actually kind of surprised at how
these<00:01:41.759> side<00:01:42.090> there<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.420> still<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.840> shape<00:01:43.140> but

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
these side there is still in shape but

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.740 
these side there is still in shape but
for<00:01:44.009> most<00:01:44.159> parts<00:01:44.399> can<00:01:44.580> been<00:01:44.939> completely

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
for most parts can been completely

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.440 
for most parts can been completely
obliterated<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:47.399> see<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.610> little<00:01:47.880> twisted
