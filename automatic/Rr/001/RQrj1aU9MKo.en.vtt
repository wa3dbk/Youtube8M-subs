00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.899 
I do enjoy it I do think that when we
push<00:01:51.300> against<00:01:51.659> each<00:01:51.750> other<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.909> tough

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
push against each other it's tough

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.270 
push against each other it's tough
really<00:01:54.540> pushes<00:01:54.990> us<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.350> be<00:01:55.800> better<00:01:56.040> every

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
really pushes us to be better every

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.890 
really pushes us to be better every
single<00:01:56.460> day<00:01:56.850> because<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.240> see<00:01:57.390> one<00:01:57.570> guy<00:01:57.690> get

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
single day because you see one guy get

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.630 
single day because you see one guy get
to<00:01:57.990> 30<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.409> world<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.860> pushes<00:01:59.159> me<00:01:59.190> to<00:01:59.430> kind

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
to 30 in the world it pushes me to kind

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.730 
to 30 in the world it pushes me to kind
of<00:01:59.760> want<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.479> get<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.780> level<00:02:00.990> knowing<00:02:01.229> he<00:02:01.530> can

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
of want to get that level knowing he can

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:10.800 
of want to get that level knowing he can
do<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.010> maybe<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.280> can<00:02:02.550> do<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.820> as<00:02:02.909> well

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.000 

consistency<00:02:11.810> is<00:02:11.989> key<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.439> climbing<00:02:12.890> the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
consistency is key to climbing the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.759 
consistency is key to climbing the
rankings<00:02:13.569> making<00:02:14.569> sure<00:02:14.810> he<00:02:14.989> performs<00:02:15.469> every

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
rankings making sure he performs every

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.369 
rankings making sure he performs every
week<00:02:15.980> if<00:02:16.609> something<00:02:17.120> cutler<00:02:17.480> has<00:02:17.810> been<00:02:18.049> trying

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
week if something cutler has been trying

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.300

to<00:02:18.650> get<00:02:18.799> to<00:02:18.920> grips<00:02:19.129> with<00:02:19.250> I<00:02:20.890> think<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:22.159> does

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
to get to grips with I think it does

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.580 
to get to grips with I think it does
take<00:02:22.489> a<00:02:22.549> little<00:02:22.730> bit<00:02:22.849> of<00:02:22.939> time<00:02:23.349> you<00:02:24.349> got<00:02:24.500> to

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
take a little bit of time you got to

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.080 
take a little bit of time you got to
come<00:02:24.739> in<00:02:24.859> day<00:02:25.010> in<00:02:25.069> and<00:02:25.220> day<00:02:25.310> out<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.640> prove<00:02:25.879> it

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
come in day in and day out and prove it

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.940 
come in day in and day out and prove it
you<00:02:26.329> can't<00:02:26.569> just<00:02:26.780> do<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:27.109> every<00:02:27.650> other<00:02:27.680> week

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
you can't just do it every other week

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.220 
you can't just do it every other week
because<00:02:28.909> then<00:02:29.060> guys<00:02:29.239> will<00:02:29.480> know<00:02:29.689> that<00:02:29.720> maybe

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
because then guys will know that maybe

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.080 
because then guys will know that maybe
he's<00:02:30.829> not<00:02:30.950> showing<00:02:31.129> up<00:02:31.340> this<00:02:31.459> week<00:02:31.670> but<00:02:31.879> if<00:02:31.970> you

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
he's not showing up this week but if you

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.899 
he's not showing up this week but if you
show<00:02:32.209> it<00:02:32.329> either<00:02:32.510> every<00:02:33.109> single<00:02:33.709> week<00:02:33.909> it's

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
show it either every single week it's

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.640 
show it either every single week it's
kind<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.209> big<00:02:35.389> doing<00:02:35.720> I<00:02:36.019> feel<00:02:36.379> like<00:02:36.530> I've

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
kind of big doing I feel like I've

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.770 
kind of big doing I feel like I've
earned<00:02:36.799> that<00:02:36.980> respect<00:02:37.159> and<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:38.299> lose<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.659> it's

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
earned that respect and to lose it it's

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.990 
earned that respect and to lose it it's
pretty<00:02:38.989> quick<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:40.250> got<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.519> show<00:02:40.700> up<00:02:40.790> every

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
pretty quick so you got to show up every

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.210 
pretty quick so you got to show up every
day<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.329> like<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.290> way<00:02:42.379> dentist<00:02:42.680> Kula<00:02:42.980> plays

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
day I like the way dentist Kula plays

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.369 
day I like the way dentist Kula plays
again<00:02:43.579> he's<00:02:43.790> someone<00:02:44.120> pretty<00:02:44.420> solid<00:02:44.900> not<00:02:45.349> a

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
again he's someone pretty solid not a

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:46.990 
again he's someone pretty solid not a
lot<00:02:45.560> of<00:02:45.590> flash<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.189> that's<00:02:46.250> actually<00:02:46.549> a<00:02:46.760> good

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
lot of flash and that's actually a good

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.670 
lot of flash and that's actually a good
sign<00:02:47.299> for<00:02:47.329> a<00:02:47.599> player<00:02:47.810> that<00:02:48.049> his<00:02:48.349> game<00:02:48.530> is

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
sign for a player that his game is

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.369 
sign for a player that his game is
balanced<00:02:49.129> his<00:02:49.280> game<00:02:49.489> is<00:02:49.669> forceful<00:02:50.359> he<00:02:50.689> I<00:02:51.109> think

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
balanced his game is forceful he I think

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.809 
balanced his game is forceful he I think
he's<00:02:51.590> gonna<00:02:51.709> be<00:02:51.799> growing<00:02:52.099> more<00:02:52.400> in<00:02:52.609> the<00:02:52.700> next

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
he's gonna be growing more in the next

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.009 
he's gonna be growing more in the next
two<00:02:53.030> or<00:02:53.060> three<00:02:53.269> years<00:02:53.419> I<00:02:53.540> think<00:02:53.599> he<00:02:53.810> needs<00:02:53.989> to

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
two or three years I think he needs to

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.750 
two or three years I think he needs to
get<00:02:54.109> a<00:02:54.169> little<00:02:54.290> more<00:02:54.439> physically<00:02:55.189> strong<00:02:55.519> and

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
get a little more physically strong and

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.670 
get a little more physically strong and
maybe<00:02:56.510> as<00:02:56.659> it<00:02:56.750> gets<00:02:56.870> physically<00:02:57.260> stronger

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
maybe as it gets physically stronger

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.199 
maybe as it gets physically stronger
he'll<00:02:57.889> be<00:02:57.980> able<00:02:58.069> to<00:02:58.250> assert<00:02:58.489> himself<00:02:58.609> and<00:02:59.090> and

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
he'll be able to assert himself and and

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.210 
he'll be able to assert himself and and
win<00:02:59.599> more<00:02:59.750> matches<00:02:59.930> win<00:03:00.319> matches<00:03:00.530> easily<00:03:01.040> and

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
win more matches win matches easily and

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.559 
win more matches win matches easily and
but<00:03:01.639> very<00:03:01.939> interesting<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.329> see<00:03:02.419> how<00:03:02.540> he

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
but very interesting to see how he
