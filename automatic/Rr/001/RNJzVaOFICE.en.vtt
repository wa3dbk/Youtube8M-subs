00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.299 
head of interpret time we just got

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:08.250 
head of interpret time we just got
decimated<00:01:04.299> picking<00:01:05.229> on<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.409> scouts<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:08.170> the

only downside with the snake and I even

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.590 
only downside with the snake and I even
with<00:01:09.909> the<00:01:10.260> lend-lease<00:01:11.260> fuel<00:01:11.680> it<00:01:11.860> is<00:01:11.979> slow<00:01:12.600> but

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
with the lend-lease fuel it is slow but

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.600 
with the lend-lease fuel it is slow but
I'll<00:01:13.720> tell<00:01:13.840> you<00:01:13.900> what<00:01:14.110> with<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:14.979> low<00:01:15.130> profile

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
I'll tell you what with the low profile

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.340 
I'll tell you what with the low profile
I<00:01:15.790> would<00:01:15.940> much<00:01:16.240> rather<00:01:16.299> be<00:01:16.750> in<00:01:16.840> this<00:01:16.990> tank<00:01:17.170> than

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
I would much rather be in this tank than

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.149 
I would much rather be in this tank than
like<00:01:17.500> let's<00:01:17.770> say<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:18.009> Panther<00:01:18.310> 88<00:01:18.670> this<00:01:19.119> is

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
like let's say the Panther 88 this is

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.240 
like let's say the Panther 88 this is
now<00:01:21.159> the<00:01:21.220> Panther<00:01:21.520> 88<00:01:21.759> has<00:01:21.909> a<00:01:21.940> better<00:01:22.149> gun<00:01:23.250> it's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
now the Panther 88 has a better gun it's

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.560 
now the Panther 88 has a better gun it's
about<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.610> same<00:01:24.790> rate<00:01:24.850> of<00:01:25.090> fire<00:01:25.240> looking

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
about the same rate of fire looking

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.719 
about the same rate of fire looking
every<00:01:25.750> six<00:01:25.960> seconds<00:01:26.290> you're<00:01:26.440> firing<00:01:26.649> 6277<00:01:29.729> but

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
every six seconds you're firing 6277 but

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.580 
every six seconds you're firing 6277 but
this<00:01:30.850> has<00:01:31.000> got<00:01:31.180> a<00:01:31.630> much<00:01:31.930> lower<00:01:32.110> profile<00:01:32.560> than

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
this has got a much lower profile than

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.840 
this has got a much lower profile than
both<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:32.950> CDC<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.990> anther<00:01:35.530> 88<00:01:35.920> I<00:01:36.310> don't

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
around the back m6 just died time to

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.380 
around the back m6 just died time to
move<00:02:14.330> out<00:02:15.370> so<00:02:16.370> my<00:02:16.490> one<00:02:16.670> complaint<00:02:16.970> is<00:02:17.300> the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
move out so my one complaint is the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.780 
move out so my one complaint is the
mobility<00:02:17.810> but<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.410> has<00:02:18.650> like<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.430> said<00:02:19.640> it's<00:02:19.730> a

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
mobility but it has like I said it's a

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:20.980 
mobility but it has like I said it's a
slightly<00:02:20.000> better<00:02:20.180> armor<00:02:20.540> so<00:02:20.660> you're<00:02:20.780> kind<00:02:20.960> of

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
slightly better armor so you're kind of

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.800 
slightly better armor so you're kind of
like<00:02:21.110> in<00:02:21.230> an<00:02:21.320> armored<00:02:21.710> or<00:02:22.040> better<00:02:22.670> Harvard<00:02:23.120> t44

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
like in an armored or better Harvard t44

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.590 
like in an armored or better Harvard t44
now

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
now

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.150 
now
next<00:02:25.020> shot<00:02:25.170> off<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.470> jack<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.770> other<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.040> be

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
next shot off the jack the other to be

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.430 
next shot off the jack the other to be
bounced

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
bounced

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.220 
bounced
now<00:02:29.250> it's<00:02:29.430> not<00:02:29.610> perfect<00:02:30.240> don't<00:02:30.810> get<00:02:30.930> me<00:02:31.050> wrong

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
now it's not perfect don't get me wrong

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.080 
now it's not perfect don't get me wrong
it's<00:02:31.770> still<00:02:31.860> most<00:02:32.460> tanks<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:32.940> run

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
it's still most tanks that you run

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.310 
it's still most tanks that you run
against<00:02:33.300> competitor<00:02:33.750> 8<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.930> if<00:02:34.020> they<00:02:34.110> get<00:02:34.230> the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
against competitor 8 you if they get the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.520 
against competitor 8 you if they get the
right<00:02:34.470> angle<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:35.300> think<00:02:36.300> 120<00:02:36.780> on<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.350> turret

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
right angle so I think 120 on the turret

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.340 
right angle so I think 120 on the turret
and<00:02:37.860> maybe<00:02:38.190> like<00:02:38.430> 100<00:02:38.820> on<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.720> front<00:02:39.960> we'll

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
and maybe like 100 on the front we'll

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.820 
and maybe like 100 on the front we'll
take<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.530> look<00:02:40.620> after<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.950> battles<00:02:41.810> yeah<00:02:42.830> we'll

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
take a look after the battles yeah we'll

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.740 
take a look after the battles yeah we'll
see<00:02:43.980> but<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.640> think<00:02:45.120> when<00:02:45.210> we<00:02:45.300> go<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.420> do<00:02:45.630> the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
see but I think when we go to do the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.300 
see but I think when we go to do the
review<00:02:46.050> will<00:02:46.170> do<00:02:46.350> more<00:02:46.500> detailed<00:02:46.890> stats<00:02:47.160> this

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
review will do more detailed stats this

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.550 
review will do more detailed stats this
order<00:02:47.700> standard-issue<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.330> tank<00:02:48.540> but<00:02:48.780> it

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
order standard-issue the tank but it

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.780 
order standard-issue the tank but it
definitely<00:02:49.740> has<00:02:49.980> more<00:02:50.130> armor<00:02:50.430> on<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.610> front

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
definitely has more armor on the front

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.710 
definitely has more armor on the front
of<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.910> third<00:02:51.030> day<00:02:51.270> at<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.420> front<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.630> the

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
of the third day at the front of the

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.330 
of the third day at the front of the
bond<00:02:52.490> the<00:02:53.490> whole

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
bond the whole

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.150 
bond the whole
so<00:02:56.030> that<00:02:56.360> does<00:02:56.540> help<00:02:56.690> a<00:02:56.810> lot<00:02:56.959> now<00:02:57.769> here's<00:02:58.010> our

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
so that does help a lot now here's our

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.440 
so that does help a lot now here's our
teams<00:02:58.400> of<00:02:58.550> good<00:02:58.700> standing<00:02:58.910> but<00:02:59.269> watch<00:02:59.420> what

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
teams of good standing but watch what

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.650 
teams of good standing but watch what
happens<00:02:59.629> they<00:03:00.080> kind<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:01.030> some<00:03:02.030> Schmucks<00:03:02.360> going

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
happens they kind of some Schmucks going

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.660 
happens they kind of some Schmucks going
on<00:03:02.810> here<00:03:03.050> I<00:03:03.230> still<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:04.190> don't<00:03:04.310> want<00:03:04.489> to<00:03:04.550> say<00:03:04.640> I

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670

on here I still I don't want to say I
saved<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.120> game<00:03:05.269> because<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:05.569> certainly

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
saved the game because I certainly

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.619 
saved the game because I certainly
didn't<00:03:06.230> save<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.560> game<00:03:06.940> but<00:03:07.940> I<00:03:08.360> definitely

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
didn't save the game but I definitely

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.080 
didn't save the game but I definitely

helped win the game with the guys that

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.430 
helped win the game with the guys that
we<00:03:11.209> had<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.450> is-3<00:03:11.840> did<00:03:11.959> a<00:03:12.019> good<00:03:12.140> job<00:03:12.200> two

up<00:03:16.730> coming<00:03:16.910> after<00:03:17.239> him<00:03:17.390> you'll<00:03:18.170> see

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.340 

so<00:03:21.100> yeah<00:03:21.250> if<00:03:21.490> you<00:03:21.700> like<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.970> t44<00:03:22.570> you're

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
so yeah if you like the t44 you're

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.310 
so yeah if you like the t44 you're
definitely<00:03:23.470> gonna<00:03:23.710> like<00:03:23.860> this<00:03:23.980> tank<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:25.320> you

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
definitely gonna like this tank and you

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.120 
definitely gonna like this tank and you
know<00:03:26.410> it's<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.460> same<00:03:27.670> kind<00:03:28.360> of<00:03:28.480> gameplay<00:03:29.130> just

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
know it's the same kind of gameplay just

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.790 
know it's the same kind of gameplay just
a<00:03:30.220> little<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.640> little<00:03:30.730> slower<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:32.500> so<00:03:32.650> you<00:03:32.710> have

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
a little a little slower and so you have

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.530 
a little a little slower and so you have
to<00:03:32.950> be<00:03:33.010> careful<00:03:33.190> not<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.700> you<00:03:34.000> know<00:03:34.090> like<00:03:34.420> if

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
to be careful not to you know like if

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.760 
to be careful not to you know like if
you're<00:03:34.660> thinking<00:03:34.780> of<00:03:34.960> pushing<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.350> tank<00:03:35.560> you're

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
you're thinking of pushing a tank you're

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.320 
you're thinking of pushing a tank you're
not<00:03:35.920> probably<00:03:36.310> gonna<00:03:36.400> be<00:03:36.550> it<00:03:36.610> you<00:03:36.910> might<00:03:37.180> be

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
not probably gonna be it you might be

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.790 
not probably gonna be it you might be
able<00:03:37.390> to<00:03:37.480> i'll<00:03:37.750> turn<00:03:37.930> his<00:03:38.110> turret<00:03:38.410> fees<00:03:38.620> look

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
able to i'll turn his turret fees look

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.700 
able to i'll turn his turret fees look
at<00:03:38.920> a<00:03:38.950> slow<00:03:39.190> turret<00:03:40.140> but<00:03:41.140> it's<00:03:41.290> not<00:03:41.440> gonna<00:03:41.560> be

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
at a slow turret but it's not gonna be

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.900 
at a slow turret but it's not gonna be
an<00:03:41.800> all<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.070> time<00:03:42.220> thing<00:03:42.460> you<00:03:42.640> got<00:03:42.760> to<00:03:42.790> be

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
an all the time thing you got to be

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.940 
an all the time thing you got to be
careful<00:03:43.030> because<00:03:43.360> this<00:03:43.840> tank<00:03:44.050> is<00:03:44.170> not<00:03:44.440> moving

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
careful because this tank is not moving

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.670 
careful because this tank is not moving
as<00:03:45.070> fast<00:03:45.100> as<00:03:45.520> the<00:03:45.580> t44<00:03:46.180> so<00:03:46.420> it's<00:03:46.570> not<00:03:46.690> let's<00:03:47.590> see

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
as fast as the t44 so it's not let's see

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.900 
as fast as the t44 so it's not let's see
44<00:03:48.040> porters<00:03:48.730> on<00:03:48.910> scout<00:03:49.240> like<00:03:50.340> this<00:03:51.340> car<00:03:51.550> I

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
44 porters on scout like this car I

all<00:05:48.169> by<00:05:48.319> himself<00:05:48.439> and<00:05:48.830> I'm<00:05:48.919> thinking<00:05:49.490> man<00:05:49.849> I

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:50.089 
all by himself and I'm thinking man I

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:51.699 
all by himself and I'm thinking man I
just<00:05:50.360> went<00:05:50.479> the<00:05:50.539> wrong<00:05:50.659> way<00:05:50.719> but<00:05:51.199> I<00:05:51.379> think<00:05:51.619> it

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:51.709 
just went the wrong way but I think it

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:55.449 
just went the wrong way but I think it
then<00:05:51.830> something<00:05:52.279> is<00:05:54.009> three<00:05:55.009> is<00:05:55.099> playing<00:05:55.339> it

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:55.459 
then something is three is playing it

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:57.519 
then something is three is playing it
smart<00:05:55.669> he's<00:05:55.909> got<00:05:56.119> cover<00:05:56.389> there<00:05:56.659> with<00:05:56.839> that<00:05:56.869> I

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:57.529 
smart he's got cover there with that I

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:00.480 
smart he's got cover there with that I
think<00:05:57.860> it's<00:05:57.979> the<00:05:58.129> little<00:05:59.110> there's<00:06:00.110> that

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
think it's the little there's that

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.679 
think it's the little there's that
Walder<00:06:01.490> that<00:06:01.699> he's<00:06:01.819> hiding<00:06:02.149> behind<00:06:02.270> so<00:06:02.659> they

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:02.689 
Walder that he's hiding behind so they

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:04.869 
Walder that he's hiding behind so they
can't<00:06:02.990> get<00:06:03.169> good<00:06:03.319> hits<00:06:03.589> on<00:06:03.740> him<00:06:03.889> I<00:06:04.129> don't<00:06:04.819> think

going<00:07:39.750> in<00:07:39.840> this<00:07:39.960> tank<00:07:40.169> but<00:07:40.349> it's<00:07:40.500> a<00:07:40.760> definitely

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:41.760 
going in this tank but it's a definitely

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.129 
going in this tank but it's a definitely
a<00:07:41.820> bruiser<00:07:42.030> for<00:07:42.360> sure<00:07:42.450> it's<00:07:42.750> just<00:07:42.900> like<00:07:43.020> the

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:43.139 
a bruiser for sure it's just like the

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:44.990 
a bruiser for sure it's just like the
t44<00:07:43.710> the<00:07:43.889> only<00:07:44.039> downside<00:07:44.400> is<00:07:44.430> a<00:07:44.550> little<00:07:44.910> bit

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 
t44 the only downside is a little bit

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.640 
t44 the only downside is a little bit
slower<00:07:45.240> but<00:07:45.539> the<00:07:45.660> upside<00:07:45.810> is<00:07:46.020> it<00:07:46.320> has<00:07:46.440> better

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:46.650 
slower but the upside is it has better

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.890 
slower but the upside is it has better
armor<00:07:47.070> so<00:07:47.310> you're<00:07:47.490> kind<00:07:47.669> of<00:07:47.729> you<00:07:48.389> trading<00:07:48.780> off

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:48.900 
armor so you're kind of you trading off

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.640 
armor so you're kind of you trading off
speed<00:07:49.260> for<00:07:49.880> armor<00:07:50.880> so<00:07:51.210> I<00:07:51.449> am<00:07:51.990> still<00:07:52.199> using<00:07:52.349> the

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:52.650 
speed for armor so I am still using the

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.800 
speed for armor so I am still using the
lend-lease<00:07:52.919> oil<00:07:53.280> because<00:07:53.669> I<00:07:53.699> want<00:07:54.000> to<00:07:54.150> have

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:54.810 
lend-lease oil because I want to have

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.450 
lend-lease oil because I want to have
that<00:07:54.960> little<00:07:55.139> bit<00:07:55.349> of<00:07:55.380> an<00:07:55.530> extra<00:07:55.830> boost<00:07:56.010> to<00:07:56.370> the

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:56.460 
that little bit of an extra boost to the

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.820 
that little bit of an extra boost to the
engine<00:07:56.789> definitely<00:07:57.150> needs<00:07:57.360> it<00:07:57.539> so<00:07:57.840> alright

00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:58.830 
engine definitely needs it so alright

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:08.559 
engine definitely needs it so alright
guys<00:07:59.039> I<00:07:59.340> will<00:07:59.460> see<00:07:59.760> you<00:08:00.360> on<00:08:00.539> the<00:08:00.630> battlefield
