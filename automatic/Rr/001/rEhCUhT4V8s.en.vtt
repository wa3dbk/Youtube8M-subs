00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.330 
going to resize everything and make sure
it<00:01:59.320> fits<00:01:59.710> I<00:01:59.920> move<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:01.210> picture<00:02:02.020> of<00:02:02.410> the<00:02:02.650> pie<00:02:03.010> to

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
it fits I move the picture of the pie to

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:12.559 
it fits I move the picture of the pie to
the<00:02:03.640> top

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.949 

I<00:02:13.430> also<00:02:14.430> have<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.849> crop<00:02:15.090> picture<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:15.930> that

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
I also have to crop picture so that

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.589 
I also have to crop picture so that
in-state<00:02:16.560> in<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.829> square<00:02:17.129> box<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.299> is

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
in-state in the square box and that is

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.020 
in-state in the square box and that is
how<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:21.840> get<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.409> Polaroid<00:02:22.739> edit<00:02:23.400> which<00:02:23.790> I

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
how you get the Polaroid edit which I

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.319 
how you get the Polaroid edit which I
think<00:02:24.269> it's<00:02:24.510> really<00:02:24.840> easy<00:02:25.170> into<00:02:25.849> now<00:02:26.849> on<00:02:27.120> to

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
think it's really easy into now on to

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.330 
think it's really easy into now on to
the<00:02:27.480> second<00:02:27.840> edit<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.379> I<00:02:28.500> said<00:02:28.709> earlier<00:02:29.099> I

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
the second edit like I said earlier I

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.000 
the second edit like I said earlier I
always<00:02:29.760> lend<00:02:30.030> my<00:02:30.180> pictures<00:02:30.540> in<00:02:30.780> Cisco<00:02:31.200> cam<00:02:31.440> to

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
always lend my pictures in Cisco cam to

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.440 
always lend my pictures in Cisco cam to
add<00:02:32.159> a<00:02:32.190> filter<00:02:32.459> risk<00:02:32.790> because<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.360> like<00:02:33.659> it<00:02:35.450> so

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
add a filter risk because I like it so

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.449 
add a filter risk because I like it so
the<00:02:36.659> first<00:02:36.840> offense<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.349> always<00:02:37.620> try<00:02:37.829> out<00:02:37.980> or<00:02:38.159> t1

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.089 
the first offense I always try out or t1
+<00:02:38.909> f2<00:02:39.390> but<00:02:39.629> if<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.840> don't<00:02:39.900> like<00:02:40.319> those<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.890> I'll

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
+ f2 but if I don't like those and I'll

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.800

try the other ones out and for this

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.690 
try the other ones out and for this
setup<00:02:43.109> I<00:02:43.439> really<00:02:44.040> like<00:02:44.189> the<00:02:44.310> way<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.459> looks

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
setup I really like the way it looks

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.809 
setup I really like the way it looks
with<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:45.090> filter<00:02:45.599> m5<00:02:46.159> after<00:02:47.159> that<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.519> just

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
with the filter m5 after that I just

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.190 
with the filter m5 after that I just
played<00:02:48.000> around<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.390> is<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:48.690> exposure

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
played around this is the exposure

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.759 
played around this is the exposure
contrast<00:02:50.150> whatever<00:02:51.150> until<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.930> ended<00:02:52.379> up<00:02:52.500> with

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
contrast whatever until I ended up with

00:02:52.769 --> 00:03:03.140 
contrast whatever until I ended up with
a<00:02:52.950> good<00:02:53.400> result<00:03:01.220> for<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.370> majority<00:03:02.700> of<00:03:02.879> my

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
a good result for the majority of my

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.819 
a good result for the majority of my
pictures<00:03:03.569> I<00:03:03.750> don't<00:03:03.840> like<00:03:04.139> the<00:03:04.290> way<00:03:04.440> they<00:03:04.650> look

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
pictures I don't like the way they look

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.369 
pictures I don't like the way they look
crop<00:03:05.159> so<00:03:05.639> I<00:03:05.700> use<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.150> AB<00:03:06.299> square<00:03:06.720> ready<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.260> add

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
crop so I use the AB square ready to add

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.160 
crop so I use the AB square ready to add
white<00:03:07.739> borders<00:03:08.190> around<00:03:08.549> my<00:03:08.970> picture<00:03:09.359> and<00:03:10.019> that

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
white borders around my picture and that

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.319 
white borders around my picture and that
way<00:03:10.319> I<00:03:10.349> can<00:03:10.560> fit<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.040> entire<00:03:11.340> picture<00:03:11.819> in<00:03:12.030> and

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
way I can fit the entire picture in and

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.180 
way I can fit the entire picture in and
still<00:03:12.720> put<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:12.989> on<00:03:13.170> Instagram<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:16.040> took<00:03:17.040> this

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.349 
next photo on a plane of New York City
so<00:03:19.680> because<00:03:19.980> of<00:03:20.129> the<00:03:20.250> lighting<00:03:20.639> and<00:03:21.060> the

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
so because of the lighting and the

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.900 
so because of the lighting and the
window<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:21.989> everything<00:03:22.169> it's<00:03:22.620> very<00:03:22.769> blue<00:03:23.549> I

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
window and everything it's very blue I

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.879 
window and everything it's very blue I
didn't<00:03:24.629> like<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.870> way<00:03:24.989> it<00:03:25.139> looks<00:03:25.349> so<00:03:25.530> I

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
didn't like the way it looks so I

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.099 
didn't like the way it looks so I
changed<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.609> temperature<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.449> exposure

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
changed the temperature and exposure

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.860 
changed the temperature and exposure
until<00:03:28.889> it<00:03:29.280> was<00:03:29.400> more<00:03:29.609> of<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.849> grayish<00:03:30.090> color<00:03:30.299> and

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
until it was more of a grayish color and

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.259 
until it was more of a grayish color and
then<00:03:31.410> I<00:03:31.440> went<00:03:31.739> into<00:03:31.889> after<00:03:32.310> light<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.790> add<00:03:32.940> one

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
then I went into after light to add one

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.599 
then I went into after light to add one
of<00:03:33.329> my<00:03:33.389> favorite<00:03:33.989> things<00:03:34.349> ever<00:03:34.590> it's<00:03:35.160> called<00:03:35.489> a

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
lightly and I just try them all out

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.180 
lightly and I just try them all out
until<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:39.750> found<00:03:40.139> one<00:03:40.410> that<00:03:40.530> I<00:03:40.620> really<00:03:40.650> liked

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
because the overall scheme of the

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.580 
because the overall scheme of the
picture<00:03:44.609> was<00:03:44.760> still<00:03:45.000> blue<00:03:45.299> I<00:03:45.329> decided<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:46.230> add
