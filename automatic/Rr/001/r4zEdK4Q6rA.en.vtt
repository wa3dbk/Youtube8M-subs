thought mr. Bell away should be allowed
to<00:00:10.320> stay<00:00:10.620> in<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.950> UK<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.730> think<00:00:12.509> there's

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
to stay in the UK I think there's

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.959 
to stay in the UK I think there's
several<00:00:12.870> issues<00:00:13.110> here<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:14.040> thing<00:00:14.670> really

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
several issues here the thing really

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.090 
several issues here the thing really
stands<00:00:15.420> over<00:00:15.599> at<00:00:15.750> first<00:00:16.020> glance<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.980> course

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
stands over at first glance is of course

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.279 
stands over at first glance is of course
the<00:00:17.279> issue<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.609> proportionality<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:19.050> was<00:00:19.260> a

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
the issue of proportionality this was a

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.620 
the issue of proportionality this was a
lena<00:00:19.680> altercation<00:00:20.520> which<00:00:21.060> he<00:00:21.270> pleaded<00:00:21.600> guilty

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
lena altercation which he pleaded guilty

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.740 
lena altercation which he pleaded guilty
to<00:00:22.170> but<00:00:22.769> really<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.400> other<00:00:23.880> issue<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.330> you

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
to but really the other issue is you

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.230 
to but really the other issue is you
know<00:00:24.869> this<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.590> man<00:00:25.830> saved<00:00:26.189> 13<00:00:26.760> years<00:00:27.060> and

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
know this this man saved 13 years and

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.500 
know this this man saved 13 years and
did<00:00:27.779> five<00:00:28.109> operational<00:00:28.859> tours<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:30.060> he's<00:00:30.330> done

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
did five operational tours so he's done

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.470 
did five operational tours so he's done
his<00:00:30.750> bit<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.349> nation<00:00:32.059> but<00:00:33.059> mr.<00:00:33.329> Bell

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
his bit for this nation but mr. Bell

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.630 
his bit for this nation but mr. Bell
away<00:00:33.750> faced<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.469> military<00:00:34.829> summary<00:00:35.190> hearing

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
away faced a military summary hearing

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.130 
away faced a military summary hearing
which<00:00:35.880> equates<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.420> conviction<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:37.050> a

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
which equates to a conviction in a

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.840 
which equates to a conviction in a
civilian<00:00:37.530> court<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.309> rules<00:00:38.520> are<00:00:38.640> very<00:00:38.760> clear

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
civilian court the rules are very clear

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.200 
civilian court the rules are very clear
on<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.480> aren't<00:00:39.870> they<00:00:40.579> yes<00:00:41.579> they<00:00:41.610> are<00:00:41.879> indeed

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
on this aren't they yes they are indeed

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.000 
on this aren't they yes they are indeed
in<00:00:42.450> fact<00:00:42.480> but<00:00:42.960> that's<00:00:43.230> not<00:00:43.379> that's<00:00:43.860> not

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
in fact but that's not that's not

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.279 
in fact but that's not that's not
necessarily<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.879> reason<00:00:45.480> for<00:00:45.629> agreeing<00:00:45.960> with

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
necessarily a reason for agreeing with

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.170 
necessarily a reason for agreeing with
it<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.590> think<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.920> whole<00:00:47.100> issue<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.550> one<00:00:48.030> of

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
it I think the whole issue is one of

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.990 
it I think the whole issue is one of
proportionality<00:00:49.280> he's<00:00:50.280> not<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> only<00:00:50.610> case

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
proportionality he's not the only case

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.150 
proportionality he's not the only case
we've<00:00:51.239> got<00:00:51.510> we've<00:00:51.840> got<00:00:52.079> many<00:00:52.350> many<00:00:52.530> cases<00:00:52.829> list

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
we've got we've got many many cases list

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.580 
we've got we've got many many cases list
only<00:00:53.760> last<00:00:54.000> week<00:00:54.090> at<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.480> serving<00:00:54.870> soldier<00:00:55.140> come

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
only last week at a serving soldier come

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.619 
only last week at a serving soldier come
in<00:00:55.739> who'd<00:00:56.340> got<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> killers<00:00:57.210> driving

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
in who'd got a killers driving

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.689 
in who'd got a killers driving
conviction<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.010> course<00:00:59.039> I've<00:00:59.340> never<00:00:59.550> been

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
conviction and of course I've never been

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.270 
conviction and of course I've never been
taken<00:01:00.059> into<00:01:00.210> account<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.829> that's<00:01:02.100> his

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
taken into account and and that's his

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.219 
taken into account and and that's his
perception<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.750> what<00:01:03.930> are<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
perception of it so what are the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.840 
perception of it so what are the
implications<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:05.100> other<00:01:05.159> Commonwealth

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
implications for other Commonwealth

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.090 
implications for other Commonwealth
personnel<00:01:06.420> should<00:01:06.659> mr.<00:01:06.900> by<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.200> way<00:01:07.409> fail<00:01:07.890> to

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
personnel should mr. by the way fail to

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.510 
personnel should mr. by the way fail to
overturn<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.850> decision<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:10.310> think<00:01:11.310> that

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
overturn this decision I think that

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.280 
overturn this decision I think that
they're<00:01:11.760> enormous<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.390> enormous<00:01:12.689> even<00:01:13.140> for

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
they're enormous that enormous even for

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.320 
they're enormous that enormous even for
the<00:01:13.350> army<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.430> say<00:01:14.460> none<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> this

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
the army and I have to say none of this

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.600 
the army and I have to say none of this
really<00:01:15.780> has<00:01:16.470> got<00:01:16.680> anything<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:17.369> with<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
really has got anything to do with the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.719 
really has got anything to do with the
army<00:01:17.880> these<00:01:18.060> are<00:01:18.240> imposed<00:01:18.630> rules<00:01:18.930> but<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.460> think

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
army these are imposed rules but I think

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.640 
army these are imposed rules but I think
the<00:01:20.820> implications<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.630> recruiting<00:01:22.080> for

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the implications for recruiting for

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.120 
the implications for recruiting for
retention<00:01:23.009> are<00:01:23.880> quite<00:01:24.720> staggering<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.950> all

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
retention are quite staggering and all

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.410 
retention are quite staggering and all

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
following Commonwealth soldiers so this

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.770 
following Commonwealth soldiers so this
is<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> vital<00:01:47.159> issue<00:01:47.310> do<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.299> think<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.600> Armed

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
is a vital issue do you think the Armed

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.510 
is a vital issue do you think the Armed
Forces<00:01:48.840> should<00:01:49.439> reconsider<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.189> way<00:01:50.310> in

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
Forces should reconsider the way in

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.999 
Forces should reconsider the way in
which<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.729> disciplines<00:01:51.420> its<00:01:51.960> personnel<00:01:52.680> in

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
which it disciplines its personnel in

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.830 
which it disciplines its personnel in
light<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.579> kind<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:54.000> case<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.570> order<00:01:54.630> to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
light of this kind of case in order to

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.920 
light of this kind of case in order to
protect<00:01:54.990> them<00:01:55.380> further<00:01:56.420> well<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.509> think<00:01:57.750> I

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
protect them further well I think I

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.870 
protect them further well I think I
think<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.770> really<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.189> Armed<00:01:59.340> Forces<00:01:59.399> do

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
think that really the Armed Forces do

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.520 
think that really the Armed Forces do
need<00:02:00.090> discipline<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.899> wouldn't<00:02:01.200> I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
need discipline and I wouldn't I

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.800 
need discipline and I wouldn't I
wouldn't<00:02:01.590> argue<00:02:02.040> otherwise<00:02:02.369> but<00:02:03.360> what<00:02:03.719> I

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
wouldn't argue otherwise but what I

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.109 
wouldn't argue otherwise but what I
think<00:02:04.049> needs<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.380> happen<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
think needs to happen is is that the

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.880 
think needs to happen is is that the
government<00:02:06.659> need<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.990> look<00:02:07.200> at<00:02:07.380> what's<00:02:07.770> going

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
government need to look at what's going

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.070 
government need to look at what's going
on<00:02:08.129> here<00:02:08.369> what<00:02:08.640> we've<00:02:08.789> seen<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.450> every

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
on here what we've seen is that every

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.830 
on here what we've seen is that every
department<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.830> actually<00:02:11.489> following<00:02:11.910> their

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
department is actually following their

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.559 
department is actually following their
rules<00:02:13.019> and<00:02:13.410> applying<00:02:14.160> them<00:02:14.310> as<00:02:14.550> such<00:02:14.760> what<00:02:15.300> no

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
rules and applying them as such what no

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.390 
rules and applying them as such what no
one<00:02:15.750> really<00:02:16.050> worked<00:02:16.260> out<00:02:16.500> was<00:02:16.830> what<00:02:17.190> would

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
one really worked out was what would

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.550 
one really worked out was what would
happen<00:02:17.819> when<00:02:18.300> there<00:02:18.450> was<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.569> chemical<00:02:18.989> mix<00:02:19.349> of

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
happen when there was a chemical mix of

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.800 
happen when there was a chemical mix of
all<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:20.010> these<00:02:20.160> working<00:02:20.910> together<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.480> it's

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
all of these working together and it's

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.839 
all of these working together and it's
been<00:02:22.050> caustic<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:23.040> not<00:02:23.280> only<00:02:23.430> for<00:02:23.730> this

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
been caustic and not only for this

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.640 
been caustic and not only for this
family<00:02:24.090> it's<00:02:24.390> almost<00:02:24.599> devastating<00:02:25.349> for<00:02:25.530> this

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
family it's almost devastating for this

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.130 
family it's almost devastating for this
family<00:02:25.890> but<00:02:26.550> for<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:27.330> know<00:02:27.450> all<00:02:27.690> fallen

family but for you know all fallen
Commonwealth<00:02:28.560> soldiers<00:02:29.069> how<00:02:29.819> confident<00:02:30.330> are

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
Commonwealth soldiers how confident are

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.300 
Commonwealth soldiers how confident are
you<00:02:30.569> that<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.989> might<00:02:31.260> be<00:02:31.470> able<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.709> get<00:02:32.040> a

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
you that you might be able to get a

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.550 
you that you might be able to get a
change<00:02:33.239> in<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.629> rules<00:02:33.900> as<00:02:34.170> far<00:02:34.410> as

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
change in the rules as far as

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.229 
change in the rules as far as
Commonwealth<00:02:35.069> soldiers<00:02:35.549> are<00:02:35.670> concerned<00:02:36.090> and

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
Commonwealth soldiers are concerned and

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.539 
Commonwealth soldiers are concerned and
in<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.200> way<00:02:37.349> that<00:02:37.620> these<00:02:37.769> kind<00:02:38.069> of<00:02:38.129> cases<00:02:38.340> are

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
in the way that these kind of cases are

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.890 
in the way that these kind of cases are
interpreted<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.830> think<00:02:41.569> many<00:02:42.569> of<00:02:42.720> your<00:02:42.840> viewers

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
interpreted I think many of your viewers

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.110 
interpreted I think many of your viewers
will<00:02:43.349> know<00:02:43.379> that<00:02:43.650> veterans<00:02:44.099> eat<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.400> very<00:02:44.940> much

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
will know that veterans eat is very much

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.350 
will know that veterans eat is very much
a<00:02:45.150> frontline<00:02:46.130> fighting<00:02:47.130> organization<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:48.269> we

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
a frontline fighting organization and we

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.039 
a frontline fighting organization and we
are<00:02:48.480> not<00:02:48.630> about<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.790> desist<00:02:50.790> here<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.450> think

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
are not about to desist here so I think

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.660 
are not about to desist here so I think
we<00:02:52.170> will<00:02:52.319> keep<00:02:52.500> pushing<00:02:52.890> we're<00:02:53.250> pushing<00:02:53.489> at

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
we will keep pushing we're pushing at

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.059 
we will keep pushing we're pushing at
the<00:02:53.730> very<00:02:53.940> highest<00:02:54.209> levels<00:02:54.750> because<00:02:55.349> this<00:02:55.860> was

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
the very highest levels because this was

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.849 
the very highest levels because this was
never<00:02:56.280> meant<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.730> be
