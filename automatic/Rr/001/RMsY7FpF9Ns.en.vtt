exchange so obviously you do have to

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.810 
exchange so obviously you do have to
sacrifice<00:03:03.240> a<00:03:03.990> XP<00:03:04.560> bank<00:03:04.740> in<00:03:04.980> order<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.370> get<00:03:05.640> an

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
XP exchange but that doesn't really

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.850 
XP exchange but that doesn't really
matter<00:03:08.790> because<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.300> is<00:03:09.690> such<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.960> cool<00:03:10.320> mod<00:03:10.620> I

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
matter because this is such a cool mod I

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.670 
matter because this is such a cool mod I
don't<00:03:11.550> think<00:03:11.850> you'd<00:03:12.030> really<00:03:12.270> need<00:03:12.680> anything

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
don't think you'd really need anything

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.640
