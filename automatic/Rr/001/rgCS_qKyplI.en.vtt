00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 induction engines exercise tells us the 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.649
 enunciated exercise that a motor of 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.280
 three-phase induction 220 volts and one 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.910
 54-pole industry frequency can 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.160
 a load whose resistant torque is 6.5 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.130
 n by m knowing that the engine absorbs 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.760
 the network 1200 watts and that its performance 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.890
 is 0 82 asks us to determine the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.900
 speed its axis and displacement 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.789
 for calculation of shaft speed 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.830
 we need to know what is the power 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.680
 useful engine for that we have 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.070
 established the formula that tells us that 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.050
 the power absorbed by n in this case 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.700
 in is the engine performance speed 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.370
 of speed 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.500
 is equal to the useful power 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.010
 entering the data in the formula 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.980
 that would be at 1200 watts of power 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.559
 absorbed by zero as 82 that the 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.930
 performance speed we would be left 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.930
 the equivalent result to 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.750
 984 watts this would be the first 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:12.460
 result that would have depending on 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.460
 calculate the speed of 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.420
 then we should calculate to solve 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.690
 the exercise to regulate them and their 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.390
 axis the angular speed depending on 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.580
 the power from the motor pad is 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.690
 we define it in the formula with 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:36.100
 coefficient of the angle is equal 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:39.010
 to the useful power over m 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.580
 in this case m is the torque of the motor that 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.520
 they tell us that it is of resistance of 6.5 n 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.540
 for me this is the same when replacing 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.430
 the data 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:54.490
 it is not 184 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.539
 guards over 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.539
 6.5 nm 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.610
 as we see the result of 984 watts is 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.190
 the result you gave us of the exercise 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.930
 previous where we calculate the power 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.840
 useful then we use it for 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:16.190
 calculate the insular speed in function 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.450
 of useful power and torque of the motor 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.450
 the result of this gives us 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:27.090
 151 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:31.550
 38 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.550
 radian is about seconds 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.870
 and with this we have the second result 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.110
 and we proceed 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.410
 to calculate the speed of the field 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.450
 magnetic or syndrome 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.940
 and this is that this speed 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.430
 is in the formulas to calculate the 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.430
 shaft speed displacement 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.810
 the speed of the magnetic field we 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.720
 is given by the formula 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.040
 n 1 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.050
 that would be equal to 60 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.610
 by the frequency 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.610
 about p 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.690
 in this case p is the engine torque we 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.299
 says that the engine has four poles and 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.489
 therefore they would be two pairs in the engine and 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.799
 that would be two positive poles and two 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.950
 negative poles to generate the field 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.950
 magnetic 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.670
 when entering the data the way with 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.340
 which is 60 the engine has a 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.670
 frequency of 50 g 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.300
 about the pairs of dust the result 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.300
 Is the equivalent 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.670
 1500 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.060
 revolutions per minute 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.370
 I want that means we have the 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:00.830
 magnetic field rotating 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.830
 at one thousand five hundred revolutions per minute 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.410
 here are the formulas is that of the 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.310
 fast and angular and this is the one of the 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.310
 useful power 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.410
 with this we have already found all of them 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.420
 the clearances to get the formula 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.720
 of the speed of the axis that comes to us 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.710
 marked with many 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.710
 it's the same 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.360
 to 60 by angular velocity 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:34.349
 about two for you 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:45.099
 this would be equal to 60 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.099
 by 151 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:53.570
 38 as it gave us a quick and angular 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.570
 about two by pi 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:58.689
 the result of this is given to us 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.990
 400 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.250
 46.3 revolutions per minute 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:25.499
 and with this we have found the speed 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:25.499
 From the axis 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:32.139
 that we have calculated with the formula 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.500
 which is the equivalent of 60 for the 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:38.050
 angular velocity between 2 per pi and we have 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.090
 found the shaft speed 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.550
 now we are finally going with the 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.940
 Sliding the slip will be 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.840
 same according to the formula 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.470
 s 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.470
 It does not matter 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.360
 to n1 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.720
 - l 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.340
 about n 1 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.340
 this is the same as we say 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:09.050
 1500 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:11.889
 one thousand 446 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.889
 like three 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.080
 on 

00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:19.769
 1500 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.210
 these are the revolutions per minute 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:26.580
 that they gave us the magnetic field that the 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:30.950
 shaft speed and this is a 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:33.290
 equivalent to 0 37 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:36.350
 as speed is always expressed in 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:38.720
 a 037 percentage taking it to a 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.180
 numerical scale of percentages we 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:45.610
 would be the equivalent 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.610
 to 37 % 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.190
 being time achieved and being able to clarify 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.070
 some doubts you have about the 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:57.460
 Calculation of AC motors 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:59.910
 you can link this video and see it many 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.910
 Thank you
