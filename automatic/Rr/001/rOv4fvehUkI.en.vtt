00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.920 
question I got this quite a lot is why
aren't<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.490> moving<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:51.060> with<00:01:51.360> Jordi<00:01:51.750> and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
aren't you moving in with Jordi and

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.789 
aren't you moving in with Jordi and
jelly<00:01:52.290> now<00:01:53.450> not<00:01:54.450> only<00:01:54.810> could<00:01:55.049> they<00:01:55.140> not<00:01:55.320> handle

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
jelly now not only could they not handle

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.990 
jelly now not only could they not handle
me<00:01:55.950> but<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:57.090> main<00:01:57.750> reason<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:58.530> because<00:01:59.000> I

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
me but the main reason is because I

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.270 
me but the main reason is because I
can't<00:02:00.299> actually<00:02:00.540> move<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.619> Amsterdam<00:02:02.070> I
