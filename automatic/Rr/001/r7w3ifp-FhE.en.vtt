00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
difference and back then this was

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.120 
difference and back then this was
actually<00:03:39.269> a<00:03:39.420> great<00:03:39.750> training<00:03:40.140> spot<00:03:40.410> well<00:03:40.890> as

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
actually a great training spot well as

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.910

XP<00:03:57.209> was<00:03:57.359> good<00:03:57.569> these<00:03:58.260> days<00:03:58.440> it<00:03:58.709> sucks<00:03:58.889> but<00:03:59.609> you

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
XP was good these days it sucks but you

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.390 
XP was good these days it sucks but you
know<00:04:00.260> it's<00:04:01.260> kind<00:04:01.440> of<00:04:01.470> hard<00:04:01.650> that<00:04:01.920> you<00:04:02.310> know

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
know it's kind of hard that you know

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.400 
know it's kind of hard that you know
it's<00:04:02.549> hard<00:04:02.639> to<00:04:02.790> come<00:04:02.940> diddle<00:04:03.209> over<00:04:03.840> old<00:04:04.049> videos

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
it's hard to come diddle over old videos

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.229 
it's hard to come diddle over old videos
because<00:04:04.739> it's<00:04:05.010> not<00:04:05.100> really<00:04:05.370> well<00:04:05.579> relevant<00:04:06.150> to

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
because it's not really well relevant to

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.960 
because it's not really well relevant to
these<00:04:06.359> get<00:04:06.569> to<00:04:07.019> these<00:04:07.200> days<00:04:07.530> but<00:04:08.489> it's<00:04:08.639> cool<00:04:08.819> to
