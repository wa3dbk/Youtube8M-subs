00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:13.060
 serious in the locker room 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.070
 man depends on the torrent that is said 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.180
 is in a serious tone as it seems that it is 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.280
 saying 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.280
 Well, that could end badly 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.020
 because logically it is clear that 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.360
 we are talking about the best player in 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.620
 world but being precisely in the 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.060
 game of the world has to have the best 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.490
 world behavior both outside 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.810
 as in and above all much more 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.730
 inside and above all to their 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.770
 colleagues and especially for those who 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.309
 they're starting because he when he started 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.920
 and he has said many times that this role 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.360
 I treat the child phenomenally well 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.220
 people that ronaldinho when he starts 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.140
 try as he is supposedly 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.140
 treating the people who supposedly 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.290
 supposedly but you have lengthened the 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.150
 argument so that it gives a little bit the 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.650
 feeling that you give a bit of a 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.650
 certain credibility I give everything 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.020
 but sorry is that it seems to me of a 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.490
 extreme gravity because we are talking 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.190
 of mistreatment 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.710
 we are talking about ex and yes forgiveness of 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.490
 mistreat mistreating yes if you have not 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.490
 made a soccer field 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.420
 I want just as I tell you one thing I 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.520
 I do not know much about Messi but the little 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.250
 I know him and people that I know 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.509
 a lot and he knows him very well that is not a month 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.209
 that is, that portrait he makes is 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.119
 confidential it moves away absolutely from 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:49.750
 the personality of messi neither speaks like that nor 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.819
 he expresses himself this way nor does he know this tone 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.189
 neither this kind of words nor this kind of 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:57.100
 expressions like that I can tell you that 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:00.130
 caused quite by not saying very 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.289
 upset this news I have been able 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.780
 talk to two people from the locker room a 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.780
 player and a person from the locker room and 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.000
 This itself is not very big thing is 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.000
 that they will not give you pabulum nor will 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:25.090
 give or will lengthen euphoria but only 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:27.190
 you have to see what we have seen this 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.609
 late has not treated family that is not a 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.470
 juvenile me if this guy is capable of 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.840
 treat as adapted to da vinci 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.880
 on one occasion but on several occasions 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.280
 in an official match seeing all the 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.750
 world if you are able to deal in a 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.910
 official party has had as it has 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.490
 treated that they are going to tell us of what 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.850
 can happen in workouts I'm not going 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.850
 to consent 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:19.290
 please everything up to what you see the 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.290
 anger of the people 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.590
 information denies the information 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.940
 of the digital confidential 'deny the 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.400
 information of a man is that it does not 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.870
 it's messi that's not true that I think 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.870
 you see on TV is messi 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.549
 but what we see on television 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.549
 putting the abrupt life 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.680
 when we go to 180 revolutions we are 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.680
 in tension 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:07.000
 precious and covers despise it very 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.799
 easy one reader is hired from a 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.090
 person who can read lips and looks 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.709
 what Messi said in the field of 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.510
 it is very easy game first 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.209
 secondly I do not see leo messi 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.729
 being so wild in their schemes to the 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.459
 private is that he is a quiet guy 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.500
 humble enough respectful with people 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.510
 educated, I find it hard to believe, I do not say 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.190
 that is false what has 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.510
 published 'the confidential digital' I say 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.919
 I can not believe it 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.349
 in any case with analyzing the 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.740
 player's lips we could get out of 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:34.740
 quite 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.259
 Eduardo looks at these images and a moment 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:41.750
 you think this is from a person 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:44.210
 simple and good companion 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.960
 the quotes women do not do not say this is 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.960
 the game image 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.370
 but on the pitch between two 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.030
 team players do not emanate the 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:59.830
 bronca Poser 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.830
 I have not ever seen that indolence 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:07.780
 that anger is a fight 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:15.970
 for the row if it repeats two weeks 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.590
 then it's also something else 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.080
 when it is repeated for it it is also 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.760
 normal wonder I was treated no other thing is 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.230
 that I do not give, and I'm 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.880
 saying that he told you I repeat it and 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.040
 I 'm telling you now I'm saying and I'm 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.590
 commenting on some images and words 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.910
 that have come out of a story 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.670
 supposedly if it is so badly done 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:37.030
 Now I'll tell you again if that's done in 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.380
 a wardrobe in a private environment that is 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.910
 outside the pitch project what 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.120
 that makes a game tone pisses off 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.160
 discussions insults normal now in a 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.080
 wardrobe and say it to bad milk that's 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.670
 of bad kind for that to be or not 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.870
 I have no idea to see each idea not 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.860
 we have seen players at hernando del 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.630
 neck to another 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.820
 hitting and I hit 20 thousand times 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.840
 explained many times and then with 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.270
 companions 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.100
 since everything is consumed punctually tve 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.630
 but cable or whatever fernando 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.280
 in those that are to stick with him 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:07.540
 because it's not what I do not remember 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.320
 but listen but there is a row 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:13.810
 but a while back given to sticking three 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.000
 pushes rules but at five 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.260
 minutes of this initiative 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.880
 by saying what he says what 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.620
 allegedly says alexis with what they have 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.190
 paid for you because it 's so bad it's a 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.480
 wardrobe view never 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:31.750
 many do not say things very very much that 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:33.130
 they do a lot of damage they say things that are 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.419
 they say things behind people's backs 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.240
 as has also happened in some cases 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:39.250
 of with messi because we can also 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.890
 refresh the memory around the 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.350
 differences that messi moved over 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.690
 ibrahimovic and we know how that ended 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.310
 when in the barcelona environment they are 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.570
 those problems that at some point 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.110
 had for example with marta that 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:55.840
 They told here is something that I think 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:59.260
 must solve the messi itself if you go 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.419
 having problems with each player what 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:07.960
 will have to solve you listen up 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:11.640
 what a point that looks like a demon 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.640
 Argentine but I feel myself 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:28.150
 crying home every day according to 

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:35.220
 explanation you do not know what's wrong 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:35.220
 tolerates jce that is the best that you do not 

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.500
 tolerates 

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:53.020
 but he is very serious about what is being 

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:57.390
 talking is talking about abuse in 

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:57.390
 a wardrobe towards a player against
