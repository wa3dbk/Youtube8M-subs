 hello to all and all those all 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.450
 under the time 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.820
 listen I hope you're fine 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.560
 for me it's going great we find ourselves 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.039
 today for a two return 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.480
 flea markets 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.580
 so I tell you right now it's 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.630
 not the biggest around my life I 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.310
 found 2 4 6 and 8 10 11 cards this vintage 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.720
 than eleven cards on the same stand 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.189
 so I make you the little anecdote 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.649
 lightened you put the cards here like 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.989
 that you will have a good first small 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.210
 overview of stuff 11 cards the bear is 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.460
 not extraordinary that's for sure it was 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.579
 an empty granaries of advertised between 200 and 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.360
 300 exhibitors I arrived there very early 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.719
 and was to be 7:30 7:53 p.m. hour and a half 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.489
 I think yes between 7:30 and 8am there was 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.039
 exhibitors not yet installed so 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.870
 I went around twice I did this 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.489
 empty granaries in a city drain where 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.800
 I had very long time so 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.000
 barentin for what you know sailing 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.580
 before planning where I live near 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.070
 rouen I was there I have that very early 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.850
 simply because the afternoon 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.530
 I had friends who came from metz 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.909
 so that's very far coming from 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.560
 far that I'm going that I hosted everything 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.650
 the weekend we had a blast and 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.320
 it interests you and suddenly I was a 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.119
 little bit here and suddenly I sealed 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.009
 very early it could not have been there 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.240
 will know departure 11h 12h never been there 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.220
 software is very early that was 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.439
 long time I've lifted to that and I 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.460
 think and I hope is strongly found 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.430
 a lot of krohn things they have very 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.680
 early and I was very disappointed because there 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.960
 had no and I mean no seller 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.670
 of cards except or a person who is 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.689
 there every year every year for you 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.229
 say we say hello we shake hands 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.700
 we recognize ourselves 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.009
 it was a gentleman who go 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.890
 collection of his children since 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.290
 at least 4 5 years old I know and he 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.090
 must have fifteen twenty thousand cards and 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.350
 every time giant down takes over each 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.259
 every few years a little bit and he 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.460
 knows about prices so that's 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.540
 complicated my heater we discuss it's 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.640
 rather nice and as I had nothing 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.950
 find and listened I took a gp at 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.189
 him simply put us that 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.750
 side 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.330
 I found that so I'm going to you 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.880
 tell the prices every time so this 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.450
 you have seen it so a small fixed hold 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.660
 very nice so the ex block in this state 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.290
 that's what I got for 20 cents the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.930
 first cards I'm going to you 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.140
 show his cards at 20 cents then 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.210
 the rushu lucky man 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.580
 the device 20 cents to tell you there 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.930
 about 20 inches that comes up filled and 10 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.240
 completed workbook so I always do 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.350
 all the filing cabinets or there and the pokÃ© box 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.700
 normally it is that the communes are 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.750
 what he tells me every time and 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.120
 every time I do it pretty much 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.280
 half it would take me half an hour 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.090
 three quarters of an hour to watch everything 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.050
 why do I look at the communes all 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.320
 simply because each time he 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.280
 knows pretty much and every time I 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.980
 always find one or two small 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.810
 nice treasures in the communes and 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.030
 I'll show you here and there I 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.410
 found a little treasure 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:01.830
 w9 this is the incentive I had 20 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.480
 cents vincenti now 50 good I 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.200
 know more than 20 or 50 I know that I believe 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.690
 that it's 50 big promo claws 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.340
 this is your very good state of which I 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.330
 taken with the little pot driss fair 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.330
 behind the very pretty this one 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.280
 Jesus then when you dig the jacks 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.840
 in the summer in the east in the box at 50 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.990
 centimes I took so an ar gall 2 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.580
 years rivers two ex dragon these are the 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.750
 dragon rivers it's not so common 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.740
 that and especially that I took because 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.190
 that she is really very very very 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.190
 close to new 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.220
 nice but if I had found lots of 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.870
 stuff before certainly I would certainly 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.410
 not 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.030
 then hello to marine if you 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.470
 passes by there a little pikachu flakes 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.490
 of snow 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.020
 here I am priced because it is 50 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.390
 cents and 7.4 to 50 cents that's 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.660
 still a good plan here is then in 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.430
 state 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.330
 we could almost fit nine because 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.910
 to find it 9 this map is 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.200
 complicated to decant the fate of 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.550
 tripes or boxes have already seen and 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.290
 so that's fifty cents I 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.730
 taken built their aggressors and all the 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.959
 pitchous there sales or 50 cents 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.670
 then in any case is a commune where he 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.010
 will go in what is it there it was rather 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.510
 interesting non game taken then 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.300
 it goes off to box that it's in a 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.640
 20 centimes box with the communes 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.950
 here I found it was not a 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.850
 common but now he's gutted but 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.280
 Monday in France and a 50 hour watt 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.630
 centimes a little a jungle area 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.950
 in editing is so it's not going 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.039
 paulo Figure 1 is simply uncommon 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:26.979
 and go to lay a dime 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:28.330
 I jumped on it then oh yes I you 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.770
 did not say I finally found but ultra 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.789
 I found ultras but he was 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.900
 always ultras but hey he has not 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.789
 big thing every time then it's not 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.550
 great to take but there I took them 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:38.259
 to resist a little expensive ends will tell you 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.639
 here I had 4 ultra these four 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:42.400
 legends and elected officials at 5 euros each 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:47.289
 each time so the legends part 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:51.190
 due to the surveyors like that I had the 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:54.340
 dark rewrote celia the bottom part for 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.870
 the state here they are all very close 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.580
 new 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.520
 I would say 5 euros it's a small 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.659
 little less than the prices but let's say 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.159
 I took because we discuss and 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:05.610
 then here is the base he was sitting that 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:07.569
 help to make 5 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.009
 and so I took both parts of 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:10.449
 blades that already has the legends guys as well 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.379
 duo started from the bottom 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:16.210
 when we do like that it is rather 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:20.949
 nice true that it's pretty pretty here 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:22.870
 for the states very good condition and nothing 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.979
 to say yes the assises I finance 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.990
 frankly I take them not to 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.960
 realize at 7.50 yeah I did not use it 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.029
 7 50 pieces and I sincerely tell him I 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.500
 take them 1.5 if you take the four 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:35.500
 if you do it a corner he told me good 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.610
 he thought about farting hockey and learns 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.710
 an ultra he had some bonus 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.210
 some ex ex block but that's it 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.069
 often damaged and often they mix 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.009
 in the 10 euros it does not interest me 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:45.580
 all I have not found much I'm going 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:48.069
 say that like that 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.779
 easter and I will find a map in 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:50.590
 the box in the sensible wines I 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:52.419
 found a map that made me 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.729
 extremely pleasure to find that I 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.870
 seen at home I was shocked good it's not 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.180
 a crazy thing we did not expect a 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:02.680
 crazy thing but still here is a 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.419
 little and then that's not going 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.539
 works go in very very good condition 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:08.620
 that's wrong is not new tanguay then 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.259
 when is it a promo 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.699
 black stars go promo is the 30th 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.590
 was illustrated by ken sugimori so 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:17.129
 whoever made the other quotation marks the 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:20.199
 first pokemon cards from the basic set 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:21.250
 and this promo game I'm not looking for 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:23.260
 columns the promos I collect them 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.490
 not the 7 projects 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.240
 I know I will look for a 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.670
 time because I wanted to do myself 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.960
 just the blacks promos that and I saw 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.800
 that it's almost impossible to steal 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.180
 collect all one to who are 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.170
 not found will have more than 100 euros 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.340
 It's not worth it 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.590
 and that one I know she's rating in 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.570
 the red wines of the cottage is nonsense 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.680
 a ball 15 euros so I hurried 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.820
 to learn it will avoid buying it 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.030
 it really make a collection 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.930
 day and so I got that for 20 cents 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.190
 in the comics box for that I 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.660
 always look good there was still a 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.150
 ten pocketbook what I have not 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.730
 searched before it was long I do not have 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.840
 all searched 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.040
 I was happy it's the little ma 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.280
 little find of the day this little top 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.990
 flow that's so here is a little return of 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.980
 flea market good it's not huge for 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.240
 the moment is not the best but 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.220
 the empty granaries of my life good I find 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.960
 the ultras respond blow for me too 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.570
 and the ultras at 5 euros is not the 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.440
 same flavor as found at 20 cents 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.280
 not even not wanting 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.450
 pay money 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.340
 it's just that finding ultras at 20 

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.440
 centimes is it's enjoyable 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.730
 it's really the find the sync 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.070
 it's almost the internet price a 

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.840
 no, that's it for the little ones 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.620
 finds 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.520
 I'm trying to make a garage sale 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.050
 every few weeks I arrive 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.700
 even less do two there for example 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.380
 I did two this week where 

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.150
 I had that but in the second I 

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.070
 found that there was nothing at all 1 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.720
 000 plus it started raining so 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.980
 I went 

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.000
 so here I hope to do one or two 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.200
 case there may be two weeks ago there 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.820
 will have no opinion of driving I know 

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.710
 not if I can not find anything I was already 

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.750
 said but when I find I show that's it 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.220
 sense he finds a two cards here I 

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.470
 would like no video for 2 4 years too 

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.940
 I find two stars and love 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:49.320
 now I hope this garage sale 

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:51.340
 this pitcher back below earlier 

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.690
 do not hesitate to say what you have 

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.830
 found a pretty one always even though I 

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.820
 do not always answer I always read that 

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.500
 you found it makes me happy to 

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.420
 see what you had found and we can 

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.720

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.720
