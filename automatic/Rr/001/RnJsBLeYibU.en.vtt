00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.560
 if the thing then in the local network so the data from the hard drive 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.200
 distributed local network and then applause in the trend 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.360

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.190
 set up et cetera 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.190
 but there is also a native small for all operating systems 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.210
 The iphone application was of course somehow the focus around 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.230
 all these games 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.130
 since the user can set up that were pretty 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.520
 comfortable quite intuitive 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.520
 is a simpler the apartheid viewer

 At pictures ads, videos can show the Shen correct format ads 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.640
 has a few problems currently in this early version with around well 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.590
 therefore shared files so there, for example, do not smoke 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.190
 m otherwise that went fast he can now searched something really very 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.620
 is beautiful around 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.440
 Files can be downloaded that means if you also have one and DS 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.350
 Network comes from outside 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.040
 let's have files we have lying on the hard drive at home 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.040
 download 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.670
 and upload too 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.180
 Unfortunately, there is still a fascinating story going on with a photo but something 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.819
 For example, it does not sync around 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.049
