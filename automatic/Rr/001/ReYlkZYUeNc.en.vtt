 hello if you urgently want 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.330
 sawing up and down 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.309
 drill and mill quickly and 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.349
 it can be safely done with 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.570
 using a universal tool 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.880
 exactly woodworking machine 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.439
 stark cwm 2500 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.099
 Looked like this in the manufacturing 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.830
 C double double m 2500 trademark 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.320
 stark machine universal five in one 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.140
 this is a novelty you will be doing on it 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.010
 types of work like planing 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.260
 milling and drilling thicknessing 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.719
 Zhenya, I saw that you long and hard 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.300
 diligently collected this machine and I with him 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:51.320
 got acquainted closer and now come on 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.530
 tell about it all so machine stark cwm 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.360
 2500 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.770
 first is professional 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.910
 multifunctional installation for 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.520
 wood processing 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.739
 equipped with five main functions and 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.040
 necessary when processing wood 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.470
 as previously it affected and it all sounded 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.350
 engine power he has two with 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.200
 half kilowatt a little bit heavy 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.960
 62 kilos evening but on the other hand 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.689
 this is a plus because the heavy mill street 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.340
 remarkably kept on the ground that is 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.430
 it does not twist we do not need extra 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.729
 fasten it when working with blanks 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.960
 for each function bag 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.060
 blocking individual modules 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.270
 carried out individually in order 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.549
 so that you do not have questions or not 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.140
 Are cocks ever unnecessary 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.490
 I use the instruction 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.740
 fully in Russian 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.439
 there is a detailed description for each 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.960
 functions so briefly about technical 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.290
 characteristics of the mounted machine 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.800
 for specific functions 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.840
 let's start with the planing function table length 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.080
 will be 1 meter wide 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.630
 will be 30 18 centimeters angle 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.850
 stable ruler can be set 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:07.130
 from 0 to 45 degrees markup stands at 0 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.649
 15, 30 and 45 degrees respectively at 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.570
 machine prepared replenishment warm 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.080
 he become works for us two 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.790
 makes 58 centimeters width of a cut 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.060
 will be two hundred and fifty 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.680
 millimeters workpiece height up to 160 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.709
 millimeters also need to be noted 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.920
 what is with all the feed rate 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.510
 blanks provided for up to five meters in 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.160
 a minute 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.410
 move the functions of sawing machine 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.750
 mounted and under this feature will 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.120
 have a table length of 75 centimeters 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.340
 correspondingly 25 centimeters wide 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.320
 maximum cutting height is 8 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.750
 half centimeters ie notice 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.370
 what when working on sawing blanks 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.989
 machine can use discs 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.989
 diameter up to 200 50 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.840
 last but not least important feature 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.610
 performance among us or other works 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.420
 installation of all necessary 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.380
 modules of this function are table sizes we have 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.150
 makes 37 by 20 centimeters 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.340
 vertical movement of the table will be 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.769
 available ranging from zero to ten 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.780
 centimeters in addition the machine is equipped 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.489
 16 millimeters he ammo completion 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.470
 it makes sense to say that the machine 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.330
 truly universal all modules 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.269
 it perfectly fit each other 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.180
 no plastic used only 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.890
 metal parts okay little wife thanks 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.200
 Great you watched the company 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.830
 electromotor our wood machining 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.350
 machine tools 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.930
 and see a lot of things 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.120
 these videos here with us were with you 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.510
 Eugene and Anastasia see you soon 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.510
 bye Bye
