00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:06.069
 and good to all guys we are again 

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:08.290
 here in the hot spots in then 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.299
 is in each zone its location and we are going to 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.759
 I always give you the one who is with me 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.900
 helping in this I asked them and they 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:18.260
 I loved 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.320
 in this map of drones is a little bit 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.509
 messy and especially for those who are born 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.189
 for the hot spot it is much worse 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.890
 for those born on this side of 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.820
 state of the camera where you see here if 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.940
 we are born here it is much worse 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.070
 to see where he is born hartÃ³n if it is born in the 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.560
 good side on the bad side is worth this is 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.390
 the good side 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.400
 this with extreme conditions 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.760
 to arrive much earlier point 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.040
 from the other side and since the point 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.980
 born in the middle there is in this big house 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.470
 what do you see and that and there is going to 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.350
 predominate will matter a lot 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.080
 blinding grenades that in the case of the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.160
 lvbp only worth blinding pomegranates 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.650
 they are going to matter a lot and also short 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.710
 distance in the hall and long 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.710
 distance from casita casita 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.530
 to see people here in leagues mode 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.560
 change a lot with you and in bet and things 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.880
 and to delay 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.310
 to the people to the opponents 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.890
 and the second one point here I think only 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.869
 there are four points I think it is in all 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.060
 the games there are only four points and in 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.439
 this point does have to defend very 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.380
 ok since you can come by the house 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.829
 from the left here in or through 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.829
 down here 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.320
 or here going up the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.490
 electricians but it does not matter much anymore 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.500
 that if you have good defenders good 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.480
 good people who defend well that 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.910
 shoot well it goes great 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.980
 and we are going for the third point you see 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.600
 that is fast is going very fast since 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.400
 it's 30 seconds that I've put in 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.950
 normal theory is a minute 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.800
 so tell a minute nothing more than 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.050
 catches and already apted in telling one of 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.950
 likes fellow if you play in challenge 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.310
 the vp 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.890
 go to the next point in about 10 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.570
 seconds and there are ten seconds tell 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.030
 one gets to the next point of 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.880
 advance you go and you get those points 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.570
 that can give you the victory 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.970
 this is the last point that in this 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.280
 I do not like to defend it because here 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.030
 Well, if you defend it well, it's pretty 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.100
 difficult to capture especially in league mode 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.310
 that we believe that people champion here and that 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.340
 flips 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.790
 here as you can see, there are not many areas 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.069
 defend himself but he does defend says this is 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.750
 great, good , the next one is over 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.520
 points again there in the middle there 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.410
 above 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.440
 and I hope that it worked for you 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.110
 liked and has served you to continue 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.170
