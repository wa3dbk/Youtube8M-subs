00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.240
 profitipps photo becomes steffen henssler too 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.780
 the delicious send to the left of alberto 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.490
 and more 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.070
 we made the marinade this 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.750
 sweet was with a lot of honey as counter 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.130
 sharpening a bit soy sauce business 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.720
 but can also be slightly different 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.539
 make a marinade that goes in full measure 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.390
 lemon and now not squeeze 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.970
 should be in thin thin slices 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.470
 to cut 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.120
 because it is crucial that the shell 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:37.809
 that's why it comes with antique 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.570
 lemon slices purely because onion beautiful 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.420
 red onions take a great deal 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:49.299
 Taste together in chic rings 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:52.030
 Also, of course, a little bit of garlic 

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:54.519
 and how albert almer has too much club than 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.250
 I say 210 as well 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:00.850
 to press the hand that you place on 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.619
 seven as here you can see that 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.900
 the aroma ran out not too much 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:09.400
 They just rang it here then 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:14.400
 Ordinary pinch sea salt bit 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:18.220
 pity itself made so sharp 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.510
 Thank you very much and then instead of sugar because 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.610
 Sugar always needs a bit 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.020
 little sweet because I feel the heat of 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.010
 sugar caramelizes what we have today 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.170
 we make use of a caffeinated 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:33.390
 liquid in professional circles also cola 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.390
 Called by whatever brand 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.300
 shot full of coal and then now 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.340
 Just click on the marinade and now 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.560
 you have to imagine a big one 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.500
 Handful send in the marinade left 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.300
 let half an hour marinate in 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.159
 the oven or tried a bit 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.540
 that the lemon slices are not on top 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.729
 the books so in between 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.290
 Companies notice wonderful acidity 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.270
 slight sharpness from the mustard and the 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.409
 sweetness from the coal will try it out 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.409
 real to the hearth
