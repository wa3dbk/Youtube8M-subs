00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:11.159
 and that while it too 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:17.739
 it must 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.400
 45 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.130
 however, this year is earlier than planned 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.269
 the scattering 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:26.980
 you look 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.079
 but not so that I pull a few times 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:31.820
 heitinga again 4 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.900
 an electro so what am I doing here 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.760
 well-known worldwide 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.440
 the amusement park loeb 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.010
 all works 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.400
 stoke city twice 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.320

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.320
 skobrev 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.560
 natural 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.470
 never became four times and years 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.910
 last year earlier 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.620
 the fact that it was closing the leak 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.860
 one over the plates 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.520
 that doesn't seem to be everything 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.210
 43 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.060
 p 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.650
 you never know what 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.490
 and that can be read 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.220
 got better this year 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.070
 That is clearly Amsterdam 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.070
 krajicek 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.680
 rose 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.710
 the bant 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.920

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.410
 spokesperson peter r 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.690
 this is not yet clear 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.690
 quality so this would prove 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.320
 from a measurement institution in the world 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.470

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:32.729
 you up 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.379
 That 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:45.759
 8 the man
