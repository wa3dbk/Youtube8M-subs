00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.190 
controller much much heavier and really
nice<00:02:05.759> now<00:02:06.119> we<00:02:06.180> have<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.570> little<00:02:06.750> light<00:02:06.990> here

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
nice now we have this little light here

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.050 
nice now we have this little light here
if<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.350> hold<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.710> PlayStation<00:02:08.280> button<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.879> will

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
if I hold the PlayStation button it will

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.430 
if I hold the PlayStation button it will
blink<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.660> will<00:02:09.780> change<00:02:10.020> colors

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
blink and it will change colors

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.380 
blink and it will change colors
depending<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:10.950> what<00:02:11.129> player<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.610> are<00:02:11.640> at

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
depending on what player you are at

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.370 
depending on what player you are at
least<00:02:12.660> from<00:02:12.840> what<00:02:12.989> I

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
least from what I

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.560 
least from what I
man<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.800> then<00:02:14.460> here<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.850> touchpad<00:02:15.390> it

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
man and then here is a touchpad it

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.150 
man and then here is a touchpad it
clicks<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:18.020> I<00:02:19.020> guess<00:02:19.200> it's<00:02:19.410> touch<00:02:19.650> sensitive

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
clicks and I guess it's touch sensitive

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.870 
clicks and I guess it's touch sensitive
and<00:02:20.430> then<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.390> triggers<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:23.370> triggers<00:02:23.730> are<00:02:23.790> a

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
and then the triggers the triggers are a

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.780 
and then the triggers the triggers are a
little<00:02:24.180> bit<00:02:24.420> looser<00:02:24.660> than<00:02:24.900> an<00:02:25.140> xbox<00:02:25.560> 360<00:02:26.310> they

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
little bit looser than an xbox 360 they

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.570 
little bit looser than an xbox 360 they
do<00:02:26.850> have<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.150> good<00:02:27.360> amount<00:02:27.570> of<00:02:27.720> throw<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.170> them

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
do have a good amount of throw to them

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.550 
do have a good amount of throw to them
the<00:02:29.580> button<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.000> here<00:02:30.450> or<00:02:30.600> solid<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.200> shoulder

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
the button is here or solid the shoulder

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.600 
the button is here or solid the shoulder
buttons<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.990> triggers<00:02:33.990> would<00:02:34.140> be<00:02:34.260> good

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
buttons and the triggers would be good

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.460 
buttons and the triggers would be good
for<00:02:35.610> playing<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.940> racing<00:02:36.120> game<00:02:36.390> that's<00:02:37.230> one

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
for playing a racing game that's one

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.060 
for playing a racing game that's one
thing<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.740> I've<00:02:37.950> always<00:02:38.100> been<00:02:38.900> definitely

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
thing that I've always been definitely

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.040 
thing that I've always been definitely
leaning<00:02:41.070> towards<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.610> xbox<00:02:41.910> 360<00:02:42.510> on<00:02:42.600> is<00:02:42.900> the

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
leaning towards the xbox 360 on is the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.350 
leaning towards the xbox 360 on is the
trigger<00:02:43.290> part<00:02:43.740> but<00:02:44.310> these<00:02:44.460> feel<00:02:44.730> good<00:02:45.000> now<00:02:45.300> the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
trigger part but these feel good now the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.570 
trigger part but these feel good now the
impulse<00:02:45.810> triggers<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.650> xbox<00:02:47.040> one<00:02:47.310> could

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
impulse triggers of the xbox one could

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.040 
impulse triggers of the xbox one could
be<00:02:47.730> really<00:02:47.880> interesting<00:02:48.000> but<00:02:48.690> these<00:02:48.900> are

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
be really interesting but these are

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.400 
be really interesting but these are
definitely<00:02:49.260> better<00:02:49.770> than<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.160> ps3<00:02:50.850> remote

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
definitely better than the ps3 remote

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.400 
definitely better than the ps3 remote
the<00:02:52.410> analog<00:02:53.100> sticks<00:02:53.930> definitely<00:02:54.930> have<00:02:55.110> way

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
the analog sticks definitely have way

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.530 
the analog sticks definitely have way
more<00:02:55.440> weight<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:55.920> them<00:02:56.250> they<00:02:56.880> feel<00:02:57.150> more

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
more weight to them they feel more

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.510 
more weight to them they feel more
grippy<00:02:57.990> that<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.230> hated<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.950> top<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.430> the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
grippy that I hated the top of the

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.370 
grippy that I hated the top of the
analog<00:02:59.850> sticks<00:03:00.210> on<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.510> other<00:03:00.660> one<00:03:00.870> they

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
analog sticks on the other one they

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.750 
analog sticks on the other one they
weren't<00:03:01.560> my<00:03:01.740> favorite<00:03:02.130> at<00:03:02.220> all<00:03:02.600> both<00:03:03.600> click

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
weren't my favorite at all both click

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.000 
weren't my favorite at all both click
and<00:03:05.960> everything<00:03:06.960> feels<00:03:07.230> nice<00:03:07.470> it's<00:03:07.740> much

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
and everything feels nice it's much

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.700 
and everything feels nice it's much
bigger<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.400> have<00:03:08.700> really<00:03:09.030> big<00:03:09.240> hands<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.840> the

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
bigger I have really big hands and the

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.530 
bigger I have really big hands and the
controller<00:03:11.370> feels<00:03:11.670> much<00:03:11.940> bigger<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.480> much

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
controller feels much bigger and much

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.770 
controller feels much bigger and much
more<00:03:12.960> comfortable<00:03:13.470> in<00:03:13.590> my<00:03:13.620> hands<00:03:14.570> I'm<00:03:15.570> not

for an xbox 360 so it should be

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.840
