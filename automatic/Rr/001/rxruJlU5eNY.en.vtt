this TV there's three technologies in

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.490 
this TV there's three technologies in
this<00:00:13.280> TV<00:00:13.700> that<00:00:13.940> that<00:00:14.750> we<00:00:15.049> think<00:00:15.289> will<00:00:15.440> really

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
this TV that that we think will really

the<00:00:17.900> second<00:00:18.590> is<00:00:18.800> the<00:00:19.040> detail<00:00:19.700> and<00:00:19.910> the

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
the second is the detail and the

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.019 
the second is the detail and the
upscaling<00:00:20.630> ability<00:00:21.169> of<00:00:21.259> the<00:00:21.380> TV<00:00:21.710> and<00:00:21.860> the

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
upscaling ability of the TV and the

upscaling ability of the TV and the
third<00:00:23.029> is<00:00:23.360> the<00:00:23.539> sound<00:00:23.840> it's<00:00:24.289> an<00:00:24.470> important

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
third is the sound it's an important

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.759 
third is the sound it's an important
part<00:00:25.039> of<00:00:25.099> tvs<00:00:25.490> that<00:00:25.519> is<00:00:25.880> often<00:00:26.090> overlooked<00:00:26.769> so

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
part of tvs that is often overlooked so

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.040 
part of tvs that is often overlooked so
firstly<00:00:28.160> let's<00:00:28.400> take<00:00:28.550> a<00:00:28.580> look<00:00:28.760> at<00:00:28.849> color<00:00:29.060> we

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
firstly let's take a look at color we

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.960 
firstly let's take a look at color we
use<00:00:30.230> an<00:00:30.349> exclusive<00:00:30.890> technology<00:00:31.099> in<00:00:31.490> this<00:00:31.609> TV

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
use an exclusive technology in this TV

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.960 
use an exclusive technology in this TV
called<00:00:32.269> triluminos<00:00:32.689> and<00:00:33.610> what<00:00:34.610> triluminos

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
called triluminos and what triluminos

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.540 
called triluminos and what triluminos
does<00:00:35.360> is<00:00:35.540> it<00:00:35.660> gives<00:00:35.809> us<00:00:35.930> more<00:00:36.140> color<00:00:36.500> to<00:00:36.800> be

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
does is it gives us more color to be

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.880 
does is it gives us more color to be
able<00:00:37.670> to<00:00:37.879> draw<00:00:38.239> on<00:00:38.480> to<00:00:38.629> the<00:00:38.750> screen<00:00:39.019> the<00:00:39.650> best

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
able to draw on to the screen the best

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.729 
able to draw on to the screen the best
way<00:00:40.040> to<00:00:40.390> for<00:00:41.390> me<00:00:41.449> to<00:00:41.570> explain<00:00:41.900> is<00:00:42.140> if<00:00:42.379> you<00:00:42.470> think

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
way to for me to explain is if you think

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.950 
way to for me to explain is if you think
about<00:00:42.949> an<00:00:43.100> artist<00:00:43.489> and<00:00:43.729> his<00:00:44.269> paint<00:00:44.600> palette

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
about an artist and his paint palette

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.079 
about an artist and his paint palette
the<00:00:45.860> more<00:00:46.040> color<00:00:46.250> he<00:00:46.400> has<00:00:46.580> on<00:00:46.699> that<00:00:46.850> paint

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089 
the more color he has on that paint

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.840 
the more color he has on that paint
palette<00:00:47.479> the<00:00:48.350> more<00:00:48.589> accurately<00:00:49.460> he<00:00:49.670> will<00:00:49.760> be

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
palette the more accurately he will be

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.219 
palette the more accurately he will be
able<00:00:49.970> to<00:00:50.119> represent<00:00:50.269> real<00:00:50.720> life<00:00:50.930> in<00:00:51.140> his

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:51.229 
able to represent real life in his

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:53.770 
able to represent real life in his
painting<00:00:51.640> it's<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:52.729> same<00:00:52.940> with<00:00:53.089> our<00:00:53.239> TV<00:00:53.570> we

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
painting it's the same with our TV we

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.210 
painting it's the same with our TV we
have<00:00:53.900> about<00:00:53.989> thirty<00:00:54.440> percent<00:00:54.739> more<00:00:54.949> color

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
have about thirty percent more color

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.310 
have about thirty percent more color
available<00:00:55.400> to<00:00:55.879> us<00:00:56.030> which<00:00:56.690> means<00:00:56.960> that<00:00:57.080> we<00:00:57.170> can

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
available to us which means that we can

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.469 
available to us which means that we can
represent<00:00:57.710> real<00:00:58.159> life<00:00:58.430> more<00:00:58.760> accurately<00:00:59.210> on

00:00:59.469 --> 00:00:59.479 
represent real life more accurately on

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.020 
represent real life more accurately on
the<00:00:59.689> screen<00:01:00.580> secondly<00:01:01.580> let's<00:01:01.699> talk<00:01:01.909> about

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
the screen secondly let's talk about

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.960 
the screen secondly let's talk about
detail<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:02.930> upscaling<00:01:03.589> technology<00:01:04.220> well

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
detail and upscaling technology well

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.429 
detail and upscaling technology well
that's<00:01:05.119> what<00:01:05.239> we're<00:01:05.299> done<00:01:05.479> by<00:01:05.689> the<00:01:05.750> processor

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
that's what we're done by the processor

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.580 
that's what we're done by the processor
at<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.619> heart<00:01:06.830> of<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:06.950> TV<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:08.439> we've<00:01:09.439> been

now we've taken that data and we've put
it<00:01:29.090> into<00:01:29.359> our<00:01:29.390> processor<00:01:30.109> into<00:01:30.469> the<00:01:30.619> x-reality

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
it into our processor into the x-reality

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.609 
it into our processor into the x-reality
processor<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:32.030> that<00:01:32.570> is<00:01:32.689> exclusive<00:01:33.229> to<00:01:33.259> Sony

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619
