00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
complicated to explain it involves the

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.630 
complicated to explain it involves the
causes<00:04:02.440> where<00:04:02.620> you<00:04:02.770> scare<00:04:03.190> with<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.430> fire

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
causes where you scare with the fire

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.980 
causes where you scare with the fire
everything<00:04:04.120> but<00:04:04.300> there's<00:04:04.480> a<00:04:04.540> way<00:04:04.690> where<00:04:04.900> you

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
everything but there's a way where you

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.170 
everything but there's a way where you
can<00:04:05.020> keep<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.500> stick<00:04:05.770> and<00:04:06.070> it's<00:04:06.850> really

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
can keep the stick and it's really

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.760 
can keep the stick and it's really
glitch<00:04:07.510> in<00:04:07.780> fact<00:04:07.960> I'll<00:04:08.110> even<00:04:08.230> show<00:04:08.470> you<00:04:08.500> if<00:04:08.710> I

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
glitch in fact I'll even show you if I

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.310 
glitch in fact I'll even show you if I
put<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.100> stick<00:04:09.310> down<00:04:09.690> you<00:04:10.690> can<00:04:10.870> never<00:04:11.050> get<00:04:11.230> it

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.420 
where you last saved and you'll have the
stick<00:04:37.060> again<00:04:37.210> woohoo<00:04:37.919> really<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.100> stick<00:04:39.310> is

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
stick again woohoo really the stick is

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.100 
stick again woohoo really the stick is
kind<00:04:39.640> of<00:04:39.730> pointless<00:04:40.030> I<00:04:40.330> figured<00:04:40.840> out<00:04:40.960> on

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
kind of pointless I figured out on

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.260 
kind of pointless I figured out on
accident<00:04:41.710> it<00:04:41.860> was<00:04:41.980> pretty<00:04:42.190> neat<00:04:42.460> first<00:04:42.880> but

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
accident it was pretty neat first but

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.000 
accident it was pretty neat first but
then<00:04:43.720> Ariel<00:04:44.050> is<00:04:44.140> this<00:04:44.290> kind<00:04:44.500> of<00:04:44.530> point<00:04:44.740> listed

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
then Ariel is this kind of point listed

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.050 
then Ariel is this kind of point listed
you<00:04:45.100> can't<00:04:45.280> do<00:04:45.370> anything<00:04:45.610> with<00:04:45.850> it

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
you can't do anything with it

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.570 
you can't do anything with it
and<00:04:46.270> again<00:04:46.870> if<00:04:46.990> you<00:04:47.080> put<00:04:47.230> it<00:04:47.320> down<00:04:47.500> it's<00:04:48.370> gone

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
and again if you put it down it's gone

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.980 
and again if you put it down it's gone
so<00:04:49.290> that's<00:04:50.290> that

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
so that's that

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.750 
so that's that
so<00:04:52.990> there's<00:04:53.320> one<00:04:53.470> no<00:04:53.590> point<00:04:53.860> to<00:04:53.980> the<00:04:54.100> stick<00:04:54.490> if

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
so there's one no point to the stick if

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.240 
so there's one no point to the stick if
you<00:04:54.820> want<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.300> keep<00:04:55.480> the<00:04:55.750> stick<00:04:56.100> pretty<00:04:57.100> much

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250
