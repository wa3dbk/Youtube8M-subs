pickup selected and has a delay sets of

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.360 
pickup selected and has a delay sets of
about<00:02:43.770> 430<00:02:44.760> milliseconds<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.860> second<00:02:47.220> part

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
about 430 milliseconds the second part

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.010 
about 430 milliseconds the second part
is<00:02:47.520> very<00:02:47.700> dry<00:02:47.970> soundly<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.690> want<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.900> turn

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
boosted the mids and the volumes

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.600 
boosted the mids and the volumes
slightly<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.650> really<00:02:58.830> screams<00:02:59.310> really

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
slightly so it really screams really

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.730

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
stands out

stands out
he's<00:03:02.490> my<00:03:02.610> boss<00:03:02.760> GT<00:03:03.210> 10<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:04.140> I've<00:03:04.230> used<00:03:04.440> the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
he's my boss GT 10 and I've used the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.160 
he's my boss GT 10 and I've used the
Marshall<00:03:05.280> 1959<00:03:06.060> model<00:03:06.240> on<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.690> with<00:03:07.050> the

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
Marshall 1959 model on that with the

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.100 
Marshall 1959 model on that with the
first<00:03:07.410> input<00:03:08.270> David<00:03:09.270> almost<00:03:09.690> certainly<00:03:09.930> used

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
first input David almost certainly used

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.660 
first input David almost certainly used
higher<00:03:10.320> but<00:03:10.470> how<00:03:10.890> amps<00:03:11.280> in<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.460> studios<00:03:13.670> I've

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
higher but how amps in the studios I've

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.130 
higher but how amps in the studios I've
also<00:03:14.820> used<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.090> clean<00:03:15.300> boost<00:03:15.540> with<00:03:15.750> this<00:03:15.900> and

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
also used a clean boost with this and

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.570 
also used a clean boost with this and
that<00:03:16.260> obviously<00:03:16.830> it's<00:03:16.980> not<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.190> either

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
that obviously it's not you either

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.740 
that obviously it's not you either
so<00:03:18.330> overall<00:03:18.960> don't<00:03:19.320> use<00:03:19.410> too<00:03:19.620> much<00:03:19.830> distortion

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
so overall don't use too much distortion

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.030 
so overall don't use too much distortion
on<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.810> record<00:03:22.260> they<00:03:22.470> would<00:03:22.680> have<00:03:22.770> used<00:03:22.920> a

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
on the record they would have used a

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.730 
on the record they would have used a
full<00:03:23.190> space<00:03:23.490> overdrive<00:03:24.090> pedal<00:03:24.510> into<00:03:25.380> his<00:03:25.590> high

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
full space overdrive pedal into his high

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.670 
full space overdrive pedal into his high
watt<00:03:25.920> amp<00:03:26.100> settled<00:03:27.230> so<00:03:28.230> usually<00:03:28.500> clean

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
watt amp settled so usually clean

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.680 
watt amp settled so usually clean
channel<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.340> dialing<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.120> old<00:03:30.240> drivers<00:03:30.480> your

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
channel and dialing the old drivers your

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.590 
channel and dialing the old drivers your
favorite<00:03:31.020> old<00:03:31.140> drive<00:03:31.380> distortion<00:03:31.890> pedal<00:03:32.600> add

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
favorite old drive distortion pedal add

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.270 
favorite old drive distortion pedal add
some<00:03:33.810> delay<00:03:33.930> or<00:03:34.170> echo<00:03:34.200> for<00:03:34.710> the<00:03:34.800> first<00:03:35.010> solo

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
some delay or echo for the first solo

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.100 
some delay or echo for the first solo
and<00:03:35.760> it's<00:03:36.300> probably<00:03:36.480> worth<00:03:36.660> boosting<00:03:37.080> your

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
and it's probably worth boosting your

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.260 
and it's probably worth boosting your
mids<00:03:37.350> a<00:03:37.440> bit<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.770> rolling<00:03:38.700> off<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.820> travel<00:03:39.240> a

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
mids a bit and rolling off the travel a

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.620 
mids a bit and rolling off the travel a
bit<00:03:40.100> for<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.160> third<00:03:41.340> solo<00:03:41.670> David<00:03:42.330> use<00:03:42.480> the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
bit for the third solo David use the

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.630 
bit for the third solo David use the
custom<00:03:42.990> Bill<00:03:43.260> Lewis<00:03:43.440> guitar<00:03:43.980> that<00:03:44.160> pickups

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
custom Bill Lewis guitar that pickups

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.970 
custom Bill Lewis guitar that pickups
which<00:03:44.850> could<00:03:45.030> be<00:03:45.120> switched<00:03:45.420> between

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
which could be switched between

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.470 
which could be switched between
humbucker<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.160> single<00:03:47.460> coil<00:03:47.670> mode<00:03:47.790> where

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
humbucker and single coil mode where

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.590 
humbucker and single coil mode where
Carl<00:03:48.720> suppose<00:03:49.020> it's<00:03:49.170> no<00:03:49.320> on<00:03:49.970> this<00:03:50.970> guitar<00:03:51.120> it's

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
Carl suppose it's no on this guitar it's

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.540 
Carl suppose it's no on this guitar it's
also<00:03:52.050> had<00:03:52.260> 24<00:03:52.680> frets<00:03:52.950> which<00:03:53.070> meant<00:03:53.250> he<00:03:53.340> could

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
also had 24 frets which meant he could

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.700 
also had 24 frets which meant he could
use<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.660> high<00:03:54.810> notes<00:03:55.080> that<00:03:55.350> you<00:03:55.470> can't

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
use the high notes that you can't

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.920 
use the high notes that you can't
ordinarily<00:03:56.160> do<00:03:56.310> on<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.520> strap<00:03:56.820> so<00:03:57.180> if<00:03:57.690> you<00:03:57.810> do

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
ordinarily do on the strap so if you do

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.600 
ordinarily do on the strap so if you do
on<00:03:58.050> the<00:03:58.110> other<00:03:58.170> 21<00:03:58.650> fret<00:03:58.950> guitar

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
on the other 21 fret guitar

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.410 
on the other 21 fret guitar
then<00:04:00.390> you'll<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.960> graph<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.320> improvise<00:04:01.710> during

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
then you'll a graph to improvise during

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.570 
then you'll a graph to improvise during
the<00:04:03.420> third<00:04:03.600> solo<00:04:03.960> or<00:04:04.320> play<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.100> phrases<00:04:05.490> an

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
the third solo or play the phrases an

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.610 
the third solo or play the phrases an
octave<00:04:05.850> lower
