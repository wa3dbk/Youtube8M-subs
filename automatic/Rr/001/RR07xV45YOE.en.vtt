advanced warfare takes inspiration from
oh<00:03:33.090> and<00:03:33.600> check<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:33.989> out<00:03:34.230> by<00:03:34.650> all<00:03:34.860> means<00:03:35.130> I

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
oh and check this out by all means I

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.310 
oh and check this out by all means I
should<00:03:35.400> have<00:03:35.820> been<00:03:35.970> wasted<00:03:36.269> right<00:03:36.690> there<00:03:36.930> my

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
should have been wasted right there my

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.870 
should have been wasted right there my
street<00:03:37.680> should<00:03:37.860> have<00:03:38.010> been<00:03:38.130> done<00:03:38.459> but<00:03:38.700> that

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
street should have been done but that

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.640 
street should have been done but that
guy<00:03:39.060> just<00:03:39.120> could<00:03:39.480> not<00:03:39.660> settle<00:03:40.019> his<00:03:40.200> aim<00:03:40.410> and

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
guy just could not settle his aim and

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.380 
guy just could not settle his aim and
because<00:03:41.070> of<00:03:41.100> it<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.489> managed<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.880> take<00:03:42.090> him<00:03:42.239> out

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
because of it I managed to take him out

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.740 
because of it I managed to take him out
and<00:03:42.510> build<00:03:43.140> up<00:03:43.320> to<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.500> beautiful<00:03:44.030> swarm<00:03:45.030> but

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
and build up to that beautiful swarm but

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.199 
and build up to that beautiful swarm but
there<00:03:45.930> we<00:03:46.080> go<00:03:46.260> reach<00:03:46.590> that<00:03:46.830> 15<00:03:47.400> kill<00:03:47.700> gunstreak

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
there we go reach that 15 kill gunstreak

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.440 
there we go reach that 15 kill gunstreak
with<00:03:48.840> nothing<00:03:49.260> but<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.560> good<00:03:49.769> old<00:03:49.920> tac-45<00:03:50.450> let

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
with nothing but the good old tac-45 let

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.110 
with nothing but the good old tac-45 let
those<00:03:51.660> falling<00:03:52.110> skies<00:03:52.440> metals<00:03:52.920> rain<00:03:53.190> but

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
those falling skies metals rain but

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.150 
those falling skies metals rain but
anyways<00:03:54.450> everybody<00:03:54.989> is<00:03:55.170> comparing<00:03:55.680> the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
anyways everybody is comparing the

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.310 
anyways everybody is comparing the
exosuit<00:03:57.090> system<00:03:57.450> with<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.630> boost<00:03:57.840> jumps<00:03:58.200> and

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
exosuit system with the boost jumps and

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.630 
exosuit system with the boost jumps and
the<00:03:58.380> boost<00:03:58.560> dodge<00:03:58.769> is<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:59.010> one<00:03:59.190> not<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.519> the

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
the boost dodge is a one not to the

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.490 
the boost dodge is a one not to the
system<00:03:59.970> that's<00:04:00.150> available<00:04:00.299> in<00:04:00.660> titanfall<00:04:01.049> and

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
system that's available in titanfall and

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.259 
system that's available in titanfall and
so<00:04:02.070> right<00:04:02.250> now<00:04:02.280> that's<00:04:02.670> kind<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.150> only

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
so right now that's kind of the only

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.900 
so right now that's kind of the only
game<00:04:03.750> we<00:04:03.900> have<00:04:04.049> available<00:04:04.320> that<00:04:05.070> would<00:04:05.160> kind

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
game we have available that would kind

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.370 
game we have available that would kind
of<00:04:06.060> give<00:04:06.269> us<00:04:06.390> a<00:04:06.480> taste<00:04:06.690> for<00:04:06.930> what<00:04:07.080> advanced

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
of give us a taste for what advanced

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.080 
of give us a taste for what advanced
warfare<00:04:07.739> multiplayer<00:04:07.980> is<00:04:08.459> going<00:04:08.700> to<00:04:08.790> be<00:04:08.910> like

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
warfare multiplayer is going to be like

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.150 
warfare multiplayer is going to be like
and<00:04:09.390> since<00:04:09.959> I'm<00:04:10.110> a<00:04:10.200> fan<00:04:10.440> of<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.739> system<00:04:11.040> in

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
and since I'm a fan of the system in

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.220 
and since I'm a fan of the system in
titanfall<00:04:11.489> it<00:04:11.880> follows<00:04:12.540> that<00:04:12.570> I<00:04:12.750> might<00:04:13.049> be<00:04:13.200> a

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
titanfall it follows that I might be a

titanfall it follows that I might be a
fan<00:04:13.500> of<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.739> system<00:04:14.040> in<00:04:14.130> advanced<00:04:14.400> warfare

abilities<00:04:42.430> I<00:04:42.610> really<00:04:43.419> can't<00:04:43.449> definitively

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
abilities I really can't definitively

abilities I really can't definitively
answer<00:04:44.229> that<00:04:44.680> right<00:04:44.860> now<00:04:44.919> while<00:04:45.789> personally

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
answer that right now while personally

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.909 
answer that right now while personally
ideally<00:04:46.839> I<00:04:46.870> think<00:04:47.169> it's<00:04:47.289> a<00:04:47.379> really<00:04:47.409> great<00:04:47.860> idea

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
ideally I think it's a really great idea

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.040 
ideally I think it's a really great idea
I<00:04:48.460> think<00:04:48.669> I'll<00:04:49.240> like<00:04:49.449> the<00:04:49.599> mechanics<00:04:49.990> I

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
I think I'll like the mechanics I

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.239 
I think I'll like the mechanics I
haven't<00:04:50.259> played<00:04:50.409> against<00:04:50.650> them<00:04:50.860> again<00:04:51.159> I

00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:51.249 
haven't played against them again I

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:53.159 
haven't played against them again I
can't<00:04:51.460> say<00:04:51.669> for<00:04:51.699> sure<00:04:51.879> but<00:04:52.059> I<00:04:52.419> like<00:04:52.629> the<00:04:52.659> ideas

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
can't say for sure but I like the ideas

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.230 
can't say for sure but I like the ideas
behind<00:04:53.319> it<00:04:53.740> and<00:04:53.889> most<00:04:54.520> of<00:04:54.759> the<00:04:54.849> multiplayer

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
behind it and most of the multiplayer

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.670 
behind it and most of the multiplayer

gameplay that I've seen from it all
looks<00:04:57.430> fairly<00:04:58.059> good<00:04:58.479> but<00:04:59.199> of<00:04:59.289> course<00:04:59.499> we<00:04:59.620> can

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
looks fairly good but of course we can

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.079 
looks fairly good but of course we can
never<00:04:59.979> take<00:05:00.249> these<00:05:00.430> multiplayer<00:05:00.939> reveal
