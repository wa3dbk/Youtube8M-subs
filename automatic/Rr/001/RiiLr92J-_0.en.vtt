00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
championship wins for the last several

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.869

years either Irina wins it or Anna wins

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.950 
years either Irina wins it or Anna wins
it<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:01.070> this<00:01:02.070> game<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.489> believe<00:01:02.670> took<00:01:03.390> place<00:01:03.690> in

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
it and this game I believe took place in

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.950 
it and this game I believe took place in
round<00:01:04.170> 3<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.920> was<00:01:05.510> obviously<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> critical

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
round 3 and was obviously a critical

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.219 
round 3 and was obviously a critical
battle<00:01:07.560> for<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.299> overall<00:01:09.299> standings<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
battle for the overall standings of the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.800 
battle for the overall standings of the
tournament<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.340> position<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.909> very

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
tournament so this position is very

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.800 
tournament so this position is very
tricky<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.260> it's<00:01:13.560> pretty<00:01:13.920> complex<00:01:14.810> basically

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
tricky and it's pretty complex basically

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.140 
tricky and it's pretty complex basically
what<00:01:16.049> we've<00:01:16.200> had<00:01:16.439> here<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> Kings<00:01:17.490> Indian<00:01:17.759> as

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
what we've had here is a Kings Indian as

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.880 
what we've had here is a Kings Indian as
you<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.420> tell<00:01:18.600> by<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.320> locked<00:01:19.560> pawn

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
you can tell by the the locked pawn

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.950 
you can tell by the the locked pawn
structure<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> center<00:01:20.759> white<00:01:21.750> was

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
structure in the center white was

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.480 
structure in the center white was
playing<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.530> Queen<00:01:22.770> side<00:01:22.799> black<00:01:23.280> was

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
playing on the Queen side black was

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.969 
playing on the Queen side black was
trying<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.850> attack<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.360> king<00:01:24.570> side<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.049> we

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
trying to attack on the king side and we

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.800 
trying to attack on the king side and we
reached<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.340> position<00:01:26.490> after<00:01:27.119> about<00:01:27.360> 40

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
reached this position after about 40

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.440 
reached this position after about 40
moves<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.610> black<00:01:29.610> definitely<00:01:30.000> has<00:01:30.299> an

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
moves and black definitely has an

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.390 
moves and black definitely has an
advantage<00:01:30.570> here<00:01:31.140> probably<00:01:31.860> due<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.130> this

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
advantage here probably due to this

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.520 
advantage here probably due to this
strong<00:01:32.729> LightSquared<00:01:33.210> Bishop<00:01:33.659> white<00:01:34.290> doesn't

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
strong LightSquared Bishop white doesn't

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.890 
strong LightSquared Bishop white doesn't
really<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:35.009> an<00:01:35.130> answer<00:01:35.280> for<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.000> as<00:01:36.390> we

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
really have an answer for it and as we

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.830 
really have an answer for it and as we
can<00:01:37.020> see<00:01:37.229> here<00:01:37.500> White's<00:01:37.740> King<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.720> pretty<00:01:39.720> much

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
can see here White's King is pretty much

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.690 
can see here White's King is pretty much
gonna<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.350> some<00:01:40.590> back<00:01:40.770> riding<00:01:41.040> problems<00:01:41.490> for

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
gonna have some back riding problems for

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.249 
gonna have some back riding problems for
the<00:01:41.790> rest<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.150> game<00:01:42.360> notice<00:01:42.899> how<00:01:43.020> white

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
the rest of the game notice how white

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.620 
the rest of the game notice how white
has<00:01:43.740> no<00:01:44.009> way<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.340> dislodging<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:45.090> bishop

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
has no way of dislodging this bishop

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.270 
has no way of dislodging this bishop
there's<00:01:46.020> no<00:01:46.200> LightSquared<00:01:46.560> bishop<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.100> come

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
there's no LightSquared bishop to come

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.090 
there's no LightSquared bishop to come
to<00:01:47.399> f1<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.909> challenge<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.320> g3<00:01:49.799> square

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
to f1 to challenge it and the g3 square

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.280 
to f1 to challenge it and the g3 square
is<00:01:50.220> taken<00:01:50.579> away<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.540> bishop<00:01:51.750> can't<00:01:52.110> be

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
is taken away so the bishop can't be

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.870 
is taken away so the bishop can't be
attacked<00:01:52.649> by<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.670> Queen<00:01:54.030> here<00:01:54.329> for<00:01:54.540> instance

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
attacked by the Queen here for instance

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.910 
attacked by the Queen here for instance
so<00:01:56.880> because<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:58.140> think<00:01:58.619> black

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
so because of this I think black

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.530 
so because of this I think black
definitely<00:01:59.189> has<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> really<00:01:59.820> nice<00:01:59.939> practical

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
definitely has a really nice practical

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.539 
definitely has a really nice practical
advantage<00:02:00.990> meaning<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.860> lot<00:02:01.979> easier<00:02:02.369> to

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
advantage meaning it's a lot easier to

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.120 
advantage meaning it's a lot easier to
play<00:02:02.670> blacks<00:02:02.969> position<00:02:03.360> here<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.920> rest

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
play blacks position here and the rest

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.410 
play blacks position here and the rest
of<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.310> game<00:02:05.490> followed<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.060> pretty

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
of the game followed a pretty

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.869 
of the game followed a pretty
interesting<00:02:06.689> path<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.979> white<00:02:08.160> played<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.550> 4

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
interesting path so white played a 4

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.550 
interesting path so white played a 4
here<00:02:09.869> Irina

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
here Irina

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.979 
here Irina
made<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> good<00:02:11.760> decision<00:02:11.940> she<00:02:12.420> played<00:02:12.629> Bishop

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
made a good decision she played Bishop

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.949 
made a good decision she played Bishop
takes<00:02:13.170> B<00:02:13.470> sec

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
takes B sec

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.020 
takes B sec
basically<00:02:14.950> training<00:02:15.459> off<00:02:15.609> one<00:02:15.819> of<00:02:15.849> her

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
basically training off one of her

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.670 
basically training off one of her
bishops<00:02:16.359> for<00:02:16.599> whites<00:02:16.810> night<00:02:17.079> to<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.409> after

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
bishops for whites night to that after

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.670 
bishops for whites night to that after
Bishop<00:02:17.829> takes<00:02:18.129> b6<00:02:18.810> she<00:02:19.810> gets<00:02:19.989> to<00:02:20.170> play<00:02:20.200> queen

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
Bishop takes b6 she gets to play queen

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.039 
Bishop takes b6 she gets to play queen
c8<00:02:21.069> giving<00:02:21.579> her<00:02:21.700> queen<00:02:21.939> access<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.599> C<00:02:22.810> file

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
c8 giving her queen access to the C file

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.479 
c8 giving her queen access to the C file
and<00:02:23.969> invading<00:02:24.969> White's<00:02:25.180> position<00:02:26.489> actually

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
and invading White's position actually

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.280 
and invading White's position actually
interestingly<00:02:27.700> enough<00:02:28.269> even<00:02:28.689> stronger<00:02:28.989> was

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
interestingly enough even stronger was

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.759 
interestingly enough even stronger was
the<00:02:29.379> move<00:02:29.560> Queen<00:02:29.739> d7<00:02:30.810> sort<00:02:31.810> of<00:02:31.930> threatening<00:02:32.230> to

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
the move Queen d7 sort of threatening to

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.089 
the move Queen d7 sort of threatening to
UM<00:02:33.010> take<00:02:33.670> this<00:02:33.909> pawn<00:02:34.180> on<00:02:34.209> a4<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.109> if<00:02:35.769> something

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
UM take this pawn on a4 and if something

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.619 
UM take this pawn on a4 and if something
like<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:37.530> five<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:39.250> now<00:02:39.430> queen<00:02:39.760> c8<00:02:40.120> this

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
like a five and now queen c8 this

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.059 
like a five and now queen c8 this
actually<00:02:40.959> makes<00:02:41.139> a<00:02:41.260> big<00:02:41.439> difference<00:02:41.799> because

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
actually makes a big difference because

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.970 
actually makes a big difference because
White's<00:02:42.310> Bishop<00:02:42.760> doesn't<00:02:42.969> have<00:02:43.239> this<00:02:43.450> um<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.989> v

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
White's Bishop doesn't have this um a v

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.009 
White's Bishop doesn't have this um a v
square<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.459> can't<00:02:45.730> defend<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.209> b4<00:02:46.599> pawn<00:02:46.810> so

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
square and can't defend the b4 pawn so

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.679 
square and can't defend the b4 pawn so
basically<00:02:47.319> after<00:02:47.650> Queen<00:02:47.919> C<00:02:48.239> 4-bike<00:02:49.239> is<00:02:49.389> simply

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
basically after Queen C 4-bike is simply

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:51.659 
basically after Queen C 4-bike is simply
winning<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.079> b4<00:02:50.500> ponen<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.159> with<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.549> the

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:51.669 
winning the b4 ponen and with it the

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.800 
winning the b4 ponen and with it the
game<00:02:51.879> and<00:02:52.239> if<00:02:53.200> you'll<00:02:53.409> notice<00:02:53.620> white<00:02:53.980> has

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
game and if you'll notice white has

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.869 
game and if you'll notice white has
absolutely<00:02:55.810> no<00:02:56.349> counter<00:02:56.739> play<00:02:56.950> here<00:02:57.250> like<00:02:57.760> the

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
absolutely no counter play here like the

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.140 
absolutely no counter play here like the
Queen<00:02:58.090> can<00:02:58.239> come<00:02:58.419> to<00:02:58.569> g5<00:02:58.959> but<00:02:59.669> let's<00:03:00.669> say<00:03:00.849> Queen

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
Queen can come to g5 but let's say Queen

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.289 
Queen can come to g5 but let's say Queen
g5<00:03:01.540> queen<00:03:01.989> C<00:03:02.169> for<00:03:02.669> white<00:03:03.669> doesn't<00:03:03.879> have<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.120> good

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
g5 queen C for white doesn't have a good

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.610 
g5 queen C for white doesn't have a good
check<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:04.780> black<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.079> already<00:03:05.379> threatening

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
check and black is already threatening

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.979 
check and black is already threatening
Queen<00:03:06.010> f1<00:03:06.310> check<00:03:06.579> so<00:03:06.879> as<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:07.659> can<00:03:07.750> see<00:03:07.810> this

Queen f1 check so as you can see this

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.720 
Queen f1 check so as you can see this
position<00:03:08.349> is<00:03:08.439> really<00:03:08.590> really<00:03:08.919> dangerous<00:03:09.459> for

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
position is really really dangerous for

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.229 
position is really really dangerous for
white<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:11.650> was<00:03:11.769> just<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:12.069> small<00:03:12.219> nuance<00:03:12.760> Irina

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
white that was just a small nuance Irina

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.110 
white that was just a small nuance Irina
played<00:03:13.480> Queen<00:03:13.689> CA<00:03:13.930> which<00:03:14.139> is<00:03:14.260> also<00:03:14.439> good<00:03:14.859> and

played Queen CA which is also good and

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.960 
played Queen CA which is also good and
then<00:03:16.120> Zidane<00:03:16.540> ski<00:03:16.810> traded<00:03:17.379> on<00:03:17.500> b5<00:03:17.919> Queen<00:03:18.489> f2

then Zidane ski traded on b5 Queen f2
Queen<00:03:19.449> c4<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.229> this<00:03:20.769> is<00:03:20.889> the<00:03:20.979> difference<00:03:21.310> I

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
the the position is pretty much

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.280 
the the position is pretty much
completely<00:04:37.030> winning<00:04:37.479> for<00:04:37.780> black<00:04:37.990> they're

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
completely winning for black they're

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.770 
completely winning for black they're
down<00:04:38.500> a<00:04:38.530> piece<00:04:38.889> but<00:04:39.160> if<00:04:40.090> you<00:04:40.330> really<00:04:40.479> think

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
down a piece but if you really think

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.570 
down a piece but if you really think
about<00:04:40.840> it<00:04:41.020> this<00:04:41.229> Bishop<00:04:41.530> on<00:04:41.590> a5<00:04:41.979> is<00:04:42.010> not<00:04:42.340> in<00:04:42.490> the

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
about it this Bishop on a5 is not in the

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.270 
about it this Bishop on a5 is not in the
game<00:04:42.760> so<00:04:43.229> practically<00:04:44.229> speaking<00:04:44.320> black<00:04:44.919> isn't

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
game so practically speaking black isn't

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.070 
game so practically speaking black isn't
really<00:04:45.430> down<00:04:45.610> any<00:04:45.820> material<00:04:46.330> at<00:04:46.449> all<00:04:46.600> and<00:04:46.870> in

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
really down any material at all and in

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.260 
really down any material at all and in
fact<00:04:47.139> they<00:04:47.889> have<00:04:48.070> too<00:04:48.310> many<00:04:48.430> threats<00:04:48.790> here<00:04:49.000> for

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
fact they have too many threats here for

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.750 
fact they have too many threats here for
white<00:04:49.660> to<00:04:49.810> deal<00:04:50.020> with<00:04:50.199> for<00:04:50.770> instance<00:04:50.800> f3<00:04:51.610> is<00:04:51.729> a

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
white to deal with for instance f3 is a

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.420 
white to deal with for instance f3 is a
threat<00:04:52.139> as<00:04:53.139> well<00:04:53.350> as<00:04:53.530> just<00:04:53.710> taking<00:04:54.070> this<00:04:54.160> pawn

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
threat as well as just taking this pawn

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.760 
threat as well as just taking this pawn
on<00:04:54.580> d5<00:04:54.940> and<00:04:55.000> pushing<00:04:55.810> their<00:04:55.990> their<00:04:56.500> pawns

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
on d5 and pushing their their pawns

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.810 
on d5 and pushing their their pawns
forward<00:04:57.240> so<00:04:58.240> back<00:04:58.419> here<00:04:59.370> what<00:05:00.370> I<00:05:00.400> definitely

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
forward so back here what I definitely

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.180 
forward so back here what I definitely
should<00:05:00.970> have<00:05:01.000> just<00:05:01.440> tried<00:05:02.440> to<00:05:02.470> hold<00:05:02.740> on<00:05:02.889> a<00:05:02.949> bit

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
should have just tried to hold on a bit

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.360 
should have just tried to hold on a bit
longer<00:05:03.250> and<00:05:03.669> play<00:05:03.910> something<00:05:04.270> like<00:05:04.300> Knight<00:05:04.660> g2

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
longer and play something like Knight g2

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.860 
longer and play something like Knight g2
just<00:05:06.370> controlling<00:05:06.760> the<00:05:06.910> e3<00:05:07.300> Square<00:05:07.630> and<00:05:07.720> just

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
just controlling the e3 Square and just

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.200 
just controlling the e3 Square and just
trying<00:05:08.080> to<00:05:08.199> defend<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.620> position<00:05:08.820> but<00:05:09.820> after

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
trying to defend the position but after

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.990 
trying to defend the position but after
any<00:05:10.690> move<00:05:11.139> like<00:05:11.440> king<00:05:11.680> h6<00:05:12.160> for<00:05:12.370> instance<00:05:12.729> just

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
any move like king h6 for instance just

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.810 
any move like king h6 for instance just
getting<00:05:13.660> off<00:05:13.930> of<00:05:14.139> the<00:05:14.260> G<00:05:14.440> file<00:05:14.650> black<00:05:15.610> is

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
getting off of the G file black is

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.480 
getting off of the G file black is
probably<00:05:16.350> winning<00:05:17.350> here<00:05:17.740> I<00:05:17.770> mean<00:05:18.039> the<00:05:18.280> queen

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
probably winning here I mean the queen

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.270 
probably winning here I mean the queen
is<00:05:18.610> coming<00:05:18.639> into<00:05:19.030> e2<00:05:19.270> and<00:05:19.780> so<00:05:20.380> f3<00:05:20.710> pawn<00:05:20.889> is<00:05:21.070> hard

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
is coming into e2 and so f3 pawn is hard

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.100 
is coming into e2 and so f3 pawn is hard
to<00:05:21.400> defend<00:05:21.760> the<00:05:21.910> knight<00:05:22.060> might<00:05:22.330> come<00:05:22.539> to<00:05:22.660> e3<00:05:22.810> at

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
to defend the knight might come to e3 at

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.110 
to defend the knight might come to e3 at
some<00:05:23.320> point<00:05:23.560> and<00:05:23.800> white<00:05:24.280> is<00:05:24.430> just<00:05:24.460> in<00:05:24.760> serious

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
some point and white is just in serious

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.340 
some point and white is just in serious
trouble<00:05:25.240> but<00:05:25.840> that<00:05:26.020> would<00:05:26.110> have<00:05:26.229> been<00:05:26.320> a

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
trouble but that would have been a

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.909 
trouble but that would have been a
better<00:05:26.530> try<00:05:26.919> for<00:05:27.160> a<00:05:27.190> defense

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
better try for a defense

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.230 
better try for a defense
anyways<00:05:29.919> does<00:05:30.100> it<00:05:30.220> happen<00:05:30.370> after<00:05:30.760> F<00:05:30.880> takes<00:05:31.060> G

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
anyways does it happen after F takes G

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.870 
anyways does it happen after F takes G
for<00:05:31.950> like<00:05:32.950> took<00:05:33.160> this<00:05:33.370> pawn<00:05:33.610> with<00:05:33.849> check

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
for like took this pawn with check

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.990 
for like took this pawn with check
Knight<00:05:34.690> G<00:05:34.930> to<00:05:35.169> HG<00:05:35.830> and<00:05:36.099> yeah<00:05:36.250> these<00:05:36.430> pawns<00:05:36.700> are

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
Knight G to HG and yeah these pawns are

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.930 
Knight G to HG and yeah these pawns are
too<00:05:37.180> strong<00:05:37.450> and<00:05:37.720> the<00:05:37.780> bishop<00:05:38.110> and<00:05:38.260> queen<00:05:38.470> are

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
too strong and the bishop and queen are

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.250 
too strong and the bishop and queen are
extremely<00:05:39.940> active<00:05:40.120> and<00:05:40.479> maybe<00:05:40.960> the<00:05:41.110> most

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
extremely active and maybe the most

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.440 
extremely active and maybe the most
important<00:05:41.740> thing<00:05:41.830> here<00:05:41.979> is<00:05:42.010> that<00:05:42.150> blacks<00:05:43.150> King

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
important thing here is that blacks King

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.640 
important thing here is that blacks King
is<00:05:43.599> completely<00:05:44.110> safe

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
is completely safe

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.110 
is completely safe
you<00:05:44.889> know<00:05:45.010> if<00:05:45.099> Y<00:05:45.220> not<00:05:45.370> some<00:05:45.550> kind<00:05:45.729> of<00:05:45.820> counter

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
you know if Y not some kind of counter

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.940 
you know if Y not some kind of counter
play<00:05:46.300> here<00:05:46.539> then<00:05:46.750> of<00:05:47.289> course<00:05:47.530> the<00:05:47.650> position

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
play here then of course the position

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.620 
play here then of course the position
would<00:05:48.099> be<00:05:48.130> tricky<00:05:48.520> but<00:05:48.669> here<00:05:48.910> it's<00:05:49.030> the<00:05:49.599> only

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630
