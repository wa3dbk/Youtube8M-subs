water here with the cattail which is
what<00:02:05.270> I'm<00:02:05.360> familiar<00:02:05.540> with<00:02:05.840> coming<00:02:06.230> out<00:02:06.320> of

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
what I'm familiar with coming out of

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.920 
what I'm familiar with coming out of
Wisconsin<00:02:06.560> in<00:02:07.520> having<00:02:07.940> given<00:02:08.119> tours<00:02:08.509> of<00:02:08.750> the

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
Wisconsin in having given tours of the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.980 
Wisconsin in having given tours of the

largest freshwater cattail Marsh in
North<00:02:12.170> America<00:02:12.620> this<00:02:13.580> kind<00:02:13.880> of<00:02:13.940> reminds<00:02:14.240> me<00:02:14.360> of

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
North America this kind of reminds me of

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.570 
North America this kind of reminds me of
home<00:02:14.630> which<00:02:15.560> tells<00:02:15.740> us<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:15.920> for<00:02:16.310> freshwater

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
home which tells us the for freshwater

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.420 
home which tells us the for freshwater
this<00:02:17.300> particular<00:02:17.780> point<00:02:18.020> is<00:02:18.140> is<00:02:18.800> rather<00:02:19.100> high

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
this particular point is is rather high

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.870 
this particular point is is rather high
saltwater<00:02:20.390> rather<00:02:20.750> low<00:02:21.020> I<00:02:21.800> would<00:02:22.610> think<00:02:22.760> that

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
saltwater rather low I would think that

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.030 
saltwater rather low I would think that
it<00:02:23.120> would<00:02:23.330> be<00:02:23.450> here<00:02:23.720> where<00:02:23.900> chances<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:24.950> an

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
it would be here where chances of an

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.110 
it would be here where chances of an
alligator<00:02:25.280> or<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.000> Otters<00:02:27.520> may<00:02:28.520> show<00:02:28.760> up<00:02:28.910> and

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
alligator or the Otters may show up and

00:02:29.120 --> 00:03:20.600 
alligator or the Otters may show up and
if<00:02:29.180> so<00:02:29.330> we'll<00:02:29.480> try<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.720> catch<00:02:29.930> them<00:02:30.050> on<00:02:30.320> video

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.890 

that<00:03:21.610> might<00:03:21.790> be<00:03:21.880> as<00:03:21.970> close<00:03:22.180> as<00:03:22.330> you<00:03:22.420> ever<00:03:22.690> get

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
that might be as close as you ever get
