00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:33.830 
to the transport hit record and then off
we<00:02:07.050> go<00:02:31.370> hit<00:02:32.370> spacebar<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:33.209> end<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.690> recording

you<00:02:34.410> can<00:02:34.769> now<00:02:35.190> see<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.730> recorded<00:02:36.510> region

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
you can now see the recorded region

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:54.979 
you can now see the recorded region
let's<00:02:37.410> take<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.739> listen<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.280> playback<00:02:52.489> nice<00:02:53.989> now

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
let's take a listen to playback nice now

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.110 
let's take a listen to playback nice now
I'm<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.320> bit<00:02:55.560> unsure<00:02:55.709> about<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.579> second<00:02:57.090> half

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
I'm a bit unsure about the second half

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.569 
I'm a bit unsure about the second half
of<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.630> recording<00:02:58.200> so<00:02:58.650> I'll<00:02:58.829> just<00:02:59.070> position

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
of the recording so I'll just position

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.660 
of the recording so I'll just position
the<00:02:59.610> insertion<00:02:59.910> point<00:03:00.660> at<00:03:00.840> bar<00:03:01.320> five<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.040> then

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
the insertion point at bar five and then
