00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.930
 created pages must have a 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.740
 a little more weight but ok 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.080
 that's okay, and so he's the taboos that 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.840
 the people we are accustomed to and 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.470
 comes with all the history of the characters 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.000
 their glasses are the personalities 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.189
 mainly focusing logically on the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.960
 bank group at the end ne 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.700
 but he also talks about all the drivers 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.770
 which appeared to the top of the codename I 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.040

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.649

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.090

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:56.460
 he has to get caught up here in the glossary 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.979
 we will also have a report with 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.420

 voted for what will appear in each 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.680
 volume in each chapter actually then 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.870
 that he gathered all to tell 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.219

 who could not catch the first 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:23.010
 volumes we also have here what I found 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.709
 the coolest was the first chapter of 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.049
 a lane that came out at the front and 96 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.060
 is the dog named chapter 10 actually 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.159
 which has the same name as the chapter 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.439
 first chapter that came out of the rain in 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.930
 normal game that is the ideal month 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:39.030
 and here is a shot of punches was a 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.819

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.680
 floor does not have many similar things 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.420
 luv attack almost everything completely 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.030
 formed as we know it today 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.819
 the chance to see those scenes with 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.209
 became the child even though he is 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.620
 except for the chance it 's a hat then yes 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.989
 there is much much like it more 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.760
 there is also a lot of different things he does not 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.260
 I was in search of the good pici where 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.930

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.669
 completely different but we already 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:13.709
