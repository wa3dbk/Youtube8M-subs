00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.800 
the guys are defeated but impressed I
think<00:02:30.670> this<00:02:30.760> has<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:30.940> lot<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.180> do<00:02:31.360> with<00:02:31.390> surface

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
think this has a lot to do with surface

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.500 
think this has a lot to do with surface
area<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.200> friction<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:32.890> am<00:02:33.310> completely<00:02:34.120> amazed

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
area and friction I am completely amazed

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.170 
area and friction I am completely amazed
at<00:02:34.900> how<00:02:35.350> much<00:02:35.799> force<00:02:36.069> we<00:02:36.310> put<00:02:36.610> on<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:36.880> book

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
at how much force we put on that book

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.739 
at how much force we put on that book
and<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.569> still<00:02:37.989> ripped<00:02:38.560> on
