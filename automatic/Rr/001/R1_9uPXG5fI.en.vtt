00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 [Music] 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:15.329
 Let's talk a little bit about the 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:18.000
 difference between the 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:19.349
 and a professional scanner 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.089
 most people have a lot of 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.400
 difficulty in understanding the difference 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.929
 from one to the other then in this video 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.330
 Let's try to identify the 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:30.269
 main differences between the two 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.980
 in this example as shown in 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.750
 illustration I'm putting a 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.360
 document that it will come in 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.110
 shape in the scanner between a little bit 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.900
 crooked and see that on the screen he already 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.780
 automatically if this correction 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.280
 because it is a software there is a 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.310
 series of resources as we go 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.720
 I can observe from now on in this case I 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.490
 I'll do a front scan and 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.110
 back so most scanners 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.940
 are front and back in the choice of 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.400
 and I'm putting 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.590
 purposely a blank sheet 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.490
 she has images of the year in white 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.800
 two sides 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.790
 in this case also another smaller sheet 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.980
 huh 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.160
 with the size and text only in the 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:14.730
 in front of a plastic document is the 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.920
 protected by a film in this case and 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.440
 a receipt and has a value a size 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.330
 and there is in the back you 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.560
 can even identify the fund 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.290
 his 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.570
 so see what I'm inserting into the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.400
 scanner is all these documents all over 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.460
 this batch of documents there is a series 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.210
 need to close pdf file 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.729
 for example a single file and see that 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.409
 this sheet is already getting crooked 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.260
 document between the crooked or the receipt 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.960
 virtually everything went completely 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.820
 he does is a series of at last of 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.130
 Edits automatically deletes the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.470
 blank pages it already rotates 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.000
 document automatically according to the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.630
 with text 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.610
 in this case it scanned colored and 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.200
 In this case you saw the receipt in tractor 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.159
 that she has obviously made the cut 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.440
 automatically 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.529
 here we are going to give an example of 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.840
 scanning of a stack of 500 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:13.740
 leaves, for example, see that I'm in a 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.940
 table 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.320
 organized where I can work 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.460
 manipulate these roles in such a way 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.620
 image is accelerating staff and I go 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.350
 put in my documents and I can 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.270
 close the file without major problems 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.670
 because my computer does all this 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.950
 work is when we're going to manipulate 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.180
 this same MFP document 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.930
 here we are faced with the situation 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.000
 where an accident happens and you spread 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.370
 all these documents losing much 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.670
 time is also that that same 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.850
 lot of documents I want 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.070
 scan and close a pdf file in the 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.280
 multifunctional I would have to make a 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.980
 series of issues before saving the 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.690
 file and even in the feeder and 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.190
 this type of document can not 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.260
 work, do not 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.580
 I would then have to use glass 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.680
 of my all-in-one is 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.600
 scan one to one do your own and 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.270
 delete the blank pages digit 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.500
 finally had a very manual work 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:21.240
 big ne separate to put several sheets 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.760
 in my original video 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.500
 see what a job it is 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.810
 working with this type of pump a 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.980
 functional 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.030
 this applies to all 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.180
 multifunction 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.920
 Okay, just the last employee I have. 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.690
 some features like this one 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.370
 example we are giving a we here 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.300
 we have developed a solution called 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.040
 digital file where I have already selected 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.190
 automatically the folder is where I want it 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.350
 is to digitize in the middle of my 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.460
 on the equipment panel itself 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.960
 ie I 've created a workflow that 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.330
 automates my processes 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.730
 Okay. It makes life much easier. 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.940
 mainly to the user he has it 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.910
 it allows me is so foolproof 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.160
 I can determine exactly which ones 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.680
 peace and what accesses this client will have 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.840
 access in this case we made a 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.830
 very simple scanning, right? 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.410
 informing you of the correct location and 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:22.109
 Can we retrieve this document? 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.050
 for example where I 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.090
 I can identify this document to do 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.730
 download it for example I can 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.130
 send by 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.880
 and possibly mail here view 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.120
 document 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.160
 and here we can see the image is the 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.500
 own document that we have just 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.850
 scan a very simple process 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.510
 quite fast 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:46.180
 ok of this tool also I can have 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.850
 a series of identification filter 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.040
 separate the multifunctional it is a 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:54.010
 Convenience scanner where I have 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.110
 few pages only require 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.780
 few clicks and configurations 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.750
 preset by your department is 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.480
 that I simply fly select 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:08.650
 I digitize and go back to the sock for my 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.450
 where to use one and where to use the other is 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.920
 This is the big question in the 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.330
 multifunctional is a series of 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.180
 features such as copy and print 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.670
 can install applications 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.440
 custom scanners 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.930
 for folders on the network as we ended up 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.300
 Once in the scanner we can 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.120
 scan various types of materials 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.580
 at the same time we managed to make the 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.080
 deleting blank pages 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.010
 we can make the cut itself 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.040
 automatic 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.860
 automatic file formatting is the 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.570
 the text alignment in this case the 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.800
 infringer it already does this automatically 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.960
 also 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.440
 that is, it has a series of 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:50.170
 and it already does this automatically 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.820
 eliminating labor issues or the 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:56.410
 rework and I have to do mine. 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:58.450
 workstation , this is for every 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.070
 type of application, we'll have 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.780
 the advantages and disadvantages 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.670
 I would say it would be the 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.370
 convenience scanner where you 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.300
 need to do several jobs of a few 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.940
 pages 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.430
 already the professional scanner I have to 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.470
 do many jobs with many 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.840
 I can also make a 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.760
 level of automation 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.070
 Also interesting scanner obviously 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.120
 depends on its application and its 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.700
 real need 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.200
 in doubt always consult us so that the 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.180
 people can identify the best 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.010
 equipment to meet your need 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.420
 I hope this video has been useful 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.420
 Thank you very much and see you
