00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
people have said that their marmalade

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.840 
people have said that their marmalade
hasn't<00:00:45.640> set<00:00:46.290> it's<00:00:47.290> just<00:00:47.739> not<00:00:47.949> working<00:00:48.159> it's

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
hasn't set it's just not working it's

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.640 
hasn't set it's just not working it's
this<00:00:49.089> and<00:00:49.420> though<00:00:49.600> you<00:00:49.900> know<00:00:50.019> so<00:00:50.229> all<00:00:50.379> sorts<00:00:50.530> of

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
this and though you know so all sorts of

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.780 
this and though you know so all sorts of
things<00:00:50.739> so<00:00:50.860> I<00:00:50.949> thought<00:00:51.159> I<00:00:51.190> would<00:00:51.370> do<00:00:51.610> a<00:00:51.640> video

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
things so I thought I would do a video

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.710 
things so I thought I would do a video
for<00:00:52.000> you<00:00:52.390> so<00:00:53.519> marmalade<00:00:54.519> is<00:00:54.670> quite<00:00:54.909> it's<00:00:55.570> not

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
for you so marmalade is quite it's not

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.040 
for you so marmalade is quite it's not
complicated<00:00:56.320> you<00:00:56.470> don't<00:00:56.769> need<00:00:56.949> anything

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
complicated you don't need anything

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.770 
complicated you don't need anything
specific<00:00:59.050> to<00:00:59.320> do<00:00:59.500> it<00:00:59.710> with<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:01.120> it<00:01:01.210> just<00:01:01.479> takes

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
specific to do it with but it just takes

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.539 
specific to do it with but it just takes
slightly<00:01:02.080> longer<00:01:02.290> than<00:01:02.650> you<00:01:02.920> would<00:01:03.100> if<00:01:03.400> you

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.549 
slightly longer than you would if you

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:06.390 
slightly longer than you would if you
were<00:01:03.699> making<00:01:03.879> a<00:01:04.180> normal<00:01:04.510> Jam<00:01:05.049> but<00:01:05.860> I<00:01:05.890> will<00:01:06.220> go

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
were making a normal Jam but I will go

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.090 
were making a normal Jam but I will go
through<00:01:06.610> it<00:01:06.790> with<00:01:06.970> you<00:01:07.210> step-by-step<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.830> that

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
through it with you step-by-step so that

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.460 
through it with you step-by-step so that
you<00:01:09.400> can<00:01:09.670> try<00:01:09.940> it<00:01:10.000> at<00:01:10.240> home<00:01:10.510> and<00:01:10.810> hopefully

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
you can try it at home and hopefully

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.560 
you can try it at home and hopefully
you'll<00:01:11.950> get<00:01:12.130> as<00:01:12.369> good<00:01:12.610> results<00:01:12.969> as<00:01:13.180> I<00:01:13.329> do

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
you'll get as good results as I do

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.139 
you'll get as good results as I do
now<00:01:14.469> this<00:01:14.799> is<00:01:15.009> what<00:01:15.219> the<00:01:15.399> marmalade<00:01:15.729> should

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
now this is what the marmalade should

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:17.940 
now this is what the marmalade should
look<00:01:16.329> like<00:01:16.360> when<00:01:16.719> you<00:01:16.840> finished<00:01:17.200> it<00:01:17.380> might<00:01:17.680> be

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
look like when you finished it might be

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.639 
look like when you finished it might be
slightly<00:01:18.250> dark<00:01:18.700> or<00:01:18.969> I<00:01:19.060> made<00:01:19.299> two<00:01:19.539> batches<00:01:20.140> this

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
slightly dark or I made two batches this

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.499 
slightly dark or I made two batches this
was<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:21.039> first<00:01:21.280> batch<00:01:21.610> and<00:01:21.880> it's<00:01:22.000> quite<00:01:22.240> light

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
was the first batch and it's quite light

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.840 
was the first batch and it's quite light
and<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.960> second<00:01:23.380> batch<00:01:23.530> I<00:01:23.770> did<00:01:24.070> was<00:01:24.490> slightly

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
and the second batch I did was slightly

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.849 
and the second batch I did was slightly
darker<00:01:25.539> the<00:01:25.899> reason<00:01:26.289> for<00:01:26.530> that<00:01:26.619> was<00:01:26.829> because

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859 
darker the reason for that was because

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:32.490 
darker the reason for that was because
it<00:01:27.280> boiled<00:01:27.729> slightly<00:01:29.939> rougher<00:01:30.939> I<00:01:31.090> suppose<00:01:31.570> and

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
it boiled slightly rougher I suppose and

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.929 
it boiled slightly rougher I suppose and
it<00:01:32.619> bought<00:01:32.770> for<00:01:32.979> ever<00:01:33.100> so<00:01:33.280> slightly<00:01:33.579> longer

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
it bought for ever so slightly longer

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.020 
it bought for ever so slightly longer
than<00:01:34.299> this<00:01:35.109> one<00:01:35.170> did<00:01:35.770> but<00:01:36.340> that's<00:01:36.549> what<00:01:36.820> you're

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
than this one did but that's what you're

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.730 
than this one did but that's what you're
looking<00:01:37.390> for<00:01:37.689> something<00:01:38.079> that<00:01:38.259> looks<00:01:38.409> like

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
looking for something that looks like

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.469 
looking for something that looks like
this<00:01:38.950> but<00:01:39.009> this<00:01:39.369> is<00:01:39.429> chunky<00:01:39.820> marmalade

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
this but this is chunky marmalade

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.599 
this but this is chunky marmalade
because<00:01:41.380> I<00:01:41.469> like<00:01:41.710> chunks<00:01:42.100> in<00:01:42.219> my<00:01:42.250> marmalade

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
because I like chunks in my marmalade

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:45.330 
because I like chunks in my marmalade
now<00:01:43.479> all<00:01:43.840> you<00:01:44.109> need<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.560> make<00:01:44.740> that<00:01:44.890> marmalade

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
tried it I thought I'd do a bit of a

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.270 
tried it I thought I'd do a bit of a
shortcut<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:49.930> I'll<00:02:50.050> do<00:02:50.200> two<00:02:50.380> laws<00:02:50.560> doesn't

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
shortcut and I'll do two laws doesn't

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.970 
shortcut and I'll do two laws doesn't
work<00:02:51.580> you<00:02:52.300> have<00:02:52.570> to<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.380> boiling<00:02:53.620> time

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
work you have to and the boiling time

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.400 
work you have to and the boiling time
would<00:02:54.130> be<00:02:54.220> slightly<00:02:54.460> different<00:02:54.970> as<00:02:55.090> well<00:02:55.410> so

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
would be slightly different as well so

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.550 
would be slightly different as well so
whatever<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.340> recipe<00:02:57.760> says<00:02:58.030> do<00:02:58.870> that<00:02:59.140> as<00:02:59.350> one

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
whatever the recipe says do that as one

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.990 
whatever the recipe says do that as one

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
but don't worry about that as long as

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.409 
but don't worry about that as long as
they<00:05:07.770> haven't<00:05:07.979> started<00:05:08.580> to<00:05:08.699> go<00:05:08.819> soft<00:05:09.150> and

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
they haven't started to go soft and

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.959 
they haven't started to go soft and
mouldy<00:05:09.840> then<00:05:10.469> you're<00:05:10.830> absolutely<00:05:11.159> fine
