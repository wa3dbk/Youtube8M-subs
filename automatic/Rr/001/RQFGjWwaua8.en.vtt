00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.300 
sound like the revlon cream elements
eyeshadow<00:01:52.680> um<00:01:53.780> products<00:01:54.829> those<00:01:55.829> are<00:01:56.040> more

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
creamy

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.539 
creamy
but<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> more<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.829> tighter<00:01:59.189> bass

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
but this is a more of a tighter bass

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.999 
but this is a more of a tighter bass
which<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.210> really<00:02:00.539> like<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.200> kind<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.740> formula

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
which I really like this kind of formula

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.910 
which I really like this kind of formula
better<00:02:02.460> because<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.420> know<00:02:03.659> my<00:02:04.020> eyeshadow<00:02:04.649> is

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
better because I know my eyeshadow is

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.889 
better because I know my eyeshadow is
going<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.130> be<00:02:05.280> holding<00:02:05.670> longer<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:06.780> a

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
going to be holding longer and it's a

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.029 
going to be holding longer and it's a
tighter<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.320> formula<00:02:07.860> um<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.649> feel<00:02:10.860> like<00:02:10.890> a

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
tighter of formula um and I feel like a

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.220 
tighter of formula um and I feel like a
white<00:02:11.370> base<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.760> very<00:02:11.790> versatile<00:02:12.540> because<00:02:12.810> it

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
white base is very versatile because it

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.170 
white base is very versatile because it
goes<00:02:13.440> with<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.680> lot<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:13.920> our<00:02:14.160> shadows<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.940> makes

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
goes with a lot of our shadows it makes

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.320 
goes with a lot of our shadows it makes
I<00:02:15.330> shadows<00:02:15.720> bright<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.470> pop<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.130> it's<00:02:17.880> that<00:02:18.300> I

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
I shadows bright and pop and it's that I

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.410 
I shadows bright and pop and it's that I
shadow<00:02:18.660> sticks<00:02:19.380> really<00:02:19.709> well<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:20.280> this<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.730> I

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
shadow sticks really well to this and I

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.809 
shadow sticks really well to this and I
like<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:21.870> can<00:02:21.959> have<00:02:22.410> on<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:23.220> white<00:02:23.310> base

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
like that I can have on a white base

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.699 
like that I can have on a white base
that's<00:02:24.120> going<00:02:24.269> to<00:02:24.330> make<00:02:24.420> my<00:02:24.630> eyes<00:02:24.810> look<00:02:24.840> you

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
that's going to make my eyes look you

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.740 
that's going to make my eyes look you
know<00:02:25.860> pop<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.030> it's<00:02:27.330> going<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.540> give

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
know pop and it's going to give

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.199 
know pop and it's going to give
brightening<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.739> what<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.400> also<00:02:29.640> think<00:02:30.000> it's

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
brightening and what I also think it's

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.479 
brightening and what I also think it's
great<00:02:30.599> to<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:31.049> using<00:02:31.440> this<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.799> bribe<00:02:32.040> the

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
great to is using this on the bribe the

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.270 
great to is using this on the bribe the
brow<00:02:32.670> bone<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:33.810> give<00:02:33.989> just<00:02:34.260> like<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.440> slight

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
brow bone to give just like a slight

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.830 
brow bone to give just like a slight
highlight<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.120> just<00:02:36.239> have<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.450> blend<00:02:36.690> it

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
highlight and you just have to blend it

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.970 
highlight and you just have to blend it
out<00:02:36.959> a<00:02:36.989> little<00:02:37.200> bit<00:02:37.290> just<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.590> give<00:02:37.739> like<00:02:37.950> a

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
out a little bit just to give like a

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.309 
out a little bit just to give like a
little<00:02:38.280> bit<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.519> highlight<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.239> lift<00:02:39.599> it

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
little bit of a highlight and a lift it
