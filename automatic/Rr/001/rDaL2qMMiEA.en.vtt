00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.879
 good afternoon dear friends with you leo ​​store 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.660
 you know what the children did 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.220
 sixties seventies 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.579
 when they didn't have computers 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:10.899
 no they didn't play toys they didn't walk 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:11.750
 having fun 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.389
 they killed people and I'm serious 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.539
 not known a lot of history and the second 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.640
 half of the twentieth century in which children 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.689
 act as killers and 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:22.229
 most of these stories are 

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:24.869
 clones or similar to a woman’s book which 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.589
 tells about the son of the devil 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.579
 so here recently released have played with 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.279
 media is an exception 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.189
 the plot tells us about the boy's soul 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.469
 whose father sold the devil and then I 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.329
 thought that if this is the case we will 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.840
 play for some russian 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.520
 singer 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.480
 but not in the management gives us a young 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.730
 adolf hitler 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.730
 that you don't think he looks like Hitler 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.010
 by the time people land dry 6 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.780
 years old dialo will provide his father 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.170
 money a big mansion and other 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.900
 rich owls 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.190
 people but as you know there is a medal and 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.180
 down side and when people are court 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.540
 is six years old 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.730
 the devil comes to him and says that he 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.030
 his adopted son and that he needs to kill 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.590
 people to make him stronger 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.460
 well here the game begins 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.299
 as your victims will act 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.400
 people living in the estate also us 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.880
 sometimes it was a detective show 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.630
 which will try 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.360
 investigate these killings 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.790
 now let's discuss the game 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.490
 process 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.570
 by and large and the developers themselves 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.820
 recognizes that the game is very similar 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.840
 on hit monaco 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.810
 each new task will begin with 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.870
 waking up in bed 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.050
 and sometimes devils will come to you 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.860
 give any admonition to teach 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.170
 different skills 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.460
 then you will need to find a victim and and 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.900
 think up and kill without attracting attention 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.480
 you can freely navigate through 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.170
 collect various items 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.780
 who can help you 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.530
 but when all the traps are set 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.010
 lure june sacrifice well after her death 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.130
 squat all the evidence so that no one you 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.270
 suspected 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.460
 Agree to this concept algorithm 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.480
 doing a job is very similar to a hit 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.180
 Monaco 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.550
 you know even in the menu I was reminded of something about the menu 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.980
 and hit but good mane 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.850
 but that's not the whole corporal series 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.590
 hired assassin so this is devilish 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.130
 which gifted superpowers 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.940
 lucius 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.820
 you have telekinesis can 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.540
 erase witnesses to burn 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.469
 people and mind controlled 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:12.529
 all this will allow you to kill your victims 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:14.329
 more interesting cunning 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.509
 However, exactly as a relationship with a girl 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:19.199
 you do not get everything at once and opportunities 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:20.709
 as if opening gradually after 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.549
 a certain amount of murder 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.699
 of the main items you will have a flashlight and 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:26.329
 a notebook in which you will 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:27.999
 view job assignment for yourself 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:29.269
 various observations 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.349
 as well as a map which is a bit like 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.749
 card from you know what game 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:35.649
 also interesting is that the developers and 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:37.649
 introduced into the game such a factor as work on 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:38.419
 home 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:40.029
 getting out in the room helping adults 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:42.799
 brushed your teeth you will appear before your eyes 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.109
 obedient child and they with the son of Satan who 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.989
 you really are 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.269
 perhaps the process we played will end 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.260
 as I listed all the most important 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.760
 and the rest is not particularly important especially if 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.769
 you have played a lot of hits at least once and 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.829
 so aware of all this rest 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.909
 atmospheric for pleased cleansing 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.109
 the fact that all people living in the estate 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.279
 sooner or later they will become theirs 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:04.090
 the victims 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.760
 they don't even know about 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.180
 entities usa deluxe what to do helpless 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.160
 before it is perfectly transmitted through 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.209
 monitors can get a lot of fan 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.149
 day player 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:15.129
 also important is the fact that we 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.879
 manage child and adult uncle yoan 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.989
 as a little boy let him and the son of Satan 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.699
 but anyway it's a six year old child and 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:25.179
 this fact is sour on the brain 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:27.749
 I also note that the US currency time is silent that 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.739
 even more pumps the atmosphere 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.779
 atmospheric program in a special 

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:33.359
 I will not tell because you are so 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.619
 perfectly see her on the screen she is not 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:38.009
 perfect but not pathetic so come down 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.419
 As for the minuses, I was able to highlight for 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.349
 yourself only one in the game are present 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:43.709
 some flaws 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.469
 quite a lot of people 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:47.679
 lists Akita glitches and biden but 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:49.319
 I was only two 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.229
 bitch and is that when you 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:53.559
 asking for something to include where it is needed 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:55.939
 place the item on the floor and not on the shelf only 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:58.439
 to in this room otherwise it won't count 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.650
 the authors are not new trousers, but rather 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.559
 the flaw was that what if university 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:05.040
 announced something in the hands of the poster he constantly 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.279
 stuck in the senate door chairs 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.489
 aisles and other obstacles if 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.629
 I hurt them a little, I understand that 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.619
 video is not so noticeable but believe me 

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:14.819
 it's annoying 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.629
 By the way I want to note that it is not a fact that you have 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:19.849
 These pants will be as I downloaded agronic 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:20.479
 bought 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.129
 so maybe this problem and pack I already 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:24.800
 now I feel like the people in my group 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.930
 I'm starting to write in comments something like 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.570
 Give a link to the game download deadline 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.880
 I will say right away guys look for the link yourself 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.000
 you have a google hand opens so 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.370
 nokia you can buy yourself alushta though i 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.120
 I understand that this advice was heard 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.490
 a little funny from my mouth exactly like 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.169
 advice onanist count find 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:43.909
 a girl 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.559
 okay let's summarize 

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:48.009
 In general, not a game very much as I already 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:49.589
 spoke atmospheric is good 

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:51.589
 gameplay clings well of course 

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:53.249
 you still need to play 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:55.149
 you can enjoy it 

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:56.860
 more if fans hit monaco 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.800
 In a word, the game was a success 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.020
 Perhaps on this I complete my story I 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.930
 I know what happened shortly but he does not 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.050
 just wanted to attract your 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.319
 attention to this game and not just acorn and 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:08.809
 show every detail 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:10.679
 so how if after that you would have sat down 

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:12.109
 game important lobo less 

00:05:12.109 --> 00:05:13.240
 of surprises 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.690
 that's all with you
