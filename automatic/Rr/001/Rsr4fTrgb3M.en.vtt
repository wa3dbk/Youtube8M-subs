 rule 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:11.649
 he not only played 

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:16.480
 buy a complete success we need to have prepared in the deck 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.210
 three groups of letters 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.669
 you can choose the ones you want 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:24.759
 no 3 1 2 3 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.980
 - 3 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.279
 the same in this case the chosen ten espases go to more 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.140
 of a letter 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.400
 release a letter alone and as a couple and with nothing 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.280
 initially if you represent the new 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.360
 Durán 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.310
 munilla 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.480
 according to murillo 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.930
 class professionals 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.140
 how to carry out the confusing mixture these letters by putting it in the part 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.100
 bottom the cons 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.860
 below the low 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.450
 you present razor without extending the totals of the regulations that neither 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.420
 it takes 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.770
 believe 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.320
 I do not say of exit neither it is necessary that these letters go 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.890
 the count bet totally mixed the base of the team is fine is 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.230
 catacaos snack wait let's go increasingly important 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.280
 that if the Americans in the cut 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.650
 but it is a top portion the top down down 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.000
 down because when American reasoning after discarding work 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.250
 it will not be one of those that stand out in transition 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.409
 as a player bulkheads heap of cards calculating 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.730
 for river at least 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.470
 that from this point that I can perform the house mix without altering 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.230
 As you can see the tastings are not observed that have work we have a mixture made 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.540
 through the fairly wide pile of letters 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.220
 at the bottom altered hispanics so Núñez is a mixture that 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.630
 it convinces the public enough but requires more hunted part 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.540
 superior with which it rounds the 1 by crawls with cancer that rooms 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.109
 ten capacities as always indicated 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:17.569
 ent mixed dollars in 2008 in Valencia the playlists share of 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.969
 At the given moment, the kira kira letters were suspicious, just like tevez 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.199
 when this tournament 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:27.809
 below the middle two streets one of the watford minutes that the important thing 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:28.730
 is that he played 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.189
 the important thing is that the last letter 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.759
 the king who is only baghdad up because 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.019
 Well, very simple because 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.879
 tigers the letters you have 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.819
 the changes as the candles put as the purchases the one that has the tooth 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.079
 sorry the king will be the loser always 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.680
 in a poker game 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.379
 obviously it starts 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.459
 throwing first to the viewer if you are the hand you are the last both in 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.589
 this case they are 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:01.139
 players 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.539
 well 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:07.919
 always starting with the pri as haiti in how it was fought as he has 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:08.679
 king 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:13.039
 for a good serve move, yours will always be superior to a couple 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:14.059
 of aces 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:17.059
 you have nothing because I got a couple of ladies 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:18.769
 and you say 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.769
 pick up the letters and this time 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:26.659
 with the second move you will be the loser you will play the day the king 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.869
 canra producer pablo work 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:30.459
 let's put here 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.409
 and you with these are going to continue the play because that competition 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:37.609
 indicating to the tute all that the winner is done 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.659
 teachers teacher which mixed with total freedom but keeping in mind 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.449
 what are you going to wear 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:46.789
 email 

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:48.999
 to the top 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:54.539
 and at this point it indicates you are from the md Guadalajara viewer when 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:57.139
 you want when the life has put you 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:58.309
 I wanted to write 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:02.619
 the important thing is that the king does not have down because you do 

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:03.750
 laws 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.179
 Now it's going to be you, I'm going to make you win 

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:07.330
 the page 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.990
 recently it is needed after five letters and the last one in that thought that 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.360
 It was you, so whether you have or do not have what you do, it will always be 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.079
 the winner 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.000
 there is no play 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.069
 and he has a partner 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:25.189
 double pair of aces 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:26.469
 go to more 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:29.469
 and finally the same thing 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.830
 by the real ones to the mixture leading to the bottom 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.870
 yes this day climbing again up 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.529
 if you do the same player 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:46.389
 stop whenever you want if you have a lot of letters left in it 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.280
 in the dtm with the diraya all of a shot in the head 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.029
 putting the king and the top 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:57.889
 already the king's series added and I said it is once delivered the 20 the antilles 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.629

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.629
 that are delivered 3 that are delivered two a 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:09.119
 and those of which honda according to said the only letter that can not modify happens nothing 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.270

 exchange you have to do only with those that remain 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.719
 the important thing as I say is that always the loser 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.759

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.949
