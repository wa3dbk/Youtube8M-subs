00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
the way of the isolation thing where's

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.290 
the way of the isolation thing where's
the<00:02:39.470> titans<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.220> fat<00:02:40.400> thing<00:02:40.550> is<00:02:40.700> for<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.180> bit

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
the titans the fat thing is for it a bit

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.420 
the titans the fat thing is for it a bit
more<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:41.600> like<00:02:41.810> wedges<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.380> your<00:02:42.530> ear<00:02:42.800> this

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
sounds like a space between the gel and

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.900 
sounds like a space between the gel and
here<00:02:45.470> where<00:02:45.860> all<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.100> sound<00:02:46.340> like<00:02:46.490> escapes

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
here where all the sound like escapes

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.200 
here where all the sound like escapes
like<00:02:47.180> right<00:02:47.390> in<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.510> middle<00:02:48.940> it<00:02:49.940> doesn't

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
like right in the middle it doesn't

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.000 
like right in the middle it doesn't
isolate<00:02:50.390> that<00:02:50.720> will<00:02:51.110> doesn't<00:02:51.500> put<00:02:51.710> me<00:02:51.830> in<00:02:51.890> the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
isolate that will doesn't put me in the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.930 
isolate that will doesn't put me in the
isolated<00:02:52.520> state<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:53.180> mine<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.600> know<00:02:53.630> um<00:02:54.170> yeah

isolated state of mine you know um yeah

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.670 
isolated state of mine you know um yeah
so<00:02:55.940> um<00:02:56.360> they<00:02:56.720> provide<00:02:57.080> a<00:02:57.110> bunch<00:02:57.350> of<00:02:57.440> different

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
because these have a good amount of base

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.120 
because these have a good amount of base
I<00:03:14.300> mean<00:03:14.450> they<00:03:14.660> aren't<00:03:14.810> like<00:03:15.170> overwhelming

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
I mean they aren't like overwhelming

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.180 
I mean they aren't like overwhelming
this<00:03:16.310> blah<00:03:17.060> blah<00:03:17.540> blah<00:03:17.570> no<00:03:18.560> they<00:03:18.860> actually

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
this blah blah blah no they actually

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.480 
this blah blah blah no they actually
pretty<00:03:19.550> good<00:03:19.790> it's<00:03:20.480> it's<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.740> even<00:03:22.130> amount<00:03:22.400> of

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
pretty good it's it's the even amount of

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.630 
pretty good it's it's the even amount of
base<00:03:23.140> not<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.380> base<00:03:24.560> isn't<00:03:24.800> as<00:03:25.010> muddy<00:03:25.280> as<00:03:25.370> the

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
base not the base isn't as muddy as the

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.790 
base not the base isn't as muddy as the
titans<00:03:26.000> skullcandy<00:03:26.990> times<00:03:27.170> are<00:03:27.350> cheaper

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
titans skullcandy times are cheaper

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.280 
titans skullcandy times are cheaper
they're<00:03:28.190> only<00:03:28.310> like<00:03:28.550> 40<00:03:29.030> something<00:03:29.690> yeah<00:03:30.020> 40

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
they're only like 40 something yeah 40

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.770 
they're only like 40 something yeah 40
bucks<00:03:30.500> but<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.370> basis<00:03:31.760> even<00:03:31.970> heavy<00:03:32.390> entities

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
bucks but the basis even heavy entities

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.510 
bucks but the basis even heavy entities
so<00:03:33.320> if<00:03:33.410> you're<00:03:33.530> basically<00:03:33.920> go<00:03:34.100> for<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.310> times

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
so if you're basically go for the times

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.150 
so if you're basically go for the times
for<00:03:34.730> sure<00:03:34.790> much<00:03:35.750> better<00:03:35.960> by<00:03:36.140> but<00:03:36.680> if<00:03:36.800> you<00:03:36.980> want

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
for sure much better by but if you want

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.470 
for sure much better by but if you want
like<00:03:37.310> balanced<00:03:37.700> sound<00:03:37.940> definitely<00:03:38.330> go<00:03:38.450> for

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
like balanced sound definitely go for

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.130
