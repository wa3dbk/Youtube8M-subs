00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.090
 today we are going to prepare oreo cake pops 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.580
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.200
 they are 260 grams of oreo cookies and 80 ml 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.710
 of cream for riding 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.039
 and we already have the oreo and the cream 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.869
 [Music] 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.000
 now let's take the oreo cookies and 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.310
 we are going to open them we are going to leave in a 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.039
 bowl the cream that has inside 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.289
 and in the other bowl what is the basis of 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.219
 the cookie 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.219
 no no 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.250
 once separated they will be 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:42.489
 approximately 70 grams of cream x 190 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.170
 grams of cookies now we take the 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.170
 cookies and we're going to crush the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.710
 I recommend that if you have a 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.650
 you do it with the chopper already 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.869
 that will be much easier and faster 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.869
 [Music] 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.170
 there should be a texture the more 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:16.879
 fine better 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:16.879
 [Music] 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:24.299
 once we have them we will separate 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.759
 approximately 160 grams for the dough 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.780
 and 30 grams for the final decoration of 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.640
 our cake pops now let's catch 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.649
 the cream and we're going to put it in a bowl 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.810
 and with the help of a rod blender 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:40.019
 we are going to mount it 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.019
 [Music] 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.149
 we will know that the cream is mounted when 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.040
 let's go around the bowl and not 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.740
 fall 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.570
 now we take the 70 grams of cream 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.840
 I pray and we're going to put them in the bathroom 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.890
 a few seconds once melted what 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.440
 remove from heat once the tibia 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.630
 cream let's take the cream and let's go 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.700
 adding the little by little and we're going to 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.300
 Mix with enveloping movements to 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.300
 do not go down 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.509
 two 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:24.000
 [Music] 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.890
 once we have the frosting ready let's go 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.810
 to prepare the dough for it in a 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.050
 empty bowl we put cookies oreo 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.460
 crushed and a little frosting 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.430
 we mix and we will be playing with the 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.930
 texture is to say if when making a ball the 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.200
 mass cracks and breaks easily 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.090
 you will have to throw more frosting if by the 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.060
 opposite when making a ball sticks to 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.570
 our hands will miss biscuit has you 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.700
 to leave a texture like this 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.340
 As you can see in my case, I used the 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.740
 160 grams of crushed cookies and one 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.110
 fourth fifth part of the frosting 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.780
 now we proceed to make the cake pops 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.710
 For this we will make balls with our hands 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.710
 the size of a walnut 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.710
 two 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:24.070
 [Music] 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.500
 once all the balls are done, 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.890
 we put in the fridge for 30 minutes 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:34.130
 so that they gain consistency 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:36.590
 [Music] 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.810
 The ingredients for coverage are 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.620
 white chocolate to melt and cookies 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.590
 crushed oreos we already have the oreo 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.810
 crushed and chocolate now let's 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.460
 melt the chocolate in the bain-marie and 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.290
 once melted we remove it from the fire 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.920
 do not 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.140
 then we take a stick bathe 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.000
 one end in chocolate and what 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.490
 we put in our cake pop until the 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.330
 half more or less 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.460
 how 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.410
 when we have them all ready the 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.420
 We will put in the freezer for 10 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:20.030
 minutes for chocolate to harden 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:21.950
 and make glue effect now just 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.420
 is to cover and decorate our cake 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.130
 pops for it 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.740
 we put the cake pop in white chocolate 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.090
 and we bathe it with a spoon 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.880
 and we'll take it out a little inclined 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.090
 we will remove the excess coverage giving 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.040
 a few taps and without letting the 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.440
 coverage we will scatter of oreo aiete 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.220
