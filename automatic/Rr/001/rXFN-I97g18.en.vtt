hello and welcome to this accomplished
beginners<00:00:02.909> bloody<00:00:03.120> tutorial<00:00:03.689> number<00:00:03.870> 23<00:00:04.620> and

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
beginners bloody tutorial number 23 and

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.570 
beginners bloody tutorial number 23 and
this<00:00:05.430> will<00:00:05.580> continue<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.120> work<00:00:06.180> with<00:00:06.330> hair<00:00:06.990> and

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
this will continue to work with hair and

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.000 
this will continue to work with hair and
the<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.880> course<00:00:09.179> it's<00:00:09.769> implemented<00:00:10.769> through<00:00:10.980> a

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
the of course it's implemented through a

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.370 
the of course it's implemented through a
particle<00:00:11.519> systems<00:00:11.910> these<00:00:12.509> two<00:00:12.780> Suzanne's

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
particle systems these two Suzanne's

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.430 
particle systems these two Suzanne's
have<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.830> same<00:00:14.040> particle<00:00:14.519> system<00:00:15.139> except<00:00:16.139> for

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
have the same particle system except for

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.390 
have the same particle system except for
the<00:00:16.619> way<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.920> children<00:00:17.340> are<00:00:17.810> formed<00:00:19.220> so<00:00:20.220> if<00:00:20.279> I

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
the way the children are formed so if I

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.179 
the way the children are formed so if I
turn<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:20.880> on<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.359> turn<00:00:22.230> off<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.800> children

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
turn this on and turn off the children

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.810 
turn this on and turn off the children
you<00:00:23.340> get<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.789> regular<00:00:24.359> spikes<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.820> that's

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
you get the regular spikes and that's

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.080 
you get the regular spikes and that's
true<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.630> one<00:00:27.810> too<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.949> they're<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
true for that one too so they're the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.600 
true for that one too so they're the
same<00:00:30.300> particle<00:00:31.140> system<00:00:31.500> just<00:00:31.859> different

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.720 

different<00:00:35.610> children<00:00:35.989> so<00:00:36.989> if<00:00:37.110> i<00:00:37.290> press<00:00:38.129> f12<00:00:38.489> to

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
different children so if i press f12 to

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.780 
different children so if i press f12 to
render<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.170> what<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:40.790> that

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
render that this is what you get that

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.799 
render that this is what you get that
doesn't<00:00:42.120> look<00:00:42.210> very<00:00:42.270> hair<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:43.579> so<00:00:44.579> we'll<00:00:44.809> go

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
doesn't look very hair like so we'll go

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.770 
doesn't look very hair like so we'll go
back<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.020> 3d<00:00:46.559> view<00:00:46.770> here<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.370> turn<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
back to 3d view here and turn on the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.930 
back to 3d view here and turn on the
interpolated<00:00:49.770> children<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:50.370> both<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:52.940> let's

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
interpolated children for both so let's

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.130 
interpolated children for both so let's
just<00:00:54.149> examine<00:00:55.760> we<00:00:56.760> can<00:00:56.940> also<00:00:57.149> render<00:00:57.780> these

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
just examine we can also render these

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.139 
just examine we can also render these
just<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.530> see<00:00:58.680> what<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.949> looks<00:00:59.010> like<00:00:59.340> and

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
just to see what that looks like and

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.820 
just to see what that looks like and
let's<00:01:00.420> examine<00:01:00.870> them<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:02.309> factors<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:02.850> form

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
let's examine them the factors that form

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.030 
let's examine them the factors that form
hair<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:06.119> course<00:01:06.150> there's<00:01:06.869> always<00:01:07.140> lots

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
hair and of course there's always lots

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.480 
hair and of course there's always lots
of<00:01:08.250> tweaks<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:09.030> want<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.330> do<00:01:10.010> all<00:01:11.010> I'm<00:01:11.220> doing

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
of tweaks you want to do all I'm doing

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.429 
of tweaks you want to do all I'm doing
here<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.760> just<00:01:11.850> demonstrating<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.840> factors

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
here is just demonstrating the factors

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.859 
here is just demonstrating the factors
that<00:01:16.130> have<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.189> great<00:01:17.340> impact<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:18.119> what<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
that have a great impact on what the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.850 
that have a great impact on what the
hair<00:01:19.020> looks<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:20.310> except<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:21.860> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
hair looks like so except for the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.609 
hair looks like so except for the
material<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.520> you're<00:01:23.850> using<00:01:27.080> there's<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
material that you're using there's the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.789 
material that you're using there's the
render<00:01:29.100> panel<00:01:29.329> where<00:01:30.329> if<00:01:30.600> if<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.170> render

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
render panel where if if you render

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.240 
render panel where if if you render
strand<00:01:32.759> render<00:01:33.210> or<00:01:33.420> not<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.890> one<00:01:35.130> here

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
strand render or not and this one here

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.550 
strand render or not and this one here
is<00:01:38.250> turn<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.240> will<00:01:39.420> turn<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.900> strand<00:01:40.170> render

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
is turn and will turn the strand render

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.469 
is turn and will turn the strand render
off<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.280> one<00:01:41.460> here<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:41.939> keep<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.299> on

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
off and this one here we can keep it on

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.690 
off and this one here we can keep it on
and<00:01:43.970> we'll<00:01:44.970> do<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.299> also<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.280> you<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.460> see

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
and we'll do that also and you can see

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.120 
and we'll do that also and you can see
that<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.450> strand<00:01:48.990> render<00:01:49.470> case<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.950> one

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
that in the strand render case the one

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.830 
that in the strand render case the one
closest<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.000> us<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:52.409> little<00:01:52.710> bit<00:01:52.860> lighter

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
closest to us is a little bit lighter

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.130 
closest to us is a little bit lighter
and<00:01:55.250> to<00:01:56.250> kind<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.549> wisp<00:01:56.850> you're<00:01:57.180> thinner<00:01:57.659> hairs

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
and to kind of wisp you're thinner hairs

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.560 
and to kind of wisp you're thinner hairs
even<00:01:59.100> though<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.460> materials<00:02:00.000> are<00:02:00.149> exactly

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
even though the materials are exactly

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.319 
even though the materials are exactly
the<00:02:00.750> same<00:02:00.780> actually<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.439> looks<00:02:01.680> more<00:02:01.770> like

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
the same actually this looks more like

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.350 
the same actually this looks more like
wire<00:02:03.329> or<00:02:03.719> something<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.560> if<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.759> want<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.180> use

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
wire or something so if you want to use

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.510 
wire or something so if you want to use
that<00:02:06.390> if<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.380> don't<00:02:07.680> want<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.009> use<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.280> Strand

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
that if you don't want to use the Strand

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.949 
that if you don't want to use the Strand
render<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.209> think<00:02:09.390> about<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.810> when

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
render you have to think about that when

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.570 
render you have to think about that when
you<00:02:10.110> create<00:02:10.410> your<00:02:10.530> material<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.310> has<00:02:11.400> to

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
you create your material that it has to

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.370 
you create your material that it has to
be<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.910> little<00:02:12.450> bit<00:02:12.599> different<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.110> give

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
be a little bit different to give

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.040 
be a little bit different to give
same<00:02:13.560> result<00:02:13.800> or<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.400> result<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.210> is<00:02:15.510> what

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
same result or a result that is what

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.380 
same result or a result that is what
you're<00:02:16.170> looking<00:02:16.230> for<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.700> let's<00:02:17.910> look<00:02:17.970> at<00:02:18.240> this

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
you're looking for so let's look at this

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.790 
you're looking for so let's look at this
one<00:02:18.660> here<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:20.540> we<00:02:21.540> can<00:02:21.720> turn<00:02:21.990> something<00:02:22.200> more

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
one here and we can turn something more

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.770 
one here and we can turn something more
off<00:02:22.980> we<00:02:23.160> can<00:02:23.340> turn<00:02:23.550> off<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.910> kink<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:26.660> then<00:02:27.660> we

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
off we can turn off the kink and then we

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.330 
off we can turn off the kink and then we
can<00:02:27.930> change<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.530> length<00:02:28.920> I'll<00:02:29.430> also<00:02:31.340> lower

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
can change the length I'll also lower

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.700 
can change the length I'll also lower
the<00:02:32.460> amount<00:02:33.240> of<00:02:33.600> display<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.320> can<00:02:34.470> take<00:02:34.650> only

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
the amount of display it can take only

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.800 
the amount of display it can take only
five<00:02:35.430> there<00:02:35.820> so<00:02:36.030> we<00:02:36.150> can<00:02:36.300> see<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.540> little<00:02:36.690> bit

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
five there so we can see a little bit

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.140 
five there so we can see a little bit
more<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.680> individual<00:02:38.190> strands<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.880> if<00:02:39.030> I

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
more the individual strands and if I

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.290 
more the individual strands and if I
increase<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.870> length<00:02:40.520> one<00:02:41.520> means<00:02:41.820> it's<00:02:42.090> as

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
increase the length one means it's as

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.600 
increase the length one means it's as
long<00:02:42.810> as<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.380> parents<00:02:43.800> are<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.160> then<00:02:44.340> there's

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
long as the parents are and then there's

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.310 
long as the parents are and then there's
fractions<00:02:45.240> of<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:45.840> that's<00:02:45.990> how<00:02:46.260> that

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
fractions of that so that's how that

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.550 
fractions of that so that's how that
works<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:47.600> another<00:02:48.600> thing<00:02:48.750> is<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.320> endpoint

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
works and another thing is the endpoint

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.640 
works and another thing is the endpoint
rough<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:51.660> does<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:53.630> so<00:02:54.630> if<00:02:54.750> we<00:02:54.810> have<00:02:55.350> a

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
rough and that does that so if we have a

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.400 
rough and that does that so if we have a
little<00:02:56.100> bit<00:02:56.220> greater<00:02:56.520> length<00:02:57.000> than<00:02:57.410> that

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
little bit greater length than that

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.160 
little bit greater length than that
endpoint<00:02:58.770> rough<00:02:59.220> comes<00:02:59.700> out<00:02:59.940> like<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.420> and

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.280 

also<00:03:04.170> if<00:03:04.560> we<00:03:04.590> turn<00:03:05.070> on<00:03:05.250> wave<00:03:06.210> for<00:03:06.690> instance<00:03:07.020> and

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
also if we turn on wave for instance and

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.530 
also if we turn on wave for instance and
then<00:03:08.130> you<00:03:08.250> can<00:03:08.400> see<00:03:08.550> that<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.850> endpoint<00:03:09.360> rough

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
then you can see that the endpoint rough

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.110 
then you can see that the endpoint rough
kind<00:03:12.540> of<00:03:12.630> turns<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.350> strands<00:03:13.950> like<00:03:14.130> that<00:03:17.120> and

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
kind of turns the strands like that and

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.360 
kind of turns the strands like that and
also<00:03:18.300> you<00:03:18.450> can<00:03:18.630> change<00:03:18.900> change<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.830> shape<00:03:20.100> of

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
also you can change change the shape of

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.350 
also you can change change the shape of
that<00:03:20.630> to<00:03:21.630> some<00:03:21.870> degree<00:03:23.420> just<00:03:24.420> keep<00:03:24.660> that<00:03:24.690> and

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
that to some degree just keep that and

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.090 
that to some degree just keep that and
if<00:03:27.360> we<00:03:27.690> change<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.110> amplitude<00:03:28.230> there<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:29.450> 0.02

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
if we change the amplitude there to 0.02

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:42.560 
if we change the amplitude there to 0.02
and<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:33.840> can<00:03:40.580> increase<00:03:41.580> the<00:03:41.610> frequency<00:03:41.940> to

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
and the can increase the frequency to

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.470 
and the can increase the frequency to
let's<00:03:43.050> say<00:03:43.230> five<00:03:45.560> then<00:03:46.560> when<00:03:46.980> i<00:03:47.120> change<00:03:48.120> this

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
let's say five then when i change this

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.880 
let's say five then when i change this
around<00:03:48.900> you'll<00:03:49.560> see<00:03:50.390> how<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:51.600> so<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.650> speak

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
around you'll see how it so to speak

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:59.870 
around you'll see how it so to speak
bends<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:53.610> twists<00:03:57.410> so<00:03:58.410> let's<00:03:58.620> turn<00:03:59.130> back<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.580> 2

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
bends and twists so let's turn back to 2

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:08.420 
bends and twists so let's turn back to 2
and<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:02.930> 0.0<00:04:04.459> let's<00:04:05.459> 55<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:07.160> then<00:04:08.160> if<00:04:08.280> we

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
and the 0.0 let's 55 and then if we

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:17.430 
and the 0.0 let's 55 and then if we
increase<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.820> length<00:04:09.240> a<00:04:09.480> little<00:04:09.780> bit

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.069 

so<00:04:18.440> here<00:04:19.070> we<00:04:19.220> have<00:04:19.250> more<00:04:19.940> endpoint<00:04:20.479> rough<00:04:20.780> and

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
so here we have more endpoint rough and

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:42.780 
so here we have more endpoint rough and
there<00:04:21.410> is<00:04:21.530> less<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:23.380> render<00:04:24.380> that

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.360 

and<00:04:43.150> of<00:04:43.630> course<00:04:43.660> you'll<00:04:44.020> have<00:04:44.200> to<00:04:44.350> work<00:04:44.530> you

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
and of course you'll have to work you

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.610 
and of course you'll have to work you
know<00:04:45.520> tweaking<00:04:46.360> it<00:04:46.540> to<00:04:46.810> find<00:04:47.080> out<00:04:47.260> something

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
know tweaking it to find out something

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.330 
know tweaking it to find out something
that<00:04:47.800> looks<00:04:48.130> more<00:04:49.110> like<00:04:50.110> hair<00:04:50.380> actually<00:04:50.620> and

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
that looks more like hair actually and

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.220 
that looks more like hair actually and
you<00:04:51.790> can<00:04:51.970> actually<00:04:52.120> make<00:04:52.480> it<00:04:52.630> look<00:04:52.660> like<00:04:52.960> hair

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
you can actually make it look like hair

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.320 
you can actually make it look like hair
but<00:04:53.650> in<00:04:53.920> this<00:04:54.070> tutorial<00:04:54.370> we'll<00:04:54.760> just<00:04:54.970> looking

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
but in this tutorial we'll just looking

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.350 
but in this tutorial we'll just looking
at<00:04:55.480> the<00:04:56.350> you<00:04:56.710> know<00:04:56.830> the<00:04:56.980> different<00:04:57.430> factors

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
at the you know the different factors

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.500 
at the you know the different factors
that<00:04:58.510> shape<00:04:58.870> the<00:04:58.930> hair<00:04:59.320> that's<00:05:00.280> going<00:05:00.580> to<00:05:00.640> what

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
that shape the hair that's going to what

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.450 
that shape the hair that's going to what
I<00:05:01.540> want<00:05:01.690> to<00:05:01.870> do<00:05:02.020> here<00:05:02.380> is<00:05:02.500> on<00:05:02.650> this<00:05:02.950> one<00:05:03.160> here<00:05:03.430> I

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
I want to do here is on this one here I

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.090 
I want to do here is on this one here I
want<00:05:03.730> to<00:05:03.790> turn<00:05:04.030> on<00:05:04.270> the<00:05:05.230> Strand<00:05:05.590> renderer<00:05:06.130> and

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
want to turn on the Strand renderer and

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.060 
want to turn on the Strand renderer and
also<00:05:09.900> increase<00:05:10.900> the<00:05:11.170> endpoint<00:05:11.620> rough<00:05:11.920> a

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
also increase the endpoint rough a

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.340 
also increase the endpoint rough a
little<00:05:12.280> bit<00:05:12.400> more<00:05:12.640> so<00:05:13.450> we<00:05:13.480> can<00:05:13.600> look<00:05:13.930> at<00:05:14.080> that

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
little bit more so we can look at that

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.350 
little bit more so we can look at that
and<00:05:15.390> render<00:05:16.390> that<00:05:16.630> and<00:05:16.960> see<00:05:17.310> how<00:05:18.360> relatively

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
and render that and see how relatively

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.660 
and render that and see how relatively
wispy<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:20.320> hair<00:05:20.560> is<00:05:20.740> look<00:05:23.460> so<00:05:24.460> this<00:05:24.640> is

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
wispy the hair is look so this is

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.160 
wispy the hair is look so this is
something<00:05:25.030> that<00:05:25.270> you<00:05:25.720> have<00:05:26.170> to<00:05:26.200> work<00:05:26.680> with

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
something that you have to work with

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.020 
something that you have to work with
basically<00:05:29.170> you<00:05:29.980> know<00:05:30.100> trial<00:05:30.460> and<00:05:30.670> error<00:05:30.820> your

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
basically you know trial and error your

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.540 
basically you know trial and error your
way<00:05:31.210> through<00:05:31.810> so<00:05:32.200> that<00:05:32.230> you<00:05:32.470> get<00:05:32.710> a<00:05:32.950> hair<00:05:33.220> that

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
way through so that you get a hair that

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.720 
way through so that you get a hair that
you<00:05:33.580> like<00:05:37.170> this<00:05:38.170> is<00:05:38.350> it<00:05:38.680> for<00:05:38.980> this<00:05:39.070> tutorial<00:05:39.220> in
