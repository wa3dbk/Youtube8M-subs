00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:16.080
 Broadband talk was hot 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.109
 I know it's not the radar gun she 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.609
 road a pistol to kill anyone 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:28.039
 of that automotive school is the theme of 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.840
 Today's video I'll tell you 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.350
 on the bill pistol, right? 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.320
 in the older cars they used 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.110
 distributor, this person is from 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.070
 extreme importance to put the car 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.020
 it does not count, right? 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.450
 new cases are no longer there 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.940
 quota system was the only one that makes the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.200
 reading the point in a more 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.230
 You need to 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.160
 So who has an old car there? 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.440
 have a distributor or do some 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.940
 maintenance built to shoot off and 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.570
 put in place 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.479
 exchange a real sense of 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.729
 distributor it is important to always use 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:15.090
 I'm here to play a date, huh? 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:24.450
 so I'll do it and show you soon 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:28.710
 my car on the beat there touch the point is Ã© 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.979
 the best singer I'm here saying the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.740
 mark all tc there are two types 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.220
 this story is a breakthrough and 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:43.979
 also invest the voice the difference 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:47.430
 between is the following when you girl already 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:51.060
 it's an expression there to see the big bet 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.759
 that the car is thus advancing in putting 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.570
 legal control is wanted here depending 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:02.030
 of your engine 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:05.930
 in the case of the gasoline engine is 9th year in the 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.910
 space where it appears the marking degrees 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:13.770
 degrees 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:17.940
 the degrees advance 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:21.030
 the mark gives the difference between 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.290
 advances with which advance the 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.910
 t and so breakthrough will parcel 9 degrees in the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.050
 if the motor frame 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.030
 apnea is then following here we go 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:39.110
 you a car there how is it going to be? 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.110
 It's okay to put an account in 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.840
 the first step is to wait for armed motor 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.220
 expands twice 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.550
 then start a process of placing 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:59.240
 on the point here in the case of my pratinha 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:03.420
 the shorts club that the battery 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.640
 after heating before to twice 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.660
 This will be removed from the neighbor here 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.270
 It's the xote cloud beach there. 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:18.450
 make the point correction in the 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:23.010
 local distributor hot taste already 92 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:25.880
 times I took the local short club 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.880
 where is under 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:37.920
 here the pistol already the number 1 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.570
 The claws on the school's battery are 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.680
 ready to use now let's turn on the 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:48.740
 car and saw car point to mention 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.740
 O here there on distributor base 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:56.670
 the thirteen will give you the distributor to 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.490
 to reach the angle that we want 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.920
 in a house that car here is 9 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.290
 degrees 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:08.340
 Guys I will not be able to hold the 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:12.420
 camera records stole and rotate 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.490
 The time then I will show below gives a 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.620
 zoom 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:21.220
 the only window dismissal from the school of 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.360
 end of the word 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.360
 it was a better world 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.790
 so personal is the pictures were not 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.060
 very good, the camera can not 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.460
 find below the account a lot of 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.389
 thing in the front but the process is well 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:10.330
 simple dropped there the basic screw 3min 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:13.919
 distributor you program the pistol 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:18.460
 here in the degree of your car stoned 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:23.169
 It catches the trigger here and goes around 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:25.330
 distributor until reaching the angle 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:28.750
 do you want 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:31.300
 during the filming on the head 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:35.660
 detecting here in the water hose 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:39.630
 that there is a bubble hour 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:45.990
 about to burst in the car without 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:48.300
 Water in the street here almost were then already 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.760
 I'll arrange to exchange this way. 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.730
 that's complete not to happen 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.400
 no overheating problem 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:06:00.860
 Sorry the camera did not get it. 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:05.250
 find it right there I put it there 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:08.040
 image out of focus 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.350
 serginho you understand is right that 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.410
