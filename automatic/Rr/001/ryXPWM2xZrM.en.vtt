00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hi girls, I do not know if you know more 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.569
 slowly drifts away over time to the root 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.760
 is growing by creating volume and 13 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.719
 wanted to keep hair book from 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.360
 root to tips 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.700
 I use a new book roots of fruit he 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.949
 it is incredible then a protection buy one 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.420
 trip and intimacy then need to leave 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.420
 running desperate in the rain 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.880
 after washing the hair you apply the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.230
 product in the roots and comes with this nozzle 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.700
 an applicator that is just for 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.440
 to facilitate 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.120
 You can have your hair dry too. 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.629
 but I prefer damp hair to 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.489
 to facilitate the choice of the 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.440
 for breast hair you can do one of the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.340
 fingers on the wires as they look good 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.840
 like this 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.210
 this will help remove the moisture in 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:57.230
 and then you repeat this process 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.230
 across the hair root 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.810
 Now we are going to start preparing 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.760
 Hairstyle 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.350
 The first step is to make a brush in the 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.350
 sense from root to tips 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.170
 now with dry hair and I'm going to do 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.420
 iron to lower all the threads 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.370
 rebels and commanders have to roots 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.580
 having a job can leave me without 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.020
 Fear with super smooth hair you can 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.729
 make several hairstyles 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.130
 today I will teach the waterfall braid that 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:36.790
 look beautiful in the hair give you the first 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.290
 step is to separate the hair to braid 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.970
 If you have a shorter fringe you can 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.440
 to separate let loose like my fringe 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.930
 the longer I will put housed in the 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.119
 hairstyle and then you start doing 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.670
 the beginning is super simple you will be 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.830
 for it tries to separate more or less from 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.570
 same thickness and will start to 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.030
 hair transition 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.810
 from that moment you will leave 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.420
 this hair is falling loose and it goes 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.700
 get your hair in here to 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.979
 create the parts 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.380
 here you embedded from above and you create 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.640
 here the third part taking this 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.019
 hair down here 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.269
 and then you will have released again 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.730
 always leaving the hair down here 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:22.260
 loose to create this waterfall effect 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.150
 does the same thing on the other side 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.560
 to finish the braid just continue 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.390
 making a simple braid 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.650
 We'll join the two parties later. 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.599
 in the back of the head for that 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.849
 hairstyle looks beautiful it is important that 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.590
 your roots as simple as possible 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.790
 I hope you have enjoyed a 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.790
 Kisses and until the next 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.180
