I thought I had a fire extinguisher so I

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.230 
I thought I had a fire extinguisher so I
went<00:01:13.140> underneath<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.369> sink<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.880> my<00:01:15.000> kitchen

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
to go find it and it's not there I don't

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.340 
to go find it and it's not there I don't
know<00:01:17.820> if<00:01:18.000> one<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.210> my<00:01:18.299> friends<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.900> taken<00:01:19.259> it

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
know if one of my friends have taken it

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.899 
know if one of my friends have taken it
for<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.530> joke<00:01:19.799> or<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.400> use<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.790> or

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
for a joke or just to use it or

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.230 
for a joke or just to use it or
something<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.110> wasn't<00:01:22.409> there<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.920> I

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
something but it wasn't there so I

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.730 
something but it wasn't there so I
severely<00:01:24.240> started<00:01:24.810> panicking<00:01:25.049> as<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.590> can

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
severely started panicking as you can

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.070 
severely started panicking as you can
imagine<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.280> no<00:01:26.400> fire<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.939> house<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.360> very

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
imagine the no fire in the house is very

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.840 
imagine the no fire in the house is very
good<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.770> main<00:01:28.950> reason<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.280> was<00:01:29.400> panicking

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
good and the main reason I was panicking

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.789 
good and the main reason I was panicking
is<00:01:30.119> because<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.540> had<00:01:30.900> no<00:01:31.079> way<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.290> putting<00:01:31.770> it

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
is because I had no way of putting it

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.950 
is because I had no way of putting it
out<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:31.979> had<00:01:32.220> no<00:01:32.369> fire<00:01:32.610> extinguisher<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.750> half

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
out I had no fire extinguisher it's half

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.260 
out I had no fire extinguisher it's half
past<00:01:34.170> one<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> morning<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.400> nobody's
