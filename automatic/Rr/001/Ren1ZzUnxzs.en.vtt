 reader app like the google play people 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.740
 he really liked it a lot because 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.390
 we have thought about the application

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.910
 owned a computer and the application was

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.740
 thought what questions to answer 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.090
 quickly the application and then 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.320

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.320
 of an application can support a 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.500
 such high level of video and concurrency 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.210
