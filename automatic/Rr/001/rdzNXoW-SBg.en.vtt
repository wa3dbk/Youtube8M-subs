00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.089

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.160
 follow film sank here on the film factory 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.519
 today we start with our film tips 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.590
 on 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.719
 and today we have movies about 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.299
 orphans the first movie is the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.580
 Open to German the orphanage 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.650
 pretty touching horror drama 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.779
 spain and mexico with incredible 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.519
 By the way, no one works on camera 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.260
 produced less than gm or el 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.119
 It's about a woman who is with her 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.070
 family buys the house in which they as 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.900
 Child has lived an orphanage 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.030
 but exactly at this orphanage catches 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.469
 her son simon with six imaginary ones 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.000
 to speak to children by far 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.010
 more dangerous than the two 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.960
 friends who had before the move of the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.180
 film has a great atmosphere and 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.250
 he is told slowly but grippingly 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.320
 but who a scary tour de force of all 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.710
 the exorcist awaits here completely 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.719
 not correct 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.000
 but the orphanage is crazy 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.680
 touching and multilayered a film of 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.390
 a long time after his end 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.649
 second, we tie one up 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.840
 my favorite movies from martin 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.600
 scorsese and that is not even a mafia 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.300
 movie but hugo cabret we are 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.280
 us in the paris of 1930 he is an orphan boy 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.900
 lives in a train station and tries that 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.970
 to discover the secret of a machine 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.650
 he inherited from his father 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.450
 this film is a declaration of love 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.310
 the early cinema and especially one 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.799
 kneeling before the work of 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.930
 French film pioneer Georges Melis 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.610
 played here by ben kingsley 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.200
 certainly not an insider tip after all 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.090
 the film won five oscars 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.860
 But hugo cabret is crazy 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.450
 charming, honest and moving 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.729
