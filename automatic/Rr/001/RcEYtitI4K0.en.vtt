touring cars handling is sort of mixed
between<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.140> different<00:00:31.439> cars<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.890> tried<00:00:32.099> to

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
between the different cars I tried to

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.819 
between the different cars I tried to
some<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.780> faster<00:00:33.780> LeMond<00:00:34.140> style<00:00:34.530> cars

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
some of the faster LeMond style cars

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.709 
some of the faster LeMond style cars
wasn't<00:00:35.280> too<00:00:35.370> keen<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.969> handling<00:00:36.420> approach

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
wasn't too keen on the handling approach

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.709 
wasn't too keen on the handling approach
to<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.170> but<00:00:37.680> these<00:00:37.829> cars<00:00:38.129> he's<00:00:38.399> new<00:00:38.690> 2014<00:00:39.690> I

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
to it but these cars he's new 2014 I

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.840 
to it but these cars he's new 2014 I
think<00:00:40.050> these<00:00:40.170> are<00:00:41.629> WTCC<00:00:42.629> cars<00:00:43.079> are<00:00:43.850> they're

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
think these are WTCC cars are they're

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.330 
think these are WTCC cars are they're
really<00:00:45.180> really<00:00:45.450> fun<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.989> drive<00:00:46.230> some<00:00:46.950> really

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
really really fun to drive some really

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.230 
really really fun to drive some really
nice<00:00:48.079> intuitive<00:00:49.079> feelings<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.950> them

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:51.240 
nice intuitive feelings to them

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.110 
nice intuitive feelings to them
you<00:00:51.720> know<00:00:51.840> there's<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.500> much<00:00:52.740> law<00:00:53.400> to<00:00:53.460> maximize

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
you know there's so much law to maximize

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.370 
you know there's so much law to maximize
the<00:00:54.240> handling<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.840> I'm<00:00:54.900> certainly<00:00:55.230> not

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
the handling so I'm certainly not

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.500 
the handling so I'm certainly not
maximizing<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.100> handling<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.580> in<00:00:57.270> this

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
maximizing and handling in this in this

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.060 
maximizing and handling in this in this
video<00:00:57.870> really<00:00:58.200> just<00:00:58.470> sort<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.650> giving<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
video really just sort of giving it a

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.410 
video really just sort of giving it a
cruise<00:00:59.370> around<00:00:59.580> the<00:00:59.790> school<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.270> quite

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
cruise around the school and it's quite

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.660 
cruise around the school and it's quite
interesting<00:01:00.720> high-speed<00:01:01.470> entry<00:01:01.950> and<00:01:02.310> they're

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
interesting high-speed entry and they're

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.700 
interesting high-speed entry and they're
breaking<00:01:03.060> on<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.210> exit<00:01:03.690> quite<00:01:04.230> tricky<00:01:04.410> if<00:01:04.620> you

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
breaking on the exit quite tricky if you

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.300 
breaking on the exit quite tricky if you
hit<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> brakes<00:01:05.190> at<00:01:06.000> any<00:01:06.210> time<00:01:06.540> there<00:01:06.870> you<00:01:07.310> car

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
hit the brakes at any time there you car

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.190 
hit the brakes at any time there you car
starts<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.790> spin<00:01:09.090> out<00:01:09.210> very<00:01:09.450> quickly<00:01:09.660> and<00:01:10.110> you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
starts to spin out very quickly and you

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.050 
starts to spin out very quickly and you
can't<00:01:10.470> save<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.160> you're<00:01:11.310> most<00:01:11.580> scrubbing

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
can't save it so you're most scrubbing

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.420 
can't save it so you're most scrubbing
speed<00:01:12.390> off<00:01:12.540> through<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.840> corner<00:01:13.430> looking

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
speed off through the corner looking

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.520 
speed off through the corner looking
awake<00:01:14.820> for<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.060> apex<00:01:15.480> flat<00:01:15.870> through<00:01:15.900> here<00:01:16.380> and

awake for the apex flat through here and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.320 
awake for the apex flat through here and
then<00:01:16.620> I<00:01:16.740> tend<00:01:16.980> to<00:01:17.070> break<00:01:17.280> straighter<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:18.150> have

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
then I tend to break straighter to have

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.690

to high speed corner I'm a little bit

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.309 
to high speed corner I'm a little bit
conscious<00:02:18.209> here<00:02:18.450> because<00:02:18.690> I'm<00:02:18.780> not<00:02:18.930> quick

conscious here because I'm not quick
through<00:02:19.530> here<00:02:19.590> I'm<00:02:19.769> finding<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.160> AI<00:02:20.340> and

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
through here I'm finding the AI and

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.479 
through here I'm finding the AI and
break<00:02:21.569> later<00:02:21.900> into<00:02:22.290> this<00:02:22.380> corner<00:02:22.709> comfortably

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
break later into this corner comfortably

break later into this corner comfortably
than<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.790> can<00:02:24.090> we've<00:02:24.989> struggled<00:02:25.290> with<00:02:25.590> this

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
than I can we've struggled with this

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.910 
than I can we've struggled with this
corner<00:02:26.160> I'm<00:02:26.280> still<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:27.540> still<00:02:27.959> not<00:02:28.260> found<00:02:28.530> my

into<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.380> corner<00:02:31.620> yet<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:32.160> think<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.670> reason

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
into that corner yet I think the reason

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.280 
into that corner yet I think the reason
for<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.239> beings<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.959> when<00:02:34.140> you're

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
for that beings that when you're

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
really exploring the limit so as soon as

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.020 
really exploring the limit so as soon as
you<00:02:39.780> get<00:02:39.900> into<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.230> lead<00:02:40.410> when<00:02:40.950> suddenly<00:02:41.190> you

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
you get into the lead when suddenly you

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.789 
you get into the lead when suddenly you
realize<00:02:42.360> you're<00:02:42.780> able<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.110> break<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.380> bit<00:02:43.590> later

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
realize you're able to break a bit later

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.309 
realize you're able to break a bit later
and<00:02:44.160> sometimes<00:02:44.580> you're<00:02:44.700> great<00:02:44.910> too<00:02:44.940> late<00:02:45.360> so

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
and sometimes you're great too late so

I'm struggling with my judgement as to

I'm struggling with my judgement as to
the<00:02:55.739> width<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.280> car<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:57.090> that's

the width of the car and that's

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.190 
the width of the car and that's
something<00:02:57.660> which

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
something which

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.990 
something which
perfect<00:02:59.590> this<00:02:59.739> game<00:03:00.010> more<00:03:00.280> than<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.610> summer<00:03:00.849> i

perfect this game more than the summer i
don't<00:03:01.150> know<00:03:01.270> why<00:03:01.510> i<00:03:01.540> think<00:03:01.900> it's<00:03:02.110> just<00:03:02.379> getting

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
don't know why i think it's just getting

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.320 
don't know why i think it's just getting
your<00:03:02.739> line<00:03:02.980> right<00:03:03.340> now<00:03:03.580> i<00:03:03.760> think<00:03:03.940> you're<00:03:04.209> also

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
your line right now i think you're also

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.880 
your line right now i think you're also
doubt<00:03:04.599> the<00:03:04.720> fact<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.050> curbs<00:03:05.349> that<00:03:05.620> are<00:03:05.769> very

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
doubt the fact the curbs that are very

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.240 
doubt the fact the curbs that are very
bumpy<00:03:06.310> they<00:03:06.700> can<00:03:06.940> throw<00:03:07.269> you<00:03:07.330> off<00:03:07.660> so<00:03:08.590> it's

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
bumpy they can throw you off so it's

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.280 
bumpy they can throw you off so it's
important<00:03:09.849> to<00:03:09.970> find<00:03:10.000> that<00:03:10.360> line<00:03:10.540> i'd<00:03:10.780> put<00:03:11.050> such

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
important to find that line i'd put such

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.690 
important to find that line i'd put such
a<00:03:11.319> slightly<00:03:11.680> wider<00:03:12.010> lion<00:03:12.370> times

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
a slightly wider lion times

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.119 
a slightly wider lion times
so<00:03:14.270> to<00:03:14.330> swing<00:03:14.750> back<00:03:15.020> a<00:03:15.050> bit<00:03:15.290> better<00:03:15.470> it<00:03:15.830> didn't

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
so to swing back a bit better it didn't

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.280 
so to swing back a bit better it didn't

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
good frame right here but I've got a lot

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
really affects the experience I did try

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.599 
really affects the experience I did try
this<00:04:04.340> with<00:04:04.639> no<00:04:04.819> mirrors<00:04:05.239> and<00:04:05.480> you<00:04:06.379> know

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
this with no mirrors and you know

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.039 
this with no mirrors and you know
getting<00:04:07.609> surprised<00:04:08.060> by<00:04:08.269> cars<00:04:08.540> all<00:04:08.750> over<00:04:08.870> the

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
getting surprised by cars all over the

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.280 
getting surprised by cars all over the
place<00:04:09.260> all<00:04:09.470> the<00:04:09.590> time<00:04:09.650> and<00:04:10.040> it's<00:04:10.189> can<00:04:10.760> be

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
place all the time and it's can be

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.470 
place all the time and it's can be
can<00:04:13.250> be<00:04:13.340> challenging<00:04:13.760> as<00:04:13.879> I<00:04:14.000> take<00:04:14.150> a<00:04:14.209> little

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
can be challenging as I take a little

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.749 
can be challenging as I take a little
bump<00:04:14.689> from<00:04:14.840> behind<00:04:15.140> so<00:04:15.650> visually<00:04:16.430> yeah<00:04:16.639> the

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:16.759 
bump from behind so visually yeah the

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:18.580 
bump from behind so visually yeah the
game<00:04:16.940> is<00:04:17.120> nice<00:04:17.329> as<00:04:17.600> lots<00:04:17.780> of<00:04:17.900> structures<00:04:18.380> there

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
game is nice as lots of structures there

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.189 
game is nice as lots of structures there
but<00:04:18.799> it<00:04:18.889> needs<00:04:19.130> more<00:04:19.430> framerate<00:04:20.329> needs<00:04:21.019> more

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
but it needs more framerate needs more

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.990 
but it needs more framerate needs more
fluidity<00:04:21.440> especially<00:04:22.280> in<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.400> replay<00:04:22.699> mode

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
fluidity especially in the replay mode

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.510 
fluidity especially in the replay mode
the<00:04:23.810> ability<00:04:24.199> to<00:04:24.380> run<00:04:24.530> in<00:04:24.680> higher<00:04:24.830> settings<00:04:25.310> i

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
the ability to run in higher settings i

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.350 
the ability to run in higher settings i
think<00:04:25.729> you<00:04:25.820> know<00:04:25.850> when<00:04:26.030> you<00:04:26.120> look<00:04:26.210> at

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
think you know when you look at

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.909 
think you know when you look at
something<00:04:26.539> like<00:04:26.630> project<00:04:27.259> cars<00:04:27.470> that<00:04:27.620> runs

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
something like project cars that runs

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.420 
something like project cars that runs
very<00:04:28.160> smoothly<00:04:28.580> that<00:04:29.240> has<00:04:29.389> high<00:04:29.600> detail<00:04:30.080> i

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
very smoothly that has high detail i

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.860 
very smoothly that has high detail i
think<00:04:31.430> it<00:04:31.550> certainly<00:04:31.729> sets<00:04:32.090> a<00:04:32.210> benchmark<00:04:32.360> but

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
think it certainly sets a benchmark but

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.980 
think it certainly sets a benchmark but
i<00:04:32.930> think<00:04:33.139> when<00:04:33.289> i<00:04:33.320> go<00:04:34.130> from<00:04:34.370> that<00:04:34.550> to<00:04:34.610> this<00:04:34.990> get

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
i think when i go from that to this get

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.749 
i think when i go from that to this get
more<00:04:36.199> detailed<00:04:36.650> more<00:04:36.949> frame<00:04:37.220> rate<00:04:37.460> in<00:04:37.610> that

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
more detailed more frame rate in that

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.240 
more detailed more frame rate in that
moment<00:04:38.090> but<00:04:38.539> by<00:04:39.169> the<00:04:39.229> way<00:04:39.380> these<00:04:39.560> car<00:04:39.860> models

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
moment but by the way these car models

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.189 
moment but by the way these car models
are<00:04:40.430> really<00:04:40.880> nice<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.300> circuits<00:04:41.780> are<00:04:41.930> great

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
are really nice the circuits are great

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:46.659 
are really nice the circuits are great
and<00:04:43.190> it's<00:04:43.400> coming<00:04:43.759> along<00:04:43.850> so<00:04:44.680> racially<00:04:45.680> r3e

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
and it's coming along so racially r3e

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.790 
and it's coming along so racially r3e
has<00:04:46.880> come<00:04:47.090> a<00:04:47.120> long<00:04:47.240> way<00:04:47.660> forward<00:04:48.229> since<00:04:48.500> it<00:04:48.680> was

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
has come a long way forward since it was

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.710 
has come a long way forward since it was
first<00:04:49.009> length<00:04:49.310> but<00:04:49.669> in<00:04:50.090> particular<00:04:50.599> in

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
first length but in particular in

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.360 
first length but in particular in
handling

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.210 

I<00:04:55.370> take<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.700> lead<00:04:55.880> there<00:04:56.710> certain<00:04:57.710> how<00:04:57.800> fast<00:04:58.070> I

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
I take the lead there certain how fast I

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.800 
I take the lead there certain how fast I
can<00:04:58.280> go<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:58.580> school<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.150> I'm<00:04:59.270> trying<00:04:59.510> to<00:04:59.600> stop

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
can go to school and I'm trying to stop

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.040 
can go to school and I'm trying to stop
a<00:04:59.840> bit<00:05:00.020> speed<00:05:00.290> off<00:05:00.440> before<00:05:00.890> I<00:05:00.920> go<00:05:01.190> into<00:05:01.220> it<00:05:01.550> but

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
a bit speed off before I go into it but

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.600 
a bit speed off before I go into it but
it's<00:05:03.050> still<00:05:03.380> I<00:05:03.440> didn't<00:05:03.830> get<00:05:03.890> speed<00:05:04.310> down

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
it's still I didn't get speed down

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.110 
it's still I didn't get speed down
enough<00:05:04.970> there<00:05:05.330> so<00:05:05.890> the<00:05:06.890> problem<00:05:07.160> there<00:05:07.580> is<00:05:07.610> I

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
enough there so the problem there is I

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.200 
enough there so the problem there is I
could<00:05:09.050> break<00:05:09.380> harder<00:05:09.890> but<00:05:10.250> I<00:05:10.370> risk<00:05:10.640> spinning

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
could break harder but I risk spinning

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.330 
could break harder but I risk spinning
out<00:05:11.390> and<00:05:11.690> that<00:05:12.350> just<00:05:12.560> looks<00:05:12.740> rubbish<00:05:12.950> on<00:05:13.250> the

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
out and that just looks rubbish on the

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.570 
out and that just looks rubbish on the
video<00:05:13.610> so<00:05:14.330> i<00:05:14.720> can<00:05:15.170> seize<00:05:15.560> alongside<00:05:15.920> me<00:05:16.400> now

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
video so i can seize alongside me now

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.480 
video so i can seize alongside me now
really<00:05:16.940> handy<00:05:17.240> obviously<00:05:17.720> moments<00:05:18.170> like<00:05:18.290> that

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
really handy obviously moments like that

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.530 
really handy obviously moments like that
but<00:05:19.490> i<00:05:19.580> know<00:05:19.640> i'm<00:05:19.850> going<00:05:20.000> to<00:05:20.060> break<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.390> late

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
but i know i'm going to break the late

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.410 
but i know i'm going to break the late
here<00:05:20.750> and<00:05:21.050> take<00:05:21.230> this<00:05:21.260> corner<00:05:21.710> so<00:05:22.180> that's<00:05:23.180> fine

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
here and take this corner so that's fine

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.590 
here and take this corner so that's fine
gives<00:05:23.690> me<00:05:23.780> track<00:05:23.990> position<00:05:25.210> we<00:05:26.210> concerned

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
gives me track position we concerned

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.150 
gives me track position we concerned
about<00:05:26.780> this<00:05:26.870> final<00:05:27.290> call<00:05:27.530> and<00:05:27.680> I<00:05:27.740> just<00:05:27.950> don't

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
about this final call and I just don't

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.010 
about this final call and I just don't
seem<00:05:28.430> to<00:05:28.460> get<00:05:28.790> the<00:05:28.970> drive<00:05:29.240> into<00:05:29.540> that<00:05:29.690> of<00:05:29.810> light

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
seem to get the drive into that of light

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.110 
seem to get the drive into that of light
but<00:05:30.260> again<00:05:30.560> that's<00:05:30.770> a<00:05:30.919> the<00:05:31.280> screen<00:05:31.580> issue<00:05:31.790> will

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
but again that's a the screen issue will

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.540 
but again that's a the screen issue will
be<00:05:32.150> helpful<00:05:32.510> so<00:05:33.500> now<00:05:33.770> I'm<00:05:33.890> in<00:05:33.980> the<00:05:34.070> lead<00:05:34.190> then

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
be helpful so now I'm in the lead then

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.520

the<00:06:06.280> way<00:06:06.370> down<00:06:06.610> the<00:06:06.759> street<00:06:07.120> I<00:06:08.250> found<00:06:09.250> that<00:06:09.430> the

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
the way down the street I found that the

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.939 
the way down the street I found that the
way<00:06:09.879> into<00:06:10.150> this<00:06:10.270> corner<00:06:10.539> works<00:06:10.870> best<00:06:11.169> for<00:06:11.800> me

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:11.949 
way into this corner works best for me

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:14.369 
way into this corner works best for me
is<00:06:11.979> to<00:06:12.219> go<00:06:12.550> flat<00:06:12.879> as<00:06:13.180> long<00:06:13.389> as<00:06:13.569> you<00:06:13.719> can<00:06:14.020> and

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:14.379 
is to go flat as long as you can and

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:17.580 
is to go flat as long as you can and
then<00:06:14.580> just<00:06:15.580> lift<00:06:15.819> at<00:06:16.389> the<00:06:16.539> car<00:06:16.719> coast<00:06:17.020> into<00:06:17.469> it

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
then just lift at the car coast into it

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.670 
then just lift at the car coast into it
and<00:06:17.740> then<00:06:18.580> gently<00:06:19.090> apply<00:06:19.719> the<00:06:19.780> brakes<00:06:20.199> as<00:06:20.560> you

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
and then gently apply the brakes as you

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.409 
and then gently apply the brakes as you
get<00:06:20.830> to<00:06:20.979> this<00:06:21.069> point<00:06:21.310> and<00:06:21.610> then<00:06:21.879> that<00:06:22.030> gets<00:06:22.210> the

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
get to this point and then that gets the

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:23.939 
get to this point and then that gets the
current<00:06:22.780> which<00:06:22.990> you<00:06:23.169> can<00:06:23.349> see<00:06:23.500> there<00:06:23.740> so<00:06:23.889> I

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949 
current which you can see there so I

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.159 
current which you can see there so I
learned<00:06:24.189> from<00:06:24.370> the<00:06:24.490> lap<00:06:24.699> before<00:06:25.050> and<00:06:26.050> again

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
learned from the lap before and again

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.200 
learned from the lap before and again
here<00:06:26.500> this<00:06:26.650> corn<00:06:26.860> has<00:06:26.979> a<00:06:27.009> late<00:06:27.250> apex<00:06:27.610> for<00:06:27.909> me<00:06:28.060> so

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
here this corn has a late apex for me so

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.390 
here this corn has a late apex for me so
I'm<00:06:28.300> waiting<00:06:28.780> then<00:06:29.199> putting<00:06:29.500> the<00:06:29.650> apex<00:06:30.069> then

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
I'm waiting then putting the apex then

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.939 
I'm waiting then putting the apex then
getting<00:06:30.669> opens<00:06:31.569> up<00:06:31.719> much<00:06:31.930> nicer<00:06:32.199> on<00:06:32.409> the<00:06:32.469> exit

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:32.949 
getting opens up much nicer on the exit

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:35.730 
getting opens up much nicer on the exit
so<00:06:33.849> every<00:06:34.240> every<00:06:34.689> lap<00:06:34.870> you<00:06:35.050> do<00:06:35.169> on<00:06:35.319> these<00:06:35.439> games

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
so every every lap you do on these games

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.260 
so every every lap you do on these games
you<00:06:35.889> exploring<00:06:36.580> the<00:06:36.849> circuit<00:06:38.219> exploring<00:06:39.270> how

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
you exploring the circuit exploring how

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:46.910 
you exploring the circuit exploring how
you<00:06:40.330> can<00:06:40.689> go<00:06:40.840> quicker<00:06:43.800> lap<00:06:44.800> time<00:06:45.099> candy

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:46.920 
you can go quicker lap time candy

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.950 
you can go quicker lap time candy
all<00:06:47.520> the<00:06:47.610> times<00:06:47.850> it's<00:06:48.090> good<00:06:48.300> drive<00:06:48.600> on<00:06:48.870> the

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
all the times it's good drive on the

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.290 
all the times it's good drive on the
exit<00:06:49.260> of<00:06:49.320> corners<00:06:49.800> and<00:06:50.580> being<00:06:50.850> in<00:06:51.000> the<00:06:51.090> right

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
exit of corners and being in the right

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.120 
exit of corners and being in the right
gear<00:06:51.570> as<00:06:51.810> obviously<00:06:52.140> is<00:06:52.290> always<00:06:52.620> all

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.130 
gear as obviously is always all

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:59.710 
gear as obviously is always all
important<00:06:56.570> so<00:06:57.570> moving<00:06:58.080> your<00:06:58.320> lap<00:06:58.470> times

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 
important so moving your lap times

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.360 
important so moving your lap times
I'm<00:07:00.230> going<00:07:00.380> to<00:07:00.500> be<00:07:00.620> trying<00:07:00.770> different<00:07:00.980> things

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.370 
I'm going to be trying different things

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.210 
I'm going to be trying different things
on<00:07:01.760> this<00:07:01.850> lap<00:07:02.090> again<00:07:02.360> no<00:07:02.600> doubt<00:07:02.810> we<00:07:03.380> poison

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:04.220 
on this lap again no doubt we poison

when you're playing these racing games
you<00:07:05.750> know<00:07:05.870> you<00:07:05.930> I<00:07:06.440> moved<00:07:06.950> from<00:07:07.040> game<00:07:07.250> to<00:07:07.280> game

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:07.430 
you know you I moved from game to game

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.130 
you know you I moved from game to game
very<00:07:07.850> quickly<00:07:07.940> they'll<00:07:08.570> have<00:07:08.810> a<00:07:08.840> very

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:09.140 
very quickly they'll have a very

very quickly they'll have a very

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.170 
different handling approach so jumping

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.230

and<00:07:36.020> slow<00:07:36.730> breaking

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:39.190 
and slow breaking

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.330 
and slow breaking
try

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:41.340 
try

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.340 
try
it<00:07:42.000> works<00:07:42.210> me<00:07:42.360> that<00:07:42.510> time<00:07:42.780> so<00:07:43.020> the<00:07:43.110> tires

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:43.350 
it works me that time so the tires

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.580 
it works me that time so the tires
didn't<00:07:43.710> hold<00:07:43.860> on<00:07:44.150> it's<00:07:45.150> worth<00:07:45.330> i<00:07:45.510> would<00:07:45.540> like<00:07:45.900> i

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:46.590 
didn't hold on it's worth i would like i

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.969 
didn't hold on it's worth i would like i
know<00:07:47.220> i'm<00:07:47.430> near<00:07:47.639> the<00:07:47.730> end<00:07:47.850> of<00:07:47.940> the<00:07:48.030> race<00:07:48.210> now<00:07:48.540> so

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:48.979 
know i'm near the end of the race now so

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:54.779 
know i'm near the end of the race now so

the<00:07:55.789> last<00:07:55.970> couple<00:07:56.330> of<00:07:56.479> corners<00:07:56.780> and<00:07:57.139> that's

00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:57.289 
the last couple of corners and that's

00:07:57.289 --> 00:07:59.379 
the last couple of corners and that's
been<00:07:57.440> a<00:07:57.470> race<00:07:57.650> quick<00:07:58.190> run<00:07:58.400> on<00:07:58.699> the<00:07:58.819> pool<00:07:59.000> Ricard
