elegance<00:00:24.950> is<00:00:25.310> what<00:00:25.520> I'm<00:00:25.640> trying<00:00:25.790> to<00:00:25.940> trying<00:00:26.360> to

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
elegance is what I'm trying to trying to

elegance is what I'm trying to trying to
get<00:00:28.240> you<00:00:29.240> see<00:00:29.480> a<00:00:29.510> hole<00:00:29.840> that<00:00:30.080> gets<00:00:30.290> wider<00:00:30.590> and

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
get you see a hole that gets wider and

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.589 
get you see a hole that gets wider and
wider<00:00:30.890> and<00:00:31.250> wider<00:00:31.310> until<00:00:31.580> it<00:00:31.910> disappears<00:00:32.480> and

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
wider and wider until it disappears and

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.490 
wider and wider until it disappears and
then<00:00:32.840> it<00:00:32.990> forms<00:00:33.350> that<00:00:34.030> hole<00:00:35.030> again<00:00:35.420> it's<00:00:36.320> not

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
then it forms that hole again it's not

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:50.420 
then it forms that hole again it's not

I'd been in New York for eight years
eight<00:00:52.470> and<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.650> half<00:00:52.800> years<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:54.180> tried<00:00:54.630> to

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
eight and a half years and I tried to

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.320 
eight and a half years and I tried to
make<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.050> as<00:00:55.200> a<00:00:55.290> painter<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.910> didn't

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
make it as a painter and I just didn't

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.920 
make it as a painter and I just didn't
enjoy<00:00:57.630> it

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
enjoy it

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.780 
enjoy it
anymore<00:00:58.170> at<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.650> time<00:00:58.860> I<00:00:58.890> was<00:00:59.280> a

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
anymore at the time I was a

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.910 
anymore at the time I was a
superintendent<00:01:00.480> for<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.380> warehouse<00:01:01.590> in

superintendent for a warehouse in
Manhattan<00:01:03.590> surrounded<00:01:04.590> by<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:04.949> much<00:01:05.100> steel<00:01:05.520> I

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
Manhattan surrounded by so much steel I

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.360 
Manhattan surrounded by so much steel I
thought<00:01:06.720> well<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:06.960> should<00:01:07.110> use<00:01:07.800> this<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.220> make

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
thought well I should use this to make

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.510 
thought well I should use this to make
sculpture<00:01:08.940> I<00:01:09.350> just<00:01:10.350> was<00:01:10.950> bored<00:01:11.280> with

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
sculpture I just was bored with

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.760 
sculpture I just was bored with
everything<00:01:11.670> being<00:01:12.270> static<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.050> my<00:01:13.110> visual

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
everything being static in my visual

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:35.200 
everything being static in my visual
world<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:16.790> wanted<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.850> see<00:01:17.970> stuff<00:01:18.420> move

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.780 

I<00:01:35.240> usually<00:01:35.630> will<00:01:36.500> develop<00:01:37.010> a<00:01:37.130> design<00:01:37.490> on<00:01:37.700> the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
I usually will develop a design on the

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.760 
I usually will develop a design on the
computer<00:01:38.210> because<00:01:38.360> it<00:01:38.660> allows<00:01:38.870> me<00:01:38.900> to<00:01:39.140> animate

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
computer because it allows me to animate

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.110 
computer because it allows me to animate
it<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.120> actually<00:01:41.120> see<00:01:41.390> it<00:01:41.740> moving<00:01:42.740> in<00:01:42.980> a<00:01:43.520> semi

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
it and actually see it moving in a semi

it and actually see it moving in a semi
3d<00:01:44.630> space<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.500> computers<00:01:46.070> are<00:01:46.390> absolutely

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
3d space the computers are absolutely

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.620 
3d space the computers are absolutely
necessary<00:01:48.020> for<00:01:48.290> a<00:01:48.940> lot<00:01:49.940> of<00:01:50.090> my<00:01:50.210> designs

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
necessary for a lot of my designs

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.950 
necessary for a lot of my designs
because<00:01:50.990> there's<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:51.320> many<00:01:51.440> parts<00:01:52.930> when<00:01:53.930> I

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
because there's so many parts when I

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.900 
because there's so many parts when I
started<00:01:54.440> designed<00:01:54.830> I'll<00:01:55.040> start<00:01:55.400> with<00:01:55.640> an

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
started designed I'll start with an

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.360 
started designed I'll start with an
individual<00:01:56.630> element<00:01:57.170> that<00:01:57.680> then<00:01:58.100> gets

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
individual element that then gets

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.060 
individual element that then gets
multiplied<00:01:59.000> many<00:01:59.210> times<00:01:59.360> to<00:02:00.080> build<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.890> whole

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
multiplied many times to build the whole

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.520 
multiplied many times to build the whole
I<00:02:02.740> take<00:02:03.740> this<00:02:03.950> spline<00:02:04.400> now<00:02:05.140> into<00:02:06.140> a<00:02:06.170> different

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
I take this spline now into a different

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.550 
I take this spline now into a different
program<00:02:06.979> called<00:02:07.340> Rhino<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:08.090> I<00:02:08.660> can<00:02:08.990> export

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
program called Rhino and I can export

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.600 
program called Rhino and I can export
this<00:02:10.220> as<00:02:10.550> a<00:02:10.990> DXF<00:02:11.990> file<00:02:12.350> that<00:02:12.980> my<00:02:13.190> cutting

when<00:02:27.110> I'm<00:02:27.260> making<00:02:27.530> things<00:02:27.920> by<00:02:28.220> hand<00:02:28.720> my

when I'm making things by hand my

plays a lot more into the final product

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.020 
plays a lot more into the final product

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
than it does if I'm just designing on

than it does if I'm just designing on

the computer because your body and

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.860 
the computer because your body and
you're<00:02:40.250> working<00:02:40.430> in<00:02:40.700> 3d<00:02:41.060> space<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.599> you<00:02:41.750> get

you're working in 3d space and you get

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.630 
you're working in 3d space and you get
all<00:02:42.170> kinds<00:02:42.200> of<00:02:42.650> things<00:02:42.920> coming<00:02:43.370> into<00:02:43.519> your

all kinds of things coming into your

all kinds of things coming into your
head<00:02:43.819> what<00:02:44.150> looks<00:02:44.360> good<00:02:44.450> what<00:02:44.629> doesn't<00:02:45.230> look

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
head what looks good what doesn't look

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.380 
head what looks good what doesn't look
good<00:02:45.530> where<00:02:46.099> to<00:02:46.220> take<00:02:46.370> it<00:02:46.549> next<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:49.269> used<00:02:50.269> to

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
good where to take it next I used to

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.059 
good where to take it next I used to
make<00:02:50.540> things<00:02:50.780> with<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:50.989> lot<00:02:51.170> of<00:02:51.230> curvature<00:02:51.830> and

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
make things with a lot of curvature and

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.339 
make things with a lot of curvature and
I<00:02:52.400> thought<00:02:52.610> that<00:02:52.910> they<00:02:53.209> needed<00:02:53.569> that<00:02:53.690> shape<00:02:54.049> to

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
I thought that they needed that shape to

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.729 
I thought that they needed that shape to
spend<00:02:54.860> well<00:02:55.129> in<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.489> wind<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.879> turns<00:02:56.120> out<00:02:56.329> that

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
spend well in the wind it turns out that

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.410 
spend well in the wind it turns out that
sometimes<00:02:57.739> just<00:02:57.980> a<00:02:58.400> little<00:02:58.430> bit<00:02:58.879> of<00:02:59.000> curvature

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
sometimes just a little bit of curvature

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.350 
sometimes just a little bit of curvature
is<00:02:59.450> better<00:02:59.840> because<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.410> doesn't<00:03:00.769> spend

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
is better because it doesn't spend

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.729 
is better because it doesn't spend
terribly<00:03:02.360> fast<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:02.900> really<00:03:03.140> strongly
