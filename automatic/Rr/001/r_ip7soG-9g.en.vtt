00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
gonna get good tone at a reasonable

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.200 
gonna get good tone at a reasonable
price<00:00:31.859> that's<00:00:32.250> also<00:00:32.550> another<00:00:32.759> one<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.120> its

tremolo built in and it's two channels
with<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> boost<00:00:38.969> switch<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.660> can<00:00:39.809> get<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> lot

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
with a boost switch you can get a lot

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.970 
with a boost switch you can get a lot
out<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.980> amp<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.460> terms<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:42.059> tone

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
out of this amp in terms of tone

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.069 
out of this amp in terms of tone
anything<00:00:43.980> from<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.550> really<00:00:45.149> nice<00:00:45.329> clean<00:00:45.750> tone

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
anything from a really nice clean tone

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.580 
anything from a really nice clean tone
all<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.100> way<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.399> clean<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.420> edge<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:49.320> an

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
all the way to a clean on the edge to an

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.529 
all the way to a clean on the edge to an
over<00:00:49.860> driven<00:00:50.160> sound<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> moderate<00:00:51.210> gain

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
over driven sound to a moderate gain

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.630 
over driven sound to a moderate gain
setting<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.379> drive<00:00:52.590> channel<00:00:52.949> if<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.340> dime

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
setting on the drive channel if you dime

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.029 
setting on the drive channel if you dime
the<00:00:53.940> clean<00:00:54.180> channel<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.930> sounds<00:00:55.649> pretty<00:00:55.920> cool

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
the clean channel it sounds pretty cool

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.060 
the clean channel it sounds pretty cool
and<00:00:56.629> it's<00:00:57.629> at<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> volume<00:00:58.140> though<00:00:58.440> that's<00:00:58.680> quite

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
and it's at a volume though that's quite

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.069 
and it's at a volume though that's quite
loud<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.730> have<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.480> amp<00:01:00.750> at<00:01:01.020> a

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
loud so you have to have this amp at a

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.200 
loud so you have to have this amp at a
place<00:01:01.469> where<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.430> can<00:01:02.579> get<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.789> most<00:01:02.969> out<00:01:03.149> of

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
place where you can get the most out of

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.750 
place where you can get the most out of
its<00:01:03.420> volume<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.049> think<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.799> cons<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.489> amp

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
its volume I think the cons of this amp

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.740 
its volume I think the cons of this amp
is<00:01:06.200> definitely<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.890> tweed<00:01:08.610> covering<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.600> my

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
is definitely the tweed covering that my

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.250 
is definitely the tweed covering that my
friend<00:01:10.049> Rick<00:01:10.260> loves<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:11.570> it<00:01:12.570> peels<00:01:13.020> off

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
friend Rick loves it's it peels off

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.280 
friend Rick loves it's it peels off
that's<00:01:13.710> one<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> cheapest<00:01:15.210> tweet<00:01:15.840> jobs

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
that's one of the cheapest tweet jobs

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.620 
that's one of the cheapest tweet jobs
you've<00:01:16.979> ever<00:01:17.100> seen<00:01:17.430> it's<00:01:17.610> like<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.119> vinyl

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
you've ever seen it's like just a vinyl

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.840 
you've ever seen it's like just a vinyl
tweet<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.229> pretty<00:01:19.619> bad<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.100> another<00:01:20.549> really

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
tweet it's pretty bad and another really

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.030 
tweet it's pretty bad and another really
bad<00:01:21.060> thing<00:01:21.420> about<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.840> amp<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.560> reverb

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
bad thing about this amp is the reverb

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.850 
bad thing about this amp is the reverb
one-in-three<00:01:23.880> almost<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:25.049> faulty<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:25.710> you

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
one-in-three almost is faulty if you

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.580 
one-in-three almost is faulty if you
turn<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.340> reverb<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.970> past<00:01:27.299> 12<00:01:28.080> o'clock<00:01:28.409> on

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
turn the reverb of past 12 o'clock on

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.340 
turn the reverb of past 12 o'clock on
the<00:01:28.770> modern<00:01:29.159> PB<00:01:29.670> Delta<00:01:29.970> blues<00:01:30.090> amps<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:31.229> can

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
the modern PB Delta blues amps you can

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.499 
the modern PB Delta blues amps you can
get<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:32.009> oscillation<00:01:32.850> hum<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.420> I've

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
get this like oscillation hum and I've

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.690 
get this like oscillation hum and I've
actually<00:01:33.659> got<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> video<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.829> YouTube

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
actually got a video on that on YouTube

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.310 
actually got a video on that on YouTube
as<00:01:35.850> well<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.270> can<00:01:36.420> check<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.689> out<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.049> had

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
as well you can check that out I had

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.190 
as well you can check that out I had
lots<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.890> lots<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.220> problems<00:01:38.640> P<00:01:39.150> via<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.689> guess

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
lots and lots of problems P via I guess

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.530 
lots and lots of problems P via I guess
are<00:01:40.409> aware<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.009> problem<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.880> noise<00:01:42.119> in

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
are aware of this problem the noise in

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.319 
are aware of this problem the noise in
the<00:01:42.630> circuit<00:01:43.079> creates<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.189> hum<00:01:44.430> that's

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
the circuit creates a hum that's

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.929 
the circuit creates a hum that's
magnified<00:01:45.750> by<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.320> volume<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.340> amplifier

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
magnified by the volume of the amplifier

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.630 
magnified by the volume of the amplifier
rattling<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.659> actual<00:01:49.020> reverb<00:01:49.439> tank<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.490> it's

tap<00:02:03.679> the<00:02:03.920> top<00:02:04.159> and<00:02:04.429> see<00:02:04.729> if<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:04.969> makes<00:02:05.149> this

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
tap the top and see if it makes this

it
but<00:02:07.549> I<00:02:07.579> learned<00:02:08.149> my<00:02:08.360> lesson<00:02:08.690> there<00:02:08.869> I<00:02:09.080> did<00:02:09.590> get

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
but I learned my lesson there I did get

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:10.900 
but I learned my lesson there I did get
it<00:02:09.830> fixed<00:02:10.039> in<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.310> end<00:02:10.489> but<00:02:10.670> they<00:02:10.759> actually

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
it fixed in the end but they actually

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.080 
it fixed in the end but they actually
replaced<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.599> whole<00:02:11.750> amplifier<00:02:12.849> so<00:02:13.849> there

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
replaced the whole amplifier so there

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.940 
replaced the whole amplifier so there
you<00:02:14.180> go<00:02:14.360> another<00:02:14.930> thing<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:15.349> don't<00:02:15.470> really<00:02:15.590> like

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
you go another thing I don't really like

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.250 
you go another thing I don't really like
about<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.310> Delta<00:02:16.610> blues<00:02:16.730> is<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.420> tremolo<00:02:17.959> I

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
about the Delta blues is the tremolo I

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.830 
about the Delta blues is the tremolo I
mean<00:02:18.830> it's<00:02:19.069> usable<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.879> you<00:02:19.940> can<00:02:20.090> get<00:02:20.239> a<00:02:20.269> ok

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
mean it's usable and you can get a ok

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.770 
mean it's usable and you can get a ok
sound<00:02:21.200> out<00:02:21.379> of<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.650> but<00:02:22.580> comparing<00:02:23.090> it<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.420> any

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
sound out of it but comparing it to any

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.080 
sound out of it but comparing it to any
other<00:02:23.870> amp<00:02:24.290> it's<00:02:24.590> pretty<00:02:24.920> awful<00:02:25.250> it<00:02:25.610> really<00:02:25.940> is

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
other amp it's pretty awful it really is

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.059 
other amp it's pretty awful it really is
it<00:02:26.390> does<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.410> job<00:02:27.680> but<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.400> sounds<00:02:28.970> very<00:02:29.480> very

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
it does the job but it sounds very very

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.220 
it does the job but it sounds very very
optical<00:02:31.069> so<00:02:31.489> I<00:02:31.790> don't<00:02:32.690> know<00:02:32.780> how<00:02:32.930> else<00:02:33.140> to

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
optical so I don't know how else to

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.080 
optical so I don't know how else to
explain<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.860> it<00:02:34.010> just<00:02:34.220> it<00:02:34.400> sounds<00:02:34.670> digital

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
explain that it just it sounds digital

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.180 
explain that it just it sounds digital
and<00:02:35.269> crap<00:02:35.569> it<00:02:35.840> sounds<00:02:36.170> nothing<00:02:36.470> like<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.799> box

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
and crap it sounds nothing like a box

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.839 
and crap it sounds nothing like a box
trim<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:38.569> box<00:02:39.069> has<00:02:40.069> one<00:02:40.519> of<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.700> best

usability<00:02:48.260> out<00:02:48.590> of<00:02:48.769> it<00:02:48.860> it's<00:02:49.190> pretty<00:02:49.489> bad<00:02:49.670> what

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
usability out of it it's pretty bad what

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.240 
usability out of it it's pretty bad what
actually<00:02:50.329> happens<00:02:50.690> is<00:02:50.900> instead<00:02:51.290> of<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.860> trim

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
actually happens is instead of the trim

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.130 
actually happens is instead of the trim
say<00:02:52.819> your<00:02:53.000> volumes<00:02:53.390> here<00:02:53.629> instead<00:02:53.959> of<00:02:54.049> the

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
say your volumes here instead of the

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.259 
say your volumes here instead of the
trim<00:02:54.410> going<00:02:54.799> above<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.459> volume<00:02:55.819> below<00:02:56.120> the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.780 
volume it's going under back on the back
on<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.230> back<00:03:00.620> so<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:00.920> feels<00:03:01.430> like<00:03:01.519> you're

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
on the back so you feels like you're

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.210 
on the back so you feels like you're
losing<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.299> volume<00:03:02.390> right<00:03:02.840> that's<00:03:03.680> one<00:03:03.950> thing

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
losing the volume right that's one thing

losing the volume right that's one thing
about<00:03:04.250> that<00:03:04.640> tremolo<00:03:05.150> I<00:03:05.420> don't<00:03:05.870> like<00:03:06.140> it<00:03:06.410> but

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799

another friend of mine has it he has the
same<00:03:33.049> problem<00:03:33.260> so<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.130> trick<00:03:34.340> is<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.489> turn<00:03:34.790> the

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
same problem so the trick is to turn the

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.839 
same problem so the trick is to turn the
reverb<00:03:35.269> quite<00:03:35.630> you<00:03:35.810> know<00:03:35.840> quite<00:03:36.109> down<00:03:36.849> that

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
reverb quite you know quite down that

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.909 
reverb quite you know quite down that
said<00:03:38.180> it's<00:03:38.510> definitely<00:03:39.200> not<00:03:39.290> as<00:03:39.440> nice<00:03:39.650> as<00:03:39.680> a

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
said it's definitely not as nice as a

said it's definitely not as nice as a
fender<00:03:40.430> reverb<00:03:40.849> maybe<00:03:41.510> someone<00:03:41.959> could<00:03:42.079> model

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
fender reverb maybe someone could model

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.990 
fender reverb maybe someone could model
out<00:03:42.590> somehow<00:03:43.010> in<00:03:43.250> terms<00:03:43.489> of<00:03:43.669> a<00:03:43.730> blues

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
out somehow in terms of a blues

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.699 
out somehow in terms of a blues
amplifier<00:03:44.599> they're<00:03:44.810> great<00:03:45.019> they<00:03:45.290> sound<00:03:45.530> good

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
amplifier they're great they sound good

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.860

with<00:03:45.859> pedals<00:03:46.190> they<00:03:46.579> record<00:03:46.940> relatively<00:03:47.690> well

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
with pedals they record relatively well

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.770 
with pedals they record relatively well
I<00:03:48.109> think<00:03:48.260> they<00:03:48.500> sound<00:03:48.709> better<00:03:49.209> in<00:03:50.209> a<00:03:50.329> mix<00:03:50.569> than

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
I think they sound better in a mix than

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.050 
I think they sound better in a mix than
on<00:03:50.900> their<00:03:51.049> own<00:03:51.230> if<00:03:51.470> you<00:03:51.950> just<00:03:52.190> a<00:03:52.370> be<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:52.880> with<00:03:53.030> a

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
on their own if you just a be it with a

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.360

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
Fender on its own you'll probably find

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.460 
Fender on its own you'll probably find
the<00:03:55.579> fenders<00:03:56.000> gonna<00:03:56.120> sound<00:03:56.450> nicer<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:57.049> the<00:03:57.139> ear

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470
