00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.500
 today we are going to show you how to make a 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.440
 homemade mask with three ingredients 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.000
 very simple as it would be a little bit of 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.270
 wasilla skim milk or 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.580
 semi-skimmed or skimmed pumpkin 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.539
 this case to work it better and not 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.189
 there is no problem when it comes to 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.499
 mix we've known her for 10 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.869
 minutes with only valuable water you take the 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:28.269
 piece of pumpkin you know it 10 minutes 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.849
 and with that would be more than enough and a 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:33.489
 little bit of normal honey 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.140
 The goal of this mask is to hydrate 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.390
 hydrate deeply so it's 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.300
 perfect both for very very skins 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.609
 dry as if we have exposed a lot 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.379
 in the sun or the cold and we notice that our 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:46.510
 skin is very dry you need an extra 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:50.199
 of hydration, well, first thing 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.929
 we have exclaim the pumpkin and with a 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.370
 fork we are going to crush this 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:56.679
 way we get him to leave 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.239
 making a puree as homogeneous 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:02.530
 possible so that when extending it 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.570
 for the skin to be very simple once 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.150
 we already have it more or less like that 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.120
 You see the texture we are going to add the 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.820
 milk 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.590
 little by little it's worth because what you have 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.090
 have a more or less consistency 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.370
 thick to be able to apply well tell you 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.230
 this mask if you do a lot and not the 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.690
 you can spend the you can save in the 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.920
 refrigerator about 5 or 6 days without anything happening 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.660
 ok I say it because many times it's very 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.550
 difficult to calculate quantities and always 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.470
 we ended up doing a little bit more then 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.470
 let's add a teaspoon of honey 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.780
 to the dough and we will continue stirring 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.450
 all right 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.119
 the goal to remove it as much as possible 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.420
 so that the paste is very homogeneous a 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.530
 Once we have it, as you see it is 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.360
 more or less homogeneous 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.700
 we are going to extend it in the skin what 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.890
 ideal is to do it on the face neck and 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.090
 neckline with a brush but hey I was 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.340
 to show you how the 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.770
 consistency I'm going to do here in a 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.509
 moment with the fork careful we have 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.759
 put the pumpkin to cook that is not 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.400
 very hot before applying it and with 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:17.000
 its circular movements 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.040
 we are extending it as you see it is super 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.620
 simple to do and I guarantee you that it is 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.810
 super moisturizing the ideal is to make it a 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.760
 once a week and leave it about 20 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.200
 minutes on the skin then we remove it 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.940
 with hot water and we have it ready 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.080
 Well, in this simple way and 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.090
 easy since we have not listed our 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.519
 homemade mask for extra skin 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.680
 dry remember that you can see more tricks 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.099
