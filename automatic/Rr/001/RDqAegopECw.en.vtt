right off to get to the water pump and

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.580 
right off to get to the water pump and
the<00:01:19.930> thermostat<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:21.250> get<00:01:21.430> to<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:22.330> bolt<00:01:23.290> on<00:01:23.470> the

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
bottom on the other side of that I had

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.080 
bottom on the other side of that I had
to<00:01:25.540> take<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:25.810> air<00:01:25.960> cleaner<00:01:26.409> off<00:01:26.710> just<00:01:27.610> take

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
to take the air cleaner off just take

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.819 
to take the air cleaner off just take
this<00:01:28.860> hose<00:01:29.860> clamp<00:01:30.220> off<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:31.409> just<00:01:32.409> wiggle<00:01:32.619> it

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
this hose clamp off and just wiggle it

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.520 
this hose clamp off and just wiggle it
it<00:01:33.009> pops<00:01:33.250> off<00:01:33.520> there's<00:01:33.820> a<00:01:33.880> little<00:01:34.530> rubber

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
it pops off there's a little rubber

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.030 
it pops off there's a little rubber
grommet<00:01:36.159> down<00:01:36.340> at<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.610> bottom<00:01:36.790> of<00:01:37.060> it<00:01:38.040> right

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
grommet down at the bottom of it right

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.940 
grommet down at the bottom of it right
here<00:01:39.280> it<00:01:39.579> sets<00:01:39.909> it<00:01:40.060> in<00:01:40.119> the<00:01:40.210> bottom<00:01:42.329> right<00:01:43.329> here

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
here it sets it in the bottom right here

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.580 
here it sets it in the bottom right here
so<00:01:44.950> it's<00:01:45.250> not<00:01:45.430> a<00:01:45.990> really<00:01:46.990> big<00:01:47.079> thing<00:01:47.350> just<00:01:47.380> kind

so it's not a really big thing just kind

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.399 
so it's not a really big thing just kind
of<00:01:47.710> wiggle<00:01:48.040> it<00:01:48.100> it<00:01:48.430> pops<00:01:48.759> right<00:01:49.000> off<00:01:49.380> set<00:01:50.380> that

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
of wiggle it it pops right off set that

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.219 
of wiggle it it pops right off set that
out<00:01:50.740> of<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:50.950> way

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
out of the way

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.899 
out of the way
the<00:01:53.229> thermostat<00:01:53.680> is<00:01:54.070> a<00:01:54.100> big<00:01:54.340> question<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.759> lot

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
the thermostat is a big question a lot

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.149 
the thermostat is a big question a lot
of<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:55.119> I<00:01:55.180> couldn't<00:01:55.509> find<00:01:55.630> anything<00:01:56.140> but<00:01:56.860> after

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
of it I couldn't find anything but after

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.520 
of it I couldn't find anything but after
replacing<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.700> water<00:01:58.030> pump<00:01:58.450> which<00:01:59.259> isn't

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
replacing the water pump which isn't

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.760 
replacing the water pump which isn't
really<00:01:59.740> a<00:01:59.979> big<00:02:00.219> deal<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:02.320> was<00:02:02.380> a<00:02:02.469> little<00:02:02.619> bit

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
really a big deal it was a little bit

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.850 
really a big deal it was a little bit
less<00:02:03.009> than<00:02:03.159> I<00:02:03.280> thought<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:05.049> water<00:02:05.259> pump<00:02:05.619> right

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
less than I thought the water pump right

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.320 
less than I thought the water pump right
here

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.500 

Lysa<00:02:09.290> cooperating<00:02:10.190> water<00:02:10.790> pump<00:02:11.030> right<00:02:11.210> here

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
Lysa cooperating water pump right here

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.690 
Lysa cooperating water pump right here
just<00:02:11.780> remove<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.260> bolts<00:02:12.590> around<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.980> outside

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.880 

they<00:02:16.700> got<00:02:16.940> there's<00:02:17.510> several<00:02:18.050> several<00:02:18.530> bolts

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
they got there's several several bolts

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.740

write down here at the bottom of the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.270 
write down here at the bottom of the
motor<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:05.020> thermostat<00:03:06.020> like<00:03:06.770> two<00:03:07.010> 10

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
motor the thermostat like two 10

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.580 
motor the thermostat like two 10
millimeter<00:03:07.310> bolts<00:03:08.210> I<00:03:08.390> think<00:03:09.080> they're<00:03:09.200> ten

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
millimeter bolts I think they're ten

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.740 
millimeter bolts I think they're ten
millimeter<00:03:09.980> maybe<00:03:10.790> eight<00:03:11.090> millimeter<00:03:13.750> eight

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
millimeter maybe eight millimeter eight

millimeter maybe eight millimeter eight
millimeter<00:03:15.260> bolts<00:03:15.650> two<00:03:15.739> 8<00:03:15.890> millimeter<00:03:16.250> bolts

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
millimeter bolts two 8 millimeter bolts

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.490 
millimeter bolts two 8 millimeter bolts
and<00:03:16.700> pop<00:03:16.850> that<00:03:17.090> off<00:03:17.270> for<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.020> thermostat

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
and pop that off for the thermostat

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.890 
and pop that off for the thermostat
since<00:03:18.770> it's<00:03:18.860> on<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:18.980> bottom<00:03:19.340> hose<00:03:19.850> that<00:03:20.690> goes

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
since it's on the bottom hose that goes

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.580 
since it's on the bottom hose that goes
into<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.410> motor<00:03:22.900> like<00:03:23.900> I<00:03:23.930> say<00:03:24.110> you<00:03:24.170> can<00:03:24.290> see<00:03:24.500> it

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
into the motor like I say you can see it

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.860 
into the motor like I say you can see it
right<00:03:24.680> here<00:03:25.270> sticking<00:03:26.270> out<00:03:26.480> of<00:03:26.570> that<00:03:26.600> hose

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
right here sticking out of that hose

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.920 
right here sticking out of that hose
then<00:03:27.410> you<00:03:27.560> just<00:03:27.830> pop<00:03:27.980> that<00:03:28.250> out<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:29.630> put<00:03:29.810> the

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
then you just pop that out and put the

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.670 
then you just pop that out and put the
new<00:03:29.959> one<00:03:30.230> in<00:03:31.510> so<00:03:32.510> that's<00:03:33.020> where<00:03:33.230> you<00:03:33.290> find<00:03:33.530> that

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
new one in so that's where you find that

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.040 
new one in so that's where you find that
out<00:03:33.890> I<00:03:33.920> couldn't<00:03:34.340> find<00:03:34.520> it<00:03:34.700> anywhere<00:03:35.060> but<00:03:35.330> you

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
out I couldn't find it anywhere but you

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.570 
out I couldn't find it anywhere but you
have<00:03:36.170> to<00:03:36.260> take<00:03:36.410> this<00:03:36.530> other<00:03:36.709> stuff<00:03:37.040> off<00:03:37.250> it's

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
have to take this other stuff off it's

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.160 
have to take this other stuff off it's
easier<00:03:37.820> to<00:03:37.910> get<00:03:38.030> take<00:03:38.239> that<00:03:38.420> off<00:03:38.630> and<00:03:38.660> get<00:03:39.050> to

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
easier to get take that off and get to

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.540 
easier to get take that off and get to
it<00:03:39.260> from<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:39.470> top<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:39.920> get<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.220> bottom

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
it from the top and get to the bottom

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:41.590 
it from the top and get to the bottom
because<00:03:40.640> there's<00:03:40.850> a<00:03:40.910> lot<00:03:41.000> of<00:03:41.120> stuffing<00:03:41.390> away

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
because there's a lot of stuffing away

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.580 
because there's a lot of stuffing away
down<00:03:41.780> there<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.080> can't<00:03:42.290> get<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:42.709> so<00:03:44.590> that's

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
down there you can't get to it so that's

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.080 
down there you can't get to it so that's
it<00:03:45.770> and<00:03:45.980> just<00:03:46.190> replace<00:03:46.459> everything<00:03:46.880> back<00:03:47.060> on

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
it and just replace everything back on

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.600 
it and just replace everything back on
push<00:03:47.690> that<00:03:47.840> back<00:03:48.050> in<00:03:48.320> and<00:03:48.650> put<00:03:49.340> your<00:03:49.459> cover

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
push that back in and put your cover

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.210 
push that back in and put your cover
back<00:03:49.820> on<00:03:50.090> and<00:03:50.650> fill<00:03:51.650> with<00:03:51.770> antifreeze<00:03:52.040> and

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
back on and fill with antifreeze and

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.640 
back on and fill with antifreeze and
you're<00:03:52.489> done
