00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.229 
complaints about her going to be in the
movie<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:32.070> think<00:03:32.190> it's<00:03:32.280> very<00:03:32.340> interesting<00:03:33.090> how

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
movie I think it's very interesting how

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.940 
movie I think it's very interesting how
she<00:03:33.330> says<00:03:33.600> aligned<00:03:33.900> Legolas<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.680> trailer

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
she says aligned Legolas and the trailer

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.180 
she says aligned Legolas and the trailer
of<00:03:35.570> um<00:03:36.570> when<00:03:36.900> he<00:03:36.930> says<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:37.440> is<00:03:37.590> not<00:03:37.620> our<00:03:37.770> fight

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
of um when he says this is not our fight

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.699 
of um when he says this is not our fight
she<00:03:38.370> goes<00:03:38.550> this<00:03:38.730> is<00:03:38.790> our<00:03:39.120> fight<00:03:39.420> so<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:40.140> think

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
she goes this is our fight so I think

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.530 
she goes this is our fight so I think
this<00:03:41.070> should<00:03:41.250> be<00:03:41.370> very<00:03:41.400> interesting<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:42.330> see

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
this should be very interesting to see

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.840 
this should be very interesting to see
kind<00:03:42.810> of<00:03:42.959> how<00:03:43.019> that<00:03:43.320> dynamic<00:03:43.560> works<00:03:44.190> I've

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
kind of how that dynamic works I've

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.270 
kind of how that dynamic works I've
heard<00:03:45.209> rumors<00:03:45.780> surrounding<00:03:46.380> her<00:03:46.830> character

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
heard rumors surrounding her character

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.830 
heard rumors surrounding her character
and<00:03:47.310> what<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.850> developments<00:03:48.480> going<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.720> be

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
and what the developments going to be

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.720 
and what the developments going to be
which<00:03:49.320> I<00:03:49.500> think<00:03:49.830> will<00:03:49.950> be<00:03:50.100> interesting<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.610> see

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
which I think will be interesting to see

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.970 
which I think will be interesting to see
play<00:03:51.150> out<00:03:51.180> on<00:03:51.540> screen<00:03:51.930> because<00:03:52.230> when<00:03:52.709> you<00:03:52.800> hear

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980

what's false there's not much there's

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.850 
what's false there's not much there's
not<00:03:57.540> too<00:03:57.750> much<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:58.019> can<00:03:58.170> say<00:03:58.200> about<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.590> trailer

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
hobbit movie because i think they play

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.090 
hobbit movie because i think they play
they<00:04:19.979> casted<00:04:20.580> actors<00:04:21.150> who<00:04:21.780> are<00:04:22.289> great<00:04:22.800> for<00:04:23.010> the

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
they casted actors who are great for the

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.500 
they casted actors who are great for the
characters<00:04:23.520> like<00:04:23.760> my<00:04:23.910> friend<00:04:24.180> had<00:04:24.360> some

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
characters like my friend had some

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.830 
characters like my friend had some
problem

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
problem

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.900 
problem
with<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.190> casting<00:04:26.190> because<00:04:26.400> she<00:04:26.520> was<00:04:26.639> a<00:04:26.669> huge

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
with the casting because she was a huge

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.850 
with the casting because she was a huge
fan<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.300> book<00:04:27.480> and<00:04:27.720> she<00:04:27.840> expected<00:04:28.350> Thorin

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
fan of the book and she expected Thorin

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.640 
fan of the book and she expected Thorin
to<00:04:29.070> look<00:04:29.250> older<00:04:29.820> she<00:04:30.120> said<00:04:30.360> but<00:04:30.960> I<00:04:31.230> think<00:04:31.530> they

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
to look older she said but I think they

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.290 
to look older she said but I think they
did<00:04:32.070> casting<00:04:32.550> pretty<00:04:32.760> well<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:33.060> she<00:04:33.180> was

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
did casting pretty well and she was

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.820 
did casting pretty well and she was
happy<00:04:33.570> with<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.840> outcome<00:04:33.990> so<00:04:34.500> it's<00:04:34.650> one<00:04:34.740> of

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
happy with the outcome so it's one of

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.600 
happy with the outcome so it's one of
those<00:04:34.889> things<00:04:34.979> where<00:04:36.860> it<00:04:37.860> is<00:04:38.100> going<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.430> change

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
those things where it is going to change

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.640 
those things where it is going to change
from<00:04:38.850> the<00:04:38.940> book<00:04:39.150> so<00:04:39.419> if<00:04:39.600> you're<00:04:39.750> very<00:04:39.960> fond<00:04:40.470> of

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
from the book so if you're very fond of

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.930 
from the book so if you're very fond of
the<00:04:40.800> book<00:04:41.010> I<00:04:41.190> don't<00:04:41.430> know<00:04:41.550> if<00:04:41.669> that<00:04:41.820> will

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
the book I don't know if that will

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.120 
the book I don't know if that will
bother<00:04:42.180> you<00:04:42.479> I'm<00:04:42.840> very<00:04:43.260> fond<00:04:43.560> of<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.770> book<00:04:43.949> but

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
bother you I'm very fond of the book but

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.159 
bother you I'm very fond of the book but
it<00:04:44.250> doesn't<00:04:44.580> bother<00:04:44.729> me<00:04:44.970> because<00:04:45.330> it<00:04:45.840> ha<00:04:45.990> I

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
it doesn't bother me because it ha I

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.870 
it doesn't bother me because it ha I
knew<00:04:46.770> it<00:04:46.860> was<00:04:46.979> going<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.190> change<00:04:47.430> a<00:04:47.580> little<00:04:47.699> bit

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
knew it was going to change a little bit

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.560 
knew it was going to change a little bit
so<00:04:49.250> I'm<00:04:50.250> excited<00:04:50.610> to<00:04:50.850> see<00:04:50.880> what<00:04:51.090> direction<00:04:51.240> it

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
so I'm excited to see what direction it

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.270 
so I'm excited to see what direction it
goes<00:04:51.690> in<00:04:51.930> it<00:04:52.110> makes<00:04:52.260> it<00:04:52.410> more<00:04:52.620> unpredictable

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
goes in it makes it more unpredictable

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.790 
goes in it makes it more unpredictable
so<00:04:54.240> I<00:04:54.510> kind<00:04:54.780> of<00:04:54.900> know<00:04:55.139> what<00:04:55.410> I<00:04:55.440> think<00:04:55.710> the

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
so I kind of know what I think the

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.590 
so I kind of know what I think the
overall<00:04:56.160> outcome<00:04:56.430> will<00:04:57.030> be<00:04:57.060> in<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.389> third

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
overall outcome will be in the third

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.180 
overall outcome will be in the third
film<00:04:57.810> but<00:04:58.139> I<00:04:58.169> don't<00:04:58.680> know<00:04:58.860> what's<00:04:59.010> going<00:04:59.130> to

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
film but I don't know what's going to

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.860 
film but I don't know what's going to
happen<00:04:59.520> with<00:04:59.639> the<00:04:59.820> orc<00:05:00.090> thing<00:05:00.419> or<00:05:00.660> other

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
happen with the orc thing or other

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.170 
happen with the orc thing or other
things<00:05:01.229> so<00:05:01.770> I'm<00:05:01.979> excited<00:05:02.370> to<00:05:02.639> see<00:05:02.669> that<00:05:02.970> I

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
things so I'm excited to see that I
