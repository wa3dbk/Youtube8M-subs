00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.799
 had a great surprise that was 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.659
 totally ineffective and will surprise 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.979
 to the Peruvian market that have presented 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.570
 ideas and it's the truth that we're very 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.460
 happy because finally broke the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.960
 mystery of what he showed working 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.460
 more than a year and a half ago that is the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.050
 launch of the abode of Inca Kola 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.119

 in queue a drink is now chicha 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.170
 lodging that sticks more than a chicha 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.030
 abode made by Inca kola not with a 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.799
 touch of gas with a taste a smell 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.899
 really a refreshing super super 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.700

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.289
 with this release is to energize the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.970

 this and these meals that I really do not know 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.509
 the but not so happy not the truth that 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.429

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.800
 news around communication 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.720
 but this first stage is 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.850
 basically focuses on knowledge and 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.200
 tests 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.270
 is a brand that is closely linked to the 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.709
 Peruvian creativity currently what is

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.030

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.560
 want to create another link what 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.420
 we want is to strengthen the relationship that already 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.520

 dogs one more flavor option there was no 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.180
 I wish I'm safe because 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.950
 We have done many tests with 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.690
 consumers to be able to test the the 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.400
 formula the label the communication 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.840
 including we are one that has founded by 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.850
 the studies tell us that what 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.380
 expectations have as a brand with this 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.980
 launch and in general for what 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.660
 remains of the year 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.980
 look what's left the year the truth that 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.840
 it's a year it's been a pretty year 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.060
 complicated for mass consumption in 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.530
 general for all categories and this 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.420
 product what it does basically is 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.519
 give us this final point that we were missing 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.319
 we do not have a volume expectation 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.480
 It's pretty pretty optimistic 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.250
 we know that they have been going through them 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.230
 orders coming in provinces that are 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.580
 comes great we hope that with this 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.560
 the Inca brand kola keep marking 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.670
 trend that are made of the brand more 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.530

 really amazing and we are even 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:22.790

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.079
 which is for 2021 because those of 21 is 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.090

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.799

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.159

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.599
 to get it out of the Peruvian market 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:41.510
 yes the truth is that this is a project 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.310
 for 18 months that involved a lot of 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.799
 people from marketing to the 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.659
 Product development agencies 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.879
 our bottler our partner the 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:52.849
 English and the truth was the idea of ​​bringing 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:54.709
 an innovation for Inca kola do the 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.079
 family that ends up growing a little bit 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.840
 and launch the first new taste of enka 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:03.680
 koala in its 80 years of life and there it is 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.019
 the Inca kola Inca kola abode is a 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.090
 Peruvian icon that understands all 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.549
 Peruvian flavors and all the food 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.409
 Peruvian equal to chicha no chicha goes 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.510
 very good with meals and it's a flavor 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.970
 very Peruvian this I know why not put them together 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.669
 and only in queue could with his creativity 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.739
 think of making a fizzy taste 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.960
 chicha not with much more gas with more 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.330
 much more refreshing bubbles is a 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.699
 very beloved brand I think the brand was 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.100
 one of the most loved brands of Peru and 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.660
 just the Peruvians and those consumed 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.550
 they are always asking us for new things 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.530
 is a brand that has already innovated with that 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.020
 partner with d'onofrio to make an ice cream 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.030
 and it does not go much in communication in networks 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.979
 social we have a million three hundred 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.139
 thousand fans on facebook is a brand that 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.150
 is always looking to renew itself and that's 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.949
 also the idea of bringing a new flavor 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.900
 for in cocoa we are going to 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.639
 distribute a million sample so that 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.650
 people can taste it purple 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.449
 then we are really going to have a plan 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.160
 this is the end of the year 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.720
 perfect strong to lisandro and for 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.340

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.500
