and then I tug it and it kind of gives
it<00:03:28.250> some<00:03:29.090> volume<00:03:35.200> so<00:03:36.200> it<00:03:36.350> looks<00:03:36.590> like<00:03:36.740> a<00:03:37.040> little

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
it some volume so it looks like a little

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.070 
it some volume so it looks like a little
bit<00:03:37.400> different<00:03:37.790> than<00:03:37.910> a<00:03:37.940> typical<00:03:38.030> twist<00:03:38.780> and

and pin it in place now that I have this
kind<00:03:45.470> of<00:03:45.680> volume<00:03:46.310> eyes<00:03:46.760> I'm<00:03:47.360> going<00:03:47.720> to<00:03:47.810> go

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
kind of volume eyes I'm going to go

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.230 
kind of volume eyes I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:48.020> and<00:03:48.230> wrap<00:03:49.190> it<00:03:49.340> around<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.580> back<00:03:49.760> and
