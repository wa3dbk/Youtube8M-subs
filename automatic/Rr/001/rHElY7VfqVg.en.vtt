specific video order to talk about these
quick-release<00:00:38.309> systems<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.210> which<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.260> find<00:00:40.559> a

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
quick-release systems so which I find a

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.770 
quick-release systems so which I find a
very<00:00:40.950> very<00:00:41.340> useful<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.000> if<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.270> don't<00:00:42.600> know

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
very very useful and if you don't know

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.709 
very very useful and if you don't know
about<00:00:42.930> them<00:00:43.260> then<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.829> might<00:00:44.040> be<00:00:44.219> wondering

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
about them then you might be wondering

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.690 
about them then you might be wondering
what<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.930> earth<00:00:46.110> these<00:00:47.100> two<00:00:47.370> little

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
what on earth these two little

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.119 
what on earth these two little
contraptions<00:00:48.360> are<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.020> that's<00:00:49.829> what<00:00:50.010> they

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
contraptions are so that's what they

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.670 
contraptions are so that's what they
look<00:00:50.309> like<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.910> do<00:00:51.059> get<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.960> think<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.559> do

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
look like and you do get I think you do

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.200 
look like and you do get I think you do
get<00:00:52.860> two<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.579> each<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:54.059> each<00:00:54.420> airbrush<00:00:55.050> so

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
get two of each for each airbrush so

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.549 
get two of each for each airbrush so
yeah<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.539> add<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.719> explain<00:00:57.989> these<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.289> little

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
yeah for add to explain these a little

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.860 
yeah for add to explain these a little
bit<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.670> know<00:00:59.789> make<00:01:00.059> sure<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.420> using

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
bit and you know make sure you using

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.700 
bit and you know make sure you using
them<00:01:01.020> if<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.829> them<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:03.500> there'd<00:01:04.500> be<00:01:04.680> a

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
them if you have them so there'd be a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.960 
them if you have them so there'd be a
second<00:01:05.010> once<00:01:05.159> again<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.700> right<00:01:05.850> way

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
second once again this is the right way

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.990 
second once again this is the right way
around<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.780> basically<00:01:07.170> these<00:01:08.070> are<00:01:08.520> very<00:01:08.760> very

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
around so basically these are very very

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.060 
around so basically these are very very
simple<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.780> I'm<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.200> turn<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> airbrush<00:01:10.920> out

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
simple so I'm just turn the airbrush out

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.090 
simple so I'm just turn the airbrush out
and<00:01:11.430> show<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.450> what<00:01:12.689> they<00:01:12.810> are<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.170> basically

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
and show you what they are so basically

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.359 
and show you what they are so basically
when<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.580> first<00:01:14.909> get<00:01:15.290> one<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.439> these<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.950> you

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
when you first get one of these and you

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.700 
when you first get one of these and you
get<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.610> hose<00:01:17.820> which<00:01:18.540> looks<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.140> so

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
get the hose which looks like this so

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.770 
get the hose which looks like this so
just<00:01:19.920> ignore<00:01:20.400> all<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:20.909> actually<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.570> for

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
just ignore all this actually it's for

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.499 
just ignore all this actually it's for
now<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:23.159> get<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.460> hose<00:01:23.700> which<00:01:24.060> ends<00:01:24.330> like

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
now but you get the hose which ends like

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.660 
now but you get the hose which ends like
that<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.530> screw<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.280> into

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
that and you can just screw this into

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.850 
that and you can just screw this into
the<00:01:26.759> hose<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.330> that's<00:01:28.229> what<00:01:28.530> you'd<00:01:28.710> have

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
the hose and that's what you'd have

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.530 
the hose and that's what you'd have
basically<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.759> know<00:01:29.880> that's<00:01:30.090> that's<00:01:30.299> how

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
basically you know that's that's how

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.270 
basically you know that's that's how
you'd<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:30.960> using<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.380> airbrush<00:01:31.530> right<00:01:32.009> there

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
you'd be using the airbrush right there

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.030 
you'd be using the airbrush right there
so<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.759> know<00:01:32.850> that's<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:34.049> simplest<00:01:34.680> form

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
so you know that's the simplest form

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.940 
so you know that's the simplest form
that<00:01:35.250> you're<00:01:35.369> going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.579> get<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.890> what<00:01:37.890> a

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
that you're going to get it so what a

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.859 
that you're going to get it so what a
quick-release<00:01:38.250> system<00:01:38.729> does<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.689> just

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
quick-release system does is it just

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.950 
quick-release system does is it just
makes<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.350> easier<00:01:40.920> for<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.490> take<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.720> on

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
makes it easier for you to take that on

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.260 
makes it easier for you to take that on
and<00:01:43.110> off<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.590> what<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.100> do<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.970> got<00:01:45.090> two

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
and off so what we do is you got two

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.590 
and off so what we do is you got two
different<00:01:45.450> kinds<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:46.320> one<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.979> not<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
different kinds this one is not the the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.240 
different kinds this one is not the the
right<00:01:48.750> kind<00:01:48.990> for<00:01:49.200> my<00:01:49.320> setup<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:49.979> won't<00:01:50.130> be

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
right kind for my setup so I won't be

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.389 
right kind for my setup so I won't be
using<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.960> screw<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.290> one<00:01:52.470> up<00:01:52.530> and

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
using that so you screw this one up and

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.090 
using that so you screw this one up and
basically<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.720> idea<00:01:54.750> then<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.920> you

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
basically the idea then is that you

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.830 
basically the idea then is that you
always<00:01:56.549> leave<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.390> don't<00:01:57.540> actually

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
always leave this on you don't actually

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.530 
always leave this on you don't actually
need<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.229> unscrew<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:59.040> ever<00:01:59.369> really<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.240> and

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
need to unscrew this ever really so and

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.359 
need to unscrew this ever really so and
then<00:02:01.170> when<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.409> want<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.770> use<00:02:01.950> your<00:02:02.100> airbrush

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
then when you want to use your airbrush

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.620 
then when you want to use your airbrush
then<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.930> have<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.759> corresponding<00:02:05.759> piece<00:02:06.240> and

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
then you have a corresponding piece and

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.900 
then you have a corresponding piece and
you<00:02:06.840> actually<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.710> don't<00:02:08.160> think<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.459> get<00:02:08.640> this

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
you actually I don't think you get this

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.309 
you actually I don't think you get this
part<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
part in the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.360 
part in the
in<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.400> airbrush<00:02:12.150> package<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:13.069> do<00:02:14.069> need<00:02:14.220> to

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
in the airbrush package so do need to

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.430 
in the airbrush package so do need to
just<00:02:14.849> don't<00:02:15.150> go<00:02:15.540> back<00:02:15.780> on<00:02:15.810> myself<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.349> little

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
just don't go back on myself a little

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.320 
just don't go back on myself a little
bit<00:02:16.590> then<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:16.830> get<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.129> part<00:02:17.400> B<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.879> don't

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
bit then you get this part B I don't

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.420 
bit then you get this part B I don't
think<00:02:18.599> you<00:02:18.720> get<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:18.989> part<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.950> don't<00:02:20.340> know

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
think you get this part so I don't know

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.160 
think you get this part so I don't know
you<00:02:20.580> may<00:02:20.730> be<00:02:20.790> different<00:02:21.209> but<00:02:21.239> anyway<00:02:21.900> once<00:02:22.110> you

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
you may be different but anyway once you

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.130 
you may be different but anyway once you
do<00:02:22.440> then<00:02:22.970> from<00:02:23.970> now<00:02:24.120> on<00:02:24.269> from<00:02:24.569> here<00:02:24.810> on<00:02:24.989> in

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
do then from now on from here on in

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.170 
do then from now on from here on in
instead<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.769> actually<00:02:26.159> having<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.519> screw<00:02:26.940> into

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
instead of actually having to screw into

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.210 
instead of actually having to screw into
the<00:02:27.480> hose<00:02:27.660> every<00:02:28.260> single<00:02:28.590> time<00:02:28.769> you<00:02:28.920> want<00:02:29.040> to

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
the hose every single time you want to

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.220 
the hose every single time you want to
you<00:02:29.459> know<00:02:29.580> take<00:02:29.879> off<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.360> airbrush<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:31.049> and

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
you know take off this airbrush on and

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.250 
you know take off this airbrush on and
off<00:02:31.319> then<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.220> just<00:02:32.430> clean<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:34.140> know

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
off then you just clean and you know

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.710 
off then you just clean and you know
that's<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.769> really<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.819> then<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.299> take<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.510> out

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
that's it really and then to take it out

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.229 
that's it really and then to take it out
and<00:02:36.989> you<00:02:37.200> just<00:02:37.230> hold<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.739> sleeve<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:39.030> you

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
and you just hold this sleeve and you

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.800 
and you just hold this sleeve and you
just<00:02:39.450> release<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.780> like<00:02:40.079> that<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:41.099> that<00:02:41.940> kind

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
just release it like that so that kind

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.130 
just release it like that so that kind
of<00:02:42.840> shows<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.410> know<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.459> know<00:02:45.140> the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
of shows you know the the you know the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.140 
of shows you know the the you know the
simplicity<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.190> really<00:02:47.400> it's<00:02:47.670> really<00:02:47.970> easy

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
simplicity of it really it's really easy

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.300 
simplicity of it really it's really easy
and<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.989> can<00:02:49.140> do<00:02:49.319> on<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.590> fly<00:02:49.799> you<00:02:50.010> can<00:02:50.190> do

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
and you can do on the fly you can do

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.670 
and you can do on the fly you can do
with<00:02:50.430> one<00:02:50.609> hand<00:02:50.640> basically<00:02:51.329> as<00:02:51.599> well<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.079> it's

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
with one hand basically as well so it's

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.830 
with one hand basically as well so it's
really<00:02:52.799> useful<00:02:53.099> to<00:02:53.310> have<00:02:53.459> so<00:02:53.849> you<00:02:54.660> might<00:02:54.810> be

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
really useful to have so you might be

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.020 
really useful to have so you might be
thinking<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.349> yourself<00:02:55.410> then<00:02:55.980> well<00:02:56.489> I<00:02:56.730> don't

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
thinking to yourself then well I don't

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.920 
thinking to yourself then well I don't
have<00:02:57.390> lots<00:02:58.049> and<00:02:58.230> lots<00:02:58.319> of<00:02:58.560> air<00:02:58.709> brushes<00:02:59.099> and

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
have lots and lots of air brushes and

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.309 
have lots and lots of air brushes and
why<00:03:00.930> would<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.290> want<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.680> system<00:03:02.069> like<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:02.549> well

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
why would I want a system like this well

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.500 
why would I want a system like this well
the<00:03:04.319> thing<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.530> if<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.640> did<00:03:06.030> decide<00:03:06.269> to

the thing is if you did decide to

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.119 
the thing is if you did decide to
upgrade<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:07.019> mean<00:03:07.260> you're<00:03:07.410> gonna<00:03:07.500> start<00:03:07.859> with

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.199 
two anyway um you know with the Stars
forever<00:03:10.170> set<00:03:10.709> if<00:03:10.890> you<00:03:11.160> are<00:03:11.190> if<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:11.790> follow<00:03:12.030> my

advice but if you did decide to upgrade

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.430 
advice but if you did decide to upgrade
then<00:03:14.519> these<00:03:15.150> things<00:03:15.389> are<00:03:15.630> really<00:03:15.810> cheap<00:03:16.139> so

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
then these things are really cheap so

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.259 
then these things are really cheap so
and<00:03:16.859> you<00:03:17.040> normally<00:03:17.160> get<00:03:17.519> one<00:03:17.730> with<00:03:17.910> everyday

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
and you normally get one with everyday

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.720 
and you normally get one with everyday
brushing<00:03:18.900> yet<00:03:19.049> so<00:03:19.319> basically<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.370> can<00:03:20.549> leave

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
brushing yet so basically you can leave

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.569 
brushing yet so basically you can leave
them<00:03:20.910> on<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.660> then<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.709> can<00:03:22.950> switch<00:03:23.220> air

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
them on and then you can switch air

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.400 
them on and then you can switch air
brushes<00:03:23.970> out<00:03:24.900> very<00:03:25.889> very<00:03:26.010> quickly<00:03:26.519> so<00:03:27.079> I<00:03:28.079> have

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
brushes out very very quickly so I have

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.379 
brushes out very very quickly so I have
them<00:03:28.560> would<00:03:28.680> all<00:03:28.769> avoid<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.519> you<00:03:30.030> know<00:03:30.150> it's

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
them would all avoid and you know it's

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.240 
them would all avoid and you know it's
just<00:03:30.510> pretty<00:03:31.500> simple<00:03:31.919> really

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
just pretty simple really

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.960 
just pretty simple really
and<00:03:33.440> what's<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.590> benefits<00:03:35.069> then<00:03:35.310> basically

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
and what's the benefits then basically

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.800 
and what's the benefits then basically
so<00:03:36.530> one<00:03:37.530> is<00:03:37.819> basically<00:03:38.819> if<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.239> have<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.510> lot<00:03:39.780> of

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
so one is basically if you have a lot of

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.069 
so one is basically if you have a lot of
our<00:03:40.049> brushes<00:03:40.290> or<00:03:40.859> if<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:41.549> have<00:03:41.750> one<00:03:42.750> or<00:03:42.900> more

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
primer in one and then have you read the

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.039 
primer in one and then have you read the
color<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:54.389> other<00:03:54.419> you<00:03:54.660> know<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:54.900> all

that<00:03:55.200> kind<00:03:55.470> of<00:03:55.530> stuff<00:03:55.769> it<00:03:55.950> just<00:03:55.980> makes<00:03:56.400> it<00:03:56.549> a

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
that kind of stuff it just makes it a

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.159 
that kind of stuff it just makes it a
bit<00:03:56.700> easier<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.419> it<00:03:57.510> just<00:03:57.750> makes<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.139> process

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
bit easier and it just makes the process

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:03.159 
bit easier and it just makes the process
a<00:03:58.620> little<00:03:58.829> bit<00:03:59.269> less<00:04:00.269> arduous<00:04:00.599> basically<00:04:01.530> but

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
a little bit less arduous basically but

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:05.990 
a little bit less arduous basically but
what<00:04:04.169> if<00:04:04.319> you<00:04:04.470> only<00:04:04.650> have<00:04:04.980> water<00:04:05.280> airbrush

and<00:04:10.859> Mike<00:04:11.639> Wesch<00:04:12.090> my<00:04:12.720> answer<00:04:13.049> to<00:04:13.199> that<00:04:13.319> would

and Mike Wesch my answer to that would

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.870 
and Mike Wesch my answer to that would
be<00:04:13.560> yes<00:04:13.949> because<00:04:15.349> basically<00:04:16.549> you<00:04:17.549> may<00:04:17.699> not

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880
