00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.029 

well<00:01:14.909> are<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.509> goose<00:01:15.749> is<00:01:16.109> our<00:01:16.499> signature<00:01:17.009> move

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
well are the goose is our signature move

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.550 
well are the goose is our signature move
I<00:01:17.399> guess<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.850> far<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.390> Marina's<00:01:19.079> saw<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.439> in

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
I guess so far and Marina's saw it in

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.109 
I guess so far and Marina's saw it in
the<00:01:19.649> picture<00:01:20.039> right<00:01:20.219> we<00:01:20.429> did<00:01:20.579> it<00:01:20.670> last<00:01:20.850> year

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the picture right we did it last year

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.059 
the picture right we did it last year
and<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.630> think<00:01:21.780> Tessa<00:01:22.140> decided<00:01:22.710> she<00:01:22.829> wanted<00:01:23.009> to

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:23.069 
and I think Tessa decided she wanted to

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:25.249 
and I think Tessa decided she wanted to
try<00:01:23.249> the<00:01:23.310> loop<00:01:23.579> off<00:01:23.819> and<00:01:24.179> we<00:01:24.810> love<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.109> goose

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
try the loop off and we love the goose

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.440 
try the loop off and we love the goose
who<00:01:25.469> loved<00:01:25.619> do<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.890> for<00:01:26.039> our<00:01:26.130> fans<00:01:26.429> and<00:01:26.759> for<00:01:27.299> me
