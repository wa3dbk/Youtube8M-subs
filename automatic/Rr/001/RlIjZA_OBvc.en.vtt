00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
little spot you'll see where that rod is

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.949 
little spot you'll see where that rod is
going<00:03:40.010> to<00:03:40.130> fit<00:03:40.430> so<00:03:41.000> little<00:03:41.390> architectural

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
going to fit so little architectural
