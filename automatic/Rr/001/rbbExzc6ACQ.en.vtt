00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.740 
just they haven't seen anything like
that<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.579> a<00:01:43.610> lot<00:01:43.850> of<00:01:43.880> times<00:01:44.180> that's<00:01:44.299> enough<00:01:44.630> to

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
that so a lot of times that's enough to

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.170 
that so a lot of times that's enough to
trigger<00:01:44.990> a<00:01:45.140> bite<00:01:45.409> right<00:01:45.650> so<00:01:46.520> from<00:01:46.790> there<00:01:47.000> the

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
trigger a bite right so from there the

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.569 
trigger a bite right so from there the
two<00:01:47.329> top<00:01:47.570> waters<00:01:47.960> we<00:01:48.110> go<00:01:48.320> to<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.799> 3<00:01:49.009> DB<00:01:49.189> wake

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
two top waters we go to the 3 DB wake

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.300 
two top waters we go to the 3 DB wake
again<00:01:50.270> check<00:01:50.810> out<00:01:50.930> that<00:01:51.079> interior<00:01:51.470> prism<00:01:51.979> no

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
again check out that interior prism no

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.670 
again check out that interior prism no
matter<00:01:52.490> how<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:52.790> things<00:01:53.180> are<00:01:53.360> it<00:01:54.200> really<00:01:54.530> is

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
matter how the things are it really is

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.800 
matter how the things are it really is
that<00:01:55.130> is<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.579> coolest<00:01:56.119> thing<00:01:56.329> it's<00:01:56.600> got

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
that is the coolest thing it's got

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.749 
that is the coolest thing it's got
incredible<00:01:57.439> reflective<00:01:57.979> action<00:01:58.159> and<00:01:58.640> it

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
incredible reflective action and it

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.300 
incredible reflective action and it
really<00:01:58.970> mimics<00:01:59.509> what<00:01:59.750> a<00:02:00.020> live<00:02:00.350> shad<00:02:00.680> does<00:02:01.040> in

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
really mimics what a live shad does in

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.859 
really mimics what a live shad does in
the<00:02:01.399> water<00:02:01.610> doesn't<00:02:01.970> always<00:02:02.180> look<00:02:02.479> just<00:02:02.750> a

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
pinchers up it's guided a wire guard so

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:13.899 
pinchers up it's guided a wire guard so
it's<00:03:12.530> pretty<00:03:12.739> weightless<00:03:13.219> it<00:03:13.430> really<00:03:13.700> does

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
it's pretty weightless it really does
