00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
insane idea I admit but we had really

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:17.930 
insane idea I admit but we had really
just<00:01:15.869> purchased<00:01:16.410> the<00:01:16.560> Airstream<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.369> we

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
just purchased the Airstream and we

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.449 
just purchased the Airstream and we
wanted<00:01:18.300> to<00:01:18.479> jump<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.560> with<00:01:19.770> both<00:01:19.800> feet<00:01:20.009> you

00:01:20.449 --> 00:01:20.459 
wanted to jump in with both feet you

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:21.949 
wanted to jump in with both feet you
know<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.970> kind<00:01:21.209> of<00:01:21.300> everything<00:01:21.660> kind<00:01:21.899> of

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:21.959 
know and it kind of everything kind of

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:25.219 
know and it kind of everything kind of
coincided<00:01:22.590> at<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.099> right<00:01:23.340> time<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.229> we

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
coincided at the right time and we

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.839 
coincided at the right time and we
thought<00:01:25.410> why<00:01:25.679> not<00:01:25.709> you<00:01:26.490> only<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:26.819> married

00:01:26.839 --> 00:01:26.849 
thought why not you only get married

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:31.070 
thought why not you only get married
once<00:01:27.319> hopefully<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.599> we<00:01:30.720> thought<00:01:30.869> you

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
once hopefully and so we thought you

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.240 
once hopefully and so we thought you
know<00:01:31.110> we're<00:01:31.349> just<00:01:31.470> gonna<00:01:31.560> go<00:01:31.830> and<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.130> this

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
know we're just gonna go and do this

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.880 
know we're just gonna go and do this
honeymoon<00:01:32.670> right<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.209> and<00:01:34.080> so<00:01:34.560> we<00:01:34.679> didn't

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
honeymoon right and and so we didn't

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.050 
honeymoon right and and so we didn't
really<00:01:35.099> have<00:01:35.250> an<00:01:35.399> agenda

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
really have an agenda

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.930 
really have an agenda
we<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.690> hopped<00:01:37.349> in<00:01:37.560> our<00:01:37.770> Airstream<00:01:38.640> and

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
we just hopped in our Airstream and

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.080 
we just hopped in our Airstream and
headed<00:01:39.149> west<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.130> went<00:01:41.310> farming<00:01:41.700> as<00:01:41.819> far

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
headed west and you went farming as far

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.660 
headed west and you went farming as far
as<00:01:42.300> now<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.569> Airstream<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.380> like<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.800> silver

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
as now the Airstream is like the silver

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.029 
as now the Airstream is like the silver
thing<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.209> it's<00:01:45.360> one<00:01:45.660> that<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.959> pull<00:01:46.530> behind

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
thing but it's one that you pull behind

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.730 
thing but it's one that you pull behind
a<00:01:47.220> truck<00:01:47.429> correct<00:01:47.819> right<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.390> classic

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
a truck correct right it's the classic
