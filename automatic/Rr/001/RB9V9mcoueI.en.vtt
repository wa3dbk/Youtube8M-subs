00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.830 
doesn't feel like there's any slop in
the<00:02:59.650> transmission<00:03:00.250> either<00:03:00.430> in<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.849> Trop

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
the transmission either in the Trop

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
the transmission either in the Trop
shafts<00:03:02.200> or<00:03:02.349> anything

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.010 

so<00:03:11.520> accelerates<00:03:12.000> cleanly<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.420> smoothly<00:03:12.660> went

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
so accelerates cleanly and smoothly went

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.100 
so accelerates cleanly and smoothly went
out<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.260> 50

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
out to 50

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.570 
out to 50
it's<00:03:15.560> very<00:03:15.770> cost<00:03:16.130> well

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:04:04.800
