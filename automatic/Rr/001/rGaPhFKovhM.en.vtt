00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello youtube I hope you are very 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.470
 well in this video I will talk about the 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.630
 virtues and defects of ios 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.000
 and many people had asked me 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.640
 this video and I will try to do it as much 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.290
 concise possible so let's start with 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.310
 what I like most about this system 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:23.110
 operational the most applications 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.939
 the applications that we find in the 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.009
 current systems market 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.500
 mobile operatives are developed 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.810
 first in ios and this is a great 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.520
 advantage for its users and also 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.710
 I consider that the quality of 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.860
 applications that we find in aig端es 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.840
 is the best currently apart 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.330
 Apple app store remains the 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.030
 Larger and better application store 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.160
 assorted to this day in it we can 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.920
 find a quality application for 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.070
 practically any need either 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.930
 professional or entertainment the 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.270
 next feature that pleases me 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.030
 of ios is the fluidity of the system 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.830
 operative and this is because it is apolo 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.320
 the company that generates the hardware and the 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.600
 software which allows you to optimize the 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.490
 performance of their products since they do not 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.409
 they have to be adapted to different 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.109
 brands or companies 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.689
 in my experience they keep up their 

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:19.450
 device with ios itself was very unusual 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.939
 that is binding unless less clear that 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.920
 have it with me break but still your 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.109
 performance will be excellent the most 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.240
 of time and this brings me to the 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:31.090
 next feature of ayo is that 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.979
 I like the jailbreak so this 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.890
 it could generate a bit of controversy 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.500
 but stop explaining to start the 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.349
 jailbreak is not illegal if you do it has 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.969
 its good and bad consequences but what 

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:45.549
 important here is that it is not a crime 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:48.280
 do it what may be considered a 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.530
 crime is how you use it and if you want 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.479
 better understand this topic at the end of 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.909
 this video will leave the link to another 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.700
 video in which he explained everything about the 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.500
 jailbreak but going back to the subject 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.409
 Yerberito pleases me because it allows us 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.140
 exploit the potential of ios to 100% 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.599
 from my point of view there is no other 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.840
 more customizable operating system than 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:12.940
 ios when we have the jailbreak done 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.310
 the next aspect that I like about 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.610
 ios is the way in which the 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.590
 extremely simple operating system already 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.230
 either through our computer or 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.239
 from the same device and all 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.330
 updates that apolo releases for 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.430
 They are designed and released for all 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.379
 your products at the same time which 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.560
 allows users to be equally 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.660
 updated now I will explain a 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.410
 point that is half virtue and half 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.569
 ios defect is designed to 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.930
 integrate in an excellent way with others 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.390
 Brand products app is amazing 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.120
 How easy it is to share or unify 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.670
 the experience of aig端es with the one of mac or 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.069
 apple tv no doubt this is a great 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.680
 virtue but to be able to achieve this 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.620
 perfect integration we must disburse 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.989
 quite money since you aim to buy 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.959
 practically everything to achieve this great 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.489
 experience of use from products to 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.860
 software 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.379
 if you have enough money this point 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.720
 it will only be a virtue for you but if not 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.940
 you have it and acquire it only one product 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.579
 of support can be much more 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.170
 expensive than another of the competition and already 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.859
 even talk about acquiring many 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.849
 sap products or simply very expensive 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:31.000
 although I also know that for many 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:34.569
 users, it's worth it, it depends on each 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.579
 who another defect of ios is justly 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.730
 what I mentioned about jailbreaking your 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.530
 moment this is a bit confusing but 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.560
 I'll try to explain it as clearly 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.410
 possible is amazing to modify 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.060
 joves thanks to the jailbreak but why 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.489
 we must break our guarantee and 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.609
 encourage joves to be able to do our 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.620
 device as we want I consider that 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.079
 should unify quite a few of the 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:03.040
 applications that we downloaded from cydia to 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:04.900
 ios immediately and in this way ios 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.000
 it would be a much more operating system 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.350
 customizable without needing 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.120
 jailbreak 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.820
 in terms of life time in the 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.680
 battery of the devices with ios not 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.380
 considers it a defect but 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.859
 I could definitely do something to 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.650
 improve it 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.789
 and finally this is a defect that 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.150
 I hope it's temporary 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:28.250
 the aesthetic design of ios is no longer what 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.530
 shocking and cute that was in the past 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.659
 it's time for apple to do a 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.370
 physical redesign to your operating system 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:35.960
 mobile 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.750
 I honestly believe that every day 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.969
 sees a little more obsolete mainly 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.770
 in functions like multitasking the 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:45.080
 which is not really a true 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.090
 multi tasking is just changing 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.330
 application to application more 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.819
 fast I know there are many 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.340
 virtues more than aig端es like 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:57.080
 defects these are just some of the 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.629
 that came to my mind while 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.520
 I made this video and I also know that 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:03.650
 this video may be a bit 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.500
 confusing for people who do not know what 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.050
 enough of aig端es and if you are one of 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.120
 I invite you to come to my channel and 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.120

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.180
 clarify your doubts and if not leave them in the 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.159
 comments below and I answer them to 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.740
 way of conclusion I consider that a 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:24.620
 joves is an excellent operating system 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.030
 how everything in life could improve but 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.130
 It is definitely a 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.490
 the strongest options on the market 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.410
 current or probably the most solid 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.600
 remember that all the above is only 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.000
 my point of view and can be of 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.730
 agreement or not with him let me know in the 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.920
 comments that you think of ios and what has 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.790
 been your experience in using what you 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.740
 they would change and they would leave as is 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:51.110
