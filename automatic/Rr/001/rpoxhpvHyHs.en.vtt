00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
activated on this device I find that the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.999 
activated on this device I find that the
picture<00:01:56.600> quality<00:01:56.780> that<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.350> colors<00:01:57.649> are<00:01:57.830> off

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
the real colors as they should be I find

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.339 
the real colors as they should be I find
that<00:02:06.039> it<00:02:07.039> just<00:02:07.310> generally<00:02:07.970> worst<00:02:08.810> performance

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
that it just generally worst performance

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.140 
that it just generally worst performance

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.809 

there's<00:02:32.860> not<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.010> lot<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.220> details<00:02:33.700> out<00:02:33.909> for

good colors look at that idiot going

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.440 
good colors look at that idiot going
through<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.680> red<00:02:38.860> light<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.730> people<00:02:40.030> are<00:02:40.120> crazy

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
through a red light and people are crazy

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.580 
through a red light and people are crazy
in<00:02:40.659> my<00:02:40.750> area<00:02:40.959> they<00:02:41.170> don't<00:02:41.290> know<00:02:41.349> how<00:02:41.409> to<00:02:41.470> drive

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
in my area they don't know how to drive

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.199 
in my area they don't know how to drive
and<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.370> guys<00:02:42.459> think<00:02:42.790> there's<00:02:42.909> not<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.030> lot<00:02:43.180> of

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
and you guys think there's not a lot of

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.850 
and you guys think there's not a lot of
colors<00:02:43.569> right<00:02:43.720> now<00:02:43.900> because<00:02:44.230> still<00:02:44.470> early

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
colors right now because still early

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.330 
colors right now because still early
early<00:02:45.159> spring<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:47.500> it's<00:02:47.590> not<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.739> lot<00:02:48.280> of

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
early spring so it's not a lot of

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.830 
early spring so it's not a lot of
flowers<00:02:48.670> but<00:02:49.599> I<00:02:49.930> guess<00:02:50.620> it's<00:02:50.799> enough<00:02:51.040> color

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
but there's pretty much a sample for

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.060 
but there's pretty much a sample for
good<00:03:24.940> lighting<00:03:25.120> conditions<00:03:25.920> actually<00:03:26.920> let<00:03:27.010> me

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
get to the pictures and then low

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:49.900 
get to the pictures and then low
lighting<00:03:40.810> conditions<00:03:41.290> ok

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910

okay so the first part of the low
lighting<00:04:43.580> video<00:04:44.540> recording<00:04:44.960> test<00:04:45.370> I'll<00:04:46.370> be

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
lighting video recording test I'll be

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.490 
lighting video recording test I'll be
doing<00:04:46.610> it<00:04:46.790> indoors<00:04:47.120> because<00:04:47.510> some<00:04:47.840> people<00:04:48.080> say

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500

that<00:04:48.710> k<00:04:48.920> can<00:04:49.100> you<00:04:49.130> do<00:04:49.310> an<00:04:49.490> indoor<00:04:49.850> low<00:04:50.000> lighting

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
that k can you do an indoor low lighting

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.360 
that k can you do an indoor low lighting
test<00:04:50.480> you<00:04:51.110> know<00:04:51.200> when<00:04:51.320> I'm<00:04:51.410> sampling<00:04:51.860> a<00:04:52.010> camera

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
test you know when I'm sampling a camera

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.190 
test you know when I'm sampling a camera
um<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.960> second<00:04:54.440> part<00:04:54.620> will<00:04:54.770> be<00:04:55.150> outside<00:04:56.200> like

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
um the second part will be outside like

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.750 
um the second part will be outside like
when<00:04:57.410> its<00:04:57.500> pitch<00:04:57.620> black<00:04:57.680> outside<00:04:58.100> with<00:04:58.490> some

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
when its pitch black outside with some

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.090 
when its pitch black outside with some
street<00:04:59.030> lights<00:04:59.240> so<00:05:00.170> right<00:05:00.350> now<00:05:00.380> I'm<00:05:00.800> recording

with my own eyes I can see everything

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.450 
with my own eyes I can see everything
clearly<00:05:32.870> like<00:05:33.230> the<00:05:33.320> frame<00:05:33.590> where<00:05:34.370> the

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
clearly like the frame where the

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
bit better now now it's focused a lot

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.200 
bit better now now it's focused a lot
better<00:05:38.150> and<00:05:38.450> now<00:05:39.200> it's<00:05:39.350> back<00:05:39.530> to<00:05:40.030> being<00:05:41.030> out<00:05:41.180> of

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
better and now it's back to being out of

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.480 
better and now it's back to being out of
focus<00:05:41.480> on<00:05:41.810> spot<00:05:42.680> because<00:05:42.830> the<00:05:43.010> there's<00:05:43.400> too

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
focus on spot because the there's too

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.950 
focus on spot because the there's too
much<00:05:43.580> light<00:05:43.850> coming<00:05:43.880> from<00:05:44.210> there<00:05:44.510> at<00:05:44.750> the<00:05:44.840> back

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
much light coming from there at the back

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.640
