00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.229 
don't fix it and also let's talk a
little<00:02:51.040> bit<00:02:51.159> about<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.400> display<00:02:51.790> it's<00:02:52.060> a

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
little bit about the display it's a

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.059 
little bit about the display it's a
gorgeous<00:02:52.540> display<00:02:53.049> like<00:02:53.379> I<00:02:53.470> said<00:02:53.620> it's<00:02:53.769> 14

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
gorgeous display like I said it's 14

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.789 
gorgeous display like I said it's 14
inch<00:02:54.220> but<00:02:54.849> it<00:02:54.879> is<00:02:55.150> 720p<00:02:55.930> native<00:02:56.379> so<00:02:56.500> we'll<00:02:56.650> do

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
inch but it is 720p native so we'll do

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.300 
inch but it is 720p native so we'll do
hi-def<00:02:57.340> it's<00:02:57.549> actually<00:02:57.819> 1366<00:02:58.720> by<00:02:59.170> 768<00:02:59.769> so<00:03:00.220> it's

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
hi-def it's actually 1366 by 768 so it's

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.420 
hi-def it's actually 1366 by 768 so it's
slightly<00:03:01.030> larger<00:03:01.359> than<00:03:01.389> a<00:03:01.569> 720p<00:03:02.109> display<00:03:02.709> but

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
slightly larger than a 720p display but

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.360 
slightly larger than a 720p display but
it<00:03:03.519> will<00:03:03.700> do<00:03:03.940> a<00:03:03.970> full<00:03:04.269> native<00:03:04.950> 720<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.099> it's

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
it will do a full native 720 and it's

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.180 
it will do a full native 720 and it's
LED<00:03:06.849> backed<00:03:07.150> so<00:03:08.079> if<00:03:08.470> you<00:03:08.560> don't<00:03:08.739> know<00:03:08.829> Samson

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
them their incredible battery life this

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.360 
them their incredible battery life this
is<00:03:16.090> actually<00:03:16.389> a<00:03:16.420> 6-cell<00:03:17.349> lithium-ion<00:03:17.379> battery

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
is actually a 6-cell lithium-ion battery

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.220 
is actually a 6-cell lithium-ion battery
but<00:03:18.519> it<00:03:18.579> runs<00:03:18.790> for<00:03:18.940> four<00:03:19.239> point<00:03:19.599> two<00:03:19.840> hours

which<00:03:20.379> is<00:03:20.500> impressive<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.159> that's<00:03:21.549> when<00:03:21.730> it

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
which is impressive and that's when it
