maybe<00:03:23.490> they're<00:03:23.700> going<00:03:23.820> to<00:03:23.910> go<00:03:24.030> ad<00:03:24.210> at<00:03:24.360> all<00:03:24.540> so

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
maybe they're going to go ad at all so

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.690 
maybe they're going to go ad at all so
who<00:03:25.470> knows<00:03:25.650> what<00:03:25.860> they're<00:03:25.980> going<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.130> do<00:03:26.280> in<00:03:26.400> e3

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
who knows what they're going to do in e3

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.660 
who knows what they're going to do in e3
2012<00:03:27.300> but<00:03:27.900> myself<00:03:28.110> personally<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:29.040> think<00:03:29.280> it

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
2012 but myself personally I think it

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.950 
2012 but myself personally I think it
would<00:03:29.760> be<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:29.880> really<00:03:30.180> cool<00:03:30.510> year<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.840> actually

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
would be a really cool year to actually

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.960 
would be a really cool year to actually
show<00:03:31.350> off<00:03:31.500> their<00:03:31.650> next<00:03:31.920> Xbox<00:03:32.310> console<00:03:32.820> because

show off their next Xbox console because

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.930 
show off their next Xbox console because

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
if you look at that date e to be 2012

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.820 
if you look at that date e to be 2012
that's<00:03:36.450> going<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.720> be<00:03:36.840> in<00:03:36.930> June<00:03:37.230> that's

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830

now I can tell you right now that I'm
really<00:03:54.810> hoping<00:03:55.230> that<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.440> playstation<00:03:56.010> 4

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
really hoping that the playstation 4

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.500 
really hoping that the playstation 4
isn't<00:03:56.610> going<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.790> be<00:03:56.880> six<00:03:57.180> hundred<00:03:57.480> dollars

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
isn't going to be six hundred dollars

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.690 
isn't going to be six hundred dollars
like<00:03:58.290> how<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.500> PlayStation<00:03:59.130> 3<00:03:59.340> was<00:03:59.520> when<00:03:59.670> I

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
like how the PlayStation 3 was when I

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.880 
like how the PlayStation 3 was when I
first<00:03:59.970> released<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:00.690> I<00:04:01.050> could<00:04:01.290> be<00:04:01.410> absolutely

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
first released and I could be absolutely

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.620 
first released and I could be absolutely
wrong<00:04:02.130> about<00:04:02.400> this<00:04:02.550> but<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:02.820> feel<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.330> reason

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
wrong about this but I feel the reason

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.900 
wrong about this but I feel the reason
why<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:04.380> PlayStation<00:04:05.010> 3<00:04:05.160> was<00:04:05.340> so<00:04:05.550> much<00:04:05.700> money

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
why the PlayStation 3 was so much money

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.030 
why the PlayStation 3 was so much money
at<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.210> time<00:04:06.390> is<00:04:06.630> because<00:04:07.320> it<00:04:07.440> had<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.590> blu-ray

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
at the time is because it had a blu-ray

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.700 
at the time is because it had a blu-ray
player<00:04:08.070> in<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.760> PlayStation<00:04:09.420> 3<00:04:09.750> now<00:04:10.350> it's<00:04:10.560> not

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
player in the PlayStation 3 now it's not

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.260 
player in the PlayStation 3 now it's not
just<00:04:10.950> because<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.340> blu-ray<00:04:11.670> player<00:04:11.880> was<00:04:12.090> in

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
just because the blu-ray player was in

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.510 
just because the blu-ray player was in
the<00:04:12.390> PlayStation<00:04:13.020> 3<00:04:13.260> it's<00:04:13.500> because<00:04:14.160> at<00:04:14.370> the

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
the PlayStation 3 it's because at the

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.820 
the PlayStation 3 it's because at the
time<00:04:14.550> blu-ray<00:04:15.330> players<00:04:15.630> were<00:04:15.900> very<00:04:16.260> big<00:04:16.560> hot

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
time blu-ray players were very big hot

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.950 
time blu-ray players were very big hot
device<00:04:17.280> they<00:04:17.880> were<00:04:17.940> just<00:04:18.239> coming<00:04:18.630> out<00:04:18.750> they

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:18.960 
device they were just coming out they

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.200 
device they were just coming out they
were<00:04:19.049> completely<00:04:19.440> brand-new<00:04:20.040> and<00:04:20.460> the<00:04:20.880> reason

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.210 
were completely brand-new and the reason

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:22.909 
were completely brand-new and the reason
why<00:04:21.330> people<00:04:21.660> bought<00:04:22.020> the<00:04:22.169> playstation<00:04:22.740> 3

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
why people bought the playstation 3

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:23.370 
why people bought the playstation 3
anyway

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
anyway

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.960 
anyway
is<00:04:23.470> instead<00:04:24.160> of<00:04:24.280> balling<00:04:24.580> up<00:04:24.670> in<00:04:24.850> you<00:04:24.940> know

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
is instead of balling up in you know

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.510 
is instead of balling up in you know
separate<00:04:25.600> blu-ray<00:04:26.020> player<00:04:26.320> is<00:04:26.560> because<00:04:27.310> with

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
separate blu-ray player is because with

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.580 
separate blu-ray player is because with
the<00:04:27.610> PlayStation<00:04:28.210> 3<00:04:28.510> you're<00:04:29.020> getting<00:04:29.290> a<00:04:29.350> game

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
the PlayStation 3 you're getting a game

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.910 
the PlayStation 3 you're getting a game
console<00:04:30.160> and<00:04:30.400> a<00:04:30.820> blu-ray<00:04:31.180> player<00:04:31.240> in<00:04:31.780> one<00:04:32.350> so

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
console and a blu-ray player in one so

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.440 
console and a blu-ray player in one so
that's<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.220> real<00:04:33.430> big<00:04:33.670> reason<00:04:34.090> why<00:04:34.120> people

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
that's the real big reason why people

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.630 
that's the real big reason why people
bought<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:34.930> anyway<00:04:35.050> now<00:04:35.920> not<00:04:36.190> only<00:04:36.220> that<00:04:36.580> you

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
bought it anyway now not only that you

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.150 
bought it anyway now not only that you
know<00:04:36.940> PlayStation<00:04:37.780> 4<00:04:38.110> I<00:04:38.380> mean<00:04:38.680> I<00:04:38.860> don't<00:04:39.100> know

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
know PlayStation 4 I mean I don't know

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.100 
know PlayStation 4 I mean I don't know
how<00:04:39.280> much<00:04:39.460> it's<00:04:39.610> going<00:04:39.730> to<00:04:39.820> be<00:04:40.000> I'm<00:04:40.600> guessing

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
how much it's going to be I'm guessing

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.560 
how much it's going to be I'm guessing
that<00:04:41.140> should<00:04:41.440> be<00:04:41.560> around<00:04:41.770> 400<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:42.520> 450<00:04:43.090> dollars

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
that should be around 400 to 450 dollars

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.390 
that should be around 400 to 450 dollars
i<00:04:43.690> think<00:04:43.870> that's<00:04:44.020> a<00:04:44.080> reasonable<00:04:44.440> price<00:04:44.860> the

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
i think that's a reasonable price the

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.700 
i think that's a reasonable price the
xbox<00:04:45.850> 720<00:04:46.300> s<00:04:46.540> price<00:04:46.750> tag<00:04:47.080> I<00:04:47.290> really<00:04:47.530> do<00:04:47.680> feel

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
xbox 720 s price tag I really do feel

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.040 
xbox 720 s price tag I really do feel
that<00:04:47.980> a<00:04:48.190> reasonable<00:04:48.580> price<00:04:48.850> for<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.210> xbox<00:04:49.600> 720

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
that a reasonable price for the xbox 720

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.860 
that a reasonable price for the xbox 720
should<00:04:50.380> definitely<00:04:50.800> be<00:04:50.890> around<00:04:51.180> 400<00:04:52.180> to<00:04:52.270> 450

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
should definitely be around 400 to 450

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.660 
should definitely be around 400 to 450
dollars<00:04:53.290> as<00:04:53.440> well<00:04:53.650> same<00:04:54.310> thing<00:04:54.460> as<00:04:54.580> the

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
dollars as well same thing as the
