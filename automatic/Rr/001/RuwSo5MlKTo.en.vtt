 Hello UTB games tatler with you Egor 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.940
 white hare 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.040
 and today we look at the top 5 most 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.480
 rezinochek occur in the game 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.480
 industries drove 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.529
 gran turismo racing simulator series 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.539
 developed by polyphony digital 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.939
 and often offered to players 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.919
 ride on something unusual in 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.750
 fourth of the company modern 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.210
 sports car made grandfather of all 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.640
 cars benz patent motor uah 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.140
 prehistory is known by all 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.950
 german inventor carl benz 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.200
 designs this wheelbarrow in 1885 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.180
 and a year later she gets a patent on her 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.920
 production of a stroller with 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.100
 petrol engine accelerated 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.900
 up to 16 kilometers per hour but not at all 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.150
 enjoyed success with potential 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.130
 Banks firm buyers was close to 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:57.170
 the wife saved the situation 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:59.030
 the inventor of brett in 1888 she took 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.520
 with two sons drove on 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.189
 car a hundred and six kilometers committing 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.110
 successful run from manga mo forts haima 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.939
 despite the fact that gasoline accounted for 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.920
 buy roadside pharmacies and herself 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.479
 the wheelchair was constantly breaking down nonsense and not 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.619
 just made a big advertisement 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.259
 husband's invention 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.909
 but also became the first woman driving as 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.609
 it says here 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.049
 gpn freeride extreme mode which 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:23.810
 opened to the player only after 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.420
 passing plots mafia 2 introduced 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.639
 us a dozen engineering wonders 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.109
 for example with armored strip and 

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:33.130
 death black metal 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:35.929
 no windows terrifying black color 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.359
 thick metal machine gun on the roof and 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:41.299
 the murderous roll of the assassin in front speeding 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:44.090
 at least up to 60 kilometers per hour this 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.069
 the unit took down everything in its path very 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.259
 it is a pity that freeride extreme with insane 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:49.759
 missions and cars seam it 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.859
 the final version of mafia 2 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.420
 although pieces of code found in the game 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:56.060
 talked about such a plan 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.799
 developers were however not even 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.120
 would make a frankly weak second 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:04.390
 the part is much better 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.360
 space dog and hard to find easy to lose 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.340
 and impossible to forget to get this 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.770
 the car needs a fair amount of effort 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.810
 After all, collect all 50 pieces of broken 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.090
 flying saucer scattered around 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.580
 losss course is not the easiest 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.070
 problem after this space docker 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.720
 appear in the garage omega pick one 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.940
 it can only be from there once 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.740
 keep the car in your garage 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.860
 impossible after loading the game 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.420
 the car mysteriously disappears 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.760
 nevertheless it is worth a ride 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.650
 at least once a life space docker 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.270
 equipped with two turbines which 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.040
 allow the player some time 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.110
 keep in the air after jumping with 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.540
 springboards in addition he is practically 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.730
 invulnerable to smash a wheelbarrow simply 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.280
 impossible unless of course shoot by 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.530
 It propelled grenades and machine in general 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.320
 really very cool series of saints row 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.990
 full of crazy vehicles of which 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.720
 only worth drinking smetanka sleep which 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.790
 crushes everything in its path on pood I shoot 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.860
 flying in boxing 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.170
 analogs of two-dimensional pixels for 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.970
 three-dimensional space tank is 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.850
 not only to dream of all programmers but 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.580
 and any self-respecting evil genius 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.890
 but the sensor was still something more wild 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.680
 monk monopole perhaps the craziest 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.540
 car and everyone in this game 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.540
 cute car mad professor 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.080
 he is able to do enough people himself after which 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.120
 shoot 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.800
 has guns 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.830
 developer creativity full 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.780
 order and developers serious sam 2 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.670
 go further than your colleagues and 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.010
 offer the player a ride on 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.230
 dinosaur an ancient raptor meeting 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.050
 only on the first level the money planets 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.330
 although not very well protected by new 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.250
 affairs on enemies serious quite a lot of horror 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.590
 jokes with such a vehicle 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.660
 really bad lizard sword of this enemy 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.040
 fireballs after which you can 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.040
 stay fried sausage 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.939
 Well, this is all write in the comments that 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.129
 do you think about our selection 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:04.620
 maybe you will tell us even more 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.959
 Crazy car put your thumbs up 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.109
 subscribe to the channel and wait even more 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.769
