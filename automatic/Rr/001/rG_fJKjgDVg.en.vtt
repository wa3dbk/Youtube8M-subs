00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870
 no no 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.260
 and now 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.329
 homeopathy is a medicine 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.720
 highly recognized alternative at the 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.270
 world we homeopaths after 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.129
 to make a homeopathic prescription 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.640
 we are who in the laboratory 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.170
 Classically in the office 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.600
 we prepare our remedies 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.400
 homeopathic for the patient these 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.890
 remedies are elaborated in the 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.989
 homeopathic laboratories that exist in 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.250
 the Mexican Republic and us 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.800
 we have our first-aid kit 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.500
 Homeopathic consists of medicines 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.830
 of greatest daily use in practice in 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.350
 nothing limits us what we are going to 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.600
 to do is make a prescription through 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.399
 of our history and clinic we can 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.140
 ask of course also the patient 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.000
 to bring us laboratory tests 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.480
 we rely on all of that since 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.490
 we are medical surgeons 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.670
 then after we do our 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.590
 prescription we go to prepare in 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.570
 our medicine cabinet 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.270
 homeopathic homeopathic medicine 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.770
 we will impregnate it in these that are 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.480
 the so-called globules that people 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.630
 normally known as commonly 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:44.020
 he knows a lot about these globules 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.290
 they are only the vehicle the vehicle 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.480
 that will impregnate what is in itself 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.740
 the medicine the medicine 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:56.290
 homeopathic commonly comes on a basis 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.780
 of alcohol all the substances that 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.670
 we use are of natural origin 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.710
 they are vegetables are minerals are 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.610
 animal substances but in their 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.980
 preparation are already as a vehicle 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.630
 Alcohol is left as vehicle 

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.430
 we will always see that all 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.860
 homeopathic medicines because they are 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.870
 alcoholic substances these 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.690
 medicines are the ones that go like 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.840
 I said to pervade only what 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.890
 we do is deposit some 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.120
 drops 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:31.120
 of the medication in the vehicle the 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.560
 vehicle that are our globules this 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:39.130
 what it gives us is a possibility of what 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.950
 the patient has a facility for 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.930
 take it very noble indeed because the 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.110
 flavor is very nice to children 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.410
 I love practical 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.710
 and then with this we achieve 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:56.200
 that the patient can take home 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.930
 your medication since you leave the 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.810
 consult this is when we do it with 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.079
 globules we also prepare it as 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.790
 vehicle in the form of drops for it what 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:11.239
 we do exactly the same 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.180
 we put the substance in the 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:17.329
 drop jar or that we go to 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.250
 whole bottle then and after that 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.439
 substance we are going to add the rest 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.620
 of the jar is our alcohol 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:27.019
 homeopathic is an alcohol that is 87 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.840
 special degrees for homeopathy is a 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.919
 alcohol so homeopathic alcohol and this 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.319
 with this we would fill the rest of the bottle 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:39.530
 and then we prescribe a number 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:42.889
 determined of drops or globules this 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.290
 the amount of medication is important 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.260
 will have to see sometimes with the 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.090
 suffering 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.030
 sometimes it has to do with the 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:56.430
 our patient's age 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:00.750
 to the children because we prescribe 23 tickets 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.609
 and to the elderly 57 globules and the 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.209
 repetition also has to do with the 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:08.010
 condition if the condition is acute 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.709
 the repetition we are going to do more 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.829
 often if the condition is 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.180
 chronic then once a day every 48 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.549
 hours 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.380
 finally until once a week the 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.019
 patient from the office's exhale 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.229
 Take your medicine you can start it 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.090
 to take in the same office then 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.610
 this gives you the possibility to start the 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.630
 cure immediately or if it's a 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.600
 chronic disease 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.389
 logically they will take more time in 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.360
 recover health but little by little it will go 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:42.900
 feeling an improvement many times we 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.860
 they ask what is good for the cough that 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.380
 it's good for the network and rheumatoid which is 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.910
 good for colitis what good now 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.490
 it's what colitis most come to us 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.870
 gastritis that is good for allergies 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.570
 another thing that we also see 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.990
 very much and actually we 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.940
 orthodoxly we can not answer for 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.280
 with the name of medication because to 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.400
 we do not have diseases but there are 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.660
 sick then me through me 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.550
 clinical history 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.060
 I will make an individualization of 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.490
 medication then this prescription 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.050
 this remedy that I am indicating is 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.259
 the remedy for me 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.120
 feel not for the disease then 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:26.400
 so many people say good is that to me 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.099
 gave me this that is different from what 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.580
 You gave for the same thing is not the same 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:33.180
 because we are not the same and we do not live the 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.460
 disease 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.759
 in the same way then that's another 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:42.020
 extremely advantageous question of our 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:44.270
 homeopathy the individualized 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.099
 as medicine homeopathy is the 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.129
 first medicine that deals with this 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:51.860
 of the human being as a whole to see the 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:53.780
 emotional part the emotional part the 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.639
 mental part all that is also 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.789
 included because we know very well when 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:01.520
 we get sick we change and that too 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:04.270
 we do not contemplate at the time of 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.270
 prescribe a medication
