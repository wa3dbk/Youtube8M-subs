00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
obviously haven't beaten the game yet

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.499 
obviously haven't beaten the game yet

through side quests and the main story
but<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.070> have<00:00:17.220> enough<00:00:17.609> right<00:00:17.880> now<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.090> give<00:00:18.359> you

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
but I have enough right now to give you

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.980 
but I have enough right now to give you
a<00:00:18.750> general<00:00:19.080> first<00:00:19.650> impressions<00:00:20.189> review<00:00:20.990> right

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
a general first impressions review right

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.810 
a general first impressions review right
off<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.230> bat<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.560> course<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.220> thing<00:00:23.490> is

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
off the bat of course this thing is

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.880 
off the bat of course this thing is
extremely<00:00:24.750> similar<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.050> fallout<00:00:25.199> 3<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.650> fact

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
extremely similar to fallout 3 in fact

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.730 
extremely similar to fallout 3 in fact
it's<00:00:26.070> essentially<00:00:26.609> fallout<00:00:27.449> 3<00:00:27.840> with<00:00:28.380> new

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
it's essentially fallout 3 with new

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.339 
it's essentially fallout 3 with new
missions<00:00:29.130> new<00:00:29.400> locations<00:00:30.170> everything<00:00:31.170> else

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
missions new locations everything else

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.799 
missions new locations everything else
which<00:00:31.650> means<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.130> core<00:00:32.579> gameplay<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:33.329> exactly

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
which means the core gameplay is exactly

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.660 
which means the core gameplay is exactly
the<00:00:33.960> same<00:00:34.079> as<00:00:34.170> fallout<00:00:34.410> 3<00:00:34.680> which<00:00:35.250> isn't

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
the same as fallout 3 which isn't

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.360 
the same as fallout 3 which isn't
actually<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:36.000> bad<00:00:36.270> thing<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:37.070> didn't<00:00:38.070> have<00:00:38.219> to

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
actually a bad thing I didn't have to

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.100 
actually a bad thing I didn't have to
adjust<00:00:38.730> for<00:00:38.969> controls<00:00:39.360> because<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.780> controls

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
adjust for controls because the controls

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.290 
adjust for controls because the controls
are<00:00:40.230> exactly<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.739> same<00:00:40.770> that's<00:00:41.640> was<00:00:41.850> exactly

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
are exactly the same that's was exactly

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.209 
are exactly the same that's was exactly
the<00:00:42.420> same<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:43.230> like<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.649> because<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.980> was

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
the same and I like that because it was

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.979 
the same and I like that because it was
soon<00:00:44.370> after<00:00:44.640> he<00:00:45.059> had<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.210> very<00:00:45.329> well<00:00:45.600> refined

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
soon after he had a very well refined

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.959 
soon after he had a very well refined
control<00:00:46.379> system<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:46.980> there<00:00:47.610> wasn't<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.940> whole

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
control system and there wasn't a whole

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.380 
control system and there wasn't a whole
lot<00:00:48.149> they<00:00:48.390> actually<00:00:48.690> had<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.020> update<00:00:49.200> for<00:00:49.649> that

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
lot they actually had to update for that

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.660 
lot they actually had to update for that
which<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.539> always<00:00:51.690> nice<00:00:51.989> but<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.190> mean<00:00:53.489> they

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
which is always nice but I mean they

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.830 
which is always nice but I mean they
even<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.239> they<00:00:54.390> even<00:00:54.510> also<00:00:55.110> from<00:00:55.440> fallout<00:00:55.770> 3

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
even but they even also from fallout 3

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.760 
even but they even also from fallout 3
used<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.379> same<00:00:58.620> models<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.460> skins<00:01:00.770> yes

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
used the same models and skins yes

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.700 
used the same models and skins yes
obviously<00:01:02.629> slightly<00:01:03.629> updated<00:01:03.780> graphics<00:01:04.500> wise

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
obviously slightly updated graphics wise

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.740 
obviously slightly updated graphics wise
but<00:01:05.070> essentially<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.030> exact<00:01:06.330> same<00:01:06.510> stuff

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
but essentially the exact same stuff

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.070 
but essentially the exact same stuff
which<00:01:07.760> actually<00:01:08.760> adds<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.299> strange<00:01:09.630> feel<00:01:09.900> to

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
which actually adds a strange feel to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.020 
which actually adds a strange feel to
this<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.770> genuinely<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.760> same

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
this that this is genuinely in the same

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.109 
this that this is genuinely in the same
world<00:01:12.930> as<00:01:13.380> fallout<00:01:13.920> 3<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> lot<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.880> video<00:01:15.090> games

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
world as fallout 3 a lot of video games

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.980 
world as fallout 3 a lot of video games
have<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> disconnect<00:01:16.350> between<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.710> games<00:01:17.990> from

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
have a disconnect between the games from

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.760 
have a disconnect between the games from
if<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:20.009> gamer<00:01:20.939> our<00:01:21.270> player<00:01:21.930> perspective

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
if you a gamer our player perspective

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.620 
if you a gamer our player perspective
because<00:01:23.340> they're<00:01:23.759> different<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:24.330> if

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
because they're different you know if

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.810 
because they're different you know if
you<00:01:24.840> have<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.350> same<00:01:25.530> type<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.799> soldier<00:01:26.430> in

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
you have the same type of soldier in

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.789 
you have the same type of soldier in
three<00:01:27.450> different<00:01:27.600> games<00:01:27.900> they<00:01:28.200> normally<00:01:28.500> look

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
three different games they normally look

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.020 
three different games they normally look
different<00:01:29.400> i<00:01:29.460> mean<00:01:29.579> they<00:01:29.640> might<00:01:29.759> have<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
different i mean they might have the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.580 
different i mean they might have the
same<00:01:30.060> overall<00:01:30.750> new<00:01:30.930> teeth<00:01:32.119> but<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.600> mean<00:01:34.079> they

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
same overall new teeth but I mean they

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.679 
same overall new teeth but I mean they
generally<00:01:35.070> look<00:01:35.280> very<00:01:35.670> different<00:01:35.880> they'll

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
generally look very different they'll

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.480 
generally look very different they'll
have<00:01:36.900> different<00:01:37.380> types<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.799> armor<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.369> each

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
have different types of armor in each

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.100 
have different types of armor in each
game<00:01:38.729> maybe<00:01:39.090> they'll<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.509> same<00:01:39.780> color

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
game maybe they'll be the same color

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.010 
game maybe they'll be the same color
generally<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.159> varies<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.360> makes<00:01:42.869> it

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
generally but it varies and it makes it

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.810 
generally but it varies and it makes it
hard<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.470> associate<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.610> same

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
hard to associate that this is the same

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.569 
hard to associate that this is the same
game<00:01:45.090> world<00:01:45.500> you<00:01:46.500> actually<00:01:46.860> do<00:01:47.009> get<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.399> with

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
game world you actually do get this with

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.789 
game world you actually do get this with
this<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:47.970> liked<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.990> like<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.619> it

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
this and I liked it I like it I like it

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.590 
this and I liked it I like it I like it
the<00:01:49.950> sense<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.399> am<00:01:50.579> actually<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.180> larger

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the sense that I am actually in a larger

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.620 
the sense that I am actually in a larger
game<00:01:51.810> world<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.950> literally<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.360> could

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
game world that literally the I could

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.270 
game world that literally the I could
walk<00:01:54.840> far<00:01:55.140> enough<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.560> i'll<00:01:55.680> hit<00:01:56.299> the<00:01:58.280> capital

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
walk far enough and i'll hit the capital

of the game I'm walking around with like
200<00:05:37.909> stimpacks<00:05:41.050> but<00:05:42.050> really<00:05:42.500> it<00:05:42.740> is<00:05:42.830> survival

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
200 stimpacks but really it is survival

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.370

on<00:05:43.430> this<00:05:43.520> whole<00:05:43.729> outdoor<00:05:43.940> stuff<00:05:44.419> this<00:05:45.199> game

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
on this whole outdoor stuff this game

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.990 
on this whole outdoor stuff this game
has<00:05:45.409> got<00:05:45.590> a<00:05:45.620> much<00:05:45.800> brighter<00:05:46.130> color<00:05:46.550> palette

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
then fought through and I think

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:49.480 
then fought through and I think
developers<00:05:48.440> are<00:05:48.830> starting<00:05:49.099> to<00:05:49.130> move<00:05:49.310> away
