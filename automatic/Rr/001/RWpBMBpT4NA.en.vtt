the<00:00:46.320> most<00:00:46.530> simple<00:00:47.239> simple<00:00:48.239> way<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.450> play<00:00:49.050> it

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the most simple simple way to play it

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.049 
the most simple simple way to play it
and<00:00:49.410> describe<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.829> as<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.190> alternating

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
and describe it as just alternating

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.000 
and describe it as just alternating
right<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.719> left<00:00:51.960> while<00:00:52.530> you're<00:00:52.680> doing<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
right and left while you're doing the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:14.420 
right and left while you're doing the
triple<00:00:53.309> is<00:01:11.810> I<00:01:12.810> think<00:01:13.380> only<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.979> left<00:01:14.189> hand

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
triple is I think only on the left hand

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.200 
triple is I think only on the left hand
but<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:14.700> still<00:01:14.820> basically<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> same<00:01:15.390> groove

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
but it's still basically the same groove

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:25.359 
but it's still basically the same groove
