your typical floor piston wall and then

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.760 
your typical floor piston wall and then
two<00:00:53.430> pistons<00:00:53.820> facing<00:00:54.210> phone<00:00:54.500> this<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
two pistons facing phone this is the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.200 
two pistons facing phone this is the
material<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.280> your<00:00:56.489> wall<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.820> made<00:00:57.000> out<00:00:57.180> of

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
material that your wall is made out of

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.490 
material that your wall is made out of
and<00:00:57.480> here's<00:00:57.840> where<00:00:58.020> your<00:00:58.199> wall<00:00:58.469> will<00:00:58.680> be<00:01:00.500> let's

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
and here's where your wall will be let's

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.160 
and here's where your wall will be let's
keep<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.800> wall<00:01:02.039> there<00:01:02.219> then<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.270> top<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.570> here

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
keep the wall there then on top of here

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.510 
keep the wall there then on top of here
place<00:01:04.979> two<00:01:05.250> blocks<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.799> and<00:01:07.799> like<00:01:08.810> that

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
place two blocks like that and like that

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.090 
place two blocks like that and like that
redstone<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.729> top<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.090> their<00:01:13.010> repeater<00:01:14.010> here

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
redstone on top of their repeater here

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.850 
redstone on top of their repeater here
repeater<00:01:14.670> here<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.180> link<00:01:15.540> them<00:01:15.600> together<00:01:15.869> one

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
repeater here and link them together one

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.950 
repeater here and link them together one
is<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.280> for<00:01:17.310> that's<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.030> back<00:01:18.479> one<00:01:18.750> that's

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
is on for that's the back one that's

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.260 
is on for that's the back one that's
really<00:01:19.320> important<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.640> one<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.210> top

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
really important the one that is on top

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
really important the one that is on top
of<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.659> piston<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.470> for<00:01:23.869> then<00:01:24.869> we're<00:01:25.080> going

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
of the piston is on for then we're going

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.440 
of the piston is on for then we're going
to<00:01:25.350> do<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:26.369> just<00:01:26.580> going<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.790> lead<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.180> down

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
to do is just going to lead that down

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.910 
to do is just going to lead that down
like<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.520> place<00:01:29.520> your<00:01:29.820> repeater<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
like that and place your repeater and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.210 
like that and place your repeater and
you're<00:01:31.920> done<00:01:32.100> with<00:01:32.340> one<00:01:32.610> side<00:01:35.420> just<00:01:36.420> test<00:01:36.659> out

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
you're done with one side just test out

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.469 
you're done with one side just test out
now<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.880> build<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> other<00:01:39.420> side<00:01:41.150> two<00:01:42.150> blocks

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
now to build the other side two blocks

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.600 
now to build the other side two blocks
away<00:01:42.630> you're<00:01:42.990> going<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.170> place<00:01:43.409> these<00:01:44.130> Pistons

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
away you're going to place these Pistons

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.380 
away you're going to place these Pistons
there<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:46.009> then<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.280> you're<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> full<00:01:48.090> piss<00:01:48.299> in

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
there and then you you're a full piss in

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.109 
there and then you you're a full piss in
the<00:01:48.450> wall<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.259> other<00:01:49.439> side

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
the wall just like on the other side

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.499 
the wall just like on the other side
there's<00:01:51.119> your<00:01:51.299> wall<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:53.210> then<00:01:54.210> what<00:01:54.390> you're

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
there's your wall and then what you're

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.999 
there's your wall and then what you're
going<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.689> do<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:54.960> copy<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.560> onto<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
going to do is just copy it onto the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:07.420 
going to do is just copy it onto the
other<00:01:56.040> side

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.760 

and<00:02:07.790> that's<00:02:08.240> it<00:02:10.420> how<00:02:11.420> does<00:02:11.600> your<00:02:11.750> entire<00:02:12.230> two

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
and that's it how does your entire two

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.560 
and that's it how does your entire two

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
you may be wondering how this piston is

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.760 
you may be wondering how this piston is
being<00:02:42.080> powered<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:45.140> I'm<00:02:45.260> going<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.470> go<00:02:45.620> into

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
being powered so I'm going to go into

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.270 
being powered so I'm going to go into
that<00:02:47.110> basically<00:02:48.110> is<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.590> acts<00:02:48.800> like<00:02:48.920> a<00:02:49.100> blood

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
that basically is it acts like a blood

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.030 
that basically is it acts like a blood
switch<00:02:49.520> so<00:02:49.850> if<00:02:50.300> a<00:02:50.540> block<00:02:50.780> diagonally<00:02:51.500> from

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
switch so if a block diagonally from

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.920 
switch so if a block diagonally from
piston<00:02:52.550> is<00:02:52.700> power<00:02:55.150> then<00:02:56.150> if<00:02:56.390> that<00:02:56.570> piston

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
piston is power then if that piston

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.920 
piston is power then if that piston
receives<00:02:57.260> updates<00:02:58.239> it<00:02:59.239> will<00:02:59.390> become<00:02:59.660> powered

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
receives updates it will become powered

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.890 
receives updates it will become powered
but<00:03:02.930> then<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.500> will<00:03:03.620> only<00:03:03.800> change<00:03:04.160> states<00:03:04.580> if

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
but then it will only change states if

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:12.640 
but then it will only change states if
you<00:03:05.900> cause<00:03:06.380> another<00:03:06.680> update<00:03:07.130> nearby<00:03:11.350> so<00:03:12.350> what

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
you cause another update nearby so what

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.280 
you cause another update nearby so what
the<00:03:12.799> update<00:03:13.160> is<00:03:13.340> is<00:03:13.640> this<00:03:14.330> repeater<00:03:14.810> here<00:03:14.900> and

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
the update is is this repeater here and

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.009 
the update is is this repeater here and
what<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.340> diagonally<00:03:17.090> powered<00:03:17.360> block<00:03:17.570> is<00:03:17.780> is

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
what the diagonally powered block is is

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.050 
what the diagonally powered block is is
right<00:03:18.200> here<00:03:20.110> so<00:03:21.110> yeah<00:03:21.320> um<00:03:21.620> enjoy<00:03:22.610> your

right here so yeah um enjoy your
diagonally<00:03:23.780> power<00:03:24.019> odd<00:03:24.580> what<00:03:25.580> am<00:03:25.670> I<00:03:25.790> saying
