me at the about the warrior - and he
started<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.160> explain<00:02:15.310> what<00:02:15.760> was<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.300> know

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
started to explain what was you know

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.000 
started to explain what was you know
what<00:02:16.630> was<00:02:16.750> involved<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.440> said<00:02:17.650> that<00:02:17.980> sounds

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
what was involved and I said that sounds

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.790 
what was involved and I said that sounds
really<00:02:18.489> cool<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:18.970> then<00:02:19.840> he<00:02:19.930> told<00:02:20.230> me<00:02:20.350> I<00:02:20.560> don't

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
really cool and then he told me I don't

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:57.270 
really cool and then he told me I don't
really<00:02:20.950> think<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.310> can<00:02:21.459> do<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:24.640> just

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.430 

we<00:02:57.730> wanted<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.090> incorporate<00:02:58.330> as<00:02:58.810> much<00:02:59.020> as<00:02:59.230> the

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
we wanted to incorporate as much as the

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.620 
we wanted to incorporate as much as the
natural<00:02:59.770> train<00:03:00.280> that<00:03:00.430> we<00:03:00.520> have<00:03:00.700> here<00:03:01.000> so

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
natural train that we have here so

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.870 
natural train that we have here so
there's<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:01.960> lot<00:03:02.110> of<00:03:02.140> water<00:03:02.650> obstacles<00:03:03.250> ladders

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
there's a lot of water obstacles ladders

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.190 
there's a lot of water obstacles ladders
and<00:03:04.150> running<00:03:04.390> through<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.690> mountains<00:03:05.050> as

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
and running through the mountains as

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.200 
and running through the mountains as
much<00:03:05.350> as<00:03:05.500> we<00:03:05.620> can<00:03:05.830> so<00:03:06.190> working<00:03:06.850> with<00:03:07.000> that

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
much as we can so working with that

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.760 
much as we can so working with that
terrain<00:03:07.540> we<00:03:07.720> wanted<00:03:08.020> to<00:03:08.110> make<00:03:08.290> sure<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.650> the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
terrain we wanted to make sure that the

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.740 
terrain we wanted to make sure that the
obstacles<00:03:09.280> also<00:03:09.670> kind<00:03:09.850> of<00:03:09.940> balanced<00:03:10.360> out<00:03:10.480> that

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
obstacles also kind of balanced out that

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:38.970 
obstacles also kind of balanced out that
it<00:03:10.840> wasn't<00:03:10.990> too<00:03:11.320> difficult

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.760 

we<00:03:39.910> always<00:03:40.060> work<00:03:40.330> with<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.629> local<00:03:41.410> building

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
we always work with the local building

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.530 
we always work with the local building
laws<00:03:41.920> to<00:03:42.160> make<00:03:42.250> sure<00:03:42.430> that<00:03:42.550> they're<00:03:42.790> within

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
laws to make sure that they're within

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.960 
laws to make sure that they're within
the<00:03:43.750> limits<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.290> be<00:03:44.410> able<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.590> have<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:45.280> Pitt

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
the limits to be able to have the Pitt

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.460 
the limits to be able to have the Pitt
low<00:03:46.239> enough<00:03:46.480> that<00:03:46.750> people<00:03:46.870> can<00:03:47.110> fall<00:03:47.260> and

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
low enough that people can fall and

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.619 
low enough that people can fall and
still<00:03:47.680> be<00:03:47.800> safe<00:03:48.069> so<00:03:48.670> those<00:03:48.970> distances<00:03:49.450> are

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
still be safe so those distances are

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.509 
still be safe so those distances are
usually<00:03:50.200> figured<00:03:50.800> out<00:03:50.920> ahead<00:03:51.099> of<00:03:51.160> time<00:03:51.280> with

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
usually figured out ahead of time with

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:59.309 
usually figured out ahead of time with
any<00:03:51.760> of<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:52.030> building<00:03:52.330> permits<00:03:52.690> in<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.810> area

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.660 

right<00:04:00.319> there<00:04:00.560> play<00:04:00.739> it's<00:04:01.040> just<00:04:01.190> long<00:04:01.640> enough

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
right there play it's just long enough

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.370 
right there play it's just long enough
to<00:04:01.910> have<00:04:02.120> a<00:04:02.209> great<00:04:02.330> time<00:04:02.630> and<00:04:02.870> I<00:04:02.959> get<00:04:03.170> to
