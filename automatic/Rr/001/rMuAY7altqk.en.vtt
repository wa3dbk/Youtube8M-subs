00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
use a different time so basically the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.010 
use a different time so basically the
best<00:00:14.639> binder<00:00:15.420> sleeves<00:00:15.780> are<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.410> 5d<00:00:16.920> sleeves

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
best binder sleeves are the 5d sleeves

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.290 
best binder sleeves are the 5d sleeves
they're<00:00:19.020> very<00:00:19.199> good<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.560> put<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:20.310> binder<00:00:21.029> to

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
they're very good to put in a binder to

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.840 
they're very good to put in a binder to
protect<00:00:21.750> them<00:00:21.990> but<00:00:22.859> they're<00:00:23.130> very<00:00:23.160> bad<00:00:23.640> to

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
protect them but they're very bad to

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.550 
protect them but they're very bad to
play<00:00:24.060> with<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.449> would<00:00:24.630> not<00:00:24.930> recommend<00:00:25.080> playing

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
with them they get just look at how

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.160 
with them they get just look at how
dirty<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.650> really<00:00:29.210> but<00:00:30.210> yeah<00:00:30.990> they're

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
it's just the front they're just like

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.830 
it's just the front they're just like
the<00:00:47.100> curl<00:00:47.340> up<00:00:47.579> like<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:48.000> as<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.420> see<00:00:48.629> and

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
the curl up like that as you can see and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.110 
the curl up like that as you can see and
they're<00:00:49.770> not<00:00:49.860> really<00:00:51.020> that<00:00:52.309> fun<00:00:53.309> da<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.850> hold

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
they're not really that fun da the hold

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.580 
they're not really that fun da the hold
in<00:00:54.300> your<00:00:54.329> hand<00:00:54.660> like<00:00:54.809> when<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.079> said<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.469> it

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
in your hand like when you said it it

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.950 
in your hand like when you said it it
goes<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> hollow<00:00:57.120> if<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.570> said<00:00:57.840> it

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
goes like like a hollow if you said it

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.460 
goes like like a hollow if you said it
would<00:00:58.370> show<00:00:59.370> like<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.600> crease<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:04.049> now<00:01:04.409> we

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
would show like a crease in it so now we

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.260 
would show like a crease in it so now we
go<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.040> main<00:01:05.309> two<00:01:05.549> card<00:01:05.880> sleeves

have like one of these but these are

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.870 
have like one of these but these are
really<00:01:48.840> good<00:01:49.049> for<00:01:49.259> testing<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.770> new<00:01:49.799> deck<00:01:50.189> at<00:01:50.430> a

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
really good for testing a new deck at a

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.960 
really good for testing a new deck at a
local<00:01:51.750> or<00:01:51.869> something<00:01:52.490> these<00:01:53.490> are<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.880> think

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
local or something these are I think

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.270 
local or something these are I think
these<00:01:54.270> ultra<00:01:55.079> pro<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.409> new<00:01:55.560> ultra<00:01:55.920> pro<00:01:56.070> ones

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
are really good I would recommend

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.880 
are really good I would recommend
picking<00:01:58.619> those<00:01:58.950> up<00:01:59.630> and<00:02:00.630> then<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:01.439> go<00:02:01.560> under

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
picking those up and then we go under

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.090 
picking those up and then we go under
the<00:02:02.189> player's<00:02:02.460> choice<00:02:03.110> which<00:02:04.110> here<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.860> a

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
the player's choice which here is a

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.100 
the player's choice which here is a
basically<00:02:05.700> mint<00:02:06.090> condition<00:02:06.570> player's<00:02:06.810> choice

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
basically mint condition player's choice

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.029 
basically mint condition player's choice
leave<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.950> do<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:09.289> it<00:02:10.289> has<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> soft

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
leave if I do this it has a soft

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.030 
leave if I do this it has a soft
background<00:02:11.760> which<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.450> which<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:13.050> like

it's just whatever you say but yeah the

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.159 
it's just whatever you say but yeah the
player's<00:03:56.220> choice<00:03:56.519> never<00:03:57.030> use<00:03:57.780> player's

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
player's choice never use player's

choice<00:03:58.560> for<00:03:58.919> playtesting<00:03:59.579> basically<00:04:01.159> unless

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
choice for playtesting basically unless

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.099 
choice for playtesting basically unless
it's<00:04:02.370> like<00:04:02.519> a<00:04:02.579> different<00:04:03.030> color<00:04:03.239> because<00:04:03.870> what

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
it's like a different color because what

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.949 
it's like a different color because what
I<00:04:04.139> found<00:04:04.409> is<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:05.010> white<00:04:05.189> players<00:04:05.459> choice

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
I found is that the white players choice

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.689 
I found is that the white players choice
tend<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.049> like<00:04:07.229> get<00:04:07.590> dirty<00:04:07.919> really<00:04:08.340> easily

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
tend to like get dirty really easily

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:12.740 
tend to like get dirty really easily
intended<00:04:09.359> just<00:04:09.709> like<00:04:10.709> fall<00:04:11.069> apart<00:04:11.430> like<00:04:11.750> the
