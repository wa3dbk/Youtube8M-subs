00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.680
 this government is working to get out 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.570
 of the crisis without generating false 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.610
 expectations and very aware of the 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.860
 seriousness of the moment we make reforms 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.110
 we explain them to the Spaniards and 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.309
 we defend in this parliament this is how 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.830
 how the criteria of 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.780
 government communication 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.660
 thank you very much, Mr. President , I know 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.790
 that as they are, it seems to you very 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.380
 exotic and unlikely that a party will 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.570
 meet to support all together to your 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.820
 secretary general is very 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.100
 exotic 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.350
 look 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.810
 does not like press conferences 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.050
 after the council of ministers has 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.150
 you very bad memory Friday the 27th 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.710
 May 2011 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.680
 alfredo pÃ©rez rubalcaba spokesperson 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.590
 government if from this table starts to 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.920
 answering party questions I will not be 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.950
 doing my job well the end of the appointment 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.750
 I have many more for once the 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.290
 Mr. Rubalcaba and I agree 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.450
 you criticize us with your question today 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.790
 lordship 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.250
 you do not agree or get 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.710
 same and I do not need to go further than 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.810
 yesterday when you asked 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.120
 advocates why the 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.460
 justice and when you ask ask 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.320
 that we act all the other lordships not 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.330
 they have criteria and when they do not have 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.430
 criteria in Madrid do not obey them in 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.180
 ponferrada seÃ±orÃ­a because there he has 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.070
 failed the communication say you 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.560
 internal and external but most 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.200
 important criteria have failed 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.240
 and the principles seniority because if not 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.650
 there would have been a social reaction like 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.140
 what has been there would have been a 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.020
 socialist rectification lordship would have 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.700
 there was a socialist rectification sra 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.330
 this government in dream a 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.210
 vice president has taken the time 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.210
 and now heap please with shipping 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.870
 thank you president 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.940
 this government has principles and about 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.940
 everything is very clear what are the 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.340
 country objectives we took the country into a 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.140
 very complicated situation and we take to 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.030
 a first wave of reforms and 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.920
 thanks to that we are winning 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.660
 credibility outside our borders 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.940
 and the deficit data show it 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.740
 external balance of payments or 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.570
 behavior of the markets and now 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.520
 we are carrying out a second of 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.780
 those waves of reforms to create 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.980
 employment to generate growth when 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.540
 the unions participate in the measures 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.459
 from the government, you are annoyed 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.020
 what do we have to do with them to talk or 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.930
 Do not talk because of your questions 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.700
 I honor me never clear morning 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.350
 will vote some of those measures for the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.380
 entrepreneurship of young people but that 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.270
 you support the government in this case 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.250
 In these months we have tried to 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.570
 take Spain out of the crisis you 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.370
 have gotten into all the crises that have 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.640
 could and that there is no communication that 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.640
 arrange
