00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:17.130 

uses<00:01:10.280> a<00:01:10.720> vg10<00:01:12.850> not<00:01:13.850> sure<00:01:14.060> if<00:01:14.149> you<00:01:14.240> agree<00:01:14.539> that

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.529 

it's<00:01:18.140> made<00:01:18.350> in<00:01:18.500> Seiki<00:01:18.770> City<00:01:19.159> Japan<00:01:22.420> it's<00:01:23.420> got

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
it's made in Seiki City Japan it's got

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.060 
it's made in Seiki City Japan it's got
one<00:01:23.690> of<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.840> smaller<00:01:24.140> opening<00:01:24.619> holes<00:01:24.829> on<00:01:25.040> it

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
one of the smaller opening holes on it

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.710 
one of the smaller opening holes on it
and<00:01:25.369> I<00:01:26.270> believe<00:01:26.990> that's<00:01:27.170> because<00:01:27.439> this<00:01:27.560> knife

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
and I believe that's because this knife

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.469 
and I believe that's because this knife
was<00:01:29.720> designed<00:01:30.200> quite<00:01:30.409> a<00:01:30.530> while<00:01:30.770> ago<00:01:30.920> and<00:01:31.070> I

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
was designed quite a while ago and I

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.440 
was designed quite a while ago and I
think<00:01:32.479> they've<00:01:32.659> done<00:01:32.689> much<00:01:33.110> changes<00:01:33.680> to<00:01:33.860> it

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
think they've done much changes to it

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.020 
think they've done much changes to it
with<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.540> holes<00:01:35.719> a<00:01:35.840> little<00:01:35.990> bit<00:01:36.170> smaller<00:01:37.030> but

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
with the holes a little bit smaller but

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.929 
with the holes a little bit smaller but
it's<00:01:38.450> adequate<00:01:38.689> you<00:01:39.140> could<00:01:39.290> still<00:01:39.880> open<00:01:40.880> and

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
it's adequate you could still open and

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.480 
it's adequate you could still open and
close<00:01:41.149> it<00:01:41.299> on<00:01:41.329> hand<00:01:41.829> still<00:01:42.829> flick<00:01:43.100> it<00:01:43.250> with<00:01:43.369> the

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
close it on hand still flick it with the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.209 
close it on hand still flick it with the
wrist<00:01:46.060> his<00:01:47.060> life<00:01:47.299> is<00:01:47.509> crazy<00:01:47.930> sharp<00:01:49.539> it's

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
wrist his life is crazy sharp it's

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.469 
wrist his life is crazy sharp it's
possibly<00:01:52.219> one<00:01:52.399> of<00:01:52.549> the<00:01:52.610> sharpest<00:01:53.030> I<00:01:53.149> have

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.670 

filming<00:01:56.479> with<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.750> cell<00:01:57.020> phone<00:01:57.229> so<00:01:57.409> I<00:01:57.469> can't

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
filming with the cell phone so I can't

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.679 
filming with the cell phone so I can't
really<00:01:57.799> do<00:01:58.009> any<00:01:58.219> cut<00:01:58.460> tests<00:01:58.909> but<00:01:59.119> even<00:01:59.509> down

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
really do any cut tests but even down

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.749 
really do any cut tests but even down
here<00:01:59.719> on<00:02:00.049> this<00:02:00.170> little<00:02:00.380> tip<00:02:00.710> right<00:02:00.740> here<00:02:01.159> just

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
here on this little tip right here just

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.880 
here on this little tip right here just
slicing<00:02:02.360> through<00:02:02.479> paper<00:02:02.750> like<00:02:03.020> just<00:02:03.590> butter

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
slicing through paper like just butter

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.609 
slicing through paper like just butter
all<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.609> way<00:02:04.700> through<00:02:04.969> I<00:02:05.030> tried<00:02:05.420> I<00:02:05.869> tested<00:02:06.530> it

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
all the way through I tried I tested it

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.259 
all the way through I tried I tested it
on<00:02:06.829> different<00:02:07.070> parts<00:02:07.369> of<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.640> blade<00:02:07.850> just<00:02:07.880> to

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
on different parts of the blade just to

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.710 
on different parts of the blade just to
see<00:02:08.450> if<00:02:08.570> the<00:02:08.780> sharpness<00:02:09.560> was<00:02:09.739> consistent<00:02:10.369> and

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
see if the sharpness was consistent and

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.310 
see if the sharpness was consistent and
yeah<00:02:11.720> it's<00:02:12.350> consistent<00:02:13.040> Spyderco<00:02:14.109> they<00:02:15.109> got

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
yeah it's consistent Spyderco they got

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.940 
yeah it's consistent Spyderco they got
it<00:02:15.440> sharp

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
it sharp

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.449 
it sharp
I<00:02:16.030> also<00:02:17.030> tried<00:02:17.450> with<00:02:17.660> my<00:02:17.810> tasman<00:02:18.320> salt<00:02:18.620> which

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
I also tried with my tasman salt which

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.819 
I also tried with my tasman salt which
uses<00:02:19.820> h1<00:02:20.269> steel<00:02:20.630> is<00:02:20.989> to<00:02:21.140> see<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.470> difference

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
uses h1 steel is to see the difference

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.670 
uses h1 steel is to see the difference
and<00:02:21.980> this<00:02:22.190> is<00:02:22.340> for<00:02:22.549> sure<00:02:22.730> sharper<00:02:23.209> than<00:02:23.299> that

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
and this is for sure sharper than that

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.509 
and this is for sure sharper than that
my<00:02:25.070> tasman<00:02:25.519> salt<00:02:25.790> is<00:02:26.000> pretty<00:02:26.989> sharp<00:02:27.320> but<00:02:27.560> yeah

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
my tasman salt is pretty sharp but yeah

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.130 
my tasman salt is pretty sharp but yeah
this<00:02:28.760> is<00:02:28.820> definitely<00:02:29.630> sharper

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:46.070 

the<00:02:34.140> weight<00:02:34.350> on<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:36.260> is<00:02:42.620> 4.6<00:02:43.620> ounces<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:45.870> it's

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
the weight on this is 4.6 ounces so it's

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.690 
the weight on this is 4.6 ounces so it's
actually<00:02:46.260> pretty<00:02:46.650> light<00:02:46.860> for<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.250> size<00:02:47.520> of

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
actually pretty light for the size of

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.250 
actually pretty light for the size of
this<00:02:47.790> knife<00:02:49.460> you<00:02:50.460> see<00:02:50.670> it's<00:02:50.790> got<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.060> 1<00:02:51.900> steel

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
this knife you see it's got a 1 steel

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.530 
this knife you see it's got a 1 steel
liner<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:53.280> then<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:53.730> other<00:02:53.970> side<00:02:54.300> is<00:02:54.510> just

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
liner and then the other side is just

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.620 
liner and then the other side is just

me I wish it was a little bit nicer

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.230 
me I wish it was a little bit nicer
maybe<00:05:17.010> if<00:05:17.190> they<00:05:17.280> did<00:05:17.430> a<00:05:17.460> carbon<00:05:17.850> fiber<00:05:18.060> version

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
maybe if they did a carbon fiber version

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.670 
maybe if they did a carbon fiber version
or<00:05:18.750> something<00:05:19.050> that'd<00:05:19.139> be<00:05:19.260> pretty<00:05:19.410> cool<00:05:20.630> but

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
or something that'd be pretty cool but

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.310 
or something that'd be pretty cool but
yeah<00:05:22.680> overall<00:05:23.070> it's<00:05:23.550> pretty<00:05:23.789> cool

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
yeah overall it's pretty cool
