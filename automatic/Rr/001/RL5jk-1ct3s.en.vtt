gaming group we're talking about this

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.709 
gaming group we're talking about this
and<00:00:29.840> this<00:00:30.840> idea<00:00:31.199> was<00:00:31.439> sort<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.710> strengthened

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
and this idea was sort of strengthened

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.680 
and this idea was sort of strengthened
with<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.309> Halloween<00:00:35.309> game<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.059> i<00:00:36.090> did<00:00:36.480> with

with the Halloween game that i did with

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.160 
with the Halloween game that i did with
Don<00:00:37.050> forecast<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.920> Sunday<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:40.320> idea<00:00:40.559> is

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
Don forecast on Sunday the idea is

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.500 
Don forecast on Sunday the idea is
focusing<00:00:43.170> less<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.760> numbers<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:45.090> tabletop

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
focusing less on numbers in tabletop

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.029 
focusing less on numbers in tabletop
gaming<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:47.450> focusing<00:00:48.450> more<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.980> the<00:00:49.980> story

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
gaming and focusing more on the story

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.790 
gaming and focusing more on the story
and<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:51.390> actual<00:00:51.600> actions<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.260> your<00:00:52.379> character

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
and the actual actions of your character

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.520 
and the actual actions of your character
in<00:00:53.730> other<00:00:53.910> words<00:00:54.090> making<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.570> more<00:00:54.750> abstract

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
in other words making it more abstract

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.760 
in other words making it more abstract
or<00:00:56.570> rather<00:00:57.570> making<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.109> more<00:00:58.230> specific

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
or rather making it more specific

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.299 
or rather making it more specific
because<00:00:59.010> numbers<00:00:59.780> are<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> little<00:01:01.170> abstract<00:01:03.049> so

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
because numbers are a little abstract so

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.760 
because numbers are a little abstract so
what<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.339> mean<00:01:05.519> by<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:06.740> you're<00:01:07.740> a
