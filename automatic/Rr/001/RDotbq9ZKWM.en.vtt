00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
pulls the trigger so that's why we don't

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.529 
pulls the trigger so that's why we don't

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
would like to demonstrate now is a

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.439 
would like to demonstrate now is a
finger<00:00:41.989> placement<00:00:42.320> this<00:00:42.829> is<00:00:43.010> crucial<00:00:43.489> every

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
finger placement this is crucial every

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.170 
finger placement this is crucial every
time<00:00:44.600> I<00:00:44.660> draw<00:00:44.989> my<00:00:45.020> weapon<00:00:45.199> whether<00:00:45.800> I<00:00:46.180> think

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
time I draw my weapon whether I think

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.450 
time I draw my weapon whether I think
imma<00:00:47.359> shoot<00:00:47.600> i<00:00:47.870> know<00:00:48.230> i'ma<00:00:48.649> shoot<00:00:48.859> or<00:00:49.070> I'm<00:00:49.250> not

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
sure this is how it comes out finger on

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.869 
sure this is how it comes out finger on
the<00:00:52.579> side<00:00:52.850> of<00:00:52.879> the<00:00:53.149> frame<00:00:53.769> sync<00:00:54.769> finger<00:00:55.670> on<00:00:55.789> the
