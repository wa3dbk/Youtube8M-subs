00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.169
 no 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.540
 missing a few minutes we are about to discover 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.489
 the new smart to rethink a similar one 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.410
 car was certainly not easy 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.420
 however, the German company succeeded 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.449
 to create something original e 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.830
 respectful of tradition 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.440
 the goal was to renew the 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.989
 design fix the mechanics and finally 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.769
 make smart even more efficient and 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.769
 safety 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.649
 and here it is already ready with the livery 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.439
 car to go we can almost say that the 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.719
 new smart is different is equal to 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.100
 the same time the construction philosophy is 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.229
 remained the same 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.439
 but the equipment and design have done 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.209
 a real step forward 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.369
 the look is inspired by that of the 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.200
 concept car for joy and introduces itself 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.819
 original enough and in line with 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.950
 home standards 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.290
 the new smart aims a lot on 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.690
 safety with an even more interior 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.540
 resistant and some mold solutions 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.450
 superior this is especially true 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:27.519
 looking at the new interiors definitely 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.769
 more refined and spacious, however, not smart 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.950
 it's just classic does indeed know great 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.900
 return forfour la after eight years 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.440
 four-door version even more 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.110
 spacious and roomy it is called high 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.390
 technology in common with both cars 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.209
 both on the dashboard and under the hood 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.269
 here we find a range of engines 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.290
 from three cylinders with powers from 60 71 and 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.019
 90 horses 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.609
 all available also with the new gearbox 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.380
 six-speed automatic 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.799
 the launch is scheduled for the next one 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.799
 November 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.659
