 selection in mind the said saladin 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.180
 of equilibrium then the 14 king of lupine the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.760
 11 swedish man the five of the prince the nine 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.120
 a love girl the 12th rank of the val 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.039
 13 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.539
 dream of beylev and the six oars is hard 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.340
 so you said it in mind you 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.020
 to classify the aladdin of ecajeul 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.309
 obviously we present more and who 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.230
 just made a very beautiful impression 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.560
 argenteuil very good impression very 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.760
 big impression 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.880
 he broke the record of the event the 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.960
 markets 9.8 on the mile so here's the 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.880
 horse it was a little while we 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.960
 had not seen in the province of the neck that 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.490
 followed the classical program to 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.010
 vincennes what is normal rope to 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.900
 right in plus so it was kind 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.850
 of antechamber of the dukes of normandy this 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.100
 Criterium of speed of low normandy 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.270
 to argentan so he has fully fulfilled 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.650
 his contract he was pretty 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.180
 impressive more he came across 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.770
 found his nose in the wind and he 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.630
 makes the difference in champions for 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.950
 to finish so it's coming under the 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.470
 best auspices for this price of the dukes 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.800
 of Normandy and it's really the horse 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.420
 tear down 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.920
 he's a real champion yeah that's a 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.540
 true champion and then good bah in addition to his 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.850
 performance does recruit because it 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.920
 could be our leader for the 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.720
 next top elite so that would be fine 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.460
 that he still wins for the sport and 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.660
 that we are able to vibrate solvalla 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.760
 soon what exactly 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.590
 sebastien garat rate confided arnaud 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.250
 lecomte and he is talking about this 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.810
 elite loeb for the costs the choice the 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.880
 Troll earned Argentan her breasts 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.110
 he claimed marchina leak so the 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.310
 choice is in super shape that stops there 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.290
 he likes it when I think he's going 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.150
 well run it's a last 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.660
 preparation before his participation and 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.070
 club we will prepare it for the best 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.550
 so here he will be able to agree the 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.530
 first have repair certainly but 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.460
 certainly had price ambitions 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.530
 dukes of normandy it's a group of 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.090
 sir wins the race and then more 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.440
 never win so we have a chance to the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.270
 win so we will do everything to win 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.120
 that because you prefer it tracks 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.290
 flat weight basin it does well but 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.850
 since it's flat I think there still 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.490
 better then the right around superman 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:35.110
 have both served as confident of 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.490
 broth and then on the cra 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.600
 way dreamer told me that the limits he 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.310
 preferred the rope horse to the right 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.560
 oh yes when we know what he is 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.240
 able to do already left we saw 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.310
 at argentan this was impressive 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.350
 so much to do to beat it is 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.690
 the very solid base to beat him you 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.459
 see the 14 months of lupine that is not 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.890
 other than the titleholder so we're going 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.810
 besides review this edition of the year 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.090
 last so king of lupine win 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.819
 in front of swedish man and beylev's dream 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.080
 so the roofs are going to be circle so 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.340
 there we see the debate that takes the advantage 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.560
 at the entrance the straight line on oneself says 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.510
 chan swedish man brave devil 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.550
 as usual who is reviving so is 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.230
 dominated by Jean Paul's boarder 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.390
 marmion may 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.940
 and who knocks who keep the 2nd in 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.099
 iron bars they have what dreams of 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.360
 beylev after a beautiful journey that comes 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.549
 finish well for third place 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.830
 so that's duval too a total is 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.120
 today valued at a small 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.129
 back as well as this year which 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.260
 run is here we will find him 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.239
 he will make his return to May 6 king of lupine 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.370
 the entourage is very confident when we 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.510
 understands the other silvery day precisely 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.760
 in the race is won at the turkey and 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.930
 kajol jean michel was forced to send 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.340
 opposite because it's not a big 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.090
 debunker behind the autostart that has 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.790
 found a little bit far 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.620
 he sent in thickness the straight line 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.879
 across the way and he was coming to try to 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.959
 titillate aladin of ecajeul when he 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.970
 would be shown faulty at the entrance to the 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.650
 straight line losing all luck but 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.519
 we feel that it was competitive for 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.950
 play a very good role 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.180
 so watch out for him because 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.370
 it showed as the cottage was 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.870
 back to the top of his real tired voice and 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.920
 winner last year so he was able to 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.160
 prove himself on the track that at 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.040
 comfortable 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.840
 this is going to be the challenger but you 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.379
 think it can beat we have there a 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.180
 winks 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.099
 good now he's ten years old what is she 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.510
 falls on a 50 long teeth 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.329
 for me it seems complicated to me 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.769
 now that's it's tough to cook he has 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.269
 the habit of these games there and there is 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:18.030
 jean michel russell who therefore his 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.440
 intentions if if the young is a small 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.239
 little less well he'll jump on 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.070
 the opportunity against very well just 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.090
 behind you place it at the swedish man 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.430
 which shows a regularity 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.960
 really exemplary swedish man rope to 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.919
 right this price america was 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.810
 ran rope right he handed a 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.950
 first chance so the wa lâ ilâha illâ 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.210
 net third to saint galmier en 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.070
 making the distance but he was beaten 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.300
 by scarlett turgot who is a very 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.710
 good mare who was leaving 25 meters 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.330
 behind him 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.590
 thierry duvaldestin told us that the 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.450
 horse was perhaps not sharpened yet 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.099
 as he is there so I think he has 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.669
 this is clearly an objective the price of 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:45.960
 dukes of normandy 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.099
 it's a beautiful race so I 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.080
 think he brought it to the best of 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.370
 this race here he was he was 2nd year 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.720
 last he will still struggle for the 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.400
 first places this year it's in 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.020
 his good season and we are in full 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.340
 in his season on a course he 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.780
 appreciate and that's it 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.639
 coming to prove his form he has full 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.740
 trumps in his game just fine 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.600
 behind you rank the prince's five 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.889
 who will come to him on and yes exactly 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.370
 it was the race that I was talking to you about 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.350
 saint galmier 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.669
 I spin a bit special like that but 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.500
 provided a great end of the race on 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.050
 day we feel it's a funny thing 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.190
 franck nivard chose it so yes it is 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.570
 an indication anyway because he 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.340
 could have led beckman is in the end and 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.110
 at the prince's sulky the day they were 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.280
 ferry will be deferré of later he has 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.270
 fairly short passes but 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.850
 when he is very wise alone who is 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.449
 able to sublimate a time he is very 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.400
 intermittent 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.750
 if you miss there he showed anyway 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.250
 that he looked good in his head well 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.470
 in his gaits it's important because 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.639
 that he has a tendency to fall light syllable 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.990
 good course it will be quick to finish 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.090
 that can be the nice surprise of the 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.040
 race right behind you 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.930
 classify the nine a girl of love then 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.030
 that she really did not spare 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.620
 efforts is still there it's a mother 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.580
 Courage as did all his 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.380
 races when you think it's over 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.490
 She is always there 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.050
 lastly in vincennes I find 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.250
 it reassures I thought of thought 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.960
 still a bit on the downhill 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.490
 like in early winter at the end a 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.720
 wonderful universe and there I said to myself 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.820
 good and start to pull out the tongue 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.080
 and lastly to reassure so she 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.240
 she is super practical she loves 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.289
 david Thomain flat tracks and know 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.630
 by heart and will surely be fine 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:05.540
 started and stand and if she a 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.060
 course along the rope 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.580
 will fight for I say not for the 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.720
 wins but for the 3 4 5th place it's 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.490
 archi playable at wii 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.960
 Well, I'll just make a little return 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.450
 backwards, we did not listen 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.790
 thierry raffegeau who confided in 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:23.020
 arnaud lecomte and he sees himself in 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:25.580
 the first three with prince 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.800
 ceramics have been very navigate a 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.190
 not far and but then he finished super fast 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.960
 we find a rope on the right tracks 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.580
 flat 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.820
 after there is surely to youth art 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.920
 of the flap and my choice was fine he is 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:43.580
 well your ambitions are important in 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.260
 this group 2 it's a race it's a 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.490
 goal anyway it's a beautiful 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.840
 No price I hope in too clean 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.280
 still ambitious is the trust 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.930
 I understand it because we are old 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.980
 really well finished he redid the 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.540
 ground on itself says ms anne messou 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.130
 edition were 25 may behind him 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.120
 the moment at equal post no that I can 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.860
 not allow me to put under and from 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.110
 way behind him but hey there after 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.130
 we never know the quality of the course 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.730
 maestria of franck nivard 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:09.830

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.690

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.610

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.740
 precisely for the occasion he finds the 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.210
