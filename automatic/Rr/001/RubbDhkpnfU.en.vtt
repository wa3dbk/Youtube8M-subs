00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hey my friend and welcome to this 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.420
 trouble in my wants video you noticed 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.980
 certainly that I do not live 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.110
 comment but the gameplay 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.980
 just running in the background and me 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.440
 not so incidentally that happened here 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.960
 I'll comment but I have that 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.130
 Gameplay taken in the background 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.279
 and I will do that soon 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.140
 Maybe more often if I do 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.439
 I'm a coach or if I'm an instant 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.660
 maybe a good round ' or 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.510
 simply a very respectable community 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.910
 I'll have to record then I'm yes 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.950
 just sit down again and 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.629
 to comment on 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.160
 and certainly hey asks why 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.899
 Are not you supposed to go straight to it when you are 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.500
 've been playing when I simply 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.879
 somehow with the skype or something and yes 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.820
 then probably in the mainfeld game I would yes 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.940
 the voice of the record and I 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.460
 would somehow still quite normal 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.899
 comment and the person with the me 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.699
 talk will not ask hey what 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.530
 he talks there or why he takes now 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.110
 I want to simply times only 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.570
 private talk and yes I play there 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.700
 then stop by and then I take 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.720
 sometimes, if you like 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.729
 and yes, that's what happens 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.500
 as it is now, for example 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.650
 a good trader round resp 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.869
 that means a good one I'll show you this 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.610
 Dogs for the reason that easy here 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.250
 let's see how incompetent my with 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.460
 Trade Taiwan or my teammates 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.689
 So those who are also traders and 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.310
 like me in the end alone 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.890
 but you will still be 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.350
 yes, that's just a small one 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.750
 Information will be that soon 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.020
 such very short rounds like these 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.729
 here is the long erich 34 minutes only 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.729
 that's just how it will be in the future 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.619
 round will give and yes this 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.210
 I will then videos as a gap filler 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.689
 For example, if I do not take one 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.210
 time has somehow to record or 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.119
 if somehow yes I knew 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.770
 upload to render whatever 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.880
 I will fill these videos as fillers 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.020
 Take that does not take long 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.959
 hofladen the do not go long and you 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.450
 still something to look at and yes me 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.530
 will then always comment will be short 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.209
 what to say 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.010
 and depending on how long they are 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.069
 possibly address another topic 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.690
 Say if it is a long gameplay so 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.200
 Ten minutes or so I can make a topic 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.910
 cut 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.370
 but if it is just very short it is like 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.650
 now so three minutes or so then can 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.000
 Of course I do not cut a topic like that 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.100
 and here you are now the same 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.650
 see 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.350
 I'm almost the only one left 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.890
 everybody stands and that's why the innocence 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.230
 actually know value trader is so 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.480
 the world always runs in chat 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.500
 see who has tested everything so can 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.750
 you actually assume that 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.610
 worth knowing trader is still i am 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.410
 now here as the only one left with 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.769
 another coach but somehow 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:01.980
 does not taste at all and yes now 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:03.750
 will you see how i am here for single 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.290
 or circled and I have yes 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.180
 also for trader points but i was 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.040
 somehow I did not think about it 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.709
 could never have actively recovered or one 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.410
 the little test or whatever 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.120
 but I've thought you over it well 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.940
 I died here at this point 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.440
 and yes you have seen it once you 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.870
 alone and so much is still there 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.880
 and you are not a Swiss colleague 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.130
 then the game can be a lot 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.870
 go out yes I would say that 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.540
 It was with this short trouble man 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.310
 wants video as I said these short 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.570
 videos come then always if I nothing 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.370
 have another or something as gap filler 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.630
 and otherwise just tell me 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.790
 maybe you'll see, I hope so 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.260
 I liked you and I say to you 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.260
 next time people
