 hello that such a plaster and view focus not on 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:34.250
 Today's editorial is going to teach 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.570
 how to change the tone to the skin of 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.350
 colour 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:43.910
 with photoshop and good let's go 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.910
 first we are going to a file 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.720
 open 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.900
 and we select our ag stream by 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.900
 example is 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:03.930
 this is a lawyer for 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.930
 but work better 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.960
 and here in this area 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.549
 let's click on this button 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.549
 for creating a new cup 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.189
 and now I know what we're going to the tool 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.189
 of the brush 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.680
 we call the year tone 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.790
 then now yes 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.130
 and here 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:35.090
 the rossi explosion is more or less like this 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.970
 and the macri 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.380
 and good yo 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.380
 and we started the painter 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.350
 for everything only 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.939
 only the door 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.939
 l we want to change the tome 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.840
 A) Yes 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:13.180
 it does not matter if his wife 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.180
 we can all erase this after 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.910
 the colors 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.280
 or teach them quickly how is this hair 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:33.100
 which is in their homes and with more care 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.100
 then I repeat that I do not have much time 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.630
 wait he lacked little 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.370
 how am I 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.730
 remember not to paint the hair 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.319
 and well here I touched them for the last 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.019
 selected this cup 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.980
 let's see up here where it says 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:09.480
 normal let's give on this little arrow 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:14.690
 let's select the tone option and 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.160
 if we approach it they play it but 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:22.920
 and it is very 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:25.010
 reduce language around here we're also going 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.860
 to see a little more 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.520
 more realistic we will select a 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.150
 soft 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.930
 and greece 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.689
 now 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.450
 Answer is how good if we have you 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:41.790
 change the color 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.250
 we oppress control 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:50.760
 Y 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:54.540
 I will also go to picture settings 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.580
 here as saturation 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:02.490
 let's see a click 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:07.850
 and here I do not move anything of our 2 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.850
 cellulose move it from luminosity 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.410
 and then over here 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.750
 good as it serves 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.750
 but for the white house 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.360
 edit you 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.830
 An example 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.830
 when so 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:36.480
 and we give in ok operantes election in 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.950
 this crisis coloring 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.320
 perez yoma one 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:45.190
 that I forgot that step I'm sorry 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.190
 okay 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:52.320
 and now the details look 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.320
 we select the draft 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.210
 there 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:02.110
 but it came out a lot 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.110
 very well you do not see 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.480
 if you look here 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.010
 and so they will change me 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.699
 since it's easy 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:34.880
 We can use this same procedure 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.880
 with now change the color to the hair 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.350
 different parts of the clothes 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.869
 to the eyes 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.540
 what they want 

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:49.490
