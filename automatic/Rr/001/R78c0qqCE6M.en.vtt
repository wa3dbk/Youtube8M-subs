okay<00:02:32.209> beautiful<00:02:33.209> throw<00:02:33.390> well<00:02:33.570> done<00:02:33.780> you're

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
okay beautiful throw well done you're

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.020 
okay beautiful throw well done you're
going<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.800> do<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.920> five<00:02:35.160> stride<00:02:35.459> approach<00:02:35.730> again

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
going to do a five stride approach again

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.190 
going to do a five stride approach again
but<00:02:36.209> this<00:02:36.330> time<00:02:36.570> we're<00:02:36.690> going<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.840> accelerate

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
but this time we're going to accelerate

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.199 
but this time we're going to accelerate
a<00:02:37.380> little<00:02:37.680> bit<00:02:37.800> quicker<00:02:38.070> into<00:02:38.459> it<00:02:38.550> but<00:02:39.180> I

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
a little bit quicker into it but I

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.940 
a little bit quicker into it but I
particularly<00:02:39.870> want<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.350> emphasize<00:02:40.709> that

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
particularly want you to emphasize that

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.949 
particularly want you to emphasize that
final<00:02:41.490> throwing<00:02:41.760> position<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.420> how<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.690> back

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
final throwing position and how the back

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.050 
final throwing position and how the back
foot<00:02:43.200> works<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.800> sets<00:02:44.070> everything<00:02:44.220> else<00:02:44.610> so<00:02:45.030> a

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
foot works it sets everything else so a

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.300 
foot works it sets everything else so a
quick<00:02:45.300> demonstration<00:02:45.510> now<00:02:46.140> on<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.380> spot<00:02:46.620> for

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
quick demonstration now on the spot for

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.100 
quick demonstration now on the spot for
turning<00:02:47.819> that<00:02:47.850> right<00:02:48.390> heel<00:02:48.600> up<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.020> out

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
turning that right heel up and out

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.380 
turning that right heel up and out
against<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.100> straight<00:02:50.370> left<00:02:50.670> leg<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:51.150> again

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
against a straight left leg and again

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.979 
against a straight left leg and again
and<00:02:52.140> that's<00:02:52.709> your<00:02:52.890> focus<00:02:53.280> for<00:02:53.400> this<00:02:53.989> faster

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
and that's your focus for this faster

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.449 
and that's your focus for this faster
you<00:02:55.110> can<00:02:55.230> do<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:55.500> with<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.739> relaxed<00:02:56.190> arm<00:02:56.310> the

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
you can do that with a relaxed arm the

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.910 
you can do that with a relaxed arm the
further<00:02:56.640> it'll<00:02:56.850> go<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.300> want<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.410> start<00:02:58.680> now

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
further it'll go I want you to start now

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.040 
further it'll go I want you to start now
in<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.190> slightly<00:02:59.430> different<00:02:59.850> position<00:03:00.050> with

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
in a slightly different position with

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.080 
in a slightly different position with
your<00:03:01.290> left<00:03:01.709> foot<00:03:01.890> back<00:03:02.070> for<00:03:02.550> your<00:03:02.640> five<00:03:02.820> stride

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
your left foot back for your five stride

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.390 
your left foot back for your five stride
approach<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:04.380> you<00:03:04.410> know<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:04.769> can<00:03:05.040> start<00:03:05.250> to

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
approach so you know you can start to

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.430 
approach so you know you can start to
accelerate<00:03:05.730> in<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.360> your<00:03:06.510> first<00:03:06.690> step<00:03:06.870> forward

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
accelerate in so your first step forward

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.110 
accelerate in so your first step forward
will<00:03:07.620> count<00:03:07.860> when<00:03:08.100> your<00:03:08.370> left<00:03:08.580> foot<00:03:08.760> touches

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
will count when your left foot touches

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:20.580 
will count when your left foot touches
the<00:03:09.209> ground<00:03:09.360> 1<00:03:09.720> 1<00:03:10.650> 2<00:03:10.769> 3<00:03:10.920> 4<00:03:11.340> 5

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.970 

and<00:03:21.590> how<00:03:21.799> did<00:03:21.950> that<00:03:22.069> feel<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.459> you<00:03:22.489> I<00:03:23.769> think<00:03:24.769> the

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
and how did that feel to you I think the

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.460 
and how did that feel to you I think the
timing<00:03:25.280> was<00:03:25.610> really<00:03:25.939> really<00:03:26.540> good<00:03:26.750> because

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
timing was really really good because

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.220 
timing was really really good because
your<00:03:27.769> emphasis<00:03:27.920> was<00:03:28.400> in<00:03:28.579> that<00:03:29.000> position<00:03:29.239> that

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
your emphasis was in that position that

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.960 
your emphasis was in that position that
sets<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:30.799> up<00:03:30.829> then<00:03:31.129> to<00:03:31.310> just<00:03:31.459> let<00:03:31.700> your<00:03:31.849> own

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
sets you up then to just let your own

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.490 
sets you up then to just let your own
come<00:03:32.209> through<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:32.750> weren't<00:03:33.019> trying<00:03:33.170> to<00:03:33.290> fight

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
come through you weren't trying to fight

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.960 
come through you weren't trying to fight
it<00:03:33.680> with<00:03:33.799> your<00:03:33.920> arm<00:03:34.040> or<00:03:34.189> throw<00:03:34.430> hard<00:03:34.700> with<00:03:34.879> your

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
it with your arm or throw hard with your

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:35.979 
it with your arm or throw hard with your
arm<00:03:35.150> it<00:03:35.299> was<00:03:35.420> relaxed

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
arm it was relaxed

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.720 
arm it was relaxed
that's<00:03:36.409> your<00:03:36.590> emphasis<00:03:36.709> again<00:03:37.250> good

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
that's your emphasis again good

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:46.500 
that's your emphasis again good
acceleration<00:03:38.030> in<00:03:38.650> 1<00:03:39.650> 2<00:03:39.769> 3<00:03:39.799> 4<00:03:40.220> 5

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.319 

well<00:03:47.110> done
