00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
why I only needed to use like the

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.870 
why I only needed to use like the
tablespoon<00:04:50.560> of<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:50.770> oil<00:04:50.980> because<00:04:51.400> it<00:04:51.520> creates

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
tablespoon of the oil because it creates

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.140 
tablespoon of the oil because it creates
all<00:04:52.750> of<00:04:52.810> this<00:04:53.110> juice<00:04:53.530> which<00:04:54.430> is<00:04:54.610> great<00:04:54.940> over

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
all of this juice which is great over

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.810
