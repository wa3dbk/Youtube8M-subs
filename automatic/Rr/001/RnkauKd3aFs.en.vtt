you can make the clock and the weather

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.509 
you can make the clock and the weather
icon<00:00:19.660> animated<00:00:20.439> by<00:00:20.589> animated<00:00:21.130> I<00:00:21.220> mean<00:00:21.369> that

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:21.519 
icon animated by animated I mean that

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:22.800 
icon animated by animated I mean that
they're<00:00:21.640> going<00:00:21.730> to<00:00:21.789> move<00:00:21.939> around<00:00:22.060> the<00:00:22.449> clock

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
they're going to move around the clock

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.149 
they're going to move around the clock
will<00:00:22.960> actually<00:00:23.380> tell<00:00:23.529> time<00:00:23.769> and<00:00:23.919> we'll<00:00:24.009> just

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:24.159 
will actually tell time and we'll just

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:25.679 
will actually tell time and we'll just
sit<00:00:24.279> there<00:00:24.369> 10-15<00:00:24.939> all<00:00:25.060> the<00:00:25.150> time<00:00:25.300> like<00:00:25.449> it<00:00:25.599> is

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
sit there 10-15 all the time like it is

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.019 
sit there 10-15 all the time like it is
right<00:00:25.810> now<00:00:26.130> check<00:00:27.130> it<00:00:27.249> out<00:00:27.339> every<00:00:27.789> time<00:00:27.909> you

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
right now check it out every time you

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.639 
right now check it out every time you
look<00:00:28.179> at<00:00:28.239> your<00:00:28.300> clock<00:00:28.539> in<00:00:28.689> system<00:00:28.989> 15<00:00:29.319> it's

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:29.649 
look at your clock in system 15 it's

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:32.220 
look at your clock in system 15 it's
kind<00:00:29.710> of<00:00:29.800> boring<00:00:30.479> and<00:00:31.479> then<00:00:31.599> you<00:00:31.720> can<00:00:31.869> make<00:00:32.020> the

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
kind of boring and then you can make the

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.990 
kind of boring and then you can make the
weather<00:00:32.560> icon<00:00:33.010> you<00:00:33.489> know<00:00:33.579> if<00:00:33.700> it's<00:00:33.820> raining

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
weather icon you know if it's raining

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.430 
weather icon you know if it's raining
outside<00:00:34.239> they'll<00:00:34.750> be<00:00:34.840> like<00:00:34.989> a<00:00:35.020> little<00:00:35.260> cloud

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
outside they'll be like a little cloud

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.140 
outside they'll be like a little cloud
there<00:00:35.710> with<00:00:35.890> rain<00:00:36.100> and<00:00:36.130> stuff<00:00:36.430> if<00:00:36.730> it's<00:00:36.970> hot

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
there with rain and stuff if it's hot

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.430 
there with rain and stuff if it's hot
it'll<00:00:37.420> you<00:00:37.690> know<00:00:37.750> what<00:00:37.960> to<00:00:38.050> be<00:00:38.140> a<00:00:38.170> son<00:00:38.410> like

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
it'll you know what to be a son like

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.650 
it'll you know what to be a son like
that<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:38.950> then<00:00:39.070> they<00:00:39.730> don't<00:00:39.910> say<00:00:40.000> 95<00:00:40.420> or

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
that and then they don't say 95 or

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.590 
that and then they don't say 95 or
whatever<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:42.280> this<00:00:42.610> is<00:00:42.820> all<00:00:43.000> you<00:00:43.210> need<00:00:43.240> to<00:00:43.480> do

whatever so this is all you need to do

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.210 
whatever so this is all you need to do

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
obviously you have to have cydia

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.490 
obviously you have to have cydia
installed<00:00:45.280> because<00:00:45.850> if<00:00:46.570> you<00:00:47.170> have<00:00:47.320> an<00:00:47.410> iPhone

installed because if you have an iPhone

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.350 
installed because if you have an iPhone
and<00:00:47.890> you<00:00:47.950> don't<00:00:48.100> have<00:00:48.190> cydia<00:00:48.520> then<00:00:48.760> you<00:00:49.180> don't

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
and you don't have cydia then you don't

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.570 
and you don't have cydia then you don't
really<00:00:49.450> have<00:00:49.660> an<00:00:49.780> iphone<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:51.100> what<00:00:51.490> you're

iphone on my computer yeah it's an app
called<00:01:04.360> vincy<00:01:05.229> from<00:01:05.860> cydia<00:01:06.689> okay<00:01:07.689> so<00:01:07.750> the

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
called vincy from cydia okay so the

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.590 
called vincy from cydia okay so the
first<00:01:08.020> app<00:01:08.679> that<00:01:09.399> we<00:01:09.490> need<00:01:09.640> to<00:01:09.729> look<00:01:09.819> for<00:01:09.880> in<00:01:10.210> IC

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
first app that we need to look for in IC

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.300 
first app that we need to look for in IC
is<00:01:11.280> called<00:01:12.280> live<00:01:12.850> clock<00:01:14.039> so<00:01:15.039> we're<00:01:15.130> going<00:01:15.219> to

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
is called live clock so we're going to

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.470 
is called live clock so we're going to
go<00:01:15.429> and<00:01:15.789> search<00:01:17.729> will<00:01:18.729> type<00:01:18.969> in<00:01:19.149> live<00:01:19.479> clock

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
go and search will type in live clock

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:29.020 
go and search will type in live clock
or<00:01:22.140> at<00:01:22.230> least<00:01:22.260> the<00:01:22.440> beginning<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.830> it

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.640 

for<00:01:29.720> those<00:01:29.810> of<00:01:29.960> you<00:01:30.020> guys<00:01:30.140> that<00:01:30.200> don't<00:01:30.530> know

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
for those of you guys that don't know

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.969 
for those of you guys that don't know
cydia<00:01:31.040> basically<00:01:31.549> I'm<00:01:31.850> sorry<00:01:32.090> I<00:01:32.150> see<00:01:32.479> is<00:01:32.630> just

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
cydia basically I'm sorry I see is just

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.250 
cydia basically I'm sorry I see is just
like<00:01:33.979> another<00:01:34.130> version<00:01:34.490> of<00:01:34.670> cydia<00:01:35.260> although

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
like another version of cydia although

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.770 
like another version of cydia although
it<00:01:36.409> can't<00:01:36.650> install<00:01:37.100> some<00:01:37.400> packages<00:01:37.909> that<00:01:38.540> city

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
it can't install some packages that city

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.170 
it can't install some packages that city
you<00:01:38.900> can<00:01:39.110> and<00:01:39.409> it's<00:01:40.159> definitely<00:01:40.580> faster<00:01:40.820> than

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
you can and it's definitely faster than

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.990 
you can and it's definitely faster than
cydia<00:01:41.390> when<00:01:41.659> it<00:01:41.750> opens<00:01:42.020> up<00:01:42.580> so<00:01:43.580> as<00:01:43.759> you<00:01:43.880> guys

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
cydia when it opens up so as you guys

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.990 
cydia when it opens up so as you guys
see<00:01:44.390> right<00:01:44.600> there<00:01:44.780> we<00:01:44.930> gotta<00:01:45.080> live<00:01:45.259> clock

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
see right there we gotta live clock

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.930 
see right there we gotta live clock
point<00:01:47.000> for<00:01:47.479> that<00:01:47.950> is<00:01:48.950> exactly<00:01:49.430> what<00:01:49.790> we're

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
point for that is exactly what we're

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.060 
point for that is exactly what we're
looking<00:01:49.970> for<00:01:50.380> so<00:01:51.380> we're<00:01:51.500> just<00:01:51.530> going<00:01:51.799> to<00:01:51.860> tap

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
looking for so we're just going to tap
