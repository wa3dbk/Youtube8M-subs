00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.819 
not fully human beings they are indeed
clones<00:01:50.659> fighting<00:01:51.659> rebels<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.470> think<00:01:52.740> we

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
clones fighting rebels and I think we

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.289 
clones fighting rebels and I think we
can<00:01:53.009> kill<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.220> lot<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.670> them<00:01:53.790> because<00:01:54.060> they<00:01:54.270> are

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
can kill a lot of them because they are

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.080 
can kill a lot of them because they are
cloned<00:01:54.600> from<00:01:54.810> one<00:01:55.020> actual<00:01:55.829> bounty<00:01:56.490> hunter<00:01:56.850> but
