pretty great and I'd want to stare at me
too<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.270> they<00:02:06.360> don't<00:02:06.390> stop<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.380> like<00:02:08.300> I'm

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
too but they don't stop it's like I'm

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.180 
too but they don't stop it's like I'm
just<00:02:09.510> listening<00:02:09.869> my<00:02:10.080> music<00:02:10.500> trying<00:02:11.040> to<00:02:11.100> be

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
just listening my music trying to be

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:29.060 
just listening my music trying to be
natural<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.610> there's<00:02:11.790> like<00:02:13.580> -<00:02:27.830> how<00:02:28.830> do<00:02:28.890> you

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
natural and there's like - how do you

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.060 
natural and there's like - how do you
get<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.340> school<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:29.940> live<00:02:30.690> off<00:02:30.840> campus<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.950> get

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
get to school I live off campus to get

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.650 
get to school I live off campus to get
here<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.310> take<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.700> bus<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.090> mall<00:02:33.180> from<00:02:33.510> my

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
here I take the bus to the mall from my

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.100 
here I take the bus to the mall from my
house

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
house

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.259 
house
and<00:02:34.200> then<00:02:34.320> I<00:02:34.410> think<00:02:34.590> that's<00:02:34.920> for<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.250> mall<00:02:35.459> to

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
and then I think that's for the mall to

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.330 
and then I think that's for the mall to
here<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:36.930> takes<00:02:37.230> about<00:02:37.410> an<00:02:37.769> hour

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
here and that takes about an hour

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.550 
here and that takes about an hour
but<00:02:38.730> yeah<00:02:39.060> it's<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.780> few<00:02:39.959> hundred<00:02:40.230> for<00:02:40.320> three

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
but yeah it's a few hundred for three

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.680 
but yeah it's a few hundred for three
day<00:02:40.709> week<00:02:40.950> yeah<00:02:41.459> ok<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:42.090> know<00:02:42.180> what<00:02:42.360> shut<00:02:42.630> up

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
day week yeah ok you know what shut up

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.350 
day week yeah ok you know what shut up
10<00:02:43.110> o'clock<00:02:43.230> class<00:02:43.500> is<00:02:43.680> still<00:02:43.830> stuck<00:02:44.360> bill

10 o'clock class is still stuck bill

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.880 
10 o'clock class is still stuck bill
then<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.600> go<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.870> your<00:02:46.050> classes<00:02:46.320> how<00:02:46.680> are<00:02:46.769> your

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
then you go to your classes how are your

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.890 
then you go to your classes how are your
classes<00:02:47.070> class<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.150> pretty<00:02:48.360> grand

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
classes class is a pretty grand

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.570 
classes class is a pretty grand
except<00:02:49.590> when<00:02:49.739> they<00:02:49.769> aren't<00:02:50.130> actually<00:02:50.310> don't

like most of my classes I think are your

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.650 
like most of my classes I think are your

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
Sciences and stuff but for me it's

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.600 
Sciences and stuff but for me it's
bigger<00:03:00.840> classes<00:03:01.020> but<00:03:01.590> then<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:01.770> have<00:03:01.980> my<00:03:02.310> human

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
bigger classes but then I have my human

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.100 
bigger classes but then I have my human
size<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:02.970> class<00:03:03.180> which<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.750> complain<00:03:04.080> about
