00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.690
 hello my name is hector silva fireman 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.940
 volunteer of the third company of the 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.059
 angels fire department 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.150
 I want to show how we ship do 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.920
 in the body of the angels towards a 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.910
 scheme and a circuit that we could 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.790
 design from the central does not 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.329
 dispatch by mdc 1200 to our 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:34.630
 base 5 micturition equipment you will not activate 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:36.980
 the fall of sow in the barracks and 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.079
 also activation of sirens 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.079
 at the same time he also does it and he does it 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.930
 called selective as well then 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.579
 make alert calls according to 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.040
 the units that the central wants 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.190
 dispatch on your laptop is that 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.760
 I have here back simulating teams of 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.220
 different companies my laptop 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.980
 will simulate the plant's equipment the 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.100
 which will give a signaling by the 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.369
 mdc 1200 to the base team which is going to be 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.580
 activate the siren then I will do 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.340
 activate the siren of barracks in barracks 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.930
 x1 activate although the central one has the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.270
 power to activate it 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.680
 also if there are personnel in the barracks 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.300
 obviously you can activate the form 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.149
 manual as I have no sneaky in this 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.150
 box there is the red light indicates that you are 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:29.110
 activating the light 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.910
 of the siren manually and if not 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.260
 has in the barracks where we had 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.080
 us problems in everything be and 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.390
 we designed this circuit in which 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.070
 let's try immediately to touch 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.800
 sirens from my laptop I give 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.840
 the feeling to my base team and you 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.820
 can see to play without propeller 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.060
 touch mermaid and I was learning from the 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.159
 light automatically the time it is 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.890
 can be programmed with a timer 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.920
 or software ray equipment 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.979
 there it just turned off the light and now 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.520
 let's go an activation of al qaida of 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.979
 ring for a room in this case we're going 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.039
 to do the third company we are going to 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.780
 activate from my laptop that the 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.310
 is doing base 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.989
 to this first that was activated 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.610
 the net is falling the bell that 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.830
 it means that in this green light I am 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.349
 simulating that it activates if you grab 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.770
 opening gates is in the use of guards 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.770
 nocturnal 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.720
 obviously if you want to add also the 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.159
 mermaid can also and there appear 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.230
 who was the one who received the weapon and 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:39.439
 just turned off the light in shape 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.840
 automatic you can also program the 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:43.909
 chicharra activation time with a 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.220
 timer or also programmed by software 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.319
 of the team the team that is 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.209
 option which here understands that it ends 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.060
 receive a call from this case the 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.810
 just issued me and it stays in this 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.940
 option also the portable equipment what 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.540
 let's do now we're going to light 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.540
 why 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:08.270
 four radio equipment that simulate 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:10.280
 different companies and we go 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.650
 now again we are going to make a 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.160
 alert activation to the fourth 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.770
 company 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.470
 then active now for the fourth 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:24.080
 company 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:25.460
 spears a warning tone by mc 1200 the 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.230
 what now that they can see fourth 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.890
 team mate 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.409
 and the firefighter team just received a 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.890
 alert in this case the programming of 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:38.810
 pp 110 remained in manual therefore there 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.410
 that respect 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.210
 something we will receive 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.770
 and now we're going to do activation for the 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.370
 third for you to see comfortably 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.500
 how to activate planet with fall of 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.510
 cicada in the room that stimulates it 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.610
 obviously in this video are the 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.620
 green 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.230
 you can see that it activates the 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.800
 light and we choose laptop that says third 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.680
 it was also activated 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.590
 what team 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.920
 there is activating the rest of the 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.340
 None of the equipment has been activated 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.780
 there are really centuries and the 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.580
 time as I say the program is worth 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.120
 also by a timer or by the software 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.250
 of the radio equipment 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.520
 let's go one 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.320
 in direct activation for another 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.900
 unit we are going to do an activation of 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.330
 alert for 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:33.680
 the fifth company that means that 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:36.310
 is to activate only the 7 300 to be 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.310
 here I have tomorrow 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.630
 to itv from here to the state now the fifth 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.270
 company had previously been the 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.920
 third and also the central one has the 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:51.540
 option to be able to alert different 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:55.050
 companies all at the same time finished 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:57.410
 and now we're going to an alert estimate 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.410
 for 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.600
 the whole body of a veil 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.689
 and there we are going to go the letter and you to 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.389
 watch 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:10.119
 Exactly so would my team be 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.979
 concentrated the third quarter team 

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:13.899
 here we also have a team of 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:17.679
 the third water was activated 

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:19.689
 in the fifth and also a team for the 

00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:21.459
 sixth company that simulates in these 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:23.409
 four laptops that is natural in the 

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:26.669
 which is warning you that the central 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:26.669
 general warning 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.450
 so it can be a general sale 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.320
 warned for example of a warning of 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:37.660
 tsunami an earthquake warning 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.150
 fire preventive barracks 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.850
 interface depending on the needs that 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.430
 have each fireman's body can be 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.900
 assign this as you watch the circuit 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.120
 everyone would like to see the little box there 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.600
 can see how is a circuit activated 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.090
 relay pair of a button and the 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.670
 circuit that makes arrive from the card 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.870
 rear of ration equipment in this 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.050
 we are doing it in a way 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.090
 manual but 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.849
 in the second video we are going to show it 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.740
 with software in which it does the same 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:11.389
 also by activation prevention 1200 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.389
 but it comes out by software
