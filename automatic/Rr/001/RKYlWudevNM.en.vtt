lights is the original Eno lights are
just<00:00:11.250> white<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.880> these<00:00:12.090> cycle<00:00:12.540> through<00:00:12.719> the

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
just white and these cycle through the

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.539 
just white and these cycle through the
colors<00:00:13.170> you<00:00:13.710> may<00:00:13.860> have<00:00:14.009> seen<00:00:14.190> our<00:00:14.370> other

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
so it's the exact same packaging as the

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.330 
so it's the exact same packaging as the
other<00:00:23.519> lights<00:00:23.910> great<00:00:24.869> carrying<00:00:25.410> case<00:00:25.500> for<00:00:26.099> it

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
other lights great carrying case for it

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.490 
other lights great carrying case for it
you<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:27.090> tell<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.570> difference<00:00:27.930> between<00:00:28.349> the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
you can tell the difference between the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.140 
you can tell the difference between the
other<00:00:28.529> lights<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.250> one<00:00:29.460> by<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.699> rainbow

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150

which light is which and you open it up
has<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.100> same<00:00:41.399> great<00:00:42.059> 23<00:00:42.960> LED<00:00:43.530> lights<00:00:44.180> same

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
has the same great 23 LED lights same

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.630 
has the same great 23 LED lights same
output<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.410> runtime<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:46.860> these<00:00:47.160> are<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> same

72<00:00:48.329> hours<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.739> difference<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.250> batteries<00:00:50.760> on

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
72 hours the difference in batteries on

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.660 
72 hours the difference in batteries on
this<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.390> these<00:00:52.050> lights<00:00:52.379> require<00:00:53.129> three

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
this is these lights require three

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.720 
this is these lights require three
double<00:00:54.090> A<00:00:54.210> batteries<00:00:54.350> where<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:56.039> other<00:00:56.399> set

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
double A batteries where the other set

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.810 
double A batteries where the other set
of<00:00:56.760> Eno<00:00:57.270> lights<00:00:57.510> just<00:00:57.930> has<00:00:58.140> two<00:00:58.920> double-a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
of Eno lights just has two double-a

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.540 
of Eno lights just has two double-a
batteries<00:01:00.300> has<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.020> same<00:01:01.289> great<00:01:01.649> case<00:01:02.039> easy

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
batteries has the same great case easy

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.299 
batteries has the same great case easy
to<00:01:03.390> get<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.750> off<00:01:04.140> just<00:01:04.680> slide<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.040> closed

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
to get on and off just slide it closed

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.460 
to get on and off just slide it closed
it<00:01:06.000> does<00:01:06.240> have<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.689> on/off<00:01:07.110> switch<00:01:07.439> right

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
it does have the on/off switch right

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.580 
it does have the on/off switch right
here<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.909> we're<00:01:09.270> gonna<00:01:09.360> flip<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.530> can

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
here so we're gonna flip that on you can

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.190 
here so we're gonna flip that on you can
see<00:01:10.890> it'll<00:01:11.100> start<00:01:11.130> cycling<00:01:11.909> through<00:01:12.150> here<00:01:12.570> one

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
see it'll start cycling through here one

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.770 
see it'll start cycling through here one
option<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.830> noticed<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.460> these<00:01:15.090> lights<00:01:15.420> don't

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
option I noticed that these lights don't

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.590 
option I noticed that these lights don't
have<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.530> doesn't<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.369> option<00:01:17.850> to

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
have is it doesn't have the option to

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.560 
have is it doesn't have the option to
keep<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> certain<00:01:20.460> light<00:01:20.759> color<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.240> if

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
keep it on a certain light color so if

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.109

you liked blue or red you don't have the
option<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.600> keep<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.200> there<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:25.680> just

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
option to keep it on there it's just

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.920 
option to keep it on there it's just
gonna<00:01:26.040> continuously<00:01:26.820> cycle<00:01:27.119> through<00:01:27.659> all<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
gonna continuously cycle through all the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.480 
gonna continuously cycle through all the
different<00:01:28.340> LED<00:01:29.340> colored<00:01:29.939> options<00:01:30.890> so<00:01:31.890> now

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
different LED colored options so now

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.310 
different LED colored options so now
we're<00:01:32.670> gonna<00:01:32.759> head<00:01:33.000> outside<00:01:33.150> I'm<00:01:33.930> gonna<00:01:34.079> put

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
we're gonna head outside I'm gonna put

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.149 
we're gonna head outside I'm gonna put
these<00:01:34.530> up<00:01:34.920> next<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.329> original<00:01:36.650> Ino<00:01:37.650> white

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
these up next to the original Ino white

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.370 
these up next to the original Ino white
lights<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:39.270> we<00:01:39.299> can<00:01:39.420> do<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> side-by-side

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
lights so we can do a side-by-side

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.130 
lights so we can do a side-by-side
comparison<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.700> see<00:01:42.119> all<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.630> different

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
comparison and see all the different

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.200 
comparison and see all the different
color<00:01:43.320> options<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.890> these<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.729> okay<00:01:45.149> so

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
color options that these have okay so

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.359 
color options that these have okay so
