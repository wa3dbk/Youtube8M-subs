really you could do that but it'll take

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.120 
really you could do that but it'll take
a<00:01:21.630> lot<00:01:21.899> of<00:01:21.960> time<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.409> everything<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.830> do<00:01:22.950> to

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
quality as well so it's basically copy a

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.490 
quality as well so it's basically copy a
coconut<00:01:50.520> hold<00:01:50.789> it<00:01:50.909> both<00:01:51.060> hands<00:01:51.300> like<00:01:51.479> son<00:01:51.690> take

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
coconut hold it both hands like son take

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:04.820 
coconut hold it both hands like son take
a<00:01:52.590> corner<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:56.360> peel<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.390> off<00:01:58.020> like<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.830> if

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
a corner and peel it off like so and if

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.630 
a corner and peel it off like so and if
you<00:02:04.920> went<00:02:05.039> away

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
you went away

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.999 
you went away
don't<00:02:06.270> try<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.479> away<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:07.140> really<00:02:07.860> good

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
don't try this away this really good

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.380 
don't try this away this really good

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
therefore a lot of how far along I know

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.380 
therefore a lot of how far along I know
I<00:02:11.970> just<00:02:12.180> worked<00:02:12.500> around<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.650> nut<00:02:14.150> on<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.329> end

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
I just worked around the nut on the end

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.789 
I just worked around the nut on the end
and<00:02:15.780> you're<00:02:15.930> taking<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:18.620> feel<00:02:21.799> successive

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
and you're taking the feel successive

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.650 
and you're taking the feel successive
parts<00:02:23.100> of<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.310> husk<00:02:23.519> up<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.850> find<00:02:24.090> them

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.460

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
mistake into this part where we've now

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.850 
mistake into this part where we've now
got<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.280> gap<00:02:35.550> here<00:02:36.260> put<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.350> stake<00:02:37.620> into<00:02:37.800> the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
got a gap here put the stake into the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.130 
got a gap here put the stake into the
soft<00:02:38.190> part<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:38.970> husk<00:02:39.180> bed<00:02:39.390> and

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
soft part of the of the husk bed and

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.990 
soft part of the of the husk bed and
really<00:02:40.500> drive<00:02:40.740> it<00:02:40.890> down<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.460> takes<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.820> bit<00:02:41.970> of

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
really drive it down it takes a bit of

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.550 
really drive it down it takes a bit of
force<00:02:42.240> and<00:02:43.010> peeling<00:02:44.010> away<00:02:44.330> from<00:02:45.330> you<00:02:45.560> but

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
force and peeling away from you but

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.900 
force and peeling away from you but
you're<00:02:46.820> breaking<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:48.150> out<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.450> show<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.760> it's

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
you're breaking it out of show and it's

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.520 
you're breaking it out of show and it's
just<00:02:51.120> repeating<00:02:51.570> that<00:02:51.630> process<00:02:51.780> all<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.440> way

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
just repeating that process all the way

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:02.660 
just repeating that process all the way
around<00:02:52.770> now<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:59.340> kids<00:02:59.700> have<00:02:59.820> take<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.450> off<00:03:01.670> to

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
around now the kids have take it off to

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:31.990 
around now the kids have take it off to
bring<00:03:02.850> their<00:03:03.030> races<00:03:04.760> get<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:05.910> strung

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.180 

whatever<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.090> go<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:40.440> reason<00:03:40.650> he's<00:03:40.830> a<00:03:40.920> steak

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
whatever you go the reason he's a steak

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.400 
whatever you go the reason he's a steak
obviously<00:03:41.970> not<00:03:42.210> only<00:03:42.390> because<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:42.930> allows<00:03:43.170> to

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
obviously not only because it allows to

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.560 
obviously not only because it allows to
get<00:03:43.560> into<00:03:43.740> nut<00:03:44.060> there's<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.120> lot<00:03:45.330> more<00:03:45.510> energy

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
get into nut there's a lot more energy

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.830 
get into nut there's a lot more energy
efficient<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:48.090> don't<00:03:48.360> want<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.540> go<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.660> be

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
efficient you don't want to go to be

it slowly coconut juice is obviously a

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:08.410 
it slowly coconut juice is obviously a
great<00:04:03.620> source<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:06.260> electricity<00:04:07.260> electrolyte

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
water inside is sterile so we don't need

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.940 
water inside is sterile so we don't need
