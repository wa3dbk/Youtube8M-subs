terrible mistake at the end of his life

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.779 
terrible mistake at the end of his life
and<00:01:53.659> made<00:01:54.020> it<00:01:54.200> in<00:01:54.289> the<00:01:54.380> last<00:01:54.590> 10<00:01:54.979> years<00:01:55.009> and<00:01:55.579> I

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
and made it in the last 10 years and I

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.959 
and made it in the last 10 years and I
don't<00:01:56.659> know<00:01:56.840> why<00:01:57.079> he<00:01:57.259> did<00:01:57.469> we<00:01:57.649> just<00:01:57.979> he<00:01:58.399> may

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
don't know why he did we just he may

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:00.760 
don't know why he did we just he may
carry<00:01:59.240> that<00:01:59.450> with<00:01:59.689> him<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.020> I<00:02:00.380> do<00:02:00.439> I<00:02:00.649> think

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
carry that with him and I do I think

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.739 
carry that with him and I do I think
this<00:02:01.249> probably<00:02:03.939> escalated<00:02:04.939> his<00:02:04.969> demise<00:02:05.450> I

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749 
this probably escalated his demise I

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:07.510 
this probably escalated his demise I
think<00:02:05.990> clearly<00:02:06.259> it<00:02:06.439> did<00:02:06.649> I<00:02:06.679> think<00:02:06.889> to<00:02:07.310> deal

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
think clearly it did I think to deal

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.370 
think clearly it did I think to deal
with<00:02:07.789> the<00:02:07.939> stress<00:02:08.240> he<00:02:08.420> had<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.899> be<00:02:09.020> dealing

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.199 
with the stress he had to be dealing
with<00:02:09.410> think<00:02:10.190> about<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.490> fall<00:02:10.729> from<00:02:10.970> grace
