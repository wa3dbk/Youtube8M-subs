 to destination in this video we will see the 

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:09.210
 last patch that they have put the last 

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:11.429
 update regarding the damage of the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.769
 weapons to the damage that they have reduced in 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.080
 automatic rifles in the end we're going to 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.570
 see everything a little so we know 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.580
 now the damage that may have 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.670
 rifles these automatic shotguns 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.290
 they have also touched something the cannon of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.910
 finally hand all going to see everything 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.310
 this information is so taken out of the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.620
 Vung official website and so the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.790
 explained as I read it well the 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:38.070
 update 1.0 point 2.2 summary 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.650
 changes in the stability of weapons 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.600
 automatic rifle have reduced the damage 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.790
 and the scanners rifles damage has 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.590
 also increased corrections in the 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.060
 Templar area of the raid that what 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.870
 we will also see later everything with 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.410
 examples and others 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.780
 well in the classes the titan the skill 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.910
 unbreakable they have cut him agility in 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.190
 the planned and the sorcerer the skill 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.170
 sulfur can now be activated when the 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.479
 player is in the air let's see a 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.860
 example of the sorcerer's skill 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.360
 sulfur is this from here from the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.790
 melee attack kill a 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.890
 enemy with calcination is worth in the air 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.670
 because right now it could be activated before 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.970
 you could not activate guns worth guns 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.770
 automatic damage is reduced by 2% and 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.000
 reduces the damage of precision have the 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:28.929
 head of a 5 150 125 and the 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.620
 stability from 4% to 17% of the barrel 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:35.410
 hand you increase the accuracy in the air 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.210
 and this is going to see an example of the canyon 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.840
 hand in the air that if before it was 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.730
 precise then now more still weapons 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.160
 explorer's rifle damage is increased 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.280
 6% damage is increased against 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.750
 aliens from 6 percent to a 25 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.060
 according to the category of aliens that 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.280
 be and improvements of the acquisition of 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.500
 targets and additional rewind settings 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.560
 shotgun rifle is reduced 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.930
 20% maximum distance damage the 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.090
 tight benefit to the body now has 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.070
 a cone to shoot wider the 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.620
 Benefits tele meters and close to 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.630
 body now worth mutually exclusive 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.580
 let's see an example that in the 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.650
 Distant shotgun right now does not 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.330
 as much damage as before as we see here not 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.270
 it hurts a little closer even 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.830
 neither and without the change and yet 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.800
 when it is a little closer by the 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.640
 cone the peephole so much wider the 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.510
 shooting range 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.819
 good to the class success 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.000
 in the root the last one reduces the damage 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:44.400
 34% but the accuracy damage increased 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.800
 from a 25 from 1.25 to 1.50 and the infinity to 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.080
 portable the weapon in portable fixed 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.220
 the improved battery benefit is changed 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.140
 by fast recharge well benefits are 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.200
 have corrected an error that prevented 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.390
 this benefit would give additional ammunition 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.820
 and lightweight an error has been corrected 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.190
 that provided extra agility though 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.930
 the weapon was saved this I think that 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.420
 refers to let's see an example 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.120
 that the gun used to fire and even 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.470
 before the peephole put to the great 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.630
 runs ideal when the peephole is 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.370
 put when he starts to shoot me 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.420
 it seems that if what is preferred to that 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.920
 I think that's why the engrams are higher 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.980
 rewarded during an assault 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.230
 will appear in the summary screen 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.030
 final that did not appear before or now if 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.890
 they put it in the in the final summary 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.470
 one of the last ones also in the 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.360
 glass camera have been added have been 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.040
 Added pool platforms 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.930
 snipers let's see a 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.700
 example and the relics disappears and 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.590
 appears when the carrier goes outside 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.230
 from the play area 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.030
 in the area this Templar when the 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.739
 players were there at that 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.860
 platforms there will then make a 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.989
 counter goes back 4 3 2 1 and does not 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.000
 you can not put yourself there because you 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.280
 kill if the player with the relic leaves 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.319
 of the area that alone in that area 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.120
 the relic returns to its place and by 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.760
 last one is in one I understand but it is 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.160
 here destination the fallen have abandoned 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.290
 your position your position in the base of 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.739
 launch to plan a new 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.359
 offensive not be wait for them exactly 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.579
 but good as they have put it then I 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.959
 commented as I read it 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.729
 so nothing guys this has all been 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.220
 the changes that have gotten into the last 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.229
 update regarding weapons damage 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.580
 neither theme and a little bit I hope that you 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.530
 I liked that I helped you 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.690
