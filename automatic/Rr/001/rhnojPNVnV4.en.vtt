 Hello, I want to tell you how I am 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:19.580
 with my own hands I try to make a fireplace 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:27.170
 such a miracle I do myself the first time 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:30.269
 at first everything had to be without a pile 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:35.239
 wanted to make a fireplace just like 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:38.040
 decorative took out this one 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.260
 after which they learned that there are such 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.870
 fireboxes which can also be heated 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:50.820
 rooms me and there will be three plus here 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:56.280
 this stone is therefore already clean here 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:02.070
 tattoo cabinet did not want to put on top here 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:05.630
 here we will have to go air already 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.659
 winter was checked then the air goes 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:13.470
 over here and but around the firebox air 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:18.170
 heats up here everything will be protection here 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:21.689
 near the drywall profile parallel 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:26.000
 a warmed environment to drywall not 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:32.090
 damage aluminum sheet here 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.090
 because for the winter drywall rained down 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:44.880
 He goes there in the winter already tried very 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:47.960

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:04.950

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:47.660

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.660
