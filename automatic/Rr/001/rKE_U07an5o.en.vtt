00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 I would not say that our project is not so 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.570
 and right here itâ€™s not successful how many are there 4 4 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.969
 4 thousand views 4,000 views on the Yu tube 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.700
 our clip we have it seems to me 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.070
 very well with this start this 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.230
 it's not screwed up it's real real 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.300
 views people watch discuss something 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.240
 write even there are people who are worth 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.539
 thumbs up it nicely wanted her 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.730
 amazing of all but we did not expect 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.079
 about a reaction like that we will 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.880
 Thought to 30 views and finished 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.200
 it still seems to me that there 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.100
 viewing 30 and this is a mistake for me too 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.579
 it seems but there looked 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:52.320
 4000 with what a bunch of reviews on our video 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.570
 Any Internet parody programs should be 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.390
 say that is not very funny jokes to me 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.040
 did not like the review 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.950
 even from time to time we get on 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:07.590
 some comments but since we already 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:09.180
 such pop mastodons then we already have it 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.360
 does not hurt because of our 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.610
 long stage life together and not 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.000
 joint stage the same and not at all 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.950
 living together and teaching life that I don't 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.750
 not ready to subscribe to all that 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.229
 speaks three cherries in the core about 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.520
 mastodon let's answer ok 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:32.720
 wonderfully 3 met soon i 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.030
 I plan to conquer the world with my genius 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.860
 creativity because here's why 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.390
 this korean with gangnam style you 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:47.780
 get food this i won't get there 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.039
 there were inserts it was like catch yes here 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.990
 so I decided that I would conquer the world 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.509
 With our creativity, we still 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.960
 most people are so international 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.369
 the language is English 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.479
 so 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.270
 It's clear that the songs are sung in English 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.490
 just to cover a big 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.439
 the audience has such a psychological effect 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.470
 foreign speech always sounds 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.630
 more interesting and all they say is said on 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.790
 foreign language will be more 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.790
 original with 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:27.049
 what is the meaning of the song we have this 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.739
 actually the song we have is called 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.909
 cognitive dissonance i'm a songwriter and 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.310
 the cognitive dissonance 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:40.370
 they have songs we are not mine 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:44.239
 invention is not a long meaning 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.889
 discord in the complexity of understanding 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.049
 the world with which we 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:51.620
 we face every day these songs are about 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:54.680
 what's happening around us so much 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.379
 that we have a complete misunderstanding 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.849
 sheer confusion utter chaos and order 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:02.000
 least we still manage somehow 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:05.180
 enjoy life 3 is actually very 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.500
 strange that this song was so much 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.299
 incomprehensible perceived as 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.609
 somehow aggressive because it seems to me 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.230
 that each person is more so in 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.519
 adolescence was experiencing 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.180
 the cognitive dissonance 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.769
 and who would not like I do not know stand there 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.180
 just eat hollywood ice cream 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:26.479
 star there substituting what any name or 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.159
 there who did not get up at seven in the morning did not go 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:30.000
 to study in some kind of public 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.130
 transport and 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.490
 did not study as doomed therefore me 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.700
 it seems just the truth of the eyes is splitting and we 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.980
 this song so come to life 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.350
 modern teenagers they are on us very 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:55.770
 angry for what we showed them as 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:56.550
 they live there no image of freaks 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.040
 understand 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:03.540
 in this clip for example just the loan i 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:07.950
 This is essentially my four cups of new 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.410
 release but I don't think it was 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.810
 some kind of fick image i 'm actually 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.540
 Of course I understand that the combination of my nose 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.790
 points and this yellow jacket can 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.290
 cause about this situation but in 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.410
 In this case, I and on the first of September 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:25.470
 School went to the image of a freak I do not know 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.419
 would understand if we were mohawks 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:32.450
 happy love let you all be 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.450
 well what else to tell you 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:40.420
 live so that your life will be remembered 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.420
 his well and all around
