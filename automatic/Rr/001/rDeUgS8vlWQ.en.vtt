 welcome to the audible version and video 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.880
 of endodontic notes this resource 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.820
 audiovisual is a complement to the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.830
 Internet page that you consulted was 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.660
 prepared by doctor ricardo rivas

 muÃ±oz of the faculty of studies 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.599
 superior iztacala of the university

 national autonomy of mexico seventh 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.450
 thumb pathology unit the topic that I'm going 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.430
 to read is the diagnostic etiology and 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.540
 poule pitis treatment 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.450
 irreversible 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.280
 etiology the most common cause of the poule 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.800
 irreversible pitis is the invasion 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.170
 pulp by bacterial decay 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.290
 Although the other causes such as 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.840
 thermal or mechanical chemical also 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.060
 can give this consequence a pulpÃ­ 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.120
 reversible tis may deteriorate in 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.070
 irreversible symptoms in the states 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.770
 first of the poule irreversible pitis 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.320
 a painful paroxysm can be caused 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.780
 by some stimulus the pain usually 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.240
 continues even when the cause is removed 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.560
 and it can appear spontaneously without 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.690
 Apparent cause 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.210
 the patient describes the pain as acute 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.630
 penetrating or stabbing and usually 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.670
 Severe can be intermittent or continuous 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.320
 the change of position can increase the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.509
 pain from changes in pressure 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.330
 intraocular pain may be reported 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.540
 referred in more advanced stages the 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.009
 pain can be throbbing rogent e 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.800
 bothersome or with the tooth constantly 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.259
 pressure if there is no communication blame 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.180
 the pain can be very intense the 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.130
 patient can not sleep at night 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.690
 with pain without giving in to analgesics 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.300
 common 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.670
 it is increased by the heat and sometimes it gives 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.310
 with cold although the constant cold 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.650
 apical periodontitis also increases 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.650
 is absent except in late stages 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.440
 when the inflammation of infection is 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.690
 extends to the periodontal ligament 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.090
 diagnosis to the inspection usually 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.610
 there is a communicating deep cavity 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.860
 with flesh or a lesion carios down a 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.770
 restoration when examining the communication 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.810
 you see a kind of grayish crust 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.690
 on the exposed pulp and dentin 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.510
 surrounding this layer is composed of 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.390
 polymorph leukocytes food waste 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.370
 nuclear degenerate microorganisms and 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.340
 blood cells the stench of 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.590
 decomposition is frequent in this area 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.810
 the probing of this area is not painful 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.570
 until it reaches deeper areas 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.940
 to the radiography you can show a 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.340
 penetrating cavity or restoration very 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.350
 deep to the thermal tests it 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.450
 causes pain that persists at a 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.520
 removal of the stimulus the test 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.620
 electrical induces an answer with a 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.470
 marked variation with respect to 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.740
 homologous mobility tests 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.320
 and palpation are negative diagnostic 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.240
 differential is necessary to distinguish 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.550
 of poule pitis reversible la 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.710
 abnormally painful response to heat 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.930
 indicates advanced periods of 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.030
 irreversibility and can simulate the 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.790
 symptoms of an acute alveolar abscess 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.910
 without having its other characteristics like 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.970
 they would be inflammation facial sensitivity to 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.190
 the palpation and percussion and so on 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.380
 principle the patient identifies 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.470
 easily the causative tooth but to 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.600
 As it progresses it becomes more difficult 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.180
 recognize it treatment the pec take a 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.250
 total or emergency pulpotomies in the 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.560
 case of molars for later 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.709
 finish the total removal of the pulp 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.959
 unfavorable prognosis for the pulp and 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.000
 favorable for the tooth if the pulp is 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.670
 Removed and the tooth continues treatment 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.340
 endodontic and restoration 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.780
 this is all for now to see the 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.800
 illustrations on the subject and the 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.770
