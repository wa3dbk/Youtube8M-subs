00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
that is basically because I just felt

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.000 
that is basically because I just felt
like<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.480> knew<00:00:45.690> my<00:00:45.930> hair<00:00:46.140> could<00:00:46.260> do<00:00:46.410> much<00:00:46.680> better

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
like I knew my hair could do much better

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.250 
like I knew my hair could do much better
than<00:00:47.100> what<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.430> was<00:00:47.640> doing<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:48.899> need

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
than what it was doing and I just need

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.860 
than what it was doing and I just need
something<00:00:49.559> more<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.520> penetrate<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.600> get

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.730 
look pretty good so you know I'm
thinking<00:01:57.700> that<00:01:57.730> what<00:01:58.600> shea<00:01:58.870> butter<00:01:59.140> has<00:01:59.500> like

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
thinking that what shea butter has like

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.940 
thinking that what shea butter has like
some<00:01:59.920> kind<00:02:00.160> of<00:02:00.220> humidity<00:02:00.900> resistance<00:02:01.900> to<00:02:02.770> it

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
some kind of humidity resistance to it

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.040 
some kind of humidity resistance to it
because<00:02:03.250> usually<00:02:03.730> I<00:02:03.940> when<00:02:04.240> I<00:02:04.270> would<00:02:04.630> work<00:02:04.810> out

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
because usually I when I would work out

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.690 
because usually I when I would work out
I<00:02:05.080> would<00:02:05.350> have<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:05.710> like<00:02:05.890> twist<00:02:06.160> up<00:02:06.340> my<00:02:06.370> hair

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
I would have to like twist up my hair

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.910 
I would have to like twist up my hair
later<00:02:06.910> on<00:02:07.120> that<00:02:07.300> night<00:02:07.330> and<00:02:07.810> I<00:02:08.440> mean<00:02:08.619> who<00:02:08.770> wants

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
later on that night and I mean who wants

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.570 
later on that night and I mean who wants
to<00:02:09.100> really<00:02:09.369> do<00:02:09.580> that<00:02:09.790> so<00:02:10.420> anyway<00:02:11.310> as<00:02:12.310> I<00:02:12.550> was

to really do that so anyway as I was

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.130 
to really do that so anyway as I was
saying<00:02:12.760> um<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.970> doesn't<00:02:16.240> have<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.570> greasy

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
saying um it doesn't have a greasy

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.130 
saying um it doesn't have a greasy
residue<00:02:17.350> I<00:02:18.100> don't<00:02:18.370> have<00:02:18.520> to<00:02:18.670> use<00:02:18.900> sulfates<00:02:19.900> to

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140

I<00:03:43.000> know<00:03:43.570> this<00:03:43.840> is<00:03:43.960> a<00:03:44.020> debate<00:03:44.380> about<00:03:44.650> unrefined

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
I know this is a debate about unrefined

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.480 
I know this is a debate about unrefined
and<00:03:46.060> refined<00:03:46.630> shea<00:03:46.990> butter<00:03:47.320> and<00:03:47.710> how<00:03:48.130> to<00:03:48.190> tell

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
and refined shea butter and how to tell

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.640 
and refined shea butter and how to tell
the<00:03:48.580> difference<00:03:48.610> and<00:03:50.490> there<00:03:51.490> I<00:03:52.090> think<00:03:52.780> I

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
the difference and there I think I

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.790 
the difference and there I think I
refined<00:03:54.310> shared<00:03:54.640> letter<00:03:54.910> they<00:03:55.150> say<00:03:55.360> that<00:03:55.600> is

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
refined shared letter they say that is

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.830 
refined shared letter they say that is
anywhere<00:03:56.800> between<00:03:56.860> yellow<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:57.810> like<00:03:58.810> a

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
anywhere between yellow and like a

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.170 
anywhere between yellow and like a
creamy<00:03:59.080> color<00:03:59.530> like<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.520> color<00:04:00.730> varies

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
creamy color like the color varies

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.590 
creamy color like the color varies
depending<00:04:01.750> on<00:04:01.900> where<00:04:03.120> what<00:04:04.120> part<00:04:04.360> of<00:04:04.420> Africa

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
depending on where what part of Africa

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.770 
depending on where what part of Africa

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
tell the difference between the two is

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.660 
tell the difference between the two is
go<00:04:25.420> by<00:04:25.600> your<00:04:25.840> smell<00:04:26.200> if<00:04:26.560> it<00:04:26.890> doesn't<00:04:27.190> have<00:04:27.370> like

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670

I got nutty smell to it

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.610 
I got nutty smell to it
then<00:04:30.670> you<00:04:31.240> don't<00:04:31.360> have<00:04:31.510> refine<00:04:32.260> you<00:04:32.440> don't

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
then you don't have refine you don't

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.260 
then you don't have refine you don't
have<00:04:32.770> refined<00:04:33.280> shea<00:04:33.580> butter<00:04:33.820> you<00:04:34.000> have

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
have refined shea butter you have

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.480 
have refined shea butter you have
something<00:04:34.780> that's<00:04:34.960> been<00:04:35.230> refined<00:04:35.740> basically

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
something that's been refined basically

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.780 
something that's been refined basically
and<00:04:36.760> that's<00:04:37.720> not<00:04:37.900> good<00:04:38.140> because<00:04:38.410> it's<00:04:39.100> lacking

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
and that's not good because it's lacking

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.190 
and that's not good because it's lacking
the<00:04:39.940> nutrients<00:04:40.419> that<00:04:40.450> you<00:04:40.660> need<00:04:40.690> for<00:04:41.110> your

the nutrients that you need for your
hair<00:04:41.560> like<00:04:42.520> dividing<00:04:43.030> either<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:44.470> vitamin<00:04:45.010> E

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
hair like dividing either the vitamin E

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.770 
hair like dividing either the vitamin E
the<00:04:45.370> vitamin<00:04:45.790> a<00:04:46.000> divided<00:04:46.870> an<00:04:46.960> F<00:04:47.140> and<00:04:48.720> so<00:04:49.720> you

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
the vitamin a divided an F and so you

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.720 
the vitamin a divided an F and so you
need<00:04:50.080> those<00:04:50.260> in<00:04:50.560> order<00:04:50.770> for<00:04:51.040> it<00:04:51.100> to<00:04:51.130> work<00:04:51.220> and

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
need those in order for it to work and

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.390 
need those in order for it to work and
