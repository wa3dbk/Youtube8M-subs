00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:47.879 
bring miss past and then we'll c MZ they
get<00:01:46.419> out<00:01:46.569> then<00:01:46.929> next<00:01:47.109> you<00:01:47.289> know<00:01:47.409> there's<00:01:47.560> a<00:01:47.649> 12

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:47.889 
get out then next you know there's a 12

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:49.620 
get out then next you know there's a 12
foot<00:01:48.009> python<00:01:48.429> running<00:01:48.669> around<00:01:48.909> and<00:01:49.119> then<00:01:49.479> they

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
foot python running around and then they

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.330 
foot python running around and then they
mate<00:01:49.869> and<00:01:50.139> then<00:01:50.319> you<00:01:50.439> got<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.590> lot<00:01:50.799> of<00:01:50.829> pythons

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
mate and then you got a lot of pythons

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.429 
mate and then you got a lot of pythons
running<00:01:51.700> around<00:01:51.909> right<00:01:52.149> and<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:53.020> can't<00:01:53.349> imagine

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
running around right and I can't imagine

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.339 
running around right and I can't imagine
anything<00:01:53.859> more<00:01:54.099> disastrous<00:01:54.639> uh<00:01:54.909> I'm<00:01:55.659> so<00:01:56.049> angry

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:56.349 
anything more disastrous uh I'm so angry

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:59.819 
anything more disastrous uh I'm so angry
the<00:01:57.039> girl<00:01:57.219> died<00:01:57.459> the<00:01:57.729> people<00:01:58.060> died<00:01:58.469> okay<00:01:59.469> by

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
the girl died the people died okay by

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.769 
the girl died the people died okay by
the<00:01:59.889> way<00:02:00.159> the<00:02:00.520> Python<00:02:00.939> it<00:02:01.119> bit<00:02:01.389> the<00:02:01.539> little

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:01.779 
the way the Python it bit the little

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:04.260 
the way the Python it bit the little
girl<00:02:01.989> in<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:02.499> head<00:02:02.649> first<00:02:03.009> off<00:02:03.579> and<00:02:03.969> then

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
girl in the head first off and then

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.690 
girl in the head first off and then
wrapped<00:02:05.020> itself<00:02:05.349> around<00:02:05.529> the<00:02:05.889> child<00:02:06.189> and

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
wrapped itself around the child and

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.540 
wrapped itself around the child and
crush<00:02:07.179> uh<00:02:07.929> and<00:02:08.410> then<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:08.830> guy<00:02:09.009> comes<00:02:09.340> out<00:02:09.489> and

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
crush uh and then the guy comes out and

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.490 
crush uh and then the guy comes out and
when<00:02:09.940> you<00:02:09.970> realize<00:02:10.270> that<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:10.989> owner<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.409> he

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
when you realize that the owner and he

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.229 
when you realize that the owner and he
stabs<00:02:11.799> it<00:02:12.099> but<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.760> doesn't<00:02:13.030> even<00:02:13.090> really

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
stabs it but that doesn't even really

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.240 
stabs it but that doesn't even really
quite<00:02:13.540> working<00:02:13.930> apparently<00:02:14.590> just<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:15.189> you

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
quite working apparently just so you

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.180 
quite working apparently just so you
know<00:02:15.519> now<00:02:15.909> you

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
know now you

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.280 
know now you
no<00:02:16.280> we're<00:02:17.180> always<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.690> know<00:02:17.780> helping<00:02:18.080> out<00:02:18.200> the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
no we're always you know helping out the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.830 
no we're always you know helping out the
public<00:02:18.620> here<00:02:18.830> uh<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.640> way<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.820> get<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.420> Python

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
public here uh the way to get a Python

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.140 
public here uh the way to get a Python
off<00:02:21.080> a<00:02:21.140> person<00:02:21.710> apparently<00:02:21.980> it's<00:02:22.430> either<00:02:22.760> pour

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
off a person apparently it's either pour

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.780 
off a person apparently it's either pour
alcohol<00:02:23.570> in<00:02:24.140> his<00:02:24.230> mouth<00:02:24.470> who<00:02:25.460> knew<00:02:25.670> they

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
alcohol in his mouth who knew they

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.940 
alcohol in his mouth who knew they
didn't<00:02:26.030> like<00:02:26.210> it<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:26.660> grab<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.870> JD<00:02:27.410> hey<00:02:27.770> you

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
didn't like it so grab the JD hey you

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.540 
didn't like it so grab the JD hey you
know<00:02:28.100> uh<00:02:28.760> and/or<00:02:29.720> pour<00:02:30.560> hot<00:02:30.740> water<00:02:30.980> on<00:02:31.130> pour

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
know uh and/or pour hot water on pour

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.890 
know uh and/or pour hot water on pour
hot<00:02:31.730> water<00:02:31.940> on<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.240> but<00:02:32.360> then<00:02:32.450> you're<00:02:32.660> pouring

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
hot water on it but then you're pouring

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.360 
hot water on it but then you're pouring
hot<00:02:33.050> water<00:02:33.080> on<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.530> Python<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:34.100> probably

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
hot water on the Python you probably

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.820 
hot water on the Python you probably
pour<00:02:34.580> hot<00:02:34.790> water<00:02:34.970> on<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.360> person<00:02:35.900> too<00:02:36.080> so<00:02:36.350> I'd

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
pour hot water on the person too so I'd

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.210 
pour hot water on the person too so I'd
go<00:02:37.010> with<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.220> JD<00:02:37.600> ok<00:02:38.600> but<00:02:39.050> that's<00:02:39.680> messed<00:02:40.040> up

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
go with the JD ok but that's messed up

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.140 
go with the JD ok but that's messed up
man<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.980> here's<00:02:42.980> what<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.250> will<00:02:43.520> not<00:02:43.730> have

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
man and I here's what I will not have

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.810 
man and I here's what I will not have

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
and if he says it at the trial I'd be

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.210 
and if he says it at the trial I'd be
like<00:02:46.970> no<00:02:47.120> that's<00:02:47.240> it<00:02:47.450> you're<00:02:47.600> done<00:02:47.630> man

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
boa constrictor or my Python would get

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.570 
boa constrictor or my Python would get
out<00:03:03.320> and<00:03:03.350> crush<00:03:03.680> my<00:03:03.860> daughter<00:03:04.100> I<00:03:04.280> mean<00:03:04.490> the
