00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
this device and the screen is lovely and

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.509 
this device and the screen is lovely and
big<00:00:25.849> ideal<00:00:26.849> for<00:00:27.180> gaming<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.250> let's<00:00:29.250> check<00:00:29.400> out

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
big ideal for gaming so let's check out

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:38.869 
big ideal for gaming so let's check out
how<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.970> performance<00:00:36.320> as<00:00:37.550> you<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.730> see

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
how is the performance as you can see

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.030 
how is the performance as you can see
the<00:00:39.090> text<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.690> pixelated

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
the text is pixelated

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.840 
the text is pixelated
and<00:00:41.329> it<00:00:42.329> suggests<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.170> might<00:00:44.100> be<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
and it suggests that might be the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.010 
and it suggests that might be the
graphics<00:00:45.420> are<00:00:46.250> not<00:00:47.250> top-notch<00:00:47.750> although<00:00:48.750> I

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
graphics are not top-notch although I

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.069 
graphics are not top-notch although I
have<00:00:49.230> put<00:00:49.739> everything<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.280> max<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:51.329> some<00:00:51.930> of

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
have put everything on max but some of

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.290 
have put everything on max but some of
the<00:00:52.260> graphics<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.719> still<00:00:54.719> jagged<00:00:55.500> edges<00:00:56.300> but

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
the graphics have still jagged edges but

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.000 
the graphics have still jagged edges but
mostly<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.410> looks<00:00:58.739> ok<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.350> you<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.530> see<00:01:01.710> over

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
mostly it looks ok and you can see over

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.090 
mostly it looks ok and you can see over
here<00:01:02.039> there<00:01:02.760> are<00:01:02.940> some<00:01:03.180> graphics<00:01:04.049> glitches<00:01:04.920> as

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
here there are some graphics glitches as

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.600 
here there are some graphics glitches as
well<00:01:05.390> but<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.600> does<00:01:06.780> not<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.049> show<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.619> often

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
well but it does not I show that often

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.200 
well but it does not I show that often
but<00:01:08.820> every<00:01:09.390> now<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.560> then<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:11.340> does<00:01:11.610> come<00:01:12.180> up

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
but every now and then it does come up

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.100

have seen some of the text in the

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.640 
have seen some of the text in the
beginning<00:04:46.650> also<00:04:47.000> that<00:04:48.000> it<00:04:48.810> was<00:04:48.870> not<00:04:49.380> high

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
beginning also that it was not high

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.520 
beginning also that it was not high
resolution<00:04:50.370> and<00:04:51.050> although<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.320> game<00:04:52.500> is

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
resolution and although the game is

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.670 
resolution and although the game is
capped<00:04:52.950> at<00:04:53.220> 30<00:04:53.250> frames<00:04:53.880> per<00:04:54.240> second<00:04:54.660> but<00:04:55.410> I

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
capped at 30 frames per second but I

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.100 
capped at 30 frames per second but I
don't<00:04:56.070> think<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.730> game<00:04:56.940> is<00:04:56.970> running<00:04:57.270> 30

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
don't think the game is running 30

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.130 
don't think the game is running 30
frames<00:04:58.500> all<00:04:58.740> the<00:04:58.860> time<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.400> at<00:05:00.240> times<00:05:00.510> it<00:05:00.750> does

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
frames all the time and at times it does

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.160 
frames all the time and at times it does
drop<00:05:01.770> down<00:05:02.040> a<00:05:02.070> little<00:05:02.280> maybe<00:05:03.270> high<00:05:03.690> twenties

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
drop down a little maybe high twenties

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.880 
drop down a little maybe high twenties
like<00:05:04.500> 25<00:05:05.010> 26<00:05:05.220> somewhere<00:05:06.030> around<00:05:06.180> that<00:05:06.570> region

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
like 25 26 somewhere around that region

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.340 
like 25 26 somewhere around that region
still<00:05:07.890> pretty<00:05:08.370> much<00:05:08.490> playable<00:05:08.970> but<00:05:09.810> if<00:05:10.170> you

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
still pretty much playable but if you

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.130 
still pretty much playable but if you
want<00:05:10.680> a<00:05:10.890> perfect<00:05:11.190> gaming<00:05:11.910> experience<00:05:12.450> then

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
want a perfect gaming experience then

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.120 
want a perfect gaming experience then
you<00:05:13.170> might<00:05:13.590> feel<00:05:14.100> little<00:05:14.340> bit<00:05:15.560> let<00:05:16.560> down<00:05:16.590> by

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
you might feel little bit let down by

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.970 
you might feel little bit let down by
the<00:05:17.190> performance<00:05:18.150> having<00:05:18.990> said<00:05:19.470> that<00:05:19.500> this

the performance having said that this

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.810 
the performance having said that this

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
might be an issue with the optimization

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.750 
might be an issue with the optimization
but<00:05:23.820> since<00:05:24.300> the<00:05:24.630> Samsung<00:05:25.140> Galaxy<00:05:25.230> s6<00:05:26.070> edge<00:05:26.400> and

are<00:06:56.570> a<00:06:56.860> few<00:06:57.860> framedrops<00:06:58.220> so<00:06:59.060> as<00:06:59.360> I<00:06:59.570> said

00:06:59.740 --> 00:06:59.750 
are a few framedrops so as I said

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.550 
are a few framedrops so as I said
earlier<00:07:00.110> that<00:07:00.699> the<00:07:01.699> game<00:07:01.910> does<00:07:02.270> not<00:07:02.300> run<00:07:02.720> at<00:07:03.229> 30

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:03.560 
earlier that the game does not run at 30

pretty<00:07:06.440> well<00:07:06.560> and<00:07:07.010> pretty<00:07:07.639> much<00:07:07.850> playable<00:07:08.650> but

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.650 
pretty well and pretty much playable but

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.969 
pretty well and pretty much playable but
at<00:07:10.250> times<00:07:10.520> I<00:07:11.090> can<00:07:11.870> witness<00:07:12.320> few<00:07:12.560> framedrops

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:12.979 
at times I can witness few framedrops

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:15.490 
at times I can witness few framedrops
but<00:07:13.760> overall<00:07:14.060> the<00:07:14.360> experience<00:07:14.479> is<00:07:14.990> not<00:07:15.020> all

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500 
but overall the experience is not all

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.860 
but overall the experience is not all
that<00:07:15.560> bad<00:07:15.970> but<00:07:16.970> it<00:07:17.270> is<00:07:17.300> little<00:07:17.690> bit

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:17.870 
that bad but it is little bit

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.610 
that bad but it is little bit
