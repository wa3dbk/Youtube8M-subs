00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
how Halicarnassus since they have a

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.090 
how Halicarnassus since they have a
world<00:00:18.150> wonder<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.750> they're<00:00:19.410> just<00:00:19.560> rebel<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.070> I

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
world wonder and they're just rebel so I

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.790 
world wonder and they're just rebel so I
won't<00:00:20.279> be<00:00:20.369> at<00:00:20.460> war<00:00:20.609> with<00:00:20.640> anyone<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.769> don't

think<00:00:23.039> that's<00:00:23.100> Seleucids<00:00:23.939> really<00:00:24.330> try<00:00:24.600> to

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
think that's Seleucids really try to

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.900 
think that's Seleucids really try to
conquer<00:00:24.960> about<00:00:26.029> what<00:00:27.029> does<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.210> give<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.449> oh

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
conquer about what does this give you oh

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.970 
conquer about what does this give you oh
that's<00:00:29.910> good<00:00:30.119> but<00:00:30.929> that's<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.710> were<00:00:31.830> useful

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
that's good but that's that were useful

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.410 
that's good but that's that were useful
in<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.460> later<00:00:32.700> game<00:00:33.200> and<00:00:34.730> oh<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.880> forgot<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.210> use
