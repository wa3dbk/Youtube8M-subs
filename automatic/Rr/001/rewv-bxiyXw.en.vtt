it's called a hyper chroma what the dogs
do<00:00:31.170> usually<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.800> they<00:00:32.009> they<00:00:32.820> hit<00:00:33.090> their<00:00:33.270> elbow

I'm<00:00:42.629> going<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.170> lead<00:00:43.379> now<00:00:43.590> because<00:00:44.989> I'm<00:00:45.989> done

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
I'm going to lead now because I'm done

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.369 
I'm going to lead now because I'm done
with<00:00:46.379> my<00:00:46.680> exam<00:00:47.600> so<00:00:48.600> we're<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.989> clean<00:00:49.260> it

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
with my exam so we're going to clean it

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.850 
with my exam so we're going to clean it
up<00:00:49.469> with<00:00:49.530> alcohol<00:00:50.809> it's<00:00:51.809> shaved<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.620> that

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
up with alcohol it's shaved and that

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.560 
up with alcohol it's shaved and that
will<00:00:53.039> allow<00:00:53.280> us<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.640> put<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> needle<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.420> and

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
will allow us to put a needle in it and

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.170 
will allow us to put a needle in it and
you<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.559> feel<00:00:55.680> it's<00:00:55.860> very<00:00:55.920> fluctuate<00:00:56.879> very

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
you can feel it's very fluctuate very

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.080 
you can feel it's very fluctuate very
soft<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:59.010> pretty<00:00:59.430> fresh

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
soft so it's pretty fresh

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.070 
soft so it's pretty fresh
usually<00:01:00.719> abscesses<00:01:01.469> are<00:01:01.739> much<00:01:01.920> harder<00:01:02.309> and

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.510 

this<00:01:07.080> fluids<00:01:07.500> are<00:01:07.619> little<00:01:07.860> cloudy<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.340> we're

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
this fluids are little cloudy so we're

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.399 
this fluids are little cloudy so we're
going<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.670> look<00:01:08.790> for<00:01:09.090> white<00:01:09.659> blood<00:01:09.869> cells<00:01:10.170> in

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
going to look for white blood cells in

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.690 
going to look for white blood cells in
it<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:12.350> see<00:01:13.350> if<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.680> an<00:01:13.799> abscess<00:01:14.220> or<00:01:14.490> if<00:01:14.580> it's

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
it and see if it's an abscess or if it's

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.800 
it and see if it's an abscess or if it's
just<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.090> seroma<00:01:15.860> in<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.130> side<00:01:17.430> you'll<00:01:17.820> if<00:01:18.479> you

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
just a seroma in the side you'll if you

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.679 
just a seroma in the side you'll if you
look<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.350> see<00:01:19.409> there's<00:01:19.770> some<00:01:20.220> faint

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
look you can see there's some faint

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.499 
look you can see there's some faint
reddish<00:01:21.689> types<00:01:22.080> discs<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.970> they're<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.330> red

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
reddish types discs and they're the red

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.679 
reddish types discs and they're the red
blood<00:01:24.750> cells<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.350> then<00:01:25.500> you'll<00:01:25.710> see<00:01:26.070> bigger

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
blood cells and then you'll see bigger

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.300 
blood cells and then you'll see bigger
cells<00:01:27.689> with<00:01:27.990> purplish<00:01:28.560> kind<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.040> curved

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
cells with purplish kind of curved

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.039 
cells with purplish kind of curved
things<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.790> them<00:01:29.909> those<00:01:30.060> are<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.299> nucleus<00:01:30.810> of

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
things in them those are the nucleus of

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.170 
things in them those are the nucleus of
white<00:01:31.590> blood<00:01:31.829> cells<00:01:32.100> whenever<00:01:32.759> there's<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.970> lot

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
white blood cells whenever there's a lot

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.969 
white blood cells whenever there's a lot
of<00:01:33.270> white<00:01:33.479> blood<00:01:33.659> cells<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:34.259> an<00:01:34.500> indication

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
of white blood cells it's an indication

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.789 
of white blood cells it's an indication
that<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.990> possible<00:01:36.990> infections<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.650> we

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
that it can be possible infections so we

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.630 
that it can be possible infections so we
put<00:01:38.070> Shiloh<00:01:39.060> one<00:01:39.420> 10<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.530> 14<00:01:40.979> days<00:01:41.220> worth<00:01:41.520> of

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
put Shiloh one 10 to 14 days worth of

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.330 
put Shiloh one 10 to 14 days worth of
antibiotics<00:01:44.479> this<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.009> diagram<00:01:47.009> what<00:01:47.310> we

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
antibiotics this is the diagram what we

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.660 
antibiotics this is the diagram what we
saw<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.640> other<00:01:47.850> day<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.479> was<00:01:48.689> much<00:01:49.530> bigger<00:01:49.920> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
saw the other day it was much bigger and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.389 
saw the other day it was much bigger and
it<00:01:51.090> has<00:01:51.270> some<00:01:51.479> areas<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.110> thought<00:01:52.470> might

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
it has some areas that I thought might

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.420 
it has some areas that I thought might
start<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.090> abscess<00:01:54.810> there<00:01:55.649> was<00:01:55.770> some<00:01:55.979> callus

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
start to abscess there was some callus

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.410 
start to abscess there was some callus
areas<00:01:57.469> sometimes<00:01:58.469> what<00:01:58.680> happens<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.909> older

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
areas sometimes what happens is in older

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.179 
areas sometimes what happens is in older
dogs<00:02:00.659> as<00:02:01.110> they<00:02:01.140> hit<00:02:01.530> their<00:02:01.740> elbows<00:02:03.829> they<00:02:04.829> will

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
dogs as they hit their elbows they will

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.160 
dogs as they hit their elbows they will
or<00:02:05.670> if<00:02:05.790> they<00:02:05.939> get<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.360> calluses<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.020> get

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
or if they get the calluses to get

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.130 
or if they get the calluses to get
infected<00:02:07.879> then<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.450> infection<00:02:09.720> will<00:02:09.989> go

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
infected then the infection will go

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.490 
infected then the infection will go
inside

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
inside

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.940 
inside
what<00:02:12.160> we<00:02:12.310> saw<00:02:12.580> inside<00:02:13.270> when<00:02:13.780> we<00:02:13.900> took<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.440> sample

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
what we saw inside when we took a sample

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.330 
what we saw inside when we took a sample
as<00:02:15.310> we<00:02:15.460> saw<00:02:15.670> some<00:02:16.230> cells<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:17.620> were<00:02:17.860> white

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
as we saw some cells that were white

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.250 
as we saw some cells that were white
blood<00:02:18.550> cells<00:02:18.850> and<00:02:19.240> we<00:02:19.420> saw<00:02:19.570> red<00:02:19.810> blood<00:02:19.990> cells

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
blood cells and we saw red blood cells

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.910 
blood cells and we saw red blood cells
kind<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:21.070> signs<00:02:21.310> of<00:02:21.490> irritation<00:02:21.820> or<00:02:22.330> infection

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
this is a terrible terrible area to wrap

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.630 
this is a terrible terrible area to wrap
and<00:02:28.900> I've<00:02:29.050> tried<00:02:29.350> all<00:02:29.650> ties<00:02:30.010> in<00:02:30.280> different

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.150 
and I've tried all ties in different
wraps<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.270> a<00:02:31.510> lot<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:32.230> them<00:02:32.350> come<00:02:32.560> off<00:02:32.740> so<00:02:33.040> I've

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
wraps and a lot of them come off so I've

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
wraps and a lot of them come off so I've
kind<00:02:33.550> of<00:02:33.700> just<00:02:33.940> gotten<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:35.430> wrapping<00:02:36.430> not<00:02:36.910> real

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
kind of just gotten to wrapping not real

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.050 
kind of just gotten to wrapping not real
tight<00:02:37.540> but<00:02:38.530> just<00:02:38.890> kind<00:02:39.459> of<00:02:39.520> like<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.670> football

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
tight but just kind of like a football

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.940 
tight but just kind of like a football
pad<00:02:40.540> or<00:02:40.720> skateboard<00:02:41.260> pad<00:02:42.000> on<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:44.200> elbow<00:02:44.560> so

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
pad or skateboard pad on the elbow so

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.310 
pad or skateboard pad on the elbow so
when<00:02:45.130> you<00:02:45.250> skateboard<00:02:45.910> or<00:02:46.239> you<00:02:46.390> rollerblade

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
when you skateboard or you rollerblade

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.760 
when you skateboard or you rollerblade
you<00:02:48.190> can<00:02:48.400> wear<00:02:48.550> elbow<00:02:48.820> pads<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.600> so<00:02:50.290> what<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.650> do

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
you can wear elbow pads and so what I do

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.979 
you can wear elbow pads and so what I do
is<00:02:51.040> I<00:02:51.130> just<00:02:51.160> kind<00:02:51.610> of<00:02:51.700> put<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.450> tape<00:02:52.630> right<00:02:52.810> on

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
is I just kind of put the tape right on

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.020 
is I just kind of put the tape right on
the<00:02:53.080> hair<00:02:53.260> because<00:02:53.410> if<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.340> put<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.640> tape<00:02:54.820> up

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
the hair because if you put the tape up

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.760 
the hair because if you put the tape up
in<00:02:55.209> here<00:02:55.570> and<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:55.959> don't<00:02:56.140> do<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.290> too<00:02:56.530> tight

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
in here and you don't do it too tight

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.190 
in here and you don't do it too tight
then<00:02:57.100> it<00:02:57.220> stays<00:02:57.430> on<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:58.060> what<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:58.660> does<00:02:59.020> is

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
then it stays on and what that does is

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.840 
then it stays on and what that does is
it<00:02:59.380> protects<00:02:59.860> this<00:03:01.110> this<00:03:02.110> this<00:03:02.850> fluid-filled

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
it protects this this this fluid-filled

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.760 
it protects this this this fluid-filled
sac<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.630> keeps<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:05.020> from<00:03:05.170> swallowing<00:03:05.470> up

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
sac and it keeps it from swallowing up

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.949 
sac and it keeps it from swallowing up
and<00:03:06.010> actually<00:03:06.310> puts<00:03:06.520> compression<00:03:07.090> on<00:03:07.239> it<00:03:07.270> and

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
and actually puts compression on it and

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.640 
and actually puts compression on it and
pace<00:03:08.370> she<00:03:09.370> keeps<00:03:09.670> looking<00:03:10.300> at<00:03:10.630> it<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:11.230> makes<00:03:11.440> it

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
pace she keeps looking at it it makes it

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.250 
pace she keeps looking at it it makes it
go<00:03:11.830> down<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.459> also<00:03:12.970> um<00:03:15.600> gives<00:03:16.600> us<00:03:16.750> support

go down and also um gives us support
what<00:03:18.010> gives<00:03:18.250> it<00:03:18.400> support<00:03:18.820> from<00:03:18.910> being<00:03:19.150> hit<00:03:19.480> and

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
what gives it support from being hit and

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.060 
what gives it support from being hit and
also<00:03:21.250> um<00:03:21.580> I'm<00:03:22.060> sorry<00:03:22.420> I'm<00:03:22.720> just<00:03:22.750> it's<00:03:23.709> is

she's<00:03:53.410> on<00:03:53.590> antibiotics<00:03:54.340> we're<00:03:54.880> going<00:03:55.060> to<00:03:55.120> keep

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
she's on antibiotics we're going to keep

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.759 
she's on antibiotics we're going to keep
it<00:03:55.450> wrapped<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:56.350> we'll<00:03:56.470> see<00:03:56.620> what's

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
it wrapped and we'll see what's

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.979 
it wrapped and we'll see what's
happening<00:03:58.049> so<00:03:59.049> the<00:03:59.230> hygroma<00:03:59.769> and<00:03:59.890> dogs<00:04:00.130> is

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
happening so the hygroma and dogs is

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.660 
happening so the hygroma and dogs is
when<00:04:01.989> the<00:04:02.200> point<00:04:02.530> of<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.739> elbow<00:04:02.890> or<00:04:03.130> like<00:04:03.489> our

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
when the point of the elbow or like our

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.220 
when the point of the elbow or like our
crazy<00:04:04.000> bone<00:04:04.360> is<00:04:04.709> hit<00:04:05.709> and<00:04:06.670> irritate<00:04:07.660> starts<00:04:08.140> a

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
crazy bone is hit and irritate starts a

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.620 
crazy bone is hit and irritate starts a
little<00:04:08.470> fluid<00:04:08.769> that<00:04:09.489> leaks<00:04:09.790> out<00:04:10.000> between<00:04:10.360> the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
little fluid that leaks out between the

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.100 
little fluid that leaks out between the
bone<00:04:10.900> and<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:12.180> skin<00:04:13.180> and<00:04:13.420> it<00:04:13.510> makes<00:04:13.540> this<00:04:13.840> big

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
bone and the skin and it makes this big

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.199 
bone and the skin and it makes this big
pocket<00:04:14.380> of<00:04:14.650> fluid<00:04:14.680> and<00:04:15.250> on<00:04:15.730> dogs<00:04:16.000> with

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
pocket of fluid and on dogs with

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.080 
pocket of fluid and on dogs with
calluses<00:04:17.220> that<00:04:18.220> fluid<00:04:18.760> can<00:04:19.410> actually<00:04:21.090> become

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
calluses that fluid can actually become

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.140 
calluses that fluid can actually become
infected<00:04:22.720> by<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.200> if<00:04:23.620> a<00:04:23.770> callous<00:04:24.130> outside

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
infected by the if a callous outside

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.820 
infected by the if a callous outside
say<00:04:25.270> dog<00:04:25.479> lays<00:04:25.750> on<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.080> concrete<00:04:26.560> all<00:04:26.800> the

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
say dog lays on the concrete all the

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.320 
say dog lays on the concrete all the
time<00:04:27.130> and<00:04:27.280> that's<00:04:27.340> one<00:04:27.580> of<00:04:27.669> the<00:04:27.729> causes<00:04:27.940> and

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
time and that's one of the causes and

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.610 
time and that's one of the causes and
they<00:04:29.110> really<00:04:29.620> get<00:04:29.889> cracked<00:04:31.020> thick<00:04:32.020> and<00:04:32.260> skin

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
they really get cracked thick and skin

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.650 
they really get cracked thick and skin
there<00:04:32.860> and<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.669> bacteria<00:04:34.150> going<00:04:34.449> through

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
there and the bacteria going through

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.310 
there and the bacteria going through
those<00:04:34.840> cracks<00:04:35.080> it<00:04:35.770> can<00:04:36.340> infect<00:04:37.000> that<00:04:37.320> pocket

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
those cracks it can infect that pocket

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.520 
those cracks it can infect that pocket
of<00:04:38.380> fluid<00:04:38.650> and<00:04:39.330> it<00:04:40.330> can<00:04:40.479> cause<00:04:40.660> an<00:04:40.840> abscess<00:04:41.290> and

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
of fluid and it can cause an abscess and

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.050 
of fluid and it can cause an abscess and
that's<00:04:41.740> what<00:04:41.979> I<00:04:42.010> was<00:04:42.160> looking<00:04:42.340> for<00:04:42.729> I<00:04:42.760> wanted

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
that's what I was looking for I wanted

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.610 
that's what I was looking for I wanted
to<00:04:43.180> see<00:04:43.449> whether<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:44.100> cells<00:04:45.100> in<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:46.620> sample

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
to see whether the cells in the sample

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.650 
to see whether the cells in the sample
were<00:04:48.160> actually<00:04:48.490> a<00:04:48.550> lot<00:04:48.760> of<00:04:48.910> white<00:04:49.090> blood<00:04:49.330> cells

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
were actually a lot of white blood cells

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.740 
were actually a lot of white blood cells
which<00:04:50.590> would<00:04:50.740> mean<00:04:50.979> I<00:04:51.220> should<00:04:51.550> put<00:04:51.760> tribal<00:04:52.690> on

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
which would mean I should put tribal on

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.900 
which would mean I should put tribal on
antibiotics<00:04:53.410> but<00:04:54.160> I<00:04:54.220> just<00:04:54.490> see<00:04:54.669> red<00:04:54.880> blood

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
antibiotics but I just see red blood

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.090 
antibiotics but I just see red blood
cells<00:04:55.330> or<00:04:55.600> hardly<00:04:56.229> any<00:04:56.320> cells<00:04:56.620> at<00:04:56.740> all<00:04:56.860> then<00:04:57.070> I

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
cells or hardly any cells at all then I

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.650 
cells or hardly any cells at all then I
know<00:04:57.220> it's<00:04:57.490> just<00:04:57.669> a<00:04:57.729> pocket<00:04:58.180> of<00:04:58.270> fluid<00:04:58.539> that

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
know it's just a pocket of fluid that

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.920 
know it's just a pocket of fluid that
needs<00:04:58.870> to<00:04:58.990> be<00:04:59.280> bandaged<00:05:00.280> or<00:05:00.940> put<00:05:01.449> in<00:05:01.570> a<00:05:01.630> sling

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
needs to be bandaged or put in a sling

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.890 
needs to be bandaged or put in a sling
and<00:05:02.229> I<00:05:02.770> don't<00:05:03.130> mean<00:05:03.460> a<00:05:03.520> sling<00:05:03.910> like<00:05:04.150> keeps<00:05:04.750> the

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
and I don't mean a sling like keeps the

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.990 
and I don't mean a sling like keeps the
leg<00:05:05.080> up<00:05:05.289> you<00:05:05.500> can<00:05:05.680> see<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:05.979> sling<00:05:06.250> I<00:05:06.400> mean<00:05:06.729> it's

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
leg up you can see the sling I mean it's

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.050 
leg up you can see the sling I mean it's
a<00:05:07.150> padded<00:05:07.750> velcro<00:05:08.400> bandage<00:05:09.400> that<00:05:09.430> goes<00:05:09.789> on<00:05:09.940> the

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
a padded velcro bandage that goes on the

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.420 
a padded velcro bandage that goes on the
points<00:05:10.419> of<00:05:10.479> both<00:05:10.660> elbows<00:05:11.139> now<00:05:11.380> you<00:05:11.440> whether<00:05:12.160> no

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
points of both elbows now you whether no

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.390 
points of both elbows now you whether no
matter<00:05:12.669> where<00:05:13.060> that<00:05:13.440> hygroma<00:05:14.440> is<00:05:14.740> or<00:05:15.220> that

matter where that hygroma is or that

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.430 
matter where that hygroma is or that
fluid<00:05:16.120> filled<00:05:16.330> pocket<00:05:16.720> if<00:05:16.810> it's<00:05:16.960> not<00:05:17.110> infected

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
fluid filled pocket if it's not infected

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.550 
fluid filled pocket if it's not infected
if<00:05:17.919> you<00:05:18.760> can<00:05:18.970> keep<00:05:19.120> it<00:05:19.300> padded<00:05:19.810> like<00:05:20.020> this<00:05:20.289> or

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
if you can keep it padded like this or

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.960 
if you can keep it padded like this or
