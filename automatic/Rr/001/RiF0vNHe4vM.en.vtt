kind of resonate with you at all I get

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.900 
kind of resonate with you at all I get
that<00:04:09.739> it's<00:04:09.920> not<00:04:11.019> it's<00:04:12.019> quite<00:04:12.230> unique<00:04:12.700> like<00:04:13.700> in

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
that it's not it's quite unique like in

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.530 
that it's not it's quite unique like in
this<00:04:14.060> and<00:04:14.870> this

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
this and this

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.060 
this and this
in<00:04:16.049> this<00:04:16.199> generation<00:04:16.560> I<00:04:17.100> mean<00:04:17.400> I<00:04:18.259> think<00:04:19.259> I<00:04:19.889> mean

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
in this generation I mean I think I mean

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.319 
in this generation I mean I think I mean
there<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.340> really<00:04:20.669> can't<00:04:20.880> think<00:04:21.060> of<00:04:21.150> another

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
there I really can't think of another

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.379 
there I really can't think of another
book<00:04:21.810> where<00:04:22.049> it's<00:04:22.199> literally<00:04:22.530> so

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
book where it's literally so

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.010 
book where it's literally so
melodramatic

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
melodramatic

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.860 
melodramatic
and<00:04:25.139> it<00:04:25.740> takes<00:04:25.949> itself<00:04:26.250> so<00:04:26.580> seriously<00:04:27.210> but<00:04:27.780> at

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
and it takes itself so seriously but at

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.820 
and it takes itself so seriously but at
the<00:04:27.960> same<00:04:28.080> time<00:04:28.320> it's<00:04:28.530> very<00:04:28.680> very<00:04:29.070> real<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:31.740> I

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
the same time it's very very real and I

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.249 
the same time it's very very real and I
think<00:04:32.360> eyes<00:04:33.360> now<00:04:33.600> ain't<00:04:33.840> just<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.080> way<00:04:34.139> it's

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
think eyes now ain't just the way it's

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:35.990 
think eyes now ain't just the way it's
written<00:04:34.350> it<00:04:34.560> just<00:04:34.710> seems<00:04:34.830> so<00:04:35.039> personal<00:04:35.669> it

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
written it just seems so personal it

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.510 
written it just seems so personal it
seems<00:04:36.479> like<00:04:36.660> it's<00:04:36.810> it's<00:04:37.110> wasn't<00:04:38.070> really<00:04:38.340> meant

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
seems like it's it's wasn't really meant

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.390 
seems like it's it's wasn't really meant
for<00:04:38.580> publication<00:04:39.330> right<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:40.979> chemistry

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
for publication right and the chemistry

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.219

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
all really didn't have to work on that

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.830 
all really didn't have to work on that
it<00:04:49.680> was<00:04:49.860> out<00:04:50.070> of<00:04:50.099> there<00:04:50.580> from<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.539> very

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
it was out of there from the very

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.020 
it was out of there from the very
beginning<00:04:52.349> would<00:04:52.440> you<00:04:52.620> did<00:04:53.310> you<00:04:53.430> agree<00:04:53.849> with

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
that yeah I mean it definitely felt like

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.860 
that yeah I mean it definitely felt like
something<00:04:56.580> was<00:04:56.699> right<00:04:56.970> in<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.389> audition<00:04:57.570> I

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
something was right in the audition I

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.960 
something was right in the audition I
mean<00:04:58.020> it's<00:04:58.139> kind<00:04:58.320> of<00:04:58.349> why<00:04:58.530> we<00:04:59.310> wanted<00:04:59.520> to<00:04:59.580> do<00:04:59.789> it

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.100 
I just thought like oh this is how he's
supposed<00:05:02.190> to<00:05:02.460> play<00:05:02.610> it<00:05:02.880> I'd<00:05:03.479> really<00:05:03.840> had<00:05:03.960> no
