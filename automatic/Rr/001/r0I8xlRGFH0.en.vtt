arguably<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.379> most<00:00:07.470> important<00:00:08.010> part<00:00:08.220> of<00:00:08.340> any

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
arguably the most important part of any

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.700 
arguably the most important part of any
car<00:00:08.790> is<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.360> tires<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.929> one<00:00:10.139> part<00:00:10.440> that

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
car is the tires the one part that

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.620 
car is the tires the one part that
connects<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.340> car<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.150> ground<00:00:12.330> it's

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
connects the car to the ground it's

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.049 
connects the car to the ground it's
driving<00:00:13.049> on<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.650> for<00:00:13.830> FIA<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.370> Larry<00:00:14.639> we've

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
driving on and for FIA for Larry we've

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.960 
driving on and for FIA for Larry we've
got<00:00:15.240> bespoke<00:00:15.929> Michelin<00:00:16.560> tires<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.220> do<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.460> job

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
got bespoke Michelin tires to do the job

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.029 
got bespoke Michelin tires to do the job
now<00:00:18.240> these<00:00:18.449> tires<00:00:18.779> are<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.140> bit<00:00:19.260> revolutionary

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
now these tires are a bit revolutionary

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.040 
now these tires are a bit revolutionary
they're<00:00:20.400> 18-inch<00:00:21.210> wheels<00:00:21.510> which<00:00:21.840> means

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
they're 18-inch wheels which means

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.200 
they're 18-inch wheels which means
they've<00:00:22.170> got<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> lower<00:00:22.650> sidewall<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.580> also

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
they've got a lower sidewall and also

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.210 
they've got a lower sidewall and also
the<00:00:24.600> tread<00:00:24.900> means<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.500> they<00:00:25.590> can<00:00:25.769> be<00:00:25.890> used<00:00:26.099> in

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
the tread means that they can be used in

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.659 
the tread means that they can be used in
both<00:00:26.279> wet<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.699> dry<00:00:26.970> conditions<00:00:31.340> the<00:00:32.340> mission

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
much more complex tire to develop so

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.380
