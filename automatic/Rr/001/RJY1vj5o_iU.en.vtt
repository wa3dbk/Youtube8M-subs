00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.470
 they are graceful and sweet but not all 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.260
 domestic races are the creation of 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.750
 rabbits can be a good alternative to 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.389
 the raising of known rabbits 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.480
 as culture cone it is not yet a 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.750
 prominent prominent activity but 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.660
 she is strategic is very significant 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.180
 from the point of view of its production 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.060
 proper with him the animal that 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.369
 allows you to produce on a large scale 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.530
 in small spaces 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.620
 using products in their food 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.440
 who are not competitive with man and 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.070
 derives that this productive activity 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.590
 production of meat of the skin at last 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.780
 of a series of products that form a 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.690
 very important value added for the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.360
 aquaculture producer requires 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.350
 such as the breeding system in 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.329
 cages 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.629
 they are suspended inside sheds 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.270
 which must be capped to prevent 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.890
 and does not compromise the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.650
 animal health 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.860
 the recommended is that around the sheds 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.960
 trees are planted they retain the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.570
 brake the heat and wind 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.960
 the most common diseases in rabbits are 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.110
 mange mastitis in one ear arthritis 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.630
 species of callus on legs 1 and coryza 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.570
 rabbits should be separated from 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.759
 animals in breeding stand in a shed 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.090
 the motherhood where the mothers are 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.790
 pups called lapas in another and the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.950
 young people with them in another location 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.520
 at this Federal University 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.049
 of mine mines are more than a thousand animals 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.680
 all of california and new zealand race 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:51.420
 white but the rabbit world is big 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.820
 in total are 66 breeds and 150 varieties 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.909
 douglas is responsible for the management of 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.159
 animals and stresses the importance 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:06.049
 observe the consumption of water and food etc. 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:12.000
 perceptive and working with the 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:13.470
 observing daily consumption and in our 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.290
 water medium 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:23.460
 feed water if food is left 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:26.490
 previous food or even illness with the 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.780
 case of toned organs working with 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.540
 quite optimism 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.630
 rabbit meat is considered noble and 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.660
 rich in proteins she has white 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.140
 low amount of potassium and 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.050
 fat the pregnant bunnies 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.450
 puppies and the young as in 110 grams 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.330
 of feed per day for mothers as in 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.440
 animals freely come to eat 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.840
 60 to 80 times a day in addition to the feed 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.300
 breeder can give the rabbits time 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.240
 when cassava leaves the grass 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.850
 for herbivores, the reproduction of 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.000
 rabbits is favorable for breeders 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.490
 be intense but it is lower in summer 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.480
 breeding animals live from three to 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.090
 five years 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.550
 ten days after the marriage is made 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.600
 palpation in the female to determine if there 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.269
 fertilization 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:23.010
 the specialist tells how the cycle is 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:26.130
 reproductive systems they are able to 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.030
 produce up to six to eight 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.850
 deliveries 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.840
 this means within a culture a 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:37.170
 relatively intense reproductive cycle 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.340
 gestation takes 31 days in the 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.070
 However, 11 to 12 days after delivery, 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.739
 it can be real home lada and so 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.330
 offer one more litter in the range 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.330
 between births of 42 days
