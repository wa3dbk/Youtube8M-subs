I<00:00:22.619> watched<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.609> games<00:00:23.850> live<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.600> was<00:00:24.720> super

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
I watched the games live I was super

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.189 
I watched the games live I was super
young<00:00:25.470> when<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.460> had<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.910> opportunity<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.900> buy

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
young when I had the opportunity to buy

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.410 
young when I had the opportunity to buy
these<00:00:28.260> shoes<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.189> copped<00:00:29.490> multiple<00:00:30.119> pairs

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
these shoes I copped multiple pairs

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.749 
these shoes I copped multiple pairs
because<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:31.859> such<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> dope<00:00:32.399> pair<00:00:32.669> of

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
because this is just such a dope pair of

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.280 
because this is just such a dope pair of
kicks<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:34.160> we<00:00:35.160> back<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.579> up<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.910> little<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:37.020> I

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
kicks and we back this up a little and I

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.010 
kicks and we back this up a little and I
was<00:00:37.500> really<00:00:37.770> excited<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.430> own<00:00:38.940> these<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.540> did

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
was really excited to own these I did

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.900 
was really excited to own these I did
review<00:00:40.410> these<00:00:40.620> already<00:00:40.829> once<00:00:41.309> but<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.640> just

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
review these already once but I just

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.340 
review these already once but I just
know<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.120> could<00:00:42.360> give<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> better<00:00:42.870> review

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
know I could give you a better review

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.990 
know I could give you a better review
now<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:43.829> that's<00:00:44.040> why<00:00:44.129> I'm<00:00:44.280> reshooting<00:00:44.820> them

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
now so that's why I'm reshooting them

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.090 
now so that's why I'm reshooting them
and<00:00:45.210> I'm<00:00:46.050> planning<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.440> wearing<00:00:46.649> them<00:00:46.950> and

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
and I'm planning on wearing them and

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.880 
and I'm planning on wearing them and
this<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.280> my<00:00:47.460> last<00:00:47.820> crispy<00:00:48.600> pair<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.530> figured

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
this is my last crispy pair so I figured

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.950 
this is my last crispy pair so I figured
why<00:00:50.039> not<00:00:50.070> reshoot<00:00:50.850> them<00:00:51.059> now<00:00:51.239> before<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.660> wear

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
why not reshoot them now before I wear

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.439 
why not reshoot them now before I wear
them<00:00:52.170> these<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:53.129> fit<00:00:53.489> true<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.730> size<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.300> my

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
them these do fit true to size in my

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.299 
them these do fit true to size in my
opinion<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.559> if<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.890> have<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> wide<00:00:56.280> foot

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
opinion but if you have a wide foot

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.670 
opinion but if you have a wide foot
maybe<00:00:56.850> go<00:00:57.059> up<00:00:57.090> half<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.719> size<00:00:57.930> if<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.379> run

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
maybe go up half the size if you run

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.920 
maybe go up half the size if you run
with<00:00:58.920> whatever<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.399> say<00:00:59.789> as<00:00:59.940> far<00:01:00.180> as<00:01:00.239> tips<00:01:00.629> with

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
with whatever I say as far as tips with

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.039 
with whatever I say as far as tips with
what<00:01:01.559> they<00:01:01.739> fit<00:01:02.100> like<00:01:02.399> then<00:01:03.120> go<00:01:03.420> through<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
what they fit like then go through the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.890 
what they fit like then go through the
size<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.589> these<00:01:04.799> they<00:01:05.309> crease<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:06.030> crazy<00:01:06.450> so

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
size on these they crease like crazy so

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.990 
size on these they crease like crazy so
definitely<00:01:07.500> get<00:01:08.159> something<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.880> avoid

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
definitely get something to avoid

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.300 
definitely get something to avoid
creasing<00:01:09.720> if<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.960> really<00:01:10.500> are<00:01:10.710> digging<00:01:11.040> these

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
creasing if you really are digging these

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.100 
creasing if you really are digging these
to<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> point<00:01:11.939> where<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.270> do<00:01:12.450> not<00:01:12.600> want<00:01:12.900> them

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
to the point where you do not want them

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.440 
to the point where you do not want them
creasing<00:01:13.740> some<00:01:14.700> people<00:01:14.970> don't<00:01:15.150> care<00:01:15.360> about

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
creasing some people don't care about

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.270 
creasing some people don't care about
decreasing<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.290> some<00:01:16.500> people<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.920> when
