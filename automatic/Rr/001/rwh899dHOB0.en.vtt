here I started this some time ago but
I'm<00:02:37.030> sure<00:02:37.269> it's<00:02:37.450> going<00:02:37.599> to<00:02:37.690> turn<00:02:37.870> into

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
I'm sure it's going to turn into

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.979 
I'm sure it's going to turn into
something<00:02:38.410> amazing<00:02:38.620> soon<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:40.269> so<00:02:40.840> I've<00:02:40.959> just

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
something amazing soon and so I've just

something amazing soon and so I've just
got<00:02:41.319> a<00:02:41.470> few<00:02:41.650> papers<00:02:42.099> a<00:02:42.340> few<00:02:42.519> little<00:02:43.030> bits<00:02:43.180> of

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
got a few papers a few little bits of

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.570 
got a few papers a few little bits of
pieces<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.780> fabric<00:02:43.959> so<00:02:44.830> that<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:44.980> can<00:02:45.220> just<00:02:45.400> pick

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
pieces of fabric so that I can just pick

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.509 
pieces of fabric so that I can just pick
up<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.290> I've<00:02:47.290> got<00:02:47.319> a<00:02:47.440> couple<00:02:47.650> of<00:02:47.800> odd<00:02:47.950> little

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
up and I've got a couple of odd little

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.550 
up and I've got a couple of odd little
templates<00:02:49.120> in<00:02:49.300> here<00:02:49.540> just<00:02:49.690> again<00:02:50.110> just<00:02:50.440> in

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
templates in here just again just in

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.890 
templates in here just again just in
case<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.890> suddenly<00:02:51.190> need<00:02:51.550> to<00:02:51.730> do<00:02:51.880> something<00:02:52.390> and

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
case I suddenly need to do something and

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.440 
case I suddenly need to do something and
the<00:02:53.410> other<00:02:53.530> thing<00:02:53.769> I<00:02:53.890> have<00:02:54.130> I<00:02:54.730> did<00:02:55.180> actually

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
the other thing I have I did actually

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.199 
the other thing I have I did actually
pop<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:56.019> pocket<00:02:56.560> in<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.769> front<00:02:56.920> here<00:02:57.370> for<00:02:58.150> a

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
pop a pocket in the front here for a

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.699 
pop a pocket in the front here for a
thimble<00:02:58.600> but<00:02:58.810> I<00:02:58.840> don't<00:02:59.140> actually<00:02:59.319> use<00:02:59.530> a

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
thimble but I don't actually use a

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.470 
thimble but I don't actually use a
thimble<00:03:00.160> very<00:03:00.340> well<00:03:00.489> but<00:03:00.640> I<00:03:00.700> do<00:03:00.760> have<00:03:01.150> some<00:03:01.360> of

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
thimble very well but I do have some of

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.960 
thimble very well but I do have some of
these<00:03:01.569> little<00:03:01.980> thin<00:03:02.980> black<00:03:03.190> sticker<00:03:03.640> things

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
these little thin black sticker things

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.710 
these little thin black sticker things
the<00:03:04.959> idea<00:03:04.989> of<00:03:05.440> these<00:03:05.590> is<00:03:05.799> that<00:03:05.920> you<00:03:06.690> stick<00:03:07.690> a

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
the idea of these is that you stick a

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.259 
the idea of these is that you stick a
little<00:03:07.930> oval<00:03:08.380> plastic<00:03:08.739> shape<00:03:09.160> on<00:03:09.400> your<00:03:09.549> finger

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
little oval plastic shape on your finger

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.030 
little oval plastic shape on your finger
and<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:10.630> works<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.410> pop<00:03:11.590> your<00:03:11.739> needle

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
and that works to pop your needle

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.830 
and that works to pop your needle
against<00:03:12.459> rather<00:03:12.730> than<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.120> whole<00:03:13.269> thin<00:03:13.540> ball<00:03:13.690> I

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
against rather than a whole thin ball I

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.140 
against rather than a whole thin ball I
find<00:03:14.049> if<00:03:14.170> I<00:03:14.260> use<00:03:14.440> a<00:03:14.470> thimble<00:03:14.860> I<00:03:14.950> just<00:03:15.160> stick<00:03:16.030> the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
find if I use a thimble I just stick the

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.180 
find if I use a thimble I just stick the
finger<00:03:16.420> out<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.599> the<00:03:16.750> way<00:03:16.810> which<00:03:17.170> is<00:03:17.380> not<00:03:17.950> a<00:03:17.980> lot

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
finger out of the way which is not a lot

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.039 
finger out of the way which is not a lot
of<00:03:18.310> help<00:03:18.760> but<00:03:18.910> these<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.150> find<00:03:19.569> I<00:03:19.720> can<00:03:19.900> work

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
because sometimes we're not too sure

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.509

what<00:04:14.319> we<00:04:14.440> can<00:04:14.590> take<00:04:14.769> when<00:04:14.950> we<00:04:15.040> travel<00:04:15.340> and<00:04:15.430> I

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
what we can take when we travel and I

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.310 
what we can take when we travel and I
can't<00:04:15.790> promise<00:04:16.060> that<00:04:16.209> things<00:04:16.570> will<00:04:17.200> go

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
can't promise that things will go

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.289 
can't promise that things will go
through<00:04:17.620> but<00:04:17.799> certainly<00:04:18.489> I've<00:04:18.639> had<00:04:18.850> success

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
through but certainly I've had success

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.120 
through but certainly I've had success
taking<00:04:19.750> that<00:04:20.229> through<00:04:20.560> on<00:04:21.340> plane<00:04:21.729> travel
