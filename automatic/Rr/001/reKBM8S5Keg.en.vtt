shoot of sailing win the movie we never

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.820 
shoot of sailing win the movie we never
intended<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.120> go<00:00:39.390> further<00:00:39.660> than<00:00:39.840> 10<00:00:40.620> minutes

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:40.830 
intended to go further than 10 minutes

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.700 
intended to go further than 10 minutes
into<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.250> project<00:00:41.820> but<00:00:42.050> with<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.140> success<00:00:43.530> of

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
into the project but with the success of

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.160 
into the project but with the success of
it<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.580> it's<00:00:44.970> actually<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.510> lucky<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:45.870> we

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
it and it's actually it's lucky that we

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.950 
it and it's actually it's lucky that we
did<00:00:46.650> raise<00:00:46.950> more<00:00:47.310> than<00:00:47.340> our<00:00:47.760> projected<00:00:48.270> 2500

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
did raise more than our projected 2500

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.770 
did raise more than our projected 2500
because<00:00:49.320> as<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:50.400> got<00:00:50.610> more<00:00:50.640> support<00:00:51.330> and<00:00:51.450> as<00:00:51.600> we

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
because as we got more support and as we

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.230 
because as we got more support and as we
as<00:00:52.620> things<00:00:52.980> got<00:00:53.160> more<00:00:53.400> and<00:00:53.490> more<00:00:53.580> complicated

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
as things got more and more complicated

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.600 
as things got more and more complicated
things<00:00:55.110> also<00:00:55.320> got<00:00:55.590> more<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.860> more<00:00:55.950> extensive

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
things also got more and more extensive

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.510 
things also got more and more extensive
so<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:57.360> had<00:00:57.720> to<00:00:57.900> then<00:00:58.080> go<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.830> locations

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
so we had to then go to locations

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.370 
so we had to then go to locations
because<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.390> had<00:01:00.510> an<00:01:00.600> obligation<00:01:00.750> now<00:01:01.200> to<00:01:01.260> our

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
because we had an obligation now to our

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.870 
because we had an obligation now to our
fans<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.860> make<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.130> as<00:01:02.280> as<00:01:02.490> good<00:01:02.700> as<00:01:02.790> we

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
fans to make this as as good as we

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.280 
fans to make this as as good as we
possibly<00:01:03.060> could<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.450> we<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.810> to<00:01:03.870> go<00:01:03.960> rent<00:01:04.170> out

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
possibly could so we have to go rent out

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.039 
possibly could so we have to go rent out
locations<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.460> locations<00:01:06.060> needed<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.930> be

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
locations the locations needed to be
