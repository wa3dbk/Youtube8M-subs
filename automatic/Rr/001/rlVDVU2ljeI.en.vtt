dollars well there are two pieces of

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.730 
dollars well there are two pieces of
good<00:01:37.500> news<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.369> first<00:01:38.670> one<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.209> that<00:01:39.740> these

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
good news the first one is that these

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.590 
good news the first one is that these

guitars have become much less expensive

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.059 
guitars have become much less expensive
in<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.990> major<00:01:43.259> manufacturers<00:01:43.950> are

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
in that major manufacturers are

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:45.889 
in that major manufacturers are
manufacturing<00:01:44.759> student<00:01:45.149> models<00:01:45.719> of<00:01:45.840> these

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
manufacturing student models of these

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.339 
manufacturing student models of these
guitars<00:01:46.109> often<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:47.100> under<00:01:47.310> $1000<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:49.140> other

guitars often for under $1000 the other
thing<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.739> remember<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.759> can<00:01:51.090> get<00:01:51.420> a

I<00:03:33.870> don't<00:03:34.470> know<00:03:34.560> if<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:34.709> can<00:03:34.829> see<00:03:35.069> this<00:03:35.220> I<00:03:35.489> play

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
I don't know if you can see this I play

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
with a very thick pick which gives me a

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
very firm round sound now when it comes

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.509 
very firm round sound now when it comes
to<00:03:43.170> amplifiers<00:03:43.769> I<00:03:43.950> want<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.340> pay<00:03:44.489> special

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
to amplifiers I want you to pay special

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.069 
to amplifiers I want you to pay special
attention<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.510> way<00:03:45.599> I<00:03:45.630> have<00:03:45.900> these

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
attention to the way I have these

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.069 
attention to the way I have these
amplifiers<00:03:46.440> set<00:03:46.920> up<00:03:47.090> notice<00:03:48.090> that<00:03:48.840> they<00:03:49.049> are

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
amplifiers set up notice that they are

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.090 
amplifiers set up notice that they are
behind<00:03:49.410> me

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
behind me

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.420

and<00:03:50.310> they<00:03:51.030> are<00:03:51.269> elevated<00:03:51.750> this<00:03:52.500> is<00:03:52.739> very<00:03:53.069> very

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
and they are elevated this is very very

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.250 
and they are elevated this is very very
important<00:03:53.970> this<00:03:54.269> does<00:03:54.540> a<00:03:54.569> couple<00:03:54.840> of<00:03:54.959> things

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
important this does a couple of things

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.259 
important this does a couple of things
first<00:03:56.010> of<00:03:56.190> all<00:03:56.310> getting<00:03:56.609> them<00:03:56.819> off<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.120> floor

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
first of all getting them off the floor

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.420 
first of all getting them off the floor
eliminates<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.109> rumbly<00:03:58.470> bass<00:03:58.859> sound<00:03:59.220> which

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
eliminates the rumbly bass sound which

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.030 
eliminates the rumbly bass sound which
is<00:03:59.459> really<00:03:59.940> problematic<00:04:00.319> but<00:04:01.319> most<00:04:01.590> important

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
is really problematic but most important

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.740 
is really problematic but most important
of<00:04:02.100> all<00:04:02.280> getting<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.760> amps<00:04:03.030> up<00:04:03.150> off<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.450> floor

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
of all getting the amps up off the floor

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.930

I've<00:04:13.470> seen<00:04:13.680> young<00:04:13.859> guitarists<00:04:14.370> who<00:04:14.430> have<00:04:14.519> put

an electric guitar to jazz ensemble is
very<00:04:29.220> tricky<00:04:29.490> we<00:04:30.090> don't<00:04:30.330> want<00:04:30.510> to<00:04:30.599> be<00:04:30.690> too<00:04:30.870> loud

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
very tricky we don't want to be too loud

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.379 
very tricky we don't want to be too loud
we<00:04:31.770> also<00:04:31.979> don't<00:04:32.370> want<00:04:32.430> to<00:04:32.610> be<00:04:32.700> too<00:04:32.849> soft<00:04:33.150> either

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
we also don't want to be too soft either

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.260

so<00:04:34.050> let<00:04:34.229> me<00:04:34.320> give<00:04:34.770> you<00:04:34.889> an<00:04:35.010> mo<00:04:35.400> that<00:04:35.910> I<00:04:35.970> think

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
so let me give you an mo that I think

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.270 
so let me give you an mo that I think
will<00:04:36.450> help<00:04:36.690> in<00:04:36.990> terms<00:04:37.500> of<00:04:37.770> getting<00:04:37.950> the<00:04:38.130> right

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
will help in terms of getting the right
