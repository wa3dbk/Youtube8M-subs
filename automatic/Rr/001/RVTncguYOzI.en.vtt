00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
use the the 1/8 output so let's just

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:00.979 
use the the 1/8 output so let's just
plug<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.309> here<00:00:59.059> and<00:01:00.059> there's<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.870> little

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
plug that in here and there's a little

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.150 
plug that in here and there's a little
lightning<00:01:01.230> bolt<00:01:01.379> showing<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.010> it's

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
lightning bolt showing that it's

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.399 
lightning bolt showing that it's
charging<00:01:02.899> okay<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.470> works<00:01:04.650> for<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.890> iPhone

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
they typically using the two int 2 amp

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:23.330 
they typically using the two int 2 amp
output<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.369> side<00:01:14.610> here<00:01:17.360> go<00:01:18.360> ahead<00:01:22.340> yeah

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
output on this side here go ahead yeah

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.170 
output on this side here go ahead yeah
there<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.090> goes<00:01:24.270> right<00:01:24.360> away<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
there it goes right away to the

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.620 
there it goes right away to the
lightning<00:01:27.180> symbol<00:01:28.250> so<00:01:29.250> yeah<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.970> mean<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.509> can

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
lightning symbol so yeah I mean you can
