through<00:04:41.639> 7<00:04:42.860> this<00:04:43.860> is<00:04:43.919> a<00:04:44.070> very<00:04:44.280> simple<00:04:44.610> task

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
through 7 this is a very simple task

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.330 
through 7 this is a very simple task
where<00:04:45.210> I<00:04:45.240> just<00:04:45.360> did<00:04:45.750> tapping<00:04:46.740> my<00:04:46.860> right<00:04:47.039> hand

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
where I just did tapping my right hand

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.120 
where I just did tapping my right hand
tapping<00:04:48.120> my<00:04:48.240> left<00:04:48.510> hand<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:48.990> then<00:04:49.650> holding<00:04:49.979> my

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
tapping my left hand and then holding my

00:04:50.130 --> 00:05:00.830 
tapping my left hand and then holding my
breath<00:04:50.370> and<00:04:50.700> also<00:04:51.770> exhaling

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.400 

so<00:05:01.380> if<00:05:02.220> we<00:05:02.340> go<00:05:02.460> back<00:05:02.490> to<00:05:02.700> here<00:05:03.169> we<00:05:04.169> know<00:05:04.290> from

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
so if we go back to here we know from

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.350 
so if we go back to here we know from
the<00:05:04.560> text<00:05:04.740> file<00:05:04.980> that<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:05.700> functional<00:05:06.030> scans

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
the text file that the functional scans

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.090 
the text file that the functional scans
begin<00:05:06.810> at<00:05:07.080> run<00:05:07.350> five<00:05:09.169> the<00:05:10.169> second<00:05:10.530> column<00:05:10.710> here

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
begin at run five the second column here

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.420 
begin at run five the second column here
tells<00:05:12.060> you<00:05:12.300> what<00:05:12.600> run<00:05:12.840> you're<00:05:13.050> at<00:05:13.230> and<00:05:13.560> the

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
tells you what run you're at and the

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.000 
tells you what run you're at and the
third<00:05:14.610> column<00:05:14.820> tells<00:05:15.330> you<00:05:15.540> what<00:05:16.320> image<00:05:16.770> is

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
third column tells you what image is

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.810 
third column tells you what image is
being<00:05:17.730> acquired<00:05:18.860> so<00:05:19.860> here<00:05:20.130> we<00:05:20.280> see<00:05:20.460> the<00:05:20.550> start

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
being acquired so here we see the start

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.760 
being acquired so here we see the start
of<00:05:21.000> run<00:05:21.210> five<00:05:21.480> and<00:05:22.110> if<00:05:22.200> we<00:05:22.320> keep<00:05:22.470> scrolling

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
of run five and if we keep scrolling

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.430 
of run five and if we keep scrolling
down<00:05:23.070> it<00:05:23.400> should<00:05:23.970> end<00:05:24.240> at<00:05:24.720> a<00:05:24.930> hundred<00:05:25.320> and

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
down it should end at a hundred and

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:32.990 
down it should end at a hundred and
sixty-five<00:05:26.000> volumes<00:05:27.000> and<00:05:27.830> it<00:05:28.830> does<00:05:31.669> run<00:05:32.669> six

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
sixty-five volumes and it does run six

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.200 
sixty-five volumes and it does run six
is<00:05:33.150> the<00:05:33.180> same<00:05:33.300> and<00:05:34.340> when<00:05:35.340> we<00:05:35.430> get<00:05:35.550> to<00:05:35.669> run<00:05:35.820> seven

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
is the same and when we get to run seven

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.090 
is the same and when we get to run seven
it<00:05:36.389> should<00:05:36.540> end<00:05:36.780> and<00:05:37.139> one<00:05:37.380> hundred<00:05:37.650> and<00:05:37.770> sixty

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
it should end and one hundred and sixty

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.190 
it should end and one hundred and sixty
volumes<00:05:38.490> because<00:05:38.729> it<00:05:39.120> is<00:05:39.210> an<00:05:39.330> anatomical<00:05:39.750> run

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
volumes because it is an anatomical run

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.000 
volumes because it is an anatomical run
and<00:05:41.720> we<00:05:42.720> see<00:05:42.900> that<00:05:43.050> that<00:05:43.110> is<00:05:43.380> also<00:05:43.860> what

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
and we see that that is also what

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.450 
and we see that that is also what
happens<00:05:45.530> it's<00:05:46.530> good<00:05:46.710> to<00:05:46.800> check<00:05:46.950> for<00:05:47.130> this<00:05:47.220> just

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
happens it's good to check for this just

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.100 
happens it's good to check for this just
to<00:05:47.550> make<00:05:47.700> sure<00:05:47.729> that<00:05:48.060> there<00:05:48.180> are<00:05:48.270> no<00:05:48.389> runs<00:05:48.720> or

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
to make sure that there are no runs or

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:55.159 
to make sure that there are no runs or
volumes<00:05:49.620> that<00:05:49.770> are<00:05:49.830> missing<00:05:53.900> once<00:05:54.900> we're<00:05:55.050> done

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
volumes that are missing once we're done

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:57.830 
volumes that are missing once we're done
with<00:05:55.350> that<00:05:55.820> we<00:05:56.820> can<00:05:56.970> select<00:05:57.150> any<00:05:57.510> of<00:05:57.690> these

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
with that we can select any of these

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.370 
with that we can select any of these
