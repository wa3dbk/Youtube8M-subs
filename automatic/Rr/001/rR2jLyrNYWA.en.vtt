00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.180
Hi, welcome to "Get Sewing With Me",

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.700
The show where I do a little bit of sewing, and I take you with me for the ride.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.660
Hopefully, teaching you some tips and tricks along the way.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.381
So I have a real problem with buying shirts - like blouses, like ones with collars and buttons down the

00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:28.321
front - and the problem

00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:32.400
with this is, is that I don't actually wear blouses - like, ever.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.400
But for some reason I can't stop buying them

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.460
So I have a closet full of blouses that I don't wear!

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.801
So I thought I might wear all my blouses a bit more if I made them a little bit more interesting

00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:42.097
And it has definitely worked!

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.640
So without further ado, let's begin!

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.140
So the first shirt I’m going to try and upcycle
is this boring black blouse.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.500
Now I found these cute buttons a couple of
months ago, and I think that now is the perfect

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.199
time to put them to use.
I’m first going to sew two matching heart

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.170
buttons onto the collar.
So, using some needle and thread, I bring

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.119
my needle up through my collar right in the
middle like this, and then I thread my button

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.640
on.
For the first few stitches it’s going to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.030
be all wobbly and move around a lot, but if
I sew it on tightly – and this is about

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.640
after 15 times going up and down – the button
will stay in place.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.080
I tied a knot in the thread after bringing
it through to the back of the collar, and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.920
there we go!
And I simply repeated this on the other side.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.280
The buttons on this blouse were also very
ugly, so I chopped them all off, and replaced

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.990
them one-by-one with these cute bow buttons.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.440
And I’m really pleased with the final result.
This shirt is now WAY cuter than it was before.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.630
So this is another method for upcycling a
standard old-shirt.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.720
I layed my shirt down flat, right side up,
making sure that the collar is totally flat

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.860
like this. Then, I grabbed a piece of lace
and measured it to the width of my collar.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.170
Then, with some fabric glue – and just as
a side not, you can’t use craft glue or

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.360
a hot glue gun here because it will make the
collar fabric all stiff – it’s got to

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.800
be fabric glue – I put a thin line all along
the back of the collar and then stuck the

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.030
lace down onto it.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.300
Then I realized that I probably needed to
cover the entire collar in glue, so I did

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.209
that, pressed the lace down, flipped it over
to make sure that the front side of the collar

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:30.030
was totally flat, and then I let the whole
thing dry for about 30 minutes.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.660
Now this is actually something that I’ve
wanted to do a shirt for quite a while. Drawing

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.680
inspiration from fashion designers like Vivetta
and Coco Fennell, I’m going to make a shirt

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.760
with a statement collar! For this, I’m using
iron-on patches. You can find these basically

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.250
anywhere – but ebay and etsy are great places
to find specific designs!

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.940
And, as the name implies, all you’ve got
to do here is iron the patches on.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:02.790
So to do that, you cover your shirt with some
cloth, like a sheet or pillow case, and with

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.880
your iron on its highest cotton setting you
place pressure onto the patch and the shirt

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.950
for about 30 seconds.
Try not to move the iron back and forth too

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.720
much, because you might move the patch.
And – the patch is now bonded onto the shirt.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.050
And I repeat this with the other side.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:26.870
The last one was inspired by a shirt that
I saw in Dangerfield, which I thought that

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.540
I could probably recreate for a lot cheaper.
Now this one does require a specialized stitch

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.850
on a sewing machine. This stitch will probably
only be found on mid-range sewing machines

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.319
and above, but, if you’ve got this stitch,
you can give this one a go!

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.960
So this is the shirt that I’m going to transform.
Before I begin sewing, I round off the edges

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.300
of the collar with a pencil, so that I’ll
have a rounder collar. This is the line I’m

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.950
going to follow with my needle when I’m
sewing.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.180
Then, I set my machine to that stitch, and,
starting at the inside of the collar, I sew

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.770
all the way around the edges, and follow the
pencil line around the pointy-bits of the

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.319
collar.

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:11.060
I 
end up with this, and then I simply cut away
all the excess fabric.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.890
And with the scissors, you’ve got to get
right into those grooves, but making sure

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.069
not to cut the stitches – and, hopefully
you’ll end up with something like this!

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:32.000
Of course, there is also embroidery! I’ve
already covered this a couple of times in

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.819
previous videos, so I will link to them here,
on you can find the links in the description

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:38.560
box if you’re on a mobile device.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.419
So, hopefully this video gives you lots of
inspiration on upcycling your own shirts,

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.680
both if you have a problem and can’t stop
buying them like me, or if you’ve got some

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.410
spare time, and want to make a couple a cute
blouses!

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:55.310
Share photos of your up-cycled blouses with
me on instagram using the hashtag #diyannika

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.390
(and just a reminder that your profile has
to be on public for me to actually see

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.650
the photo).

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.530
I hope you all enjoyed this video, and I'll see you all next time. Bye!
