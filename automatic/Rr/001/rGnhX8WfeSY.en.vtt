00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.950
 hello very good guys everyone I'm 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.460
 here again with another a boxing of 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.550
 figures 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.640
 with body but this time it's about samus 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.239
 they plow the heroine samus aran of nintendo 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.699
 of the metroid saga in a figure in the 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.760
 that represents a kind of 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:44.960
 statuette in its version 0 suite without 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.570
 armor or back from the company 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.130
 max factory and is based on the design 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.730
 of metroid other m 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.550
 and well here you can see the seal of 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.640
 nintendo like that 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:04.040
 an original version of the figure is not 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.040
 copy or nothing and nothing we will see 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.690
 how is this figure just arrived 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.110
 does nothing a few minutes ago the 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.460
 postman 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.460
 and well let's open it 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.710
 ok it would be open now let's get it out 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.710
 of the plastic wrap 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.070
 and we would have it 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.680
 As you can see, it 's amazing how 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.680
 detail has also given you one of the 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.869
 enemies of the game that we saw from the 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.540
 first black and metroid of the super 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.380
 Nintendo 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:59.580
 and let's see it a little more in detail 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.340
 here we also have the same base we're going 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.439
 to take it out 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.429
 well here we have already removed the floor 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:11.200
 from the sides we can open it and we're going to 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.200
 see more in detail this figure 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.550
 as you can see the face is super 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.590
 achieved very cool besides the effect of 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:25.970
 hair as if there was air 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:29.660
 it is very very realistic the suit is very 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.630
 well done with the original colors 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.500
 and constant well represented here 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.500
 we have your weapon 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.490
 it can not be removed in this way here 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.670
 and a cartridge belt to throw it but not 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.400
 it could not be removed 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.239
 the figure would be that static in this 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.930
 position and now the rest of the details 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.459
 we would also have this base 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.640
 transparent as you can see with the logo 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:04.290
 of metroid other m 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.440
 and the little detail that brings us here that 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.230
 is this enemy 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.780
 that we watched the first games too 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.650
 with this way you have a touch a 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.020
 so weird is like the part here 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.750
 up like a soft plastic that 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.800
 can you can tighten the truth that 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:30.319
 it's pretty cool and here we would have the 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:33.260
 accessory with which the base is put 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:38.049
 so let's set it up and let's see how 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.049
 would be in the base next to the enemy 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.700
 and good here as you can see well 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:47.129
 it's like it would be in its base 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.250
 As you can see the figure adapts 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:52.260
 perfectly here we have the enemy 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.300
 that we talked about before 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.460
 hooked up like with this kind of tube 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.120
 transparent 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.040
 all very well accomplished the suit on 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.490
 I liked the colors that have 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.900
 used and how can you see the logo that 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.280
 he's always behind the suit too 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.360
 very very accomplished 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.060
 and the colors the forms of samu and about 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.500
 all the face that seems to me of those of 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.320
 the most achieved and the most successful 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.340
 I've seen myself in the figure of samus 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.280
 Aran since there is not much 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.889
 but I think it's the best nothing 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.930
 not to say the best they have done 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.020
 This also waiting for one of 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.930
 signatures that we are with your characteristic 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.930
 armor and the cannon and such that will reach me 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.569
 surely tomorrow and what but also 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.870
 can teach boxing this last 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:49.330
 figure that I comment is articulated 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:53.290
 but it is also very cool and you will see 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.870
 and well I hope you liked it and 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.840
 you know this figure you can find 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.570
 in many import pages and nothing 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.430
 if you want to meet her and you have pac 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.610
 is it can forward that is a good 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:10.530
 buy for any gamer come a 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.530
 greeting and until the next video
