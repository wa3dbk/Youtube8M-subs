a<00:00:31.830> number<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.189> reasons<00:00:32.340> for<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.820> but<00:00:32.880> it's

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
a number of reasons for that but it's

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.660 
a number of reasons for that but it's
still<00:00:33.480> nice<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.750> have<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.680> community<00:00:35.250> here<00:00:35.520> of

I<00:01:43.610> was<00:01:44.610> first<00:01:44.940> starting<00:01:45.090> out<00:01:45.480> I<00:01:45.540> got<00:01:45.810> all<00:01:45.960> do<00:01:46.200> a

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
I was first starting out I got all do a

I was first starting out I got all do a
capsule<00:01:46.830> collection<00:01:46.940> because<00:01:47.940> there<00:01:48.630> was

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
capsule collection because there was

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.870 
capsule collection because there was
very<00:01:48.930> limited<00:01:49.140> fabric<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.130> was<00:01:50.310> scared<00:01:50.700> I

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
very limited fabric and I was scared I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.470 
very limited fabric and I was scared I
would<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.300> limited<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.050> be<00:01:53.010> doing<00:01:53.400> fashion<00:01:54.150> you

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
would be limited to be doing fashion you

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.500 
would be limited to be doing fashion you
know<00:01:54.660> with<00:01:55.290> such<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.820> limited<00:01:56.820> palette<00:01:57.120> of

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
know with such a limited palette of

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.020 
know with such a limited palette of
fabrics<00:01:58.050> but<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:59.040> more<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.280> got<00:01:59.520> into<00:01:59.580> and<00:01:59.970> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
fabrics but the more I got into and the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.790 
fabrics but the more I got into and the
more<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.240> was<00:02:00.420> researching<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.260> more<00:02:01.500> I

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
more I was researching it the more I

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.620 
more I was researching it the more I
realized<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:03.030> know<00:02:03.150> it's<00:02:03.360> kind<00:02:03.570> of

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
realized you know it's kind of

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.180 
realized you know it's kind of
ridiculous<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:04.440> do<00:02:04.590> one<00:02:04.800> that's<00:02:05.040> not

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
ridiculous to do one that's not

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.460 
ridiculous to do one that's not
sustainable<00:02:05.520> when<00:02:06.300> that<00:02:06.480> sustainable<00:02:07.140> and

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
sustainable when that sustainable and

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.760 
sustainable when that sustainable and
and<00:02:08.130> I<00:02:08.700> would<00:02:08.970> step<00:02:09.390> up<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.750> challenge<00:02:09.869> of

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
and I would step up to the challenge of

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.610 
and I would step up to the challenge of
doing<00:02:11.100> fashion<00:02:11.700> with<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.930> limitations<00:02:13.560> that

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
doing fashion with the limitations that

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.740 
doing fashion with the limitations that
I<00:02:13.740> have<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.340> seek<00:02:14.550> out<00:02:14.700> more<00:02:14.910> things<00:02:15.180> and

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
I have and seek out more things and

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.600 
I have and seek out more things and
actually<00:02:15.990> do<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.500> full<00:02:16.710> collection<00:02:16.920> as
