00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
why I got some was because my hair at

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.820 
why I got some was because my hair at
the<00:04:21.820> moment<00:04:22.150> isn't<00:04:22.330> very<00:04:23.050> thick<00:04:23.140> it's<00:04:23.590> quite

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
the moment isn't very thick it's quite

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.220 
the moment isn't very thick it's quite
thin<00:04:24.160> and<00:04:24.370> also<00:04:25.090> when<00:04:25.240> I<00:04:25.270> want<00:04:25.480> to<00:04:25.540> curl<00:04:25.810> it<00:04:26.050> and

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
thin and also when I want to curl it and

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.590 
thin and also when I want to curl it and
it<00:04:26.980> goes<00:04:27.310> too<00:04:27.580> short<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.180> just<00:04:28.390> thought<00:04:28.480> out

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
it goes too short and I just thought out

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.260 
it goes too short and I just thought out
the<00:04:28.750> length<00:04:28.930> so<00:04:29.260> I<00:04:29.500> got<00:04:30.190> these<00:04:30.340> these<00:04:30.670> a<00:04:30.730> 20

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270
