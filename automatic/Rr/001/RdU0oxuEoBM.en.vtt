expect<00:01:51.850> 87<00:01:52.850> is<00:01:53.090> because<00:01:53.719> your<00:01:54.139> strikes<00:01:54.469> based

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
expect 87 is because your strikes based

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.529 
expect 87 is because your strikes based
character<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:55.459> you<00:01:55.490> want<00:01:55.759> your<00:01:55.880> supers<00:01:56.299> to<00:01:56.420> do

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
okay first of all let me explain this

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.620 
okay first of all let me explain this
the<00:02:21.830> battle<00:02:22.190> suit<00:02:22.459> time<00:02:22.819> patroller<00:02:23.209> suit<00:02:23.420> and

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
the battle suit time patroller suit and

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.990 
the battle suit time patroller suit and
obviously<00:02:24.230> this<00:02:24.470> battle<00:02:24.800> suit<00:02:24.980> has<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.790> same

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
obviously this battle suit has the same

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.510 
obviously this battle suit has the same
stats<00:02:26.300> they<00:02:26.599> have<00:02:26.810> five<00:02:27.380> in<00:02:27.860> stamina<00:02:28.130> basic

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
stats they have five in stamina basic

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.870 
stats they have five in stamina basic
attack<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:28.880> strike<00:02:29.090> supers<00:02:29.599> see<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.880> the

attack and strike supers see and the

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.370 
attack and strike supers see and the
reason<00:02:31.910> for<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.360> is<00:02:32.600> obviously<00:02:32.930> because<00:02:33.260> you

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
reason for that is obviously because you

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.460 
reason for that is obviously because you
want<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.860> boost<00:02:34.220> what<00:02:34.610> your<00:02:34.880> build

the<00:02:51.040> only<00:02:51.190> difference<00:02:51.520> is<00:02:51.670> that<00:02:51.700> one<00:02:52.060> point<00:02:52.420> if

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
the only difference is that one point if

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.840 
the only difference is that one point if
I<00:02:53.260> were<00:02:53.380> to<00:02:53.500> put<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.770> time<00:02:53.980> petrolia<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.580> here

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
I were to put the time petrolia to here

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.070 
I were to put the time petrolia to here
it<00:02:55.030> wouldn't<00:02:55.270> make<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.420> difference<00:02:55.480> if<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:55.960> were

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
it wouldn't make a difference if I were

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.850 
it wouldn't make a difference if I were
to<00:02:56.140> put<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.350> here<00:02:56.470> would<00:02:56.590> it<00:02:56.650> make<00:02:56.800> a

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
to put it here would it make a

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:57.930 
to put it here would it make a
difference<00:02:56.980> or<00:02:57.340> here<00:02:57.580> wouldn't<00:02:57.790> make<00:02:57.910> a

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
difference or here wouldn't make a

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.580 
difference or here wouldn't make a
difference<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.780> reason<00:02:59.020> I<00:02:59.080> put<00:02:59.230> it<00:02:59.320> here<00:02:59.470> is

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
difference the reason I put it here is

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.510 
difference the reason I put it here is
because<00:02:59.800> I'm<00:02:59.890> the<00:02:59.920> type<00:03:00.100> of<00:03:00.160> person<00:03:00.310> that

with the build that I wanted so that's
what<00:03:11.410> I<00:03:11.440> did<00:03:11.530> I<00:03:12.010> wasn't<00:03:12.670> gonna<00:03:12.790> put<00:03:13.030> everything

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
strike supers at 87 88 89 90 for the Z

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.530 
strike supers at 87 88 89 90 for the Z
sole<00:05:01.740> whoops<00:05:02.550> that's<00:05:02.670> not<00:05:02.790> to<00:05:02.970> do<00:05:03.090> so<00:05:03.270> for<00:05:03.510> the

Z sole then um 90 plus five 95 100 105
and<00:05:11.940> then<00:05:12.330> a<00:05:12.360> hundred<00:05:12.810> and<00:05:12.990> six<00:05:13.620> seven<00:05:13.770> eight

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
and then a hundred and six seven eight

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.180 
and then a hundred and six seven eight
nine<00:05:14.100> 109<00:05:15.030> so<00:05:15.630> that's<00:05:15.990> why<00:05:16.200> everything<00:05:16.710> is<00:05:16.920> the

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
nine 109 so that's why everything is the

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.420 
nine 109 so that's why everything is the
way<00:05:17.220> it<00:05:17.490> is

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
way it is

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.500 
way it is
yeah<00:05:20.430> that's<00:05:20.700> why<00:05:20.790> everything<00:05:21.120> it<00:05:21.180> is<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:21.300> way

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
yeah that's why everything it is the way

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.210 
yeah that's why everything it is the way
it<00:05:21.630> is<00:05:21.720> that's<00:05:21.960> exactly<00:05:22.170> why<00:05:22.770> this<00:05:22.830> is<00:05:23.010> the

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
it is that's exactly why this is the

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.640 
it is that's exactly why this is the
best<00:05:23.370> build<00:05:23.640> because<00:05:23.910> your<00:05:24.330> strike<00:05:25.290> supers<00:05:25.530> go

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
best build because your strike supers go

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.050 
best build because your strike supers go
over<00:05:25.980> a<00:05:26.010> hundred<00:05:26.130> and<00:05:26.430> everything<00:05:26.700> else<00:05:26.850> is

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
over a hundred and everything else is

over a hundred and everything else is
either<00:05:27.240> at<00:05:27.480> or<00:05:27.750> close<00:05:28.080> to<00:05:28.110> 80<00:05:28.640> or<00:05:29.640> above<00:05:30.320> so

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320
