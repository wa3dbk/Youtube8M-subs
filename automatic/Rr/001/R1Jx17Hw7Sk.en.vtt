00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:10.089
 Yes, this time I am ak onset of the screen looks like this flat-screen tablet 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:15.249
 It is very small compared to the size of the hand 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:19.700
 Which dicom communication in a wi-fi environment with such a tablet PC 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:22.840
 It will be to verify that it would do much of the speed comes out 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:26.050
 It is precious this time that I have been using for a long time 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.140
 100 in windows 864 bits 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.279
 It familiar windows 8 is useless 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.840
 Raise -based pack search from the 64-bit 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.860
 It is the eighth place quite early 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:45.920
 Inspection is such example which put Let's doing voice voice mirror 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:51.020
 I 'm almost obscuring the hospital data, but it's quite fast, so this current situation 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.890
 Well , it looks like this kind of taplet. 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.510
 a 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:01:00.079
 Though it says I exchanging Pax and data I see another nationally fine 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.640
 Well then , if you're really looking at the dicom image, that 's not the case 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.900
 It is almost what 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:11.580
 The wi-fi environment is very slow. 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:17.010
 It is from the server machine that the transfer speed does not come out so much 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:23.160
 dicom Compress information from dicom image into jpeg and convert it 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:26.890
 Send it to a tablet and watch the jpeg images as a slide show on the tablet side 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.610
 Most of it Rutteyuu not see it in the application 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:36.060
 I mean you are looking at jpeg 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:41.040
 Well not this time this kind of tablet PC os is windows 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:46.300
 Actually thought the one by one in the wi-fi environment using this 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:52.770
 I will try to exchange dicom images with wi-fi 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.770
 Well you read the experimental patient data such as put out in Oyaguchi 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:05.200
 Yes, 200 images are included in this 2 million yen How much carpenter actually communicate by how much 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.200
 It's speed or no 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.240
 I 'm preparing to top off 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.840
 Then a 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.319
 You can think you lowered stopwatch would like to load 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.969
 start 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.960
 Yes 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:21.550
 It started after a year 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:27.020
 It is rare this time 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:33.600
 It is a manufacturer named Arthur Iconia w 700 d 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:38.740
 cp is love 5 memory is ddr 3 4 gig 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:44.520
 Oh, I forgot a little hard- ssd's 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:46.910
 A little north and south now be read more and more be read I Kedomo not forget 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.660
 We weave about 1 million yen 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.030
 Time to the 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:57.030
 35 seconds 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:59.690
 Crispy fairly smoothly it has gone smoothly is more and more apparent and I operatively 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.690
 will move 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:11.620
 The speed seems to be quite a bit from the speed I usually use after all 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.890
 However, reading is almost finished now, too . 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.520
 stop 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:21.460
 59 seconds 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:26.350
 It 's about 1 minute to see 200 dicom images 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:29.680
 I can not say that this is early though I am 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:35.230
 I think it's not too late 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:41.500
 Kedomo is faster than doing the actual film environment with a film of a wired lan of the environment 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:48.400
 It is a big runaway compared to Pax It is actually this 2 million yen image earlier 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:52.750
 I 'm trying to load on the desktop of the priority south of the gigabit delivery training 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:56.860
 I guess was about 200 sheets about 25 seconds but is 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.180
 This time for 59 seconds under wi-fi environment for tablet PC 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.500
 It has Well takes about twice 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.080
 5 joint movement movement moves considerably 6 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.840
 It is smooth 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.550
 I'm pretty much done 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.740
 Though looking through the image of the video, the image looks rough 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.230
 Actually 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:22.019
 It reflected in the amazing beautiful when viewed from my eyes 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:25.220
 It is an activity of high definition It is very beautiful- 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.220
 I wonder if the movement is good too 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:38.750
 Without any of the changes and the other 2 of Pax can be 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.750
 It is not the function limitation 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.630
 Below 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.630
 Also hear all of the functions of this kind of button 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:53.650
 200 sheets sent to the to 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:58.780
 This one is good 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:02.160
 I think whether it is the judgment of the person who sees or not, but I am not so late 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.160
 It was more than I thought
