00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.270
 you fly over the cliffs in personal flow and 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.469
 earth without interference is a ship in the air 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.829
 cushion 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:14.439
 This unit is used as 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:16.539
 ambulance services in canada do not 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.539
 we will not put up 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.980
 when a ship arrives you can 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.910
 unload and run in seconds 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.910
 brush your teeth 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.860
 developers have installed in the car 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.710
 Only 1 1 5 and the motor that it is not standard for 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.710
 hovercraft 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.350
 Traditionally such vessels have two 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.630
 individual pollock motor 1 for flying 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.680
 on the other for movement 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.850
 light and compact for this car 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.850
 her engine works for two 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.160
 Russia since the genre of devices 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.270
 when you start rome pumps 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.870
 air her air bags attached 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.670
 from him it is necessary 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.920
 air pressure raises the apparatus 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.790
 as the only way out for 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.220
 air will rise the whole car or 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.220
 regional governments to the world 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.360
 rises expired go out to 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.800
 air harvest cushion 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.040
 but you can not 12 forward at this moment 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.560
 other hovercraft 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.560
 includes the second day then for movement 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.060
 because they don't have this one 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.670
 declassified which shares air 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.810
 atlanta stream 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.110
 tons of air flow 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.649
 enough to lift 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.649
 saving the rest for 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.790
 forward movement 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.370
 when sent if you have no problems with 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.530
 by sight 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.510
 so this car needs an engine 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.970
 65 horsepower to develop 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:53.520
 speed 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.520
 70 kilometers per hour 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.260
 yes you can race on a boat but you 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.730
 will have to overcome coach 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.040
 frets and spend more fuel 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.420
 and in this device more from the plane 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.740
 than on the plate for incomplete you 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.769
 does not concern 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.790
 moving on the ground does not cause 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.709
 difficulties 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.239
 flexible skirt with separate 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.030
 air masses rises and 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.530
 falls and ammo everything if 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.760
 one of the bags will tear adjacent 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.760
 close the gaps 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.239
 yes and replace the damaged bag 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.219
 can be very fast like everyone else in 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.219
 this car 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.579
 handle associated with trolls 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.779
 directions 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:51.779
 interference with navigation does not cause problems 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:55.419
 what makes such a technique irreplaceable 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.569
 three rescue operations 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.219
 but what if you just need to do 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:03.219
 stop in the middle of the river 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.879
 this is an ordinary hovercraft 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.689
 can drown out the second screw and 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.010
 hang in place but only with one bandage 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.059
 this will not work 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.879
 but if you turn off the engine 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.760
 then you lose speed pillow and 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.760
 flopped saturday 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.949
 to get around this problem engineers 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:26.079
 borrowed a stronger idea 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.079
 fighter engine 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:31.639
 made a sweet intercept 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.629
 airflow and directs it to 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.719
 vacation period and back literature 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:38.189
 while maintaining air pressure 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.409
 cushion 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.169
 when approaching the purpose of the blade provide 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.090
 exact control of the movement of the vessel 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.019
 and in this position the pressure in the pillow 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.040
 weakens and the deck goes below 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.619
 support 

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:54.039
 dense dense foam keep the device on 

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:55.159
 afloat while injured 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.159
 get aboard 

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:01.109
 while the screw is gaining momentum 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.639
 put in the reverse position 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.659
 thrust then they turn their face 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.659
 forward analyst 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:12.839
 when creating this rescue ship 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:14.749
 hovercraft developers 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:16.239
 violated several rules 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.009
 however, it turned out light and compact 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.159
 what you need in emergency situations 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:24.399
 the floor of the steep aircraft and ships 

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:26.580
 immediately appears where 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.389
 every second counts
