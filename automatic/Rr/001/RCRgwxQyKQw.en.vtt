 portal glass and finger all mobile 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.240
 hello on glafi.com hello 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.310
 friends with you hoops 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.250
 and we'll talk about the British today 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.230
 average tank 8 levla centurion mark 1 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.539
 if in a nutshell then this tank 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.460
 superior tool with low alpha well 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.679
 high rate of fire just 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.219
 great gun mask but all 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.600
 the rest is sadness armor corps 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.180
 absolutely no maximum speed 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.489
 low turns too slower than 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.079
 classmates d size just huge 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.480
 so aiming centurion is not 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.629
 is of particular difficulty and light it 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.620
 quite easy but a gun in my opinion 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.350
 completely covers all these disadvantages 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.730
 let's start here as a detailed review 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.710
 tactical and technical characteristics of the center 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.079
 he has an excellent weapon 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.050
 of which only one drawback is 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.059
 low alpha of 190 durability a 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.310
 all other indicators are superior 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.290
 guns classmates and in terms of 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.720
 potential damage he and not much 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.890
 loses 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.860
 armor penetration 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.979
 shells as much as there are 26 millimeters 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.049
 that allows you to punch even e75 in nld with 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.500
 average distance that cannot but 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.110
 to please 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.900
 so you can punch classmates 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.360
 no problem not to mention how 6 and 7 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.700
 left ala high rate of fire 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.229
 best among classmates allows 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.240
 keep opponents on the gusla 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.520
 high accuracy will allow to do it 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.650
 even more distance to you that 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.710
 importantly, as the armor of the centurion 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.110
 March 12 almost completely no well about it 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.549
 a little bit later one more 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.500
 remarkable feature of guns 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.110
 is the high declination angle of the gun 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.030
 equal to 10 degrees and since this 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.310
 Tank simply brutally armored tower 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.399
 then a very effective tactic will be 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.799
 game from the folds of the area 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.469
 what can I generally say about kind but 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.329
 the most comfortable among me older than 8 lago 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.640
 about bug breaking high accuracy 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.590
 are the main advantages well 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.020
 for those who like to bang harder with 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.290
 big alpha will have to temper your ardor 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.989
 and learn how to target caterpillars 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.950
 then you will love this instrument for sure 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.959
 now on armor 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.719
 starting with this review I will be clearly 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.659
 show model booking tank as 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:27.120
 you see hull armor absolutely no 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.670
 although the angles are good but the thickness is only 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.590
 76 millimeters and allow the machine tool 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.379
 classmates projectile whatever you 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.109
 Turning and here are the sixth and seventh la 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.090
 it was quite possible and not to pierce but not 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:41.579
 forget that centurion throws and 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.040
 tenth in bulk so forget that 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.260
 is to drag the hull and there 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.159
 will fly in with full damage enviable 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.500
 by persistence 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.419
 but here's what center can it effectively 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.419
 to dance this is his strong tower 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:56.069
 the thickest among classmates armor 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:56.819
 there are two hundred and twenty six 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.829
 millimeters 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.900
 do not consider the mask of the instrument which 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.269
 covers almost the entire tower 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.340
 while still having a thickness of 200 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.840
 millimeters in the center and 100 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.060
 millimeters above and below 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.400
 so punch there to anyone 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.989
 almost impossible even tenths 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.870
 caught cars rushing to her, you can of course 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.879
 if they are not on goldy good angles 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.590
 the declination of the gun will allow 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.229
 case from the layouts of the area 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.419
 so try not to get out at war on 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:25.139
 opponent and stay away on 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.569
 second line 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.069
 we realize the possibilities of a great tool 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.680
 as carefully as possible 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.810
 another factor due to which 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.239
 need to play neat thoughtfully 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.370
 these are centurion tank sizes not only 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.590
 easy to target buildings distance in his 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.720
 vulnerable body but also very easy 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.569
 light up because the indicator 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.549
 masking depends on the size of the tank well 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.220
 now only a couple remains to talk 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.829
 centurionâ€™s dynamics are worst among 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.079
 classmates only 40 kilometers per hour 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.239
 maximum speed of course it is 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.629
 more than heavy tanks 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:04.199
 but not much, and strima and 38 kilometers in 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:07.199
 an hour t32 has 35 well a royal tiger in 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:09.449
 update 1 and 5 also got 38 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:11.549
 kilometers per hour and think about what 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:14.250
 it will be possible to leave it hurries the enemy 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.289
 and forget it anyway so if you 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.310
 accidentally or mistakenly entered 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:20.280
 epicenter of labor 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.680
 then they won't let you go from there but 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.020
 power density is 16 horses per 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.139
 ton and quite comfortable for overclocking and 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.569
 lifting in the mountain 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.699
 he turns his big carcass 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:33.280
 centurion is also the worst classmates 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.259
 turning index equal to 36 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.479
 degrees as for the hull and for 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:40.419
 towers if we talk about gameplay 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.680
 that sadyrin mark 1 whole tank 2 or 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.319
 even 3 lines 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.840
 so break out on it somewhere very 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:48.189
 and a very stupid idea nashpiguyut in the body 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.199
 just mom don't worry 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:51.759
 but to realize beautiful 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.069
 characteristics of the instrument from behind 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.449
 allies or folds terrain trying 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:57.999
 while not substitute your big 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.599
 cannon the most effective tactic for 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:01.900
 victories 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:04.029
 can also play like on pt that is 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.310
 long distance and trying not 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:09.129
 light up but on these boring this somehow 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.830
 centurion mark 1 is capable of more 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:13.960
 today the battle unfortunately will not be as 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.779
 the capture program is still very 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.240
 tupit but tonight will be more 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:21.310
 one video so subscribe to my 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.129
 channel like if you like it 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.310
 This video on its was Hafs until soon 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:26.310
 meeting
