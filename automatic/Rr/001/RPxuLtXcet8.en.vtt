00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:09.390
 with 677 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.640
 the one who forgives how they are here the preserve 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.860
 motriz I already bring you a tutorial of how 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:18.560
 start playing minecraft 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.599
 the beginning 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.050
 start like this is gentlemen let's play 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:26.300
 how to start playing minecraft and have 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.039
 everything you need in such a short time what 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.770
 least possible no that's a tutorial 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.689
 express we will see what I can many people 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.910
 does not know how to play badly created many say no 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.829
 I like the game etc. and so on 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.550
 that I come with you for this 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.129
 to teach the basics of minecraft 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.530
 we found a temple to a minimum that chido 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.729
 well we'll leave that for later 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.710
 first the first thing they have to do 

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:51.839
 it's obviously looking for more green either from 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.530
 any kind of import cut with the 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:59.270
 no hand have nothing nothing wrong 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.490
 do so because 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.320
 it's the simplest thing, it does not lack more time 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.740
 obviously make your anti tools 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.330
 all but there is a tree for example this 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.790
 try to be close to where there is a 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.300
 mine in this case there's good back we go 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.870
 to put this that touches us and this is the 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.600
 luck crafting character I have the 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.570
 we puts more and here we do not 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.900
 going down they make sticks we have one 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.610
 and another stick and we make a pick 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.580
 only one of our theses passes 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.170
 is that those two express really do not 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.610
 I can stop to tell you what I can with 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.130
 the peak is obviously going to apply all 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.100
 kind of garlic mouth et cetera et cetera 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.240
 this is going to do a small upgrade 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.030
 let's turn into stone is equal 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.990
 sticks and how are they clark if we are going to 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.530
 this 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.340
 and we will continue to give here the cost 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.290
 necessary to do all the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.829
 tools and to tell you more or 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.390
 less what is each one for? 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.859
 excellent look here we find hoop we 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.579
 they can sting with the stone peak 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:01.579
 Thank you 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.490
 excellent the most support I think this 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.569
 Express tutorial will be 5 minutes or 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:14.410
 except that I already had not all this stone 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.960
 we can do more things we can take 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.710
 to 0 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.710
 an axe 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.050
 a roast 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.660
 as they say in your country or in your region 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.180
 a word 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.170
 I recommend that you first make the peak 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.489
 of wood and with what they sting of stone 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.440
 they already do all stone tools 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:44.650
 never make their wooden elements 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.650
 is this one did not make sword 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.730
 in order or not that does not matter we're going to 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.730
 take a little more d 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.129
 of capstone 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.569
 we take out 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.269
 let's do a Mormon 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.519
 possible fast we take the oven can 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.700
 spend there in the castle we also put 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.099
 the cattle air is sewn with wood and 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.780
 that blowjob although we're going to use the 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.730
 talk is cut faster from the wood 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.730
 obviously also encouraging 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.220
 sorry 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:29.030
 although it is for being very soon excellent 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.030
 what we are going to do here 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.900
 we go to a little house to pass the first 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.900
 night 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:44.730
 it's beginners proportions 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.739
 if you want my problem is that you throw yourself 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.319
 I know you're going to comment on everything 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.530
 silly 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.200
 it's a basic tutorial we're going to cut 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.120
 this mom of each month will give us a 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.060
 little bit that if what you want is in the 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.499
 tools for example we have here the 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.049
 word to remove the earth from the 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:05.689
 sand of the initial program aggravates a lot 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.849
 faster than any other field like that 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:11.340
 who can use it are table what I 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:14.599
 I make a shovel but well that's for 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.599
 in order to be 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.660
 are the educational ones 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.330
 Excellent 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.700
 if you realize how the trees italy 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.340
 if you leave the leaves they throw them 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.780
 our calls you can plant the 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.700
 tribunes 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.150
 excellent perfect what we can do 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:42.020
 next mind is a door a compass 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.310
 6 excellent wood we put it 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.210
 perfect 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.210
 let's take more wood 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.729
 they realize this medium difficulty so 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.680
 that there is no problem like food 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.860
 things could be said to be difficulty 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.860
 normal 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.750
 Excellent 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.460
 excellent excellent we have to touch 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.710
 this we put all this chaos and 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.610
 let's finish our super super super 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.820
 Super House 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.820
 our house 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:27.710
 excellent is any house no 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:31.410
 they need to make a drop mom or anything 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:34.320
 only a quiet passive house without 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.450
 so much blowjob gamepro commenting on 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.220
 reality no no no matter what of that 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:42.030
 do it 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.030
 really since this 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.890
 just be very close to a click 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:51.130
 but the pharmacy can burst it but 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:54.130
 well already being here we have to iron and 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.320
 they are conceived and everything is ready here we go 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.820
 to have contact that we had five 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.680
 minutes is all that we may have 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.630
 taught tutorials everything you have 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.210
 what to have for more 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.820
 a beginner's house never entered 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.510
 let's see that here it will be nothing more 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.510
 bullshit 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.740
 vanquish blogs that is following me 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:23.430
 flaps and let's see that from here 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.430
 probably nothing 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:40.610
 and it's all for those followers who 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:42.620
 they come from 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.750
 I do not know how good to see from the channel 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:48.080
 silly or something like that 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:51.250
 do not worry 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.250
 they say tuna 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.590
 so 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.590
 that we already have here 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.980
 that 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.220
 and then he took them to that age and 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.930
 they say that I already have them and I have them here 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.930
 for anything goodbye
