00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:11.390
 Now, Ryujin City supports circulatory dynamics that have been up to this time 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:15.680
 The summary is the full load high load myocardial contraction force that I have done so far 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:18.920
 I'm learning to each other each heart rate these 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.360
 For example, a patient who is bleeding or bleeding 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.420
 Want duty used if Kana heart rate 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:28.320
 Isn't it early? 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:35.070
 If circulation blood volume decreases by dehydration or bleeding 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:37.230
 If the tax department is to be reduced, it will move quickly to compensate for the reduced amount and the circulatory dynamics will be broken. 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.350
 I will try to support you 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:46.989
 But it is not only that I know the important part even with small blood volume 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:50.379
 Peripheral vascular entered to send the Rikyu cake is contracted to try to keep blood pressure 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:55.000
 So I want to packed When I touch the hands and feet at such time 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:01:00.129
 Blood vessel becomes difficult for even flow determination machine if the contraction not come heat also carried is in 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.340
 If from and it's of course but doing so shrinks the blood vessels heart 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.980
 2 after contraction 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:09.870
 I think that the effect is increasing because 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:12.600
 You're probably supposed that the myocardial contraction is also getting stronger 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.290
 I just do not understand just looking from the outside 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.880
 So now is the time of patients with congestive heart failure 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:25.110
 I think that is faster and go I think that happened heart rate Wow 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:29.549
 Well, I did a congestive heart failure with anime though 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.590
 It is a heavy burden for the heart because all clothes are strong 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:38.200
 A lot of blood is accumulated in the heart by animation and it is painful 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.729
 As dying into the heart by moving more and more heart because I remember I had been saying 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.659
 I try to 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:47.109
 Speaking of anime, I also went to other blood distribution shocks 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:52.030
 It occurs as a side effect of bees and as a side effect of contrast agents 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:52.610
 There is anaphylactic shock , but peripheral blood vessels open 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.140
 Even anime 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:00.950
 As expected, the blood vessels spread and the effect is decreasing. 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.520
 Do you remember the state of the heart when the high load dropped 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:09.009
 Certainly it became easier 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:12.580
 The heart has eased, so it's natural that the blood resistance is getting less 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:17.319
 But in this case too, blood pressure drops 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:22.090
 The pulse is getting faster and the heart muscle contraction should be getting stronger 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.510
 I as a company it is necessary to say to contract the blood vessels, such as catheter Gora people 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.040
 Then there is the next 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.819
 A guy who doesn't do it in a will go, but if you hold the basics in place you will surely understand 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.640
 I from 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:37.159
 So next time sportsman heart sports well i usually do intense training 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:43.190
 So there is a high demand for blood 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:43.500
 Sportsman's muscles always want a lot of blood and oxygen . 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.630
 Okay 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:53.970
 Let's send oxygen more and more into the body When the heart is working hard 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:57.000
 Myocardium in the heart is becoming larger, that is, the myocardial contraction power is increased 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:01.350
 Even when you are not doing regular exercise 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.520
 Normal heart rate is 60 to 80 pes if it is our case 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:09.640
 I did so much blood in about 1 minute 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:12.100
 I can do a normal life at last by doing, but it is powerful 40 times with a power- up heart 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:19.150
 You only need so few times 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:25.420
 Commentary on Myocardial Contraction Force There are some medicines that lower the cardiac muscle contraction force at the time of animation. 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:26.500
 It is necessary to make special treatment if it is turbid because myocardium contraction is too strong or science will fall. 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.090
 Not 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:36.110
 But if there is a person who does not look like a sportsman around everyone , the pulse rate will blow 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:41.360
 If there was no such thing, it might be better to go to the hospital 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.519
 a the person I'd pulse in my acquaintance has some people are saying saying 40 times 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.330
 It did not look like a sportsman 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:52.200
 It might be better to proceed with real in person hospital 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:56.310
 That's what kind of relative's aunt It does not look true 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:01.769
 Well that's why full load stiffening myocardial contraction force 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:05.459
 Heart rate These are balanced in an exquisite way and support Kyun impressed 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:08.489
 Then once again I look back with the child 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:12.220
 If blood is not enough, infusion and blood transfusion 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:17.049
 It's entering to be personable for Tteyuu 4 hole by surgery in some cases 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:23.830
 Conversely , if blood is increasing due to blood stasis, etc. 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:27.010
 When the blood vessels that use nitrate medicine are narrow and the heart is under pressure, they are spread out and the blood vessels spread in reverse. 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:32.210
 If you are enjoying your heart too much, you can 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:38.060
 And if you want to lower your cardiac contraction, there are those medicines and your heart rate 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.960
 Doing very so does it or lowering raised in response to adjust to good condition by these four factors 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.060
 Going 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:46.460
 By the way, if the heart rate does not rise even if you use medicine, what should I do? 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:51.440
 If a drug is useless 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:56.449
 Sur 2 or yes it's a cardiac pacemaker surgery 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:05:01.669
 What part did this medicine support in this way? 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:06.319
 The point of observation is so clear that you can do a habit of thinking 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.480
 I will study without giving up without being able to become a nurse who can 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:12.960
 Five 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:17.310
 The treatment of is going to care what usually is not limited to the circulatory If you can understand the four factors to support the hemodynamics 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:20.510
 Do your best, because there will be a lot of points going on in order to understand 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.510
 Don't miss it
