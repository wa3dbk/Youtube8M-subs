00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 for the ovation from the south we are with a 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.160
 group of people not only fans 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.290
 amateurs who have come here to 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.820
 calls supposedly while it's 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.049
 Certain there are few people but we are going to 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.330
 talk to some of them 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.550
 then how this lady has come to this 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.880
 call because simply in 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.230
 against that there are abuses they tell us and for 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.300
 Of course, the team is not 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.369
 answering if I really like 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.640
 arequipeño that I am I feel indignant 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.759
 with how are being the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.329
 destinations of our beloved club Bergamo 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.329
 the truth that 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.610
 I feel disappointed and sad to see 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.170
 How is taking this as 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.210
 they say there is no evil that lasts a hundred years nor 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.600
 body that resists it I do not expect that 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.910
 that this is over someday is not 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.230
 mission of polar is like a cancer that 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.230
 is slowly destroying 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.460
 you already know about the administration 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.000
 this year's season more we do not know 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.700
 when will it turn out good not what I know is 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.509
 that in a while he's going to eat 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.300
 has a new club creditor up 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:14.560
 January this year 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:19.010
 Mr. Bengolea made a modification 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.390
 in the law and only as of January the 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.320
 temporary friendships of the clubs 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.600
 can take 5% of the club's units 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.400
 but last year was treated like the 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.840
 big mistakes last year more or 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.160
 less the same temporary charged 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.200
 around 30 thousand dollars monthly 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.590
 now to temporary permits the new 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.380
 creditor of the club and when they 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.060
 go that what more than 300 thousand dollars 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.490
 that can be reviewed on the internet 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.510
 can check in the pages of 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.230
 internet is information that is 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.380
 free from the law of the law that was published 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.750
 at the beginning of January 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.300
 luisina business now clubs 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.340
 it's not very profitable anymore so you can 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.710
 put on that has waived only 5 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.470
 percent useful and that when melgar is 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.880
 around 55 thousand dollars monthly 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.500
 that's why it's not, it's not very affordable 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.870
 very not very juicy then 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.180
 this the logical thing would be not if you want 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.490
 charge more to generate income to improve 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.760
 for you if you're depending on your 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:25.390
 income but I do not see anything left 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.970
 for generating more income I do not see no 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.590
 I see management good management I do not see that 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.480
 have looked for more sponsor I do not see that 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.940
 there is a here they are enabling more 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.760
 chips the theme of the shirts do not see 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.090
 nothing is the same then one without 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.560
 want to finish is in this situation was 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.530
 good thanks to the opinion then 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.030
 I hope that the equipment and the 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.890
 responsibility falls also on the 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.730
 Stop management of course 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.920
 we are like all the fans and also 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.770
 I think it belongs to the downside I do not know how 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.620
 it's good if it makes us belong 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.660
 to the south lion bar we 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.390
 we found outraged and we wanted 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.250
 make a complaint through you 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.890
 because the police abuse so much 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.930
 like that of the curators can only 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.690
 Lieutenants goes against the bar 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.130
 always what is going on we go to the 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.440
 stadium to encourage our team 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.780
 with drums with banderoles 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.570
 and they come with the rods and we 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.840
 they take off they do not grab at palazos we do not 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.810
 our fabrics break the shirts 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.370
 you belong to families of 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.740
 Arequipa, you are not any kind of 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.010
 maladaptive the criminals some 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.170
 Sometimes tildan this way and not 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.480
 is it really provokes let's say this 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.010
 attitude when you passively 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.530
 move for example from here from local 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.280
 to the stadium who provoke are 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.350
 the policemen if we are clearly 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.020
 arequipeños or are not I do not know what is it 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.540
 what happens with the police or in the real 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.770
 they really want a confrontation 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.720
 against us because we are going 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.750
 peaceful so peacefully at 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.820
 stadium without any reason for aggression and 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.520
 they get off their cars and they attack us 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.750
 with the rods 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:15.630
 without making any kind of excesses 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.300
 nothing like that simply to you 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.690
 mistreat bullets that of 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:24.630
 suddenly let's say you are busy on the street 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.390
 and going to battle without any kind of 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.640
 consideration grab us do not consider 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.310
 that there are women there can be children of 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.920
 11 years 10 years old, they are caught 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.500
 kicks pass the hand to women 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.500
 that are there encouraging your team and 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.480
 even so we continue with that that in 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.160
 As for the sitting also facing 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.200
 to the whole of the Lima alliance 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.090
 here is another one of the members of 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.280
 the bar they have charged more than a 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.140
 normal person yes good very good very 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.320
 good morning of that day for example 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.420
 They charged three suns to the barristas 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.130
 when in fact it should charge you like 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.380
 a normal person since we are going 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.870
 to encourage the team and we give 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.240
 our throat in the grandstand and the 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.110
 Portal administration should do 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.510
 a kind of 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.910
 and things so that the bar can enter 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.850
 with a normal input and 2 by 1 masters 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.410
 as it was done before but during this 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.140
 year the temporary administration has 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.640
 started talking and let's just say 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.130
 before there was a video to download what 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.600
 that were the previous leaders 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.000
 but now with temporary administration 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.170
 They have made the silvers were also 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.940
 give for the sun less are giving the 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:34.510
 ease of two for one but in 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:37.870
 particular alliance is like those of the 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.550
 temporary domination are from Lima and believe 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.440
 that the melgar is a team of lime not 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.380
 it's so bad and they make the tickets 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.430
 they can cost a lot more and it's very bad 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.170
 for the melgar panel 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.240
 and I'm sure they also take it a little 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.910
 wrong the fact that they have asked in some 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.890
 moment you come back love to this kind of 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.500
 attitudes can suddenly be the 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.460
 answer to this yes because good 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.670
 for example for us 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.220
 zamora yes to a better team like this to a 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.840
 better to play a little better but 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.970
 also what seems like the only 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.090
 major culprit perhaps in the setting 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:14.000
 temporary because they have for example 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.650
 due to get sponsors bonuses so that 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.170
 the team can have more budget and 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.000
 well to be able to bring better players 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.080
 because as we are now we are not going to 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.870
 to be able to face a good cup 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.730
 South American and we will be ashamed 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.350
 we should get more players a 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.160
 good level for like the first place 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.400
 we want to classify a cup 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.070
 South American good thanks in any case 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.920
 and another call this kind who 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:39.170
 will do when not yet not recent 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.240
 and will communicate with all the people to 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.680
 schedule a caravan you are already 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.540
 will inform on the radio at least of 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.250
 communication hopefully the attitude of the 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.930
 police then change in this regard 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.250
 because there are no misfits 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.440
 no criminals simply 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.510
 they want the team to go well with what 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.650
 that if the police sometimes 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.870
 think that we are about 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.980
 offenders we do to others and 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.540
 the only thing we do excellent from 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.010
 our team of our loves as 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.960
 any other under this one of others 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.970
 equipment that sometimes infiltrates 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.560
 some misfits hopefully this 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.420
 change let's make it known in 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.940
 our environment and thank you very much for having 

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.060
 Let us express our opinion in your 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.060
 time
