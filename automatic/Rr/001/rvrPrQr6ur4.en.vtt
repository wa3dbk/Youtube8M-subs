00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
hi this is James from mission and today

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.079 
hi this is James from mission and today
we're<00:00:04.259> talking<00:00:04.380> about<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.950> mission<00:00:05.160> EP<00:00:05.819> one

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.110 
we're talking about the mission EP one
l6<00:00:06.750> expression<00:00:07.440> pedal<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:08.519> setting<00:00:08.910> it<00:00:09.030> up

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
l6 expression pedal and setting it up

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.480 
l6 expression pedal and setting it up
the<00:00:09.929> m13<00:00:10.679> stompbox<00:00:11.400> Morlock<00:00:11.849> from<00:00:12.540> line<00:00:12.750> 6<00:00:13.490> so

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
the m13 stompbox Morlock from line 6 so

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:47.900 
the m13 stompbox Morlock from line 6 so
let's<00:00:14.700> get<00:00:14.849> started

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.630 

so<00:00:48.910> here<00:00:49.150> we<00:00:49.270> have<00:00:49.420> two<00:00:49.660> mission<00:00:50.410> ep<00:00:50.800> 1<00:00:50.830> l6

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
so here we have two mission ep 1 l6

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.080 
so here we have two mission ep 1 l6
expression<00:00:52.240> pals<00:00:52.860> connected<00:00:53.860> to<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.160> m13

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
expression pals connected to the m13

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.010 
expression pals connected to the m13
stompbox<00:00:55.630> more<00:00:55.900> like<00:00:57.660> one<00:00:58.660> of<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.840> nice

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
stompbox more like one of the nice

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.080 
stompbox more like one of the nice
things<00:00:59.050> about<00:00:59.380> the<00:00:59.680> m13<00:01:00.280> and<00:01:00.520> any<00:01:00.790> of<00:01:00.970> the

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
things about the m13 and any of the

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.400 
things about the m13 and any of the
light<00:01:01.300> sex<00:01:02.340> product<00:01:03.340> is<00:01:03.520> they<00:01:03.790> use<00:01:04.089> a<00:01:04.570> standard

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
light sex product is they use a standard

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.920 
light sex product is they use a standard
model<00:01:05.800> cable<00:01:06.220> to<00:01:07.030> connect<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:07.420> expression

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
model cable to connect the expression

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.680 
model cable to connect the expression
pattern<00:01:08.230> most<00:01:09.220> expression<00:01:09.790> pedal<00:01:10.060> interfaces

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
pattern most expression pedal interfaces

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.060 
pattern most expression pedal interfaces
use<00:01:10.900> a<00:01:11.340> TRS<00:01:12.340> stereo<00:01:12.760> cable<00:01:13.260> but<00:01:14.260> light<00:01:14.740> sex

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
use a TRS stereo cable but light sex

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.300 
use a TRS stereo cable but light sex
just<00:01:15.340> requires<00:01:15.760> a<00:01:15.850> regular<00:01:16.630> mono<00:01:16.930> okay<00:01:17.920> so<00:01:18.250> you

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
just requires a regular mono okay so you

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.280 
just requires a regular mono okay so you
can<00:01:18.520> use<00:01:18.550> a<00:01:19.770> patch<00:01:20.770> cable<00:01:21.040> guitar<00:01:22.000> cable<00:01:22.479> and

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
can use a patch cable guitar cable and

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.250 
can use a patch cable guitar cable and
it<00:01:23.410> will<00:01:23.500> work<00:01:23.650> just<00:01:23.680> fine<00:01:24.070> in<00:01:25.050> this<00:01:26.050> case

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
it will work just fine in this case

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.040 
it will work just fine in this case
we're<00:01:26.470> using<00:01:26.500> mission<00:01:27.070> cables<00:01:27.460> which<00:01:27.580> have<00:01:27.760> a

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
we're using mission cables which have a

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.400 
we're using mission cables which have a
right-angle<00:01:29.050> jack<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:30.369> the<00:01:30.430> pale<00:01:30.670> side<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:32.320> a

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
right-angle jack on the pale side and a

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.000 
right-angle jack on the pale side and a
straight<00:01:32.940> Jacquelyn<00:01:33.940> side<00:01:34.150> but<00:01:35.010> any

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
straight Jacquelyn side but any

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.200 
straight Jacquelyn side but any
instrument<00:01:36.610> cabling<00:01:36.970> do<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:37.240> trick

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
instrument cabling do the trick

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.260 
instrument cabling do the trick
once<00:01:40.210> you've<00:01:40.390> connected<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.990> two<00:01:41.020> pedals<00:01:41.530> up

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
once you've connected the two pedals up

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.500 
once you've connected the two pedals up
you<00:01:43.270> need<00:01:43.390> to<00:01:43.570> configure<00:01:44.320> the<00:01:44.470> panels<00:01:44.950> in<00:01:45.510> the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
you need to configure the panels in the

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.320 
you need to configure the panels in the
m13<00:01:47.170> setup<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.790> let's<00:01:48.970> take<00:01:49.210> a<00:01:49.240> look<00:01:49.420> at<00:01:49.570> that

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
m13 setup so let's take a look at that

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.940 
m13 setup so let's take a look at that
so<00:01:52.330> here<00:01:52.540> we're<00:01:52.720> looking<00:01:52.750> at<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.200> display<00:01:53.620> on

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
so here we're looking at the display on

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.230 
so here we're looking at the display on
FX<00:01:54.520> 1<00:01:54.850> on<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.690> m13<00:01:56.380> and<00:01:57.340> it's<00:01:57.490> in<00:01:57.640> normal<00:01:58.060> mode

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
FX 1 on the m13 and it's in normal mode

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.410 
FX 1 on the m13 and it's in normal mode
right<00:01:58.540> now<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:59.080> we<00:01:59.860> have<00:01:59.950> FX<00:02:00.610> 1<00:02:00.820> setup<00:02:01.180> for<00:02:01.360> a

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
right now and we have FX 1 setup for a

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.710 
right now and we have FX 1 setup for a
volume<00:02:01.630> panel<00:02:02.700> why<00:02:03.700> don't<00:02:03.880> do<00:02:04.120> now<00:02:04.270> is<00:02:04.450> hold

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
volume panel why don't do now is hold

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.800 
volume panel why don't do now is hold
down<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:05.230> hold<00:02:05.830> for<00:02:06.100> setup<00:02:06.340> button<00:02:06.880> which<00:02:07.180> is

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
down the hold for setup button which is

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.009 
down the hold for setup button which is
also<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.140> looper<00:02:08.619> control<00:02:08.980> button<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:10.019> we

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
also the looper control button and we

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.660 
also the looper control button and we
just<00:02:11.230> hold<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:11.530> down<00:02:11.560> for<00:02:11.709> couple<00:02:12.160> of<00:02:12.190> seconds

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
just hold it down for couple of seconds

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.920 
just hold it down for couple of seconds
and<00:02:14.459> it<00:02:15.459> brings<00:02:15.640> up<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.000> expression<00:02:16.360> pedals

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
and it brings up the expression pedals

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.340 
and it brings up the expression pedals
setup<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:18.489> here's<00:02:19.360> where<00:02:19.570> you<00:02:19.690> set<00:02:19.930> up<00:02:19.959> which

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
setup and here's where you set up which

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.320 
setup and here's where you set up which
expression<00:02:21.010> pedal<00:02:21.510> controls<00:02:22.510> which<00:02:22.840> FX<00:02:23.290> unit

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
expression pedal controls which FX unit

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.910 
expression pedal controls which FX unit
and<00:02:25.330> we<00:02:25.420> have<00:02:25.570> 2<00:02:25.780> expression<00:02:26.350> pedals<00:02:26.680> in<00:02:26.769> this

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
and we have 2 expression pedals in this

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.250 
and we have 2 expression pedals in this
demo<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.519> for<00:02:27.820> simplicity's<00:02:28.600> sake<00:02:28.810> I've<00:02:29.049> just

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
demo and for simplicity's sake I've just

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.810 
demo and for simplicity's sake I've just
said<00:02:29.470> FX<00:02:30.400> 1<00:02:30.670> for<00:02:31.269> pedal<00:02:31.540> 1<00:02:31.830> FX<00:02:32.830> 2<00:02:32.950> foot<00:02:33.280> pedal<00:02:33.580> 2

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
said FX 1 for pedal 1 FX 2 foot pedal 2

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.210

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
and switch 3 &amp; 4 off but here you can

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.770 
and switch 3 &amp; 4 off but here you can
set<00:02:40.650> expression<00:02:41.650> pedal<00:02:41.950> 1<00:02:42.130> &amp;<00:02:42.370> 2<00:02:42.519> to<00:02:43.360> control

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.229 
any of the effects unions and if you
just<00:02:46.900> had<00:02:47.080> one<00:02:47.110> expression<00:02:48.040> pedal<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:48.970> you

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
just had one expression pedal and you

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.580 
just had one expression pedal and you
want<00:02:49.420> it<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.570> be<00:02:49.780> able<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:50.049> control

all of the effects units with that one

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.040 
all of the effects units with that one
you<00:02:53.019> just<00:02:53.290> set<00:02:53.500> all<00:02:53.739> of<00:02:53.769> these<00:02:54.569> effects<00:02:55.569> units

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
you just set all of these effects units

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.220 
you just set all of these effects units
with<00:02:56.590> paddle<00:02:56.950> one<00:02:59.280> as<00:03:00.280> I<00:03:00.310> say<00:03:00.550> for<00:03:00.730> this<00:03:00.819> demo

we'll<00:03:02.230> stick<00:03:02.650> with<00:03:03.239> FX<00:03:04.239> one<00:03:04.450> set<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.900> paddle<00:03:05.170> 1

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
we'll stick with FX one set the paddle 1

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:11.220 
we'll stick with FX one set the paddle 1
and<00:03:06.129> FX<00:03:06.430> ^<00:03:06.730> 2<00:03:08.010> just<00:03:09.010> for<00:03:09.190> simplicity<00:03:10.230> when

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
and FX ^ 2 just for simplicity when

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.650 
and FX ^ 2 just for simplicity when
you're<00:03:11.379> done<00:03:11.560> with<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:11.830> setup<00:03:12.330> press<00:03:13.330> the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
you're done with the setup press the

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.750 
you're done with the setup press the

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.050 
halt for set up a looper control button
again<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.830> it<00:03:18.010> goes<00:03:18.190> back<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:18.640> normal<00:03:18.670> mode

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
again and it goes back to normal mode

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.420 
again and it goes back to normal mode
okay<00:03:22.060> so<00:03:22.120> once<00:03:22.450> we've<00:03:22.660> done<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.430> general

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
okay so once we've done the general

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.819 
okay so once we've done the general
setup<00:03:24.780> we're<00:03:25.780> just<00:03:25.959> gonna<00:03:26.110> check<00:03:26.440> out<00:03:26.650> the

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
setup we're just gonna check out the

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.479 
setup we're just gonna check out the
sweep<00:03:27.130> of<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.459> pedal<00:03:28.799> so<00:03:29.799> now<00:03:29.950> I'm<00:03:30.040> looking<00:03:30.340> up

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
sweep of the pedal so now I'm looking up

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.559 
sweep of the pedal so now I'm looking up
the<00:03:30.670> display<00:03:31.120> of<00:03:31.269> FX<00:03:31.750> unit<00:03:32.349> 2<00:03:33.000> which<00:03:34.000> has<00:03:34.180> pedal

the way to toe down goes all the way to
completely<00:03:52.660> on<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:54.280> then<00:03:54.430> as<00:03:54.549> I<00:03:54.700> move<00:03:54.880> the

completely on and then as I move the
pedal<00:03:55.359> through<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.720> sweep<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:58.510> can<00:03:58.569> see<00:03:58.870> how

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
pedal through the sweep you can see how

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.360 
pedal through the sweep you can see how
the<00:03:59.109> position<00:03:59.380> of<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.799> pedal<00:04:01.829> it's<00:04:02.829> relative

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
the position of the pedal it's relative

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.890 
the position of the pedal it's relative
to<00:04:04.269> the<00:04:04.359> position<00:04:04.510> of<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:04.989> effect<00:04:05.639> and

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
to the position of the effect and

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.629 
to the position of the effect and
there's<00:04:07.900> no<00:04:08.019> dead<00:04:08.380> spots<00:04:08.590> as<00:04:09.010> I<00:04:09.099> go<00:04:09.310> all<00:04:09.609> the

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
there's no dead spots as I go all the

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.490 
there's no dead spots as I go all the
way<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:09.970> heel<00:04:10.329> down<00:04:10.630> and<00:04:10.690> just<00:04:11.079> better<00:04:11.260> hit

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
way to heel down and just better hit

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.030 
way to heel down and just better hit
heel<00:04:11.709> down<00:04:11.920> now<00:04:13.200> now<00:04:14.200> you<00:04:14.260> can<00:04:14.470> see<00:04:14.620> at<00:04:14.739> zero

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
heel down now now you can see at zero

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.610 
heel down now now you can see at zero
and<00:04:15.519> I<00:04:16.120> get<00:04:16.180> an<00:04:16.389> effect<00:04:16.720> as<00:04:16.900> soon<00:04:16.930> as<00:04:17.200> I<00:04:17.320> start

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
and I get an effect as soon as I start

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.250 
and I get an effect as soon as I start
moving<00:04:17.769> the<00:04:18.070> panel<00:04:18.430> and<00:04:19.299> then<00:04:19.570> just<00:04:19.840> as<00:04:19.959> I<00:04:20.079> hit

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
moving the panel and then just as I hit

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.300 
moving the panel and then just as I hit
toe<00:04:20.530> down<00:04:20.769> which<00:04:21.070> is<00:04:21.280> now<00:04:22.710> there<00:04:23.710> with<00:04:23.889> food<00:04:24.130> to

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
toe down which is now there with food to

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.020 
toe down which is now there with food to
the<00:04:24.430> for<00:04:25.470> maximum<00:04:26.470> of<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.770> effect<00:04:27.099> so<00:04:27.370> you

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
the for maximum of the effect so you

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.990 
the for maximum of the effect so you
have<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.270> full<00:04:28.450> sweep<00:04:28.810> of<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.020> pedal<00:04:29.440> and<00:04:30.000> no

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
have the full sweep of the pedal and no

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.969 
have the full sweep of the pedal and no
dead<00:04:31.240> spots<00:04:35.729> we<00:04:36.729> can<00:04:36.760> give<00:04:37.030> it<00:04:37.150> a<00:04:37.210> try<00:04:37.680> if<00:04:38.680> you

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
dead spots we can give it a try if you

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.940 
dead spots we can give it a try if you
remember<00:04:39.520> we<00:04:39.669> had<00:04:40.080> pedal<00:04:41.080> one<00:04:41.260> set<00:04:41.620> up<00:04:41.800> two

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
remember we had pedal one set up two

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.659 
remember we had pedal one set up two
effects<00:04:42.310> one

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669

- you peddle one I have a volume pedal
the<00:04:48.659> fact<00:04:49.939> in<00:04:50.939> FX<00:04:51.270> -<00:04:51.509> I<00:04:51.539> had<00:04:51.930> a<00:04:51.960> wall<00:04:52.409> the<00:04:52.979> fan

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
the fact in FX - I had a wall the fan

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:57.920
