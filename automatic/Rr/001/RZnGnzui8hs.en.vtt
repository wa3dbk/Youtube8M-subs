00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
motions so let's begin for this tutorial

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.700 
motions so let's begin for this tutorial
you're<00:00:24.000> going<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.269> need<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.600> use<00:00:24.630> some<00:00:25.050> play<00:00:25.410> or

you're going to need to use some play or
some<00:00:25.920> promises<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.699> some<00:00:26.910> sort<00:00:27.150> now<00:00:27.960> here<00:00:28.410> I've

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
some promises of some sort now here I've

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.259 
some promises of some sort now here I've
got<00:00:28.769> some<00:00:28.980> modeling<00:00:29.460> clay<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.910> i'll<00:00:30.000> be<00:00:30.119> using

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
got some modeling clay and i'll be using

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.870 
got some modeling clay and i'll be using
that<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.869> by<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.890> way<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.279> software<00:00:32.850> that

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
that and by the way the software that

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.260 
that and by the way the software that
you<00:00:33.120> see<00:00:33.360> open<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.020> called<00:00:34.290> stop<00:00:34.530> motion<00:00:34.950> pro

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
you see open is called stop motion pro

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.090 
you see open is called stop motion pro
later<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:36.450> i'll<00:00:36.660> also<00:00:36.780> be<00:00:37.020> using<00:00:37.200> paint<00:00:37.590> net

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
later on i'll also be using paint net

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:47.399 
later on i'll also be using paint net
which<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.489> free<00:00:38.790> software

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:47.409 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.700 

so<00:00:48.409> I'm<00:00:48.800> going<00:00:49.100> to<00:00:49.129> be<00:00:49.250> using<00:00:49.370> this<00:00:50.019> short<00:00:51.019> stop

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
so I'm going to be using this short stop

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.819 
so I'm going to be using this short stop
motion<00:00:52.280> of<00:00:52.489> Vader<00:00:52.940> force<00:00:53.449> pushing<00:00:54.019> on<00:00:54.229> man

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
motion of Vader force pushing on man

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.240 
motion of Vader force pushing on man
into<00:00:55.250> a<00:00:55.280> wall<00:00:55.640> to<00:00:56.260> demonstrate<00:00:57.260> this<00:00:57.589> tutorial

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
into a wall to demonstrate this tutorial

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.630 
into a wall to demonstrate this tutorial
so<00:00:59.059> I'm<00:00:59.299> at<00:00:59.449> the<00:00:59.570> point<00:00:59.809> where<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:01.100> man<00:01:01.339> is

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
so I'm at the point where the man is

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.049 
so I'm at the point where the man is
going<00:01:02.210> to<00:01:02.329> be<00:01:03.039> flying<00:01:04.039> through<00:01:04.369> the<00:01:04.519> air<00:01:04.549> and

is get rid of the parts that are I want
to<00:01:10.939> have<00:01:11.090> flying<00:01:11.390> through<00:01:11.659> the<00:01:11.780> air<00:01:11.810> I<00:01:12.259> have<00:01:12.860> to

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
to have flying through the air I have to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.120 
to have flying through the air I have to
make<00:01:13.070> a<00:01:13.130> picture<00:01:13.549> of<00:01:13.670> just<00:01:14.000> Vader<00:01:17.740> once<00:01:18.740> i<00:01:18.920> have

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
that i can put the man and the truck

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.449 
that i can put the man and the truck
into<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.429> next<00:01:22.729> frame<00:01:22.970> but<00:01:23.810> with<00:01:24.319> the<00:01:24.560> clay<00:01:24.890> so

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:25.459 
into the next frame but with the clay so

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:27.669 
into the next frame but with the clay so
i'm<00:01:25.670> using<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.060> clay<00:01:26.360> to<00:01:26.390> prop<00:01:27.020> them<00:01:27.229> up<00:01:27.380> in

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
i'm using the clay to prop them up in

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:30.490 
i'm using the clay to prop them up in
the<00:01:28.340> air<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:28.909> when<00:01:29.630> we're<00:01:29.780> done<00:01:29.929> the<00:01:30.170> clay<00:01:30.350> is

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
the air and when we're done the clay is

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.960 
the air and when we're done the clay is
going<00:01:30.709> to<00:01:30.799> be<00:01:30.890> invisible<00:01:31.130> so<00:01:31.610> it<00:01:31.729> looks<00:01:31.880> like

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
going to be invisible so it looks like

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.639 
going to be invisible so it looks like
they're<00:01:32.450> just<00:01:32.720> flying<00:01:32.959> in<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.319> air<00:01:33.350> without

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
they're just flying in the air without

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.919 
they're just flying in the air without
any<00:01:34.039> support<00:01:34.280> that's<00:01:35.209> the<00:01:35.390> key<00:01:35.600> to<00:01:35.810> this

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
any support that's the key to this

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.230 
any support that's the key to this
tutorial<00:01:36.670> now<00:01:37.670> I'm<00:01:37.759> just<00:01:37.880> going<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.119> keep

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
tutorial now I'm just going to keep

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.870 
tutorial now I'm just going to keep
doing<00:01:38.299> this<00:01:38.690> for<00:01:39.110> however<00:01:39.830> many<00:01:40.130> frames<00:01:40.580> I

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
doing this for however many frames I

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.179 
doing this for however many frames I
want<00:01:41.179> and<00:01:41.509> I'm<00:01:42.170> going<00:01:42.319> to<00:01:42.380> fast<00:01:42.590> forward<00:01:42.740> so

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
want and I'm going to fast forward so

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:52.220 
want and I'm going to fast forward so
you<00:01:43.280> can<00:01:43.399> see<00:01:43.610> what<00:01:43.700> I'm<00:01:43.789> doing

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:03:31.730 

you

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.400 

so<00:03:32.700> hopefully<00:03:33.360> that<00:03:33.630> wasn't<00:03:33.900> confusing<00:03:34.290> or

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
so hopefully that wasn't confusing or

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.470 
so hopefully that wasn't confusing or
anything<00:03:34.770> i<00:03:34.860> know<00:03:35.010> sometimes<00:03:35.250> i<00:03:35.520> use<00:03:35.910> onion

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
anything i know sometimes i use onion

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.440 
anything i know sometimes i use onion
skin<00:03:36.750> but<00:03:37.260> anyway<00:03:37.890> I've<00:03:38.100> got<00:03:38.160> paint.net<00:03:38.700> open

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
skin but anyway I've got paint.net open

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.570 
skin but anyway I've got paint.net open
so<00:03:39.780> use<00:03:40.020> whatever<00:03:40.200> image<00:03:40.740> editor<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:41.310> want

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
now find your frames so right now I'm

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.530 
now find your frames so right now I'm
looking<00:03:45.990> for<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:46.710> call<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.130> blank<00:03:47.460> frame<00:03:47.850> or<00:03:48.480> a

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
looking for I call it a blank frame or a

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.260 
looking for I call it a blank frame or a
frame<00:03:48.960> where<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:50.100> part<00:03:50.520> that<00:03:50.790> is<00:03:50.940> flying

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
frame where the part that is flying

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.600 
really going to notice if it looks a
little<00:04:33.270> strange<00:04:33.920> you<00:04:34.920> might<00:04:35.100> also<00:04:35.280> want<00:04:35.580> to

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
little strange you might also want to

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.060

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
get rid of any shadows because that can

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.930 
get rid of any shadows because that can
make<00:04:38.640> it<00:04:38.790> look<00:04:38.970> weird<00:04:40.340> so<00:04:41.340> that's<00:04:41.550> really<00:04:41.700> all

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940
