00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.850
 which is not bad from the south so first of all for their shots other 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 territory after I heard all the traffic 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.910

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.290
 example 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.080
 remember that the 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.340
 rights watch 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.260

 even we put young doctors 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.160
 you are displaced 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.230
 you are moved like that 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.050
 cyr 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.050
 and you put it here is gradually fade 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.330
 percent admit searching for example 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.490
 this information in order to draw a profile too 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.640

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.970
 for this film 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.140
 info loncan celebrates music 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.550

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.659
 of its history 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.889
 your family life 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:17.889
 I imagine that moral person selected like that 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.769
 1 in fact the fees 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.279
 the same thing h secretists in French 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:29.010
 the goal of a warming 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.189
 I watched 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.719
 of course 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:34.849
 here 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:35.899
 So here is 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:38.899
 so that's the big thing 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:41.819
 to his eyes 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.239
 animations so you have challenges aimed p animations 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:49.499
 this is it 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:52.059
 nesmon of laure 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:54.890
 source that speaks like that 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.420
 we really have a lot of determination 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.259
 - that on promised cbs are all 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:03.199
 everything is well homogeneous nevertheless frankly jews use in a 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.549
 week to heart since it's something that 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.150
 and it is possible the subject page ph 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:13.289
 to deal with this situation you have for example fischer 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.759
 we will not say the beach 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:19.539
 and about cancer 

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:22.899
 and I'm a guy the future is only at that moment 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:25.359
 he wanted to cut the video because actually 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.919
 at the same time to explain m after keep 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.669
 for example it's the end of an episode 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.999
 he wanted canada to 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:38.229
 the video stand out 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:42.559
 little by little so all summer the disappearance fade so these scenes 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:45.609
 inspiration finally a giant black screen 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.609
 more than 5 hours what it gives 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.019
 pregnant because I can not do any of them even know anymore 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.969
 it rained alexander parr 35% 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:01.969
 excellent animations lessard look 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.269
 he will follow 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.269
 animations 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.979
 animations 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.979
 rozÃ¨s also look yes 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.629
 we actually see 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:19.629
 5 and if the swords 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.059
 the blur at the bottom 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:25.139
 a process that decided it all 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.590
 after 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.499
 according to what you like 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:32.999
 julie also the playstation home passion 360 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.809
 like this figure 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:39.460
 so we are really a lot of animations 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.659
 the pursuit 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:43.180
 the past month much more important 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.009
 without his parents yet I am sure 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.009
 I do not really know what to know about the past 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.719
 personally I can do 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:56.989
 after you know the music the welcome here 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.059
 therefore no longer rejected 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:03.059
 the end credits I know you it's 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.979
 you want a closing credits 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.800
 it's going to do this 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.879
 you have to click the proof that object to put 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:20.289
 this one judges a premature end the question that appears 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.589
 after you can move your text all the team that is on the shifters 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.509
 after 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.509
 difficult 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:35.050
 you put it players for example 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.050
 insulza analysis 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:45.229
 while this title 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.370
 then you do these 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.080
 you can mascot five officers like this 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.409
 the re-entry actually 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:55.399
 look at it's the way we order happens to you have 16 of it 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:58.900
 these sites 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.729
 this one 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:04.009
 after but 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:07.069
 several kinds you did you 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:08.010
 this challenge 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.409
 as of m indeed that you see 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:13.619
 it's obvious that television the sequence 

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:17.759
 the lot and the distribution it's really like in the movies myself I'm 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:21.339
 is going on this internship what I find it takes a little too much on the videos 

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:24.770
 to complicate things for a global 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.770
 not completed in December 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:30.569
 otherwise you have too much 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:33.569
 what is for me personally I do not have 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.889
 for example me I associate ours the mythical just before 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.999
 harper in party 

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:44.999
 wal-mart stores five hours later 

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:51.940
 I never went through the facts 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.080
 the gusts tax evasion later 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.460
 % of our teachings these activists are not members of his movement by the 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:06:59.979
 time 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:02.619
 the Swedes too fast on the latter 

00:07:02.619 --> 00:07:05.619
 I think I can help I'm sure I can 

00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:10.029
 How it works 

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:13.309
 few things have made their authors I will do everything to learn 

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:16.240
 Attempted is great culture 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.080
 for tomorrow 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.490
 6 hours I think I went around 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.490
 for a few days like these 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:28.689
 r 

00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:32.699
 it is possible to produce it near it is erased yes 

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:42.789
 I'm serene we're going to leave each other for a hundred 

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:45.069
 I am a little music 

00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:46.339
 why not 

00:07:46.339 --> 00:07:48.979
 let's go now 

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:51.460
 because 

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.030
 croatia see you soon for a next victim you said 

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:56.350
