00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
have lost a few games they have actually

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.200 
have lost a few games they have actually
surrendered<00:01:04.979> meekly<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> couple<00:01:06.150> of

surrendered meekly on a couple of
occasions<00:01:06.330> but<00:01:06.869> then<00:01:07.500> they've<00:01:07.680> got<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:07.979> one

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
occasions but then they've got this one

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.490 
occasions but then they've got this one
man<00:01:08.490> called<00:01:08.790> Chris<00:01:08.970> Gayle<00:01:09.270> who<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.930> likely<00:01:10.229> to

win<00:01:10.680> them<00:01:10.890> more<00:01:11.159> games<00:01:11.460> or<00:01:12.030> then<00:01:13.250> that's

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
win them more games or then that's

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.370 
win them more games or then that's
needed<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.700> qualify<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.479> playoffs<00:01:15.600> so

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380

Karen Pollard what he deserves at least

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.710 
Karen Pollard what he deserves at least
in<00:01:50.009> terms<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.520> number<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.790> balls<00:01:51.149> he<00:01:51.509> gets

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
potent bowling attack to suit so I think

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.260 
potent bowling attack to suit so I think
Mumbai<00:01:57.750> Indians<00:01:58.079> will<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.380> my<00:01:58.469> third<00:01:58.680> pick
