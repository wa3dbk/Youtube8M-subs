00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.710
 Ah 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.070
 This is an experiment at Guji junior high school. 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.930
 I do not know, so I lived in old Cat's house. 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:19.450
 I opened up a large gear chip and lived in a room with each of them. 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:22.740
 Bathroom tools and other ground except the cement floor is completely Attachment wave hit 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.740
 It looked like a shithole 4. 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:31.329
 But after I got into junior high school, I built a new apartment in that town . 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.329
 People moved out. 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:38.770
 At that time, of course , I went to the board of directors, 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.770
 I moved. 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:48.580
 It's a half-way down town building. 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:54.420
 I devote it. I eat it. 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.420
 The battery did not work if the company was right or what day it was. 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.920
 These people were out of the way, and the maintenance was out of order. 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:11.569
 But other than the building is recognizable by the department gave me the old form 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.569
 I almost stayed at my house. 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:19.090
 Only the door drops off and only the specialty is broken. 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.090
 The others are almost the same. 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.709
 How did I do that? 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.099
 When I put it all out from my new home, I saw the old house. 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.099
 It was because of 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.370
 So every time you go on an errand at night or come to school with a chip late, 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.690
 I saw it. 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:46.830
 I've been there quite a while. 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.830
 At that time , you were at a very mock talks with the school stuff. 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.390
 Anyway , I spent a lot of time with my friends at home. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.400
 I just piercing the computer every hour in Canada Jane heads out of the house and the sick 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:11.570
 We had a meeting and we had no dreams at the time. 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.900
 I do not have any kind of evidence or baseball bat, so I just walk around outside. 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.900
 There is 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.840
 And that time would have been around 3:00. 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.110
 Then one of my friends is sleeping in that old house . 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.190
 I said it was dangerous, of course . 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:39.910
 In fact, even a little scary haetguyo 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:44.940
 But he was a friend and he was free. 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.940
 Christian's inevitably went there and turned. 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:54.510
 So I looked around and saw some people who did not have firepower, 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:59.659
 Soccer balls also have another bathroom representatives warehouse 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.659
 The more other people discard things between hadeoraguyo 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:07.800
 Do not know that playing Superman is thrilling to me that you have a friend who 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.800
 I think he was. 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.540
 I was going to climb on that contractor's roof that used to be. 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.060
 As you know, there are quite a lot of slopes in Kia's construction. 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.950
 Treadmill where your feet is also very eopguyo 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:38.089
 I made a ballroom in the jt yard, and my friend went up there 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:44.379
 I went up the roof. 

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:44.379
 And it was really breathtaking in the roof . 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.620
 By the way, my friend is better 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.270
 Now I have fallen to the cement floor. 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.900
 And my friend hurt me tremendously. 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.210
 Deoraguyo take hands feet yirang almost encouraging levels 

00:05:10.049 --> 00:05:21.799
 There was a huge hit and then go sit impact on the spot, not even a dead kid 

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:21.799
 I keep seeing something with my eyes . 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.860
 And donated after the first time. 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.930
 I called my dad who was resting at 10 and took my friend to the hospital. 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.860
 He's in contact with you. 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:49.160
 And it's been a week since the accident happened, so I'm going to have a friend . 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:56.180
 But the time to talk when you wake a friend to buy 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:07.660
 When I did not even know I was bogus in front of my eyes, my friend saw me. 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.660
 Is to 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:16.599
 But then it's like the house where ten people live in that old house 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.599
 That's what it looks like. 

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:29.479
 The reason that people look back away from the door when the time taken to obtain some 

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:29.479
 It means that time has gone too far. 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:41.550
 And more importantly, people traveled to Jeju. 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:47.570
 The accident I have a few people on my friend and I have to move 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:47.570
 It's not that you're in the house, but acting like you're in another place. 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.300
 I knew a friend playing a joke at first gun 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:01.850
 But when we talk about those who are so enthusiastic 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:06.710
 Some people have similar experiences like 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:09.880
 Maneuni people looked increasingly ghosts Ditto glad the story is hard to believe 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.880
 I have posted this article 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.129
