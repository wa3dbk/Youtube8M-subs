00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
not gonna get electrocuted or shocked or

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.520 
not gonna get electrocuted or shocked or
anything<00:01:58.909> monochrome<00:01:59.909> CRT<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.659> however<00:02:00.930> they

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
anything monochrome CRT is however they

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.740 
anything monochrome CRT is however they
keep<00:02:02.070> their<00:02:02.250> charge<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.540> color

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
keep their charge so this is a color

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.450 
keep their charge so this is a color
tube<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.110> we<00:02:04.170> don't<00:02:04.350> worry<00:02:04.590> but<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
tube so we don't worry but the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.389 
tube so we don't worry but the
monochrome<00:02:05.820> tubes<00:02:06.240> keep<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.600> church<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:08.310> you

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
monochrome tubes keep the church so you

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.910 
monochrome tubes keep the church so you
usually<00:02:08.700> want<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.030> wait<00:02:09.179> either<00:02:09.899> use

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
usually want to wait either use

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.880 
usually want to wait either use
wait<00:02:12.920> for<00:02:13.160> two<00:02:14.120> hours<00:02:14.150> maybe<00:02:14.960> four<00:02:15.260> hours<00:02:15.290> or

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
wait for two hours maybe four hours or

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.080 
wait for two hours maybe four hours or
to<00:02:16.340> do<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.790> or<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.150> can<00:02:17.330> force<00:02:18.050> by<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:19.910> can

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
to do it or you can force by you can

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.020 
to do it or you can force by you can
sort<00:02:20.900> it<00:02:20.960> out<00:02:21.080> when<00:02:22.040> this<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.190> connected<00:02:22.460> you

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
sort it out when this is connected you

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.450 
sort it out when this is connected you
use<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.480> two<00:02:23.750> screwdriver<00:02:24.200> method<00:02:24.590> holding

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
use the two screwdriver method holding

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.880 
use the two screwdriver method holding
one<00:02:25.610> screwdriver<00:02:25.850> here<00:02:26.270> on<00:02:26.990> to<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.380> frame<00:02:27.620> and

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
one screwdriver here on to the frame and

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.500 
one screwdriver here on to the frame and
then<00:02:28.400> you<00:02:28.520> slide<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:28.880> other<00:02:29.120> screwdriver

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
then you slide the other screwdriver

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.760 
then you slide the other screwdriver
underneath<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.110> short<00:02:30.350> out<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.530> inside<00:02:32.770> and

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
underneath and short out the inside and

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.740 
underneath and short out the inside and
so<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.700> next<00:02:34.850> step<00:02:35.030> we're<00:02:35.150> going<00:02:35.240> to<00:02:35.300> remove

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
so the next step we're going to remove

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.630 
so the next step we're going to remove
so<00:02:36.290> all<00:02:36.440> we're<00:02:36.650> gonna<00:02:36.710> be<00:02:36.830> left<00:02:37.010> is<00:02:37.190> with<00:02:37.460> the

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
so all we're gonna be left is with the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.640 
so all we're gonna be left is with the
frame<00:02:37.880> and<00:02:38.180> then<00:02:38.840> we're<00:02:39.050> almost<00:02:39.200> ready<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.560> put

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
frame and then we're almost ready to put

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.130 
frame and then we're almost ready to put
the<00:02:39.830> LCD<00:02:40.190> on

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
the LCD on

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.140 
the LCD on
okay<00:02:42.140> we've<00:02:42.320> removed<00:02:42.590> all<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.010> all<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.940> wires

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
okay we've removed all the all the wires

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.000 
okay we've removed all the all the wires
that<00:02:44.540> are<00:02:44.690> hanging<00:02:44.900> around<00:02:45.050> disconnected

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
that are hanging around disconnected

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.640 
that are hanging around disconnected
them<00:02:46.130> you<00:02:46.280> just<00:02:46.550> use<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:47.050> side<00:02:48.050> cutters<00:02:48.380> and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
them you just use the side cutters and

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.690 
them you just use the side cutters and
we<00:02:49.070> remove<00:02:49.370> them<00:02:49.550> now<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:50.000> big<00:02:50.930> CRT<00:02:51.580> so<00:02:52.580> be

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
we remove them now the big CRT so be

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.890 
we remove them now the big CRT so be
careful<00:02:53.030> when<00:02:53.150> you're<00:02:53.270> taking<00:02:53.300> it<00:02:53.570> off

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
careful when you're taking it off

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.510 
careful when you're taking it off
because<00:02:54.110> it's<00:02:54.380> it's<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.740> little<00:02:54.920> bit<00:02:55.010> heavy<00:02:55.160> and

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
because it's it's a little bit heavy and

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.120 
because it's it's a little bit heavy and
if<00:02:56.300> you<00:02:56.390> drop<00:02:56.630> it<00:02:56.660> it'll<00:02:57.080> implode<00:02:57.620> because

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
if you drop it it'll implode because

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:08.890 
if you drop it it'll implode because
there's<00:02:58.280> a<00:02:58.340> vacuum<00:02:58.520> inside<00:03:07.570> take<00:03:08.570> that<00:03:08.750> to

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
there's a vacuum inside take that to

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.410 
there's a vacuum inside take that to
your<00:03:08.959> local<00:03:09.200> recycler<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:10.040> this<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.120> what<00:03:11.300> you

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
your local recycler and this is what you

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.000 
your local recycler and this is what you
should<00:03:11.510> be<00:03:11.690> left<00:03:11.900> with<00:03:12.970> that's<00:03:13.970> light<00:03:14.180> frame

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
should be left with that's light frame

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.380 
should be left with that's light frame
so<00:03:16.010> our<00:03:16.310> next<00:03:16.610> part<00:03:16.880> we're<00:03:17.120> gonna<00:03:17.209> be

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
so our next part we're gonna be

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.479 
so our next part we're gonna be
installing<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.989> LCD<00:03:18.830> to<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.040> front<00:03:19.250> of<00:03:19.340> this

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
installing the LCD to the front of this

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.780 
installing the LCD to the front of this
and<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:21.200> key<00:03:21.800> with<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.010> LCD<00:03:22.130> is<00:03:22.430> you<00:03:22.519> want<00:03:22.700> it

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
and the key with the LCD is you want it

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.479 
and the key with the LCD is you want it
to<00:03:22.880> be<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.090> same<00:03:23.269> distance<00:03:23.480> as<00:03:24.320> here<00:03:25.100> T<00:03:25.280> was

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
to be the same distance as here T was

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.150 
to be the same distance as here T was
the<00:03:25.730> CRT<00:03:26.090> was<00:03:26.239> basically<00:03:27.230> flat<00:03:27.560> flat<00:03:27.950> with

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
the CRT was basically flat flat with

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.070 
the CRT was basically flat flat with
this<00:03:28.370> so<00:03:28.820> we're<00:03:28.940> gonna<00:03:29.060> mount<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.570> LCD<00:03:29.930> so

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
this so we're gonna mount the LCD so

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.630 
this so we're gonna mount the LCD so
it's<00:03:30.430> not<00:03:31.430> too<00:03:31.640> here<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:33.130> it'll<00:03:34.130> mount<00:03:34.310> onto

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
it's not too here and it'll mount onto

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.320 
it's not too here and it'll mount onto
here<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.300> we<00:03:35.390> want<00:03:35.570> to<00:03:35.630> flush<00:03:35.840> with<00:03:36.080> this<00:03:36.230> and

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
here and we want to flush with this and

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.400 
here and we want to flush with this and
it<00:03:38.330> should<00:03:38.510> be<00:03:38.600> all<00:03:38.630> set<00:03:40.750> okay<00:03:41.750> we<00:03:42.019> take<00:03:42.200> our

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
it should be all set okay we take our

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.699 
it should be all set okay we take our
empty<00:03:42.920> inner<00:03:43.610> color<00:03:43.880> frame<00:03:44.350> stand<00:03:45.350> it<00:03:45.440> up<00:03:45.560> on

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
empty inner color frame stand it up on

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.560 
empty inner color frame stand it up on
end<00:03:45.950> and<00:03:46.660> we<00:03:47.660> we<00:03:48.320> remove<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.830> bolt<00:03:49.420> just<00:03:50.420> goes

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
end and we we remove the bolt just goes

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.990 
end and we we remove the bolt just goes
right<00:03:50.780> out<00:03:50.870> of<00:03:50.930> there<00:03:51.200> and<00:03:51.459> these<00:03:52.459> screws<00:03:52.790> here

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
right out of there and these screws here

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.900 
right out of there and these screws here
these<00:03:53.600> are<00:03:54.019> for<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.500> bezel<00:03:54.890> on<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.070> other<00:03:55.640> end

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
these are for the bezel on the other end

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.670 
these are for the bezel on the other end
so<00:03:56.180> we're<00:03:56.480> going<00:03:56.600> to<00:03:56.690> leave<00:03:56.780> that<00:03:56.810> those<00:03:57.410> there

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
so we're going to leave that those there

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.520 
so we're going to leave that those there
as<00:03:57.769> well<00:03:58.239> and<00:03:59.239> we<00:03:59.360> take<00:03:59.510> our<00:03:59.660> mono<00:03:59.840> tech<00:04:00.050> LCD

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
as well and we take our mono tech LCD

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.600 
as well and we take our mono tech LCD
make<00:04:01.400> sure<00:04:01.550> it's<00:04:01.670> faced<00:04:01.880> up<00:04:02.800> and<00:04:03.800> we<00:04:03.950> slide

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
make sure it's faced up and we slide

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.240 
make sure it's faced up and we slide
into<00:04:05.120> place<00:04:05.450> ever<00:04:06.260> so<00:04:06.500> slightly<00:04:06.769> lining<00:04:07.160> up
