memory function then there's gonna be

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.050 
memory function then there's gonna be
five<00:01:27.990> wires<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:29.310> see<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.549> little<00:01:29.729> three

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
five wires you see this little three

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.630 
five wires you see this little three
wire<00:01:30.210> connector<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:31.380> goes<00:01:31.560> into<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.040> three

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
wire connector it goes into the three

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.280 
wire connector it goes into the three
wire<00:01:33.229> plug<00:01:34.229> here<00:01:34.790> um<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.689> car<00:01:37.049> I

don't have one with me I have one in the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.870 
don't have one with me I have one in the
garage<00:01:39.060> somewhere<00:01:39.360> if<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> car<00:01:40.619> with

um power seats with memory on the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.730 
um power seats with memory on the
mirrors<00:01:45.450> with<00:01:45.630> memory<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.200> seats<00:01:46.439> then

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
mirrors with memory on the seats then

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.050 
mirrors with memory on the seats then
there's<00:01:46.890> gonna<00:01:46.979> be<00:01:47.100> five<00:01:47.369> wires<00:01:47.610> going<00:01:47.939> in

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
there's gonna be five wires going in

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.399 
there's gonna be five wires going in
there<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.540> motor<00:01:48.750> will<00:01:48.840> be<00:01:48.990> different

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
there and the motor will be different

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.190 
there and the motor will be different
and<00:01:49.560> left<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.520> right<00:01:50.549> are<00:01:50.970> different<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.990> now

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
and left and right are different so now

garage and found the other one and this

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.270 
garage and found the other one and this
is<00:04:23.420> one<00:04:23.750> of<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.960> it<00:04:24.080> looks<00:04:24.290> very<00:04:24.650> much<00:04:24.920> very

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
is one of the it looks very much very

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.490 
is one of the it looks very much very
similar<00:04:25.690> you<00:04:26.690> see<00:04:26.870> there's<00:04:27.050> a<00:04:27.110> little<00:04:27.170> screw

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
similar you see there's a little screw

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.600 
similar you see there's a little screw
in<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:27.680> middle<00:04:27.830> so<00:04:28.040> it's<00:04:28.160> a<00:04:28.250> little<00:04:28.400> bit

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
in the middle so it's a little bit

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.060 
in the middle so it's a little bit
different<00:04:29.000> the<00:04:29.150> mounts<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:30.560> little<00:04:30.740> pivot

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
different the mounts the little pivot

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.250 
different the mounts the little pivot
mounts<00:04:31.400> here<00:04:31.630> that<00:04:32.630> go<00:04:32.810> into<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.080> two

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
mounts here that go into the two

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.890 
mounts here that go into the two
actuators<00:04:33.790> to<00:04:34.790> actually<00:04:35.450> is<00:04:35.570> a<00:04:35.600> little<00:04:35.750> bit

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
actuators to actually is a little bit

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.530 
actuators to actually is a little bit
different<00:04:36.380> and<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:38.330> plug<00:04:39.370> is<00:04:40.370> a<00:04:40.430> seven<00:04:41.000> wire<00:04:41.210> I

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
different and the plug is a seven wire I

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.090 
different and the plug is a seven wire I
thought<00:04:41.840> it<00:04:41.930> was<00:04:42.050> five<00:04:42.260> foot<00:04:42.500> it's<00:04:42.650> seven<00:04:42.740> and

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
thought it was five foot it's seven and

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.290 
thought it was five foot it's seven and
that<00:04:43.760> controls<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.420> memory<00:04:44.690> function<00:04:45.170> so<00:04:46.300> if

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
that controls the memory function so if

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.660 
that controls the memory function so if
you<00:04:47.600> have<00:04:47.810> a<00:04:48.070> if<00:04:49.070> you're<00:04:49.220> going<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.460> lurking

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
you have a if you're going to lurking

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.910 
you have a if you're going to lurking
out<00:04:49.910> again<00:04:50.360> make<00:04:51.350> sure<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.620> car<00:04:51.800> you're

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
out again make sure the car you're

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
getting one out off of a pet is the same

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.100 
getting one out off of a pet is the same
as<00:04:54.050> your<00:04:54.200> if<00:04:54.260> it<00:04:54.500> has<00:04:54.680> a<00:04:55.330> memory<00:04:56.330> function<00:04:56.900> on

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
as your if it has a memory function on

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.710 
as your if it has a memory function on
the<00:04:57.800> mirrors<00:04:58.130> that<00:04:58.760> go<00:04:59.000> with<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.210> power<00:04:59.390> seats

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
the mirrors that go with the power seats

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.330 
the mirrors that go with the power seats
you're<00:05:00.350> going<00:05:00.470> to<00:05:00.530> need<00:05:00.650> one<00:05:00.800> with<00:05:00.950> the<00:05:01.040> seven

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
you're going to need one with the seven

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.550 
you're going to need one with the seven
wires<00:05:01.490> if<00:05:01.850> you<00:05:02.090> need<00:05:02.300> one<00:05:02.540> that<00:05:02.960> doesn't<00:05:03.260> have

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
wires if you need one that doesn't have

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.650 
wires if you need one that doesn't have
that<00:05:03.740> you<00:05:04.250> need<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.580> three<00:05:04.700> wire<00:05:04.940> I<00:05:05.210> don't

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
that you need the three wire I don't

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.060 
that you need the three wire I don't
think<00:05:05.810> any<00:05:05.930> of<00:05:05.990> the<00:05:06.080> SL<00:05:06.350> case<00:05:06.560> had<00:05:06.770> memory

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
think any of the SL case had memory

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.530 
think any of the SL case had memory
function<00:05:07.430> on<00:05:07.490> the<00:05:07.610> seats<00:05:07.820> even<00:05:08.030> with<00:05:08.330> power

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
function on the seats even with power

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.720 
function on the seats even with power
seats<00:05:08.930> or<00:05:09.560> sorry<00:05:09.950> memory<00:05:10.250> function<00:05:10.580> on<00:05:10.640> the

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
mirror for the CLK and the SL k I use

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.150 
mirror for the CLK and the SL k I use
the<00:05:20.000> same<00:05:20.180> mirror<00:05:20.450> same<00:05:20.750> housing<00:05:21.230> but<00:05:21.860> at

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
the same mirror same housing but at

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.000 
the same mirror same housing but at
times<00:05:22.460> different<00:05:23.169> motors<00:05:24.169> and<00:05:24.410> different

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
times different motors and different

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.990 
times different motors and different
near<00:05:25.220> class<00:05:25.600> thanks<00:05:26.600> for<00:05:26.690> watching
