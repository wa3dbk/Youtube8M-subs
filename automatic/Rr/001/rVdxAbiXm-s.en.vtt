hello everyone hope you enjoy my first

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.610 
hello everyone hope you enjoy my first
video<00:00:03.659> today<00:00:04.529> I'm<00:00:04.830> going<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.130> demonstrate<00:00:05.310> the

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:06.620 
video today I'm going to demonstrate the

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.940 
video today I'm going to demonstrate the
mth<00:00:07.620> DCs<00:00:08.340> program<00:00:09.090> that's<00:00:09.360> in<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.599> remote

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
mth DCs program that's in the remote

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.680 
mth DCs program that's in the remote
I've<00:00:10.950> arranged<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:11.790> that<00:00:12.000> when<00:00:12.450> the

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
I've arranged it so that when the

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.499 
I've arranged it so that when the
program<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.110> finished<00:00:13.490> this<00:00:14.490> Challenger<00:00:15.269> will

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
program is finished this Challenger will

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.310 
program is finished this Challenger will
be<00:00:15.540> pulling<00:00:16.250> all<00:00:17.250> 34<00:00:17.970> or<00:00:18.240> 35<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.900> these<00:00:18.990> cars

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
be pulling all 34 or 35 of these cars

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.340 
be pulling all 34 or 35 of these cars
forget<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.100> actual<00:00:20.310> count<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.090> he's<00:00:21.900> too<00:00:22.109> -

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
said and done this s2 will put this

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.990 
said and done this s2 will put this
computer<00:00:28.680> on<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.980> end<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> contest<00:00:29.849> and

computer on the end of the contest and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.060 
computer on the end of the contest and
the<00:00:30.199> Challenger<00:00:31.199> will<00:00:31.230> run<00:00:31.560> around<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.890> few

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
the Challenger will run around a few

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.479 
the Challenger will run around a few
times<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.550> then<00:00:32.640> park<00:00:33.860> it<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.010> important<00:00:35.460> to

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
times and then park it is important to

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.160 
times and then park it is important to
note<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.760> with<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.180> programming<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.930> have

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
note that with this programming you have

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.990 
note that with this programming you have
to<00:00:37.350> put<00:00:37.530> everything<00:00:37.710> back<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.550> way<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.760> had

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
to put everything back the way you had

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.160 
to put everything back the way you had
it<00:00:39.590> when<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.620> made<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.070> program<00:00:41.460> initially

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
it when you made the program initially

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.200 
it when you made the program initially
otherwise<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.379> won't<00:00:43.530> work<00:00:43.760> in<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.910> case

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
otherwise it won't work in this case

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.360 
otherwise it won't work in this case
I've<00:00:45.420> put<00:00:45.629> these<00:00:45.719> two<00:00:45.930> dash<00:00:46.170> nines<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.860> front

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
I've put these two dash nines in front

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.950 
I've put these two dash nines in front
of<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:48.420> blue<00:00:48.660> line<00:00:48.899> between<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.829> plywood

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
of the blue line between the plywood

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.880 
of the blue line between the plywood
keep<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.050> mind<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.440> only<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.680> temporary
