anything about look ski bindings you'll

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.140 
anything about look ski bindings you'll
know<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.469> we<00:00:13.769> are<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.160> leader<00:00:14.610> market

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
know that we are the leader market

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.609 
know that we are the leader market
leader<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:15.389> terms<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.809> retention<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.320> release

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
leader in terms of retention and release

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.140 
leader in terms of retention and release
and<00:00:16.830> one<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.070> most<00:00:17.220> trustworthy<00:00:17.609> bindings

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
and one of the most trustworthy bindings

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.269 
and one of the most trustworthy bindings
on<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.359> market<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.289> with<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.680> new<00:00:19.830> SPX

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
on the market so with the new SPX

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.769 
on the market so with the new SPX
binding<00:00:20.580> we've<00:00:20.699> just<00:00:20.910> taken<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.300> one<00:00:21.510> step

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
binding we've just taken that one step

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.080 
binding we've just taken that one step
further<00:00:22.039> introducing<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.130> entirely<00:00:23.910> new

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
further introducing this entirely new

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.210 
further introducing this entirely new
redesigned<00:00:24.660> heel<00:00:24.869> piece<00:00:25.140> here<00:00:25.380> really

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
redesigned heel piece here really

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.429 
redesigned heel piece here really
lightens<00:00:26.609> up<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.880> binding<00:00:27.090> really<00:00:28.019> and

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
lightens up the binding really and

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.080 
lightens up the binding really and
provides<00:00:28.890> some<00:00:29.039> increased<00:00:29.460> shock<00:00:29.670> absorption

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
provides some increased shock absorption

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.139 
provides some increased shock absorption
and<00:00:30.560> so<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.769> really<00:00:32.130> helps<00:00:32.369> ensure<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.820> you

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
and so it really helps ensure that you

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.729 
and so it really helps ensure that you
know<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.660> bunny<00:00:33.899> keeps<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.469> when<00:00:34.649> you

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
know this bunny keeps you in when you

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.560 
know this bunny keeps you in when you
need<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.980> be<00:00:35.219> but<00:00:35.700> let<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.969> out<00:00:36.090> when<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.329> want

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
need to be but let you out when you want

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.850 
need to be but let you out when you want
and<00:00:37.160> you<00:00:38.160> know<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:38.640> kind<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:39.030> new

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
and you know with this kind of new

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.950 
and you know with this kind of new
redesigned<00:00:40.860> X<00:00:41.850> housing<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.540> back<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.870> this

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
redesigned X housing in the back of this

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.389 
redesigned X housing in the back of this
thing<00:00:43.020> its<00:00:43.559> reinforced<00:00:44.160> with<00:00:44.219> metal

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
thing its reinforced with metal

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.680 
thing its reinforced with metal
underneath<00:00:44.850> here<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.210> just<00:00:45.270> kind<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.539> give<00:00:45.660> it

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
underneath here we just kind of give it

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.500 
underneath here we just kind of give it
a<00:00:45.809> nice<00:00:45.930> little<00:00:46.140> gloss<00:00:46.500> over<00:00:46.739> with<00:00:46.950> some<00:00:47.510> white

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
a nice little gloss over with some white

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.690 
a nice little gloss over with some white
paint<00:00:48.539> there<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.200> but<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.129> really<00:00:50.399> super

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
paint there and but this is really super

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.209 
paint there and but this is really super
durable<00:00:51.110> metal<00:00:52.110> housing<00:00:52.289> we've<00:00:52.920> got<00:00:53.100> two

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
durable metal housing we've got two

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.770 
durable metal housing we've got two
reinforced<00:00:53.670> pivot<00:00:54.030> housing<00:00:54.360> up<00:00:54.480> here<00:00:54.690> up

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
reinforced pivot housing up here up

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.610 
reinforced pivot housing up here up
front<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.670> we've<00:00:56.670> really<00:00:56.960> kind<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.079> redesigned

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
front so we've really kind of redesigned

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.650 
front so we've really kind of redesigned
this<00:00:58.770> thing<00:00:58.949> from<00:00:59.070> top<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.340> bottom<00:00:59.489> a<00:01:00.180> much

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
this thing from top to bottom a much

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.380 
this thing from top to bottom a much
wider<00:01:00.899> heel<00:01:01.260> cup<00:01:01.530> through<00:01:02.129> here<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:03.059> bigger

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
wider heel cup through here and a bigger

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.240 
wider heel cup through here and a bigger
treadle<00:01:03.870> allows<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> binding<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.159> be

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
treadle allows the binding just to be

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.800 
treadle allows the binding just to be
more<00:01:05.489> user<00:01:05.700> friendly<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.299> can<00:01:06.420> step<00:01:06.659> in

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
more user friendly so you can step in

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.570 
more user friendly so you can step in
and<00:01:06.900> out<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.260> thing<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.530> lot<00:01:07.650> easier<00:01:08.189> we

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
and out of this thing a lot easier we

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.910 
and out of this thing a lot easier we
also<00:01:08.729> reinforced<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.930> back<00:01:10.229> section<00:01:10.500> here

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
also reinforced this back section here

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.740 
also reinforced this back section here
so<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.280> put<00:01:11.520> your<00:01:11.549> pole<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.060> there<00:01:12.210> don't

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
so you can put your pole in there don't

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.420 
so you can put your pole in there don't
worry<00:01:12.840> about<00:01:13.020> chewing<00:01:13.380> up<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> binding<00:01:13.920> and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
worry about chewing up the binding and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.670 
worry about chewing up the binding and
get<00:01:14.729> out<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.030> thing<00:01:15.270> really<00:01:15.450> easy<00:01:15.780> it

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
get out of this thing really easy it

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.469 
get out of this thing really easy it
actually<00:01:17.009> takes<00:01:17.189> much<00:01:17.400> less<00:01:17.700> effort<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.360> get

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
actually takes much less effort to get

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.050 
actually takes much less effort to get
into<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.990> out<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.409> new<00:01:19.590> heel<00:01:19.830> piece<00:01:20.130> so

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
into and out of this new heel piece so

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.039 
into and out of this new heel piece so
for<00:01:21.240> those<00:01:21.299> people<00:01:21.479> are<00:01:21.689> having<00:01:21.840> trouble

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
for those people are having trouble

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.719 
for those people are having trouble
getting<00:01:22.290> into<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.799> out<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.890> P<00:01:23.159> X<00:01:23.280> bindings<00:01:23.670> in

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
getting into and out of P X bindings in

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.310 
getting into and out of P X bindings in
the<00:01:23.820> past<00:01:24.060> that's<00:01:24.479> all<00:01:24.720> been<00:01:24.840> remedied<00:01:25.140> with

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
the past that's all been remedied with

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.249 
the past that's all been remedied with
the<00:01:25.439> new<00:01:25.560> SP<00:01:25.770> X<00:01:26.150> but<00:01:27.150> again<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.479> know<00:01:27.600> binding

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
the new SP X but again you know binding

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.719 
the new SP X but again you know binding
all<00:01:28.380> comes<00:01:28.590> down<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.829> coupling<00:01:29.280> strength<00:01:29.579> it's

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
all comes down to coupling strength it's

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:30.770 
all comes down to coupling strength it's
probably<00:01:29.970> one<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.210> most<00:01:30.299> important

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
probably one of the most important

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.210 
probably one of the most important
attributes<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.380> binding<00:01:31.740> because<00:01:31.829> that's

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
attributes of the binding because that's

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.100 
attributes of the binding because that's
what<00:01:32.490> drives<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.939> power<00:01:33.180> into<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> ski<00:01:33.840> so

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
what drives the power into the ski so

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.929 
what drives the power into the ski so
coupling<00:01:34.560> strength<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:34.979> really<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.340> boot

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
coupling strength is really that boot
