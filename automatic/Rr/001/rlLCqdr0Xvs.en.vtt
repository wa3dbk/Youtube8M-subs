00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.630 
came out a long time before any of those
was<00:00:58.050> probably<00:00:58.590> one<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:58.950> the<00:00:59.070> most<00:00:59.220> remember

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
was probably one of the most remember

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.640 
was probably one of the most remember
first-person<00:01:00.570> well<00:01:00.780> not<00:01:00.930> first-person<00:01:01.440> one

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
first-person well not first-person one

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.700 
first-person well not first-person one
of<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.770> most<00:01:02.670> remembered<00:01:03.240> right<00:01:03.930> gun<00:01:04.439> games

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
of the most remembered right gun games

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.550 
of the most remembered right gun games
in<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> arcade<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:06.109> used<00:01:07.109> almost

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
in the arcade that used almost

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.770 
in the arcade that used almost
exclusively<00:01:07.829> full<00:01:08.640> motion<00:01:08.820> video<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.450> think<00:01:09.539> it

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
exclusively full motion video I think it

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.419 
exclusively full motion video I think it
pretty<00:01:09.869> much<00:01:10.020> did<00:01:10.259> you<00:01:10.350> stumble<00:01:10.890> wing<00:01:11.250> that

00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:11.429 
pretty much did you stumble wing that

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:13.370 
pretty much did you stumble wing that
doesn't<00:01:11.729> dare<00:01:11.880> blow<00:01:12.090> across<00:01:12.359> the<00:01:12.719> street<00:01:12.990> and

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
doesn't dare blow across the street and

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.209 
doesn't dare blow across the street and
so<00:01:13.969> these<00:01:14.969> on<00:01:15.179> breeches<00:01:15.659> mean<00:01:16.219> unfortunately

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:17.219 
so these on breeches mean unfortunately

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:19.700 
so these on breeches mean unfortunately
though<00:01:17.880> more<00:01:18.869> fortunately<00:01:19.350> depending<00:01:19.469> on

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
though more fortunately depending on

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.709 
though more fortunately depending on
your<00:01:19.770> viewpoint<00:01:19.950> I'm<00:01:20.399> sure<00:01:20.609> the<00:01:21.030> game<00:01:21.299> is

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719 
your viewpoint I'm sure the game is

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.649 
your viewpoint I'm sure the game is
pretty<00:01:22.320> much<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.590> comedy<00:01:23.130> fighting<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.090> you

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
pretty much a comedy fighting it you

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.569 
pretty much a comedy fighting it you
