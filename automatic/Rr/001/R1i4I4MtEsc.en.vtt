00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.910
 good morning hector irrigation what a taste 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.620
 to be able to greet you at this start of the week 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.420
 of the people who accompany us 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.700
 we go to the high satellite image 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.410
 pressures dominate extensively and is 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.450
 a condition that dominates or at least 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.460
 significantly influences the 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.170
 Mexican territory with a good time 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.460
 we talk about absence of clouds and 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.230
 rains for a moment of course 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.510
 we could call it the 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.880
 instability versus the current scenario 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.470
 which is just in force associated with 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.700
 these high pressures however 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.280
 during the last hours the most 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.710
 relevant some high cloudiness some 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.450
 layers this in some northern sectors 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.730
 and the northeast associated with cloudiness 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.900
 average that is reported recently without 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.670
 However, it tends to decrease in 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.530
 the rest of the day did not 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.360
 there are precipitation issues associated with 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.130
 Mexican territory the rains more 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.100
 near the country are concentrated in the

 part of the north center of the usa 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.640
 of lorier americana by various 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.160
 conditions of instability towards that 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.810
 Instead we are still a few weeks 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.280
 time just so you can get there 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.350

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.880
 pacific and in the gulf of mexico from 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.530
 then a 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.990
 important activity in terms of these 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.119
