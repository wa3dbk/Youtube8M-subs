00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 hi and welcome to paris speak 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.120
 today we will talk about the iphone 6 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.560
 m 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.960
 if nicki minaj had the iphone 6 in the 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.820
 back pocket would it still be 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.439
 right I think no no I think he 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.450
 would be well curved yeah yeah 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.000
 well cambrai wayne nicki minaj sits 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.140
 on top of the stuff it's exposed what ah that's 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.880
 make him bursts hi 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.949
 go inside the firecracker an imposing thing 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.539
 we could say unframed yeah 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.369
 impossible impossible as we saw 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.750
 how she moves with her alejandro 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.280
 buttocks in my opinion it must be heard 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.960
 for the curve of the iphone 6 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.079
 well yeah yeah when one sits above 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.699
 and this client 2 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.120
 more or less easily but francis 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:43.789
 more yeah yeah ben damn good easter so 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.929
 so been tense at the exit of the iphone 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.539
 6 old versions become 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.890
 paying why probably because 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.239
 of drunkenness I do not think it's their 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.769
 trick there when they have 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.600
 yeah every time they come out healthy 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.829
 which requires more power exactly 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.420
 made a rather vague update sadian 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.859
 optioned it's weird you see I'm going 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.659
 not downloaded to Cairo is what I am 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.879
 do not do it you'll see your battery 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.409
 will last 2:30 pal will go on purpose 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.179
 to slow down the old machines 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.679
 to make sure that you buy the 

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:08.299
 new is done on purpose to 

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:10.060
 buy the 6 to buy us 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.670
 directly because it's not express 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:17.810
 very honestly yes yes yes I said 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.770
 no no no i do not agree is this 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.149
 that it is justified to buy a 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.990
 phone over 800 euros when we 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.340
 know it's just to send 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.590
 sms went on internet web a 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.780
 outright you see otherwise we would not be there 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.950
 but no we are obviously going to nantes if 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.189
 it's to send texts and make 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.840
 1.3310 calls that's enough not seen the 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.210
 price of others we see that archos did 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.929
 competition with a phone unless 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.490
 from 200 euros 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.960
 yeah we start to ask ourselves 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.189
 questions precisely about the brand that 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.899
 are the rent masters in there 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.579
 it hurts my buttocks me 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.750
 would say that with such a sum I think 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.950
 that you can buy a computer and a 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.179
 phone but people today 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.670
 put the price because it takes everything 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.549
 with seize box mail phone networks 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.719
 social to facebook all worried jing 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.039
 edge anyway any way 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:57.630
 other phone is able to do that 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.220
 and sometimes with better 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.270
 performance so it's not interesting 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.099
 yeah it will be so maybe it's not 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.329
 at all worried but after that is the name 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:05.069
 also it's the brand that's it for all 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.360
 was more than to have a 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.429
 phone I think it's not justifying 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.660
 my nose is part of our society 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.790
 so we can not go against 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.769
 and why people do what you do 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.000
 speak but who will buy is it you 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.750
 but who would have bought if you 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.989
 I speak to them but who is samsung 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:29.970
 escada he will serve me to his biggest 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.380
 and more flexible what will it look like 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.120
 the iphone of the future ipad as TV 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.290
 portable that is at table and that we can 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.590
 put on the back I do not know anything like 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.349
 it will be our size 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.969
 he will follow everywhere to have sports 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.859
 it's going to be a bit like a species 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:49.109
 much more bastard avatar 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.909
 of applications but still a time of 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:54.719
 drunk battery caucus in the head sa 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:56.250
 sheet of paper size a4 a phone 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:56.970
 form to four sheets of paper I 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.739
 think they would have holograms 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.250
 who would come out of the phone the keyboard 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.689
 will be placed directly on the table 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.769
 round tables that's it and any 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.129
 glass surface you can but your 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.439
 phone 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:11.879
 yeah that's it or you kind of ask me a 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.639
 species of logram what to be reassured 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:18.060
 buddies if we on your mates we go to 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:22.139
 the shareholder the iphone 6 frankly he 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.930
 what different do I like 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.459
 Synthetic thee I try I try to 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.560
 bigger he is bigger he does not hold 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.849
 in the actual pocket I have a little more 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.470
 curled so you see in the palm of the 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.310
 even if you do not look tatem 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.159
 feeling of sweetness 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.090
 bigger thinner but more fragile there 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.799
 what is most expensive is 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.139
 fuck nothing he's just bigger and 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.909
 precisely precisely more expensive one more 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:45.870
 flexible design that could change my 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.489
 meaning we stay on the same thing I think 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.079
 that it would be fair for society to 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.519
 consumer to buy there 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.409
 no big difference between 5 and 6 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.940
 euros paid 600 800 euros that motivates 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:57.240
 means it's normal that the life of this 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.070
 breeze when we start we let it go 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.060
 What surprises me most is that the 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.570
 city ​​breaks when I put in a 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.770
 ulcer pass his hand working there 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.330
 Above is maybe good ah that's right 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.100
 that for the price you say that you want 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.900
 whoever are invincible what the 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.450
 No4 between 3.10 and is more resistant 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.710
 when we see the sagem already ten years we 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.180
 could do any football had that 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.290
 not break and now an iphone that there 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.730
 is you make him fall from a meter he is 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.260
 finished they have to have to do when 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.620
 even indestructible is to 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.150
 buy yeah yeah that's it 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.980
 I think it's done on purpose month 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.420
 Thin it's been three months I have games 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.530
 the cases it's not three four times but 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.880
 knowing that they have the means too 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.230
 finally to make products that 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.510
 are resistant and enduring 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.410
 waiting to see 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.330
 what will change in your visit 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.600
 to the iphone so precisely what is going 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.400
 switch 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.360
 nero not eat because of a patois I 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.890
 yet it will have to buy the 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.280
 bigger pockets listening my life is going 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.050
 switch 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.060
 I will be able to take pictures 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:53.190
 everywhere send text messages everywhere 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.300
 send emails everywhere joker nothing that 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.440
 will start to make people understand 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.970
 that you have to pay perhaps 1000 euros 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.680
 now to call his buddy in 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.210
 big it the end of the month difficult to 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.800
 because of an iphone tarpaulin belonged to the 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.810
 high that I went back down there 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.430
 that's what sucks 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.470
 gt5 is so I was where a package 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.540

 hymn to jean would not join the group 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.730

 apple just released last 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.400
 version of his flagship phone the iphone 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.480
 6 largest thinner more flexible its 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.080
 battery and its screen are always 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.820

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.000
