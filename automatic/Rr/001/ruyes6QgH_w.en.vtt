00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 because a card capacity of eight 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.899
 gigas cost $ 15 and another eight gigs 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.899
 also costs 30 reais 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:21.199
 And, well , people are in the game, right? 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.539
 use another video of the channel doi a thousand and 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.550
 today I explain to you the variation of 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.460
 memory cards we can find 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.340
 in the market you have certainly found 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.559
 the same memory capacity by price 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.510
 different why this happens 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.059
 the essential factor for you to choose a 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.460
 memory card is not the ability to 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.379
 storage, but rather the class that your 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.910
 memory card will make it clear that 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.350
 chose so much memory that you will 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.170
 wanting is also a very 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.780
 important to choose the class of your 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.370
 card is even more important 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.219
 You have to stop and think of the following 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.120
 way so I need a card 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.039
 of memory 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.899
 I'll put it this card 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.170
 memory or put photos 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.760
 I'll put music videos or documents 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.470
 put apps 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.000
 There are some classes that I will 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.189
 explain now to you 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.810
 there is class 2 that the most 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.590
 card that exists for a 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.939
 memory 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.159
 so sometimes you find a 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.590
 16 gigabyte card for a price more in 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.150
 account because they certainly class 2 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.180
 or class 4 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.020
 beauty with the two class 4 that this 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.549
 means 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.000
 class 2 is a card that has 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.890
 speed of 2 megabytes per second 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.510
 so it 's pretty slow these days 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.090
 because each image 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.260
 we have with our smartphones every 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.570
 bigger time 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.920
 then the files have large size 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.840
 then class 2 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.130
 it will convey things over 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.710
 slowness 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.320
 so that's what you do in my 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.290
 smartphone is slow even iphone is 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.570
 taking time to spend things but not yours 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.130
 smartphone it is not slow because 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.770
 this talent is your memory card 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.930
 that you should probably have a 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.480
 class 2 or class 4 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.580
 the classic 4 respectively is 4 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.429
 megabytes per second already a class well 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.280
 medium a little better than the 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.690
 class 2 and then we also have the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.790
 class 6 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.870
 the class c already starts to get cool 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.270
 Just kidding 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.690
 class c already allows you to 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.030
 record videos in HD so if you put 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.190
 that option of all the photos you hit 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.320
 I fell straight from your memory card 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.900
 if you have a classic I know if it's already 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.640
 best for you to record a video on HD 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.280
 the quality becomes better the 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.590
 reproduction was better and consequently 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.720
 the time to do things for 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.390
 open your files to display the 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.730
 things look much better with almost 6 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.500
 then we have the top of the line which is a 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.600
 class 10 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.900
 class 10 already allows you to film in 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.910
 full hd transfers much faster 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.860
 sometimes you want to get the file from 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.550
 your micro sd and transfer to another 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.720
 local 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.940
 he transferred the speed command 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.140
 much faster than it uses 10 megabytes 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.090
 per second 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.950
 if you will have a use to install 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.410
 applications on your memory card if 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.150
 You are a user who has butt 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.640
 play their applications for cards 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.560
 memory you already have to have a classic 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.350
 10 because if you will put 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.510
 applications on your memory card 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.810
 you will put in the basic card four 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.709
 classes is another class 2 that is worse 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.080
 still 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.050
 you will leave your smartphone very 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.209
 slower then do not do this 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.730
 put your card applications 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.740
 memory class 4 6 or 2 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.950
 always place in class 10 to avoid 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.400
 avoiding gagging is treatments and 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.500
 slower reproductions 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.390
 It is also worth remembering the false illusion 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.680
 manufacturers create in the minds of their 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.380
 consumers 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.989
 you often go to a store and want to 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.870
 buy a smartphone germany the side 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.700
 smartphone is eight gigs beauty between 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.500
 The days, you look more or less like this. 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.790
 I have them nowadays, I can not 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.850
 almost anything 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.510
 the seller turns to you and talks but you 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.820
 you can expand with memory cards up to 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.970
 64 gigas but you already think a lot I have 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.650
 eight gymnasts 6472 of view made everything 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.360
 Are you going to arrest anyone who is talking? 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.489
 take this device lead when 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.470
 you arrive at your house you get to 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.510
 install a lot of application starts to 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.479
 do a lot of things and realize that 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.000
 Most of these applications will not 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.850
 the memory card 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.660
 for ordinary users are for songs 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:36.479
 photos videos and documents not 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.610
 think that you with the average user will 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.410
 able to throw their applications to the 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.419
 memory card so that you can 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.780
 play to the memory card until the 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:49.140
 android and lollipop the android m 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.100
 is the so-called android 3.0 connected already 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:55.220
 allows installation for 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.260
 micro sd but if you do not have android m 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.750
 There is no way to install it yet. 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.800
 natively all the applications in the 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.690
 memory card 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.370
 so do not force yourself into the eyes that the 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.120
 memory card will also expanded 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.010
 not too much 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.390
 in fact it does expand and you go 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.740
 put there a pool memory that 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.900
 buy a little business 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.420
 only it is not for application use and 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.920
 application that weighs most in your 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.260
 smartphone 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.450
 but how do I identify a class from a 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.070
 card not to buy wrong 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.510
 usually the memory card with the 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.670
 ideas and class 6 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.550
 they are more cars so stay tuned 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.020
 also at the price that is suggested to the card 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.670
 memory you are buying 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.190
 if you buy on the internet look at the 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:36.530
 product specifications certainly 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.080
 class will be there and if you want 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.150
 look also on the memory card has 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.370
 as you discover with class that is 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.500
 I tried to give an improvement that in the focus of 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.260
 Are you guys able to see 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.250
 a little ball here circled on top of 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.690
 10th 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.930
 This means that the 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:57.200
 memory is a card of a class of 32 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.180
 Good gigas she is I hope I have 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.160
 helped you because you choose the 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.590
 best memory cards for your 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.570
 smartphone or android tablet 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.550
 if you liked let your jorge mia not 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.410
 you are enrolled sign up to receive 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.540
