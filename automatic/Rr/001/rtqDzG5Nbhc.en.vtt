 Travel Star Kobe - Beach Wine and Kobe Beef Kobe City, Hyogo City "Subtitles for the Kansai Region Promotion Foundation" 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.800
 The mountains and plains are all the leaves of the Rokko Mountains. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.840
 Every year, many people are attracted to the beauty of the autumn. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.850
 Because Rokko is a granite geology, it produces natural groundwater. 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.030
 This gift is known as the famous water, flowing in the streets of Kobe. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.900
 Miyagawa, one of the famous waters, flows to Japanâ€™s first wine country, Tan Wuxiang. 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.900
 It is famous for its authentic beach-based sake and is rejuvenated. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.220
 Nowadays, in the five townships of the beach, there are also many wine cellars that compare traditional techniques with each other to produce authentic sakes of various tastes. 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.900
 Go on the way to visit the museum that learns to make wine. 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.430
 After washing the rice, steam the rice with a steam of Celsius. 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.400
 This process is called "steamed rice." 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.750
 Like Miyagawa, it is the wine rice that is indispensable for the finest Japanese sake. 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.120
 This is the cannon used to carry the palace water, known as the "big cockroach." 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.000
 After steaming the rice, enter the "cooling" process. 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.070
 Skillful craftsmanship shines in the process. 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.570
 The production of koji is carried out in a hot, humid wine cellar. 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.780
 Concentrated, long time, and sleeplessly produced. 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.090
 Stir the koji and steamed rice with a stir bar, prepare the yeast for cultivation, and wait for the fermentation. 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.870
 After the winemaking people sang songs and counted the fermentation time, they went into the process of pressing and filtering the turbid wine. 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.780
 After several steps, it enters the stage of storage and sealing. 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.190
 Brewing Japanese sake is both quick and delicate, and it is a matter that needs seriousness. 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.300
 There is also a wine tasting corner in the library. 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.460
 Make people who like to drink can't stop. 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:36.140
 The grace of nature and the craftsmanship of the wine-making people from generation to generation, led by Mr. Du, have been honed over the years and are two parts of the beach. 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.900
 I want to drink the last drop with a grateful heart. 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.320
 The night view of Kobe Port and Kobe is really fascinating. 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.800
 Tonight, I will be happy with Kobe. 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.900
 Enjoy food in the most desirable places. 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.000
 The pure rice brewed in the beach and the Kobe beef. 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.900
 This restaurant is a restaurant that promotes the ingredients of Hyogo Prefecture and the real estate. 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.030
 We offer three kinds of set menus, each of which is made from representative Kobe beef in Hyogo Prefecture. 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:37.000
 The first is a steak set made with fried Kobe beef, the second is a steamer package made with steamed Kobe beef, and the third is a hot pot set made with Kobe beef. 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:44.100
 From these three packages to rice, vegetables, fruits and tea, the carefully selected ingredients from Hyogo Prefecture are used. 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:52.850
 In addition, there is also a representative of Japanese sake, the sake of the beach, which is available in a variety of varieties and can be enjoyed with Kobe beef. 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.700
 A chef who knows nothing about the ingredients and skillfully simmers Kobe beef. 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.900
 The frying heat is a wonderful fire that the world's gourmets admire. 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.900
 With the local fresh vegetables, it is finished. 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.060
 The silence speaks. 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.960
 Completely immersed in the "taste" of Kobe. 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.970
 Kobe, an international city with beautiful streets surrounded by nature. 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.970
 There is another one worth paying attention to.
