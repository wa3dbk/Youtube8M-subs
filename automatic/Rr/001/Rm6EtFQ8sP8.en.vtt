00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.459 
we also are out demanding a living wage
for<00:02:03.039> all<00:02:03.070> baristas<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:04.600> shift<00:02:04.869> supervisors

for all baristas and shift supervisors

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:06.990 
for all baristas and shift supervisors
right<00:02:05.740> now<00:02:05.859> we<00:02:05.920> make<00:02:06.159> well<00:02:06.369> below<00:02:06.640> a<00:02:06.670> living

right now we make well below a living
wage<00:02:07.149> and<00:02:07.659> Starbucks<00:02:08.410> seems<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.709> be<00:02:08.800> ok<00:02:09.039> with

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
wage and Starbucks seems to be ok with

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.089 
wage and Starbucks seems to be ok with
that

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
that

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.570 
that
so<00:02:12.099> those<00:02:12.370> are<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:12.580> big<00:02:12.670> issues<00:02:14.580> Starbucks

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
so those are the big issues Starbucks

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.979 
so those are the big issues Starbucks
does<00:02:15.700> not<00:02:15.849> treat<00:02:16.209> their<00:02:16.450> employees<00:02:16.540> with

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
does not treat their employees with

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.350 
does not treat their employees with
respect<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.560> dignity<00:02:17.709> for<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.730> company<00:02:19.150> that

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
respect and dignity for a company that

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.970 
respect and dignity for a company that
prides<00:02:19.599> tough<00:02:19.959> publicly<00:02:20.560> for<00:02:20.830> its

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
prides tough publicly for its

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.500 
prides tough publicly for its
relationship<00:02:21.670> with<00:02:21.700> his<00:02:21.970> workers

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
relationship with his workers

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.660 
relationship with his workers
it<00:02:22.720> seems<00:02:23.080> paradoxical<00:02:23.769> that<00:02:24.069> whenever<00:02:24.280> they

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
it seems paradoxical that whenever they

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.940 
it seems paradoxical that whenever they
they<00:02:25.390> want<00:02:25.629> to<00:02:25.720> cut<00:02:25.900> corners<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.530> worker<00:02:26.739> is

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
they want to cut corners the worker is

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.850 
they want to cut corners the worker is
always<00:02:27.280> summer<00:02:27.549> there's<00:02:28.480> no<00:02:28.750> flexibility<00:02:29.650> and

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
always summer there's no flexibility and

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.949 
always summer there's no flexibility and
