00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.309
 Hello dear subscribers 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.759
 and fishing lovers 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.509
 today I would like to talk on the topic 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:22.829
 turing 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.319
 coils 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:25.619
 is it worth it 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.679
 what does it affect 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.390
 before something improves or replace 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.960
 in his coil 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.960
 need 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.610
 understanding 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.060
 why do it and whether it is worth the night 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.550
 of money 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.370
 for example, it makes no sense to buy cheap 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.390
 coil 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.820
 then 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.490
 tuning parts cost as much as myself 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.290
 coil 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.280
 now and above 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.190
 if possible for the total amount buy a coil 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.890
 higher class 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.400
 here is a more durable and unconventional king 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.820
 let's talk on the newsroom 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.820
 o in tuning the main nodes of the coil 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.000
 first handle 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.910
 replacement of the handle on carbon Khakassia 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.540
 club replacement 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.020
 for example carbon or 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.670
 metal 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.090
 it is not only its aesthetic external 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.180
 view 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.480
 but their sensitivity increases 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.550
 due to weight reduction and 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.960
 better materials 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.620
 when biting 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.509
 tactile sensations are transmitted not only 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.590
 through the bank will increase 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.600
 holding his hand 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.440
 but also through vyatka 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.100
 form 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.330
 to start 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.720
 transferred to avtovo hand and this is common 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.280
 sensitive 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.680
 collectively will create 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.400
 maximum slap 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.940
 even coil body material or simple 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.169
 club replacement 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.169
 bearings 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:12.949
 indicators 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:14.249
 sensitivity 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:15.869
 and of course 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:18.869
 prevent wear of the Russian stick 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.340
 This replacement bushings from the field and their controversial 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.039
 or 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:26.949
 This replacement is the most relevant Kiev 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:29.819
 consciously released this catch 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.060
 because 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.899
 thin braids are used 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:35.749
 and it is necessary 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:38.499
 the most complete work ring 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:40.649
 winners in each guest 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:43.249
 This item includes their names. 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:47.219
 school for him what name is the child 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:48.869
 the third 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:51.219
 installation attache delved into the rollers 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:53.449
 place to pack them 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:55.529
 this makes it easier 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:56.829
 rotation 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.889
 light bait 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.889
 she is less heavy can 90 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:05.809
 therefore replacement 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:08.659
 it is advisable but any coil 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:09.819
 but 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.119
 if you do not change there is 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:13.299
 bearings 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:14.779
 anyway 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:16.639
 thats only on 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.859
 quality bearings for example 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.859
 Shaman's relatives 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.709
 in side skirts 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.539
 have the same things become 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.799
 since Chinese cheap bearings are in 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.039
 many cases 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:32.539
 already that year 

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:35.099
 they start to rust 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.849
 noise cues so on 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.809
 in general, we of course speak from 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:42.569
 federal authorities or not worth it right away 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.909
 run and do not change in Kiev bearings tula 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.319
 and the whole tune what is it 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.819
 it is impossible to do 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.179
 in some coils 

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:55.359
 everything is great on the shelves too 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.149
 works just require more often in 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:01.019
 remuneration 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.579
 washing and lubrication 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.419
 fourth 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.929
 installing bearings on there 

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:10.089
 of course 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:12.589
 essentially it's a load on endless 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:13.769
 is minimal 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.459
 as his task 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.299
 just secure the bullet 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.389
 for uniform scarves are rare 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.419
 therefore reasonable 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.240
 change tolkien bearings when 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.050
 time 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.659
 big bait 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:31.620
 which significantly load the stock 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.389
 coils 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.530
 but as practice has shown this node 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.849
 kina bushes works well 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:39.919
 therefore even 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.580
 Beijing Palace 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.990
 established in the Turk in this matter 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.690
 just hammering the rotor nuts on the bearings 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.229
 and their installation 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.550
 bearing on i think these laptops 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.629
 talk next video 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:01.189
 under the name of cruel this one two silver 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:04.240
 Thanks for attention 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.160
 subscribe and she channel and group 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.050
 in contact with 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.500
 goodbye
