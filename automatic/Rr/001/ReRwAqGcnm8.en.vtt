just<00:00:21.369> below<00:00:21.699> the<00:00:21.880> boil<00:00:22.090> second<00:00:22.990> thing<00:00:23.140> is<00:00:23.289> the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
just below the boil second thing is the

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.080 
just below the boil second thing is the
eggs<00:00:23.590> the<00:00:23.890> fresher<00:00:24.250> the<00:00:24.429> better<00:00:24.550> when<00:00:24.970> they're

you may want to turn the heat up or down
a<00:00:44.800> little<00:00:45.010> bit<00:00:45.219> so<00:00:45.399> it's<00:00:45.520> just<00:00:45.940> under<00:00:46.210> a<00:00:46.329> simmer

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
a little bit so it's just under a simmer

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.389 
a little bit so it's just under a simmer
and<00:00:46.870> it's<00:00:47.590> like<00:00:47.800> clockwork

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
and it's like clockwork

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.400 
and it's like clockwork
three<00:00:48.820> minutes<00:00:49.149> they're<00:00:49.480> perfect<00:00:50.020> three<00:00:50.289> to

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
three minutes they're perfect three to

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.750 
three minutes they're perfect three to
five<00:00:50.620> minutes<00:00:51.010> depending<00:00:51.280> on<00:00:51.399> how<00:00:51.489> you<00:00:51.550> like

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
five minutes depending on how you like

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.209 
five minutes depending on how you like
the<00:00:51.910> yolk<00:00:52.120> once<00:00:52.690> the<00:00:52.899> white<00:00:53.079> is<00:00:53.320> fully<00:00:53.649> set<00:00:54.039> and

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
the yolk once the white is fully set and

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:55.680 
the yolk once the white is fully set and
the<00:00:54.460> yolk<00:00:54.670> is<00:00:54.820> cooked<00:00:55.059> to<00:00:55.149> desired<00:00:55.449> doneness

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
the yolk is cooked to desired doneness

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.420 
the yolk is cooked to desired doneness
then<00:00:56.260> we're<00:00:56.350> gonna<00:00:56.440> take<00:00:56.649> the<00:00:56.800> slotted<00:00:57.160> spoon

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430

then we're gonna take the slotted spoon
and<00:00:57.609> just<00:00:57.820> lift<00:00:58.090> them<00:00:58.210> out<00:00:58.359> you<00:00:58.870> can<00:00:59.020> see<00:00:59.170> how

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
and just lift them out you can see how

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:00.720 
and just lift them out you can see how
simple<00:00:59.559> this<00:00:59.769> is<00:00:59.829> but<00:01:00.190> if<00:01:00.250> you<00:01:00.280> want<00:01:00.370> to<00:01:00.579> try

nonstick pan which goes into its own
cooking<00:01:09.580> device<00:01:09.790> but<00:01:10.660> I<00:01:10.690> have<00:01:10.840> a<00:01:10.870> feeling

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
cooking device but I have a feeling

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.870 
cooking device but I have a feeling
after<00:01:11.410> seeing<00:01:11.800> how<00:01:11.890> simple<00:01:12.310> this<00:01:12.400> is<00:01:12.460> all

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
after seeing how simple this is all

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.390 
after seeing how simple this is all
you'll<00:01:13.330> need<00:01:13.480> is<00:01:13.720> a<00:01:13.750> pot<00:01:14.020> and<00:01:14.230> some<00:01:14.320> water<00:01:14.560> it's

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
you'll need is a pot and some water it's

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.740 
you'll need is a pot and some water it's
been<00:01:15.610> just<00:01:15.790> over<00:01:15.970> three<00:01:16.300> minutes<00:01:16.420> they're

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
been just over three minutes they're

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.420 
been just over three minutes they're
perfectly<00:01:17.230> cooked<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:17.680> white<00:01:17.860> is<00:01:18.040> set<00:01:18.280> but

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
perfectly cooked the white is set but

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.190 
perfectly cooked the white is set but
it's<00:01:18.580> still<00:01:18.730> nice<00:01:18.940> and<00:01:19.000> tender<00:01:19.360> and<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.990> last

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
it's still nice and tender and the last

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.860 
it's still nice and tender and the last
step<00:01:20.440> is<00:01:20.680> just<00:01:20.710> to<00:01:21.010> blot<00:01:21.280> with<00:01:21.610> a<00:01:22.570> slotted

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
step is just to blot with a slotted

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.960 
step is just to blot with a slotted
spoon<00:01:23.110> on<00:01:23.410> a<00:01:23.470> paper<00:01:23.680> towel<00:01:23.980> that<00:01:24.700> way<00:01:24.820> you'll
