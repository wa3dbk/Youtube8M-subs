ahead<00:02:06.860> and<00:02:09.549> kick<00:02:10.549> this<00:02:10.670> up<00:02:10.910> just<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:11.239> little<00:02:11.299> bit

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
ahead and kick this up just a little bit

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.729 
ahead and kick this up just a little bit
you<00:02:11.600> wanna<00:02:11.720> make<00:02:11.840> sure<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:12.049> got<00:02:12.200> some<00:02:12.440> sound

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
you wanna make sure you got some sound

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.420 
you wanna make sure you got some sound
there<00:02:13.010> so<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:13.819> know<00:02:13.940> that<00:02:14.120> you've<00:02:14.239> got<00:02:15.430> signal

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
there so you know that you've got signal

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.339 
there so you know that you've got signal
going<00:02:16.580> through<00:02:16.879> or<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.150> can<00:02:17.270> read<00:02:17.480> it

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
going through or it can read it

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:19.330 
going through or it can read it
and<00:02:18.439> then<00:02:18.560> as<00:02:18.680> we<00:02:18.829> go<00:02:18.950> ahead<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.189> start

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
and then as we go ahead and start

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.509 
and then as we go ahead and start
turning<00:02:19.849> this<00:02:19.969> dish<00:02:20.239> you'll<00:02:21.230> hear<00:02:21.650> there<00:02:22.249> goes

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
turning this dish you'll hear there goes

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.099 
turning this dish you'll hear there goes
about<00:02:22.819> something<00:02:24.340> as<00:02:25.340> we<00:02:25.489> find<00:02:25.730> something

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
about something as we find something

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:31.959 
about something as we find something
then<00:02:27.109> you<00:02:27.170> turn<00:02:27.349> this<00:02:27.499> down<00:02:27.739> and<00:02:28.040> actually<00:02:30.969> see

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:31.969 
then you turn this down and actually see

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:36.539 
then you turn this down and actually see
if<00:02:32.060> we<00:02:32.150> can't<00:02:32.389> get<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.599> higher<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.170> we<00:02:33.950> lost<00:02:34.159> it

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.429 

so<00:02:37.549> there<00:02:37.730> there's<00:02:37.969> our<00:02:38.150> that's<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:38.840> signal<00:02:39.349> we

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:39.439 
so there there's our that's a signal we

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.229 
so there there's our that's a signal we
don't<00:02:39.590> know<00:02:39.680> from<00:02:40.040> what<00:02:40.250> satellite<00:02:40.819> yet<00:02:41.060> but

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
don't know from what satellite yet but

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.330 
don't know from what satellite yet but
we<00:02:41.329> know<00:02:41.359> that<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:41.870> from<00:02:42.469> a<00:02:42.859> satellite

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
we know that it is from a satellite

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.720 
we know that it is from a satellite
inside<00:02:44.329> we're<00:02:44.569> on<00:02:44.629> satellite<00:02:45.109> 110

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
inside we're on satellite 110

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.920 
inside we're on satellite 110
transponder<00:02:46.730> 11<00:02:47.120> but<00:02:47.269> we're<00:02:47.419> not<00:02:47.599> getting

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
transponder 11 but we're not getting

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.270 
transponder 11 but we're not getting
anything<00:02:48.109> on<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.439> bottom<00:02:48.739> it<00:02:48.859> says<00:02:48.889> not

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
anything on the bottom it says not

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.339 
anything on the bottom it says not
locked<00:02:49.669> so<00:02:50.540> we're<00:02:50.659> going<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.810> run<00:02:50.959> right<00:02:51.019> back

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
locked so we're going to run right back

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.729 
locked so we're going to run right back
outside<00:02:51.620> again<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:53.150> get<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.109> next<00:02:54.439> one<00:02:54.709> or

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
outside again and get to the next one or

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.709 
outside again and get to the next one or
find<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.430> next<00:02:55.639> satellite<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.299> see<00:02:56.449> if<00:02:56.540> that's

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:56.719 
find the next satellite to see if that's

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:00.129 
find the next satellite to see if that's
the<00:02:56.900> one<00:02:57.639> so<00:02:58.639> I<00:02:59.000> just<00:02:59.209> turned<00:02:59.449> this<00:02:59.629> knob<00:02:59.870> down

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:00.139 
the one so I just turned this knob down

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.740 
the one so I just turned this knob down
there's<00:03:00.379> a<00:03:00.439> DB<00:03:00.919> knob<00:03:01.459> down<00:03:01.819> at<00:03:01.939> the<00:03:02.000> bottom<00:03:02.150> and

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
there's a DB knob down at the bottom and

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.599 
there's a DB knob down at the bottom and
we've<00:03:03.290> already<00:03:03.409> found<00:03:03.530> a<00:03:03.859> satellite<00:03:04.400> so

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
we've already found a satellite so

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.009 
we've already found a satellite so
you'll<00:03:04.760> hear<00:03:04.939> as<00:03:05.060> I<00:03:05.180> turn<00:03:05.359> it<00:03:05.389> up<00:03:05.629> there's<00:03:05.870> the

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
you'll hear as I turn it up there's the

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.020 
you'll hear as I turn it up there's the
sound<00:03:06.260> well<00:03:07.189> what<00:03:07.340> I'm<00:03:07.430> going<00:03:07.519> to<00:03:07.609> do<00:03:07.760> is<00:03:07.879> turn

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
sound well what I'm going to do is turn

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.209 
sound well what I'm going to do is turn
it<00:03:08.180> back<00:03:08.299> up<00:03:08.569> and<00:03:09.169> we'll<00:03:09.379> move<00:03:09.530> until<00:03:09.829> we<00:03:09.949> find

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:10.219 
it back up and we'll move until we find

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:12.670 
it back up and we'll move until we find
the<00:03:10.370> next<00:03:10.549> satellite<00:03:10.900> with<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.019> sound<00:03:12.290> then

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
the next satellite with the sound then

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.649 
the next satellite with the sound then
we'll<00:03:12.769> go<00:03:12.859> check<00:03:12.889> it<00:03:13.280> in<00:03:13.370> there<00:03:13.579> on<00:03:13.699> the<00:03:13.909> screen

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.899 

there's<00:03:20.659> the<00:03:20.780> next<00:03:20.959> one<00:03:21.139> right<00:03:21.349> there<00:03:21.909> the

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:22.909 
there's the next one right there the

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.030 
there's the next one right there the
next<00:03:23.239> satellite<00:03:23.659> that<00:03:23.780> we<00:03:23.900> did<00:03:24.079> find<00:03:24.379> was<00:03:24.680> the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
next satellite that we did find was the

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.390 
next satellite that we did find was the
right<00:03:25.250> satellite<00:03:26.049> lock<00:03:27.049> Dec<00:03:27.379> will<00:03:27.530> start<00:03:27.769> 119

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
right satellite lock Dec will start 119

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.999 
right satellite lock Dec will start 119
we<00:03:28.639> do<00:03:28.759> have<00:03:28.909> a<00:03:29.090> 110<00:03:29.569> up<00:03:29.720> at<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:29.870> top<00:03:30.109> so<00:03:30.349> once

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:31.009 
we do have a 110 up at the top so once

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:32.589 
we do have a 110 up at the top so once
we<00:03:31.129> get<00:03:31.220> this<00:03:31.400> far<00:03:31.699> we<00:03:31.849> come<00:03:32.030> over<00:03:32.239> here<00:03:32.389> to<00:03:32.509> the

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
we get this far we come over here to the

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.020 
we get this far we come over here to the
check<00:03:32.840> switch<00:03:33.109> and<00:03:33.470> hit<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.489> check<00:03:34.729> switch

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
check switch and hit the check switch

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.210 
check switch and hit the check switch
and<00:03:35.530> then<00:03:36.530> it's<00:03:36.650> going<00:03:36.739> to<00:03:36.799> come<00:03:36.979> over<00:03:37.009> here

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
and then it's going to come over here

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.909 
and then it's going to come over here
and<00:03:37.579> we<00:03:37.639> go<00:03:37.759> to<00:03:37.819> test<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.989> test<00:03:39.530> it<00:03:39.769> to<00:03:39.799> make

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
and we go to test to test it to make

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.110 
and we go to test to test it to make
sure<00:03:40.040> that<00:03:40.189> we've<00:03:40.430> got<00:03:40.459> both<00:03:40.849> of<00:03:40.879> the

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
sure that we've got both of the

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.969 
sure that we've got both of the
satellites<00:03:41.599> so<00:03:42.259> we're<00:03:42.379> looking<00:03:42.650> for<00:03:42.859> both

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:42.979 
satellites so we're looking for both

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:46.719 
satellites so we're looking for both
satellite<00:03:43.639> 110<00:03:44.180> and<00:03:44.709> 119<00:03:45.709> this<00:03:46.310> is<00:03:46.459> another

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:46.729 
satellite 110 and 119 this is another

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:48.460 
satellite 110 and 119 this is another
one<00:03:46.970> of<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.150> common<00:03:47.509> problems<00:03:47.659> that<00:03:48.109> happens

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
one of the common problems that happens

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.249 
one of the common problems that happens
we<00:03:49.099> did<00:03:49.370> find<00:03:49.639> a<00:03:49.729> satellite<00:03:50.239> it<00:03:50.479> was<00:03:50.689> satellite

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:51.259 
we did find a satellite it was satellite

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:54.610 
we did find a satellite it was satellite
110<00:03:51.799> but<00:03:52.489> we<00:03:52.609> didn't<00:03:52.909> find<00:03:53.030> both<00:03:53.359> so<00:03:53.810> it<00:03:54.439> says

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
110 but we didn't find both so it says

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.170 
110 but we didn't find both so it says
we<00:03:54.859> have<00:03:54.979> fewer<00:03:55.280> satellites<00:03:55.759> than<00:03:55.970> we<00:03:56.090> have

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
we have fewer satellites than we have

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.499 
we have fewer satellites than we have
previously<00:03:56.329> detected<00:03:57.129> you<00:03:58.129> can<00:03:58.459> save<00:03:59.030> it<00:03:59.329> if

00:03:59.499 --> 00:03:59.509 
previously detected you can save it if

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:01.229 
previously detected you can save it if
you<00:03:59.720> say<00:04:00.019> that<00:04:00.290> you<00:04:00.439> will<00:04:00.560> see<00:04:00.799> which

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
you say that you will see which

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.939 
you say that you will see which
satellite<00:04:02.239> you<00:04:02.689> did<00:04:02.959> find<00:04:03.290> in<00:04:03.469> which<00:04:03.560> one<00:04:03.829> you

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:03.949 
satellite you did find in which one you

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:06.490 
satellite you did find in which one you
did<00:04:04.189> not<00:04:04.219> find<00:04:04.759> but<00:04:05.449> this<00:04:05.569> also<00:04:05.930> just<00:04:06.139> gives<00:04:06.319> us

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
did not find but this also just gives us

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.679 
did not find but this also just gives us
another<00:04:06.620> opportunity<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:08.060> cancel<00:04:08.509> out<00:04:08.659> of

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:08.689 
another opportunity to cancel out of

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.709 
another opportunity to cancel out of
that<00:04:08.840> cancel<00:04:09.590> back<00:04:09.769> come<00:04:10.549> over<00:04:10.879> and<00:04:11.150> then<00:04:11.359> try

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:11.719 
that cancel back come over and then try

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:14.170 
that cancel back come over and then try
the<00:04:11.750> next<00:04:12.280> satellite<00:04:13.280> that's<00:04:13.790> out<00:04:13.939> there

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
the next satellite that's out there

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.849 
the next satellite that's out there
because<00:04:14.780> we<00:04:14.930> didn't<00:04:15.169> find<00:04:15.409> one<00:04:15.680> of<00:04:15.709> the

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
because we didn't find one of the

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.779 
because we didn't find one of the
satellites<00:04:17.560> this<00:04:18.560> is<00:04:18.799> a<00:04:18.829> properly<00:04:19.340> aligned

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
satellites this is a properly aligned

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.570 
satellites this is a properly aligned
satellite<00:04:20.419> you<00:04:21.320> can<00:04:21.440> see<00:04:21.590> it<00:04:21.709> is<00:04:21.859> backwards<00:04:22.490> a

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
satellite you can see it is backwards a

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.680 
satellite you can see it is backwards a
little<00:04:22.610> bit<00:04:22.849> to<00:04:23.060> what<00:04:23.210> you<00:04:23.330> would<00:04:23.479> think

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
little bit to what you would think

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.709 
little bit to what you would think
satellite<00:04:24.289> 110<00:04:24.830> actually<00:04:25.639> gets<00:04:26.060> aligned<00:04:26.419> with

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:26.719 
satellite 110 actually gets aligned with

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:29.379 
satellite 110 actually gets aligned with
the<00:04:27.020> eye<00:04:27.199> on<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:27.800> right<00:04:28.070> if<00:04:28.789> you're<00:04:29.029> standing

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
the eye on the right if you're standing

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:30.460 
the eye on the right if you're standing
behind<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.779> dish

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
behind the dish

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.890 
behind the dish
and<00:04:30.560> 119<00:04:31.460> gets<00:04:31.790> aligned<00:04:32.120> with<00:04:32.360> the<00:04:32.480> I<00:04:32.510> that's

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
and 119 gets aligned with the I that's

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.970 
and 119 gets aligned with the I that's
on<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.320> left

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
on the left

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.580 
on the left
if<00:04:34.910> these<00:04:35.090> aren't<00:04:35.390> aligned<00:04:35.750> correctly<00:04:36.140> like

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
if these aren't aligned correctly like

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.410 
if these aren't aligned correctly like
this<00:04:36.920> you<00:04:37.490> won't<00:04:38.240> get<00:04:38.600> both<00:04:38.900> satellites<00:04:40.420> when

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
this you won't get both satellites when

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.320 
this you won't get both satellites when
you're<00:04:41.570> only<00:04:41.720> getting<00:04:41.990> one<00:04:42.410> satellite<00:04:43.330> the

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
you're only getting one satellite the

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.300 
you're only getting one satellite the
reason<00:04:44.720> is<00:04:44.900> because<00:04:45.230> you're<00:04:45.650> aligning<00:04:46.190> the

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
reason is because you're aligning the

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.120 
reason is because you're aligning the
satellite<00:04:46.910> with<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.480> wrong<00:04:47.720> eye<00:04:48.020> of<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:48.890> dish

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
satellite with the wrong eye of the dish

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.150 
satellite with the wrong eye of the dish
as<00:04:50.030> you<00:04:50.270> can<00:04:50.390> see<00:04:50.570> here<00:04:50.840> in<00:04:50.930> this<00:04:51.050> diagram

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
as you can see here in this diagram

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.430 
as you can see here in this diagram
satellite<00:04:52.160> 110<00:04:52.700> is<00:04:53.330> actually<00:04:53.780> aligning<00:04:54.230> with

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
satellite 110 is actually aligning with

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.030 
satellite 110 is actually aligning with
the<00:04:55.010> eye<00:04:55.040> on<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:55.640> left<00:04:56.110> which<00:04:57.110> leaves

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
the eye on the left which leaves

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.780 
the eye on the left which leaves
satellite<00:04:58.610> 119<00:04:59.330> not<00:04:59.810> hitting<00:05:00.440> anything

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
satellite 119 not hitting anything

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.550 
satellite 119 not hitting anything
that's<00:05:01.790> why<00:05:01.970> we<00:05:02.150> come<00:05:02.330> in<00:05:02.450> and<00:05:02.600> check<00:05:02.840> do<00:05:03.410> the

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
that's why we come in and check do the

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.960 
that's why we come in and check do the
check<00:05:03.800> switch<00:05:04.070> to<00:05:04.400> make<00:05:04.520> sure<00:05:04.640> that<00:05:04.730> we<00:05:04.850> have

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
check switch to make sure that we have

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.730 
check switch to make sure that we have
both<00:05:05.150> satellites<00:05:07.810> this<00:05:08.810> is<00:05:08.990> another<00:05:09.230> diagram

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
both satellites this is another diagram

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.940 
both satellites this is another diagram
showing<00:05:10.250> how<00:05:10.940> you<00:05:11.000> can<00:05:11.420> miss<00:05:11.780> satellite<00:05:12.470> 110

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
showing how you can miss satellite 110

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.400 
showing how you can miss satellite 110
and<00:05:13.130> still<00:05:13.430> get<00:05:13.730> satellite<00:05:14.510> 119<00:05:16.600> we<00:05:17.600> got<00:05:18.260> the

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
and still get satellite 119 we got the

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.170 
and still get satellite 119 we got the
satellite<00:05:18.830> reception<00:05:19.160> verified<00:05:19.820> if<00:05:19.970> you<00:05:20.030> see

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
satellite reception verified if you see

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.150 
satellite reception verified if you see
on<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.330> status<00:05:20.720> and<00:05:20.750> we<00:05:20.960> have<00:05:21.110> both<00:05:21.320> 110<00:05:21.919> and

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
on the status and we have both 110 and

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.940 
on the status and we have both 110 and
119<00:05:22.850> and<00:05:23.419> the<00:05:23.570> player<00:05:23.840> is<00:05:24.050> all<00:05:24.290> are<00:05:24.440> taken<00:05:24.770> care

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
119 and the player is all are taken care

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.490 
119 and the player is all are taken care
of<00:05:25.010> there<00:05:25.250> so<00:05:25.880> now<00:05:26.120> we<00:05:26.180> are<00:05:26.480> able<00:05:26.720> to<00:05:26.870> go<00:05:27.230> ahead

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
of there so now we are able to go ahead

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.260 
of there so now we are able to go ahead
and<00:05:27.620> watch<00:05:27.770> TV<00:05:28.160> the<00:05:28.400> satellite<00:05:28.850> dish<00:05:29.060> is

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
and watch TV the satellite dish is

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.320 
and watch TV the satellite dish is
properly<00:05:29.870> aligned<00:05:32.169> cancel<00:05:33.169> out<00:05:33.290> of<00:05:33.320> that

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
properly aligned cancel out of that

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.670 
properly aligned cancel out of that
then<00:05:35.330> we'll<00:05:35.450> cancel<00:05:35.690> out<00:05:35.960> of<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.169> point<00:05:36.410> dish

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
then we'll cancel out of the point dish

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.590 
then we'll cancel out of the point dish
and<00:05:36.919> if<00:05:36.980> you<00:05:37.070> just<00:05:37.220> press<00:05:37.490> the<00:05:37.760> zero<00:05:38.090> button<00:05:38.390> a
