00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.830
 at 13 to 30 years I have I am going to thank me 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.350
 the track that becomes youth 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.350
 This means that the victory will keep it 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:10.650
 it is a platform for discussion 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.559
 what you can press 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.549
 he could have combined better 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.549
 duke 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.589
 to work 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.160
 at the door and what you should pay attention to have side effects digested 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:27.839
 to make the present 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.949
 to bring in all the components from the cabinet 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.040
 unfortunately I only have old images of it 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.590
 the city is not very difficult, you just have to make sure it doesn't bring anything 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.780
 these are components that you encounter in computer 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.450
 I'll come back to you later 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.040
 This is great that here all the computer components are connected 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.350
 connected the buzzwordand large 24 pink a heavy 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.050
 piquet as it shows 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.300
 if it is good that a big cow becomes the computer this is too cool of it 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.150
 process 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.819
 company sees a collection 

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:01.990
 starting from process corner that must put up forest 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.130
 free the process costs from the motherboard 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.430
 by simply four screws loose screws 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.200
 once you get the processor cooler 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.900
 removed it from the motherboard 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.690
 You will see that there is still a layer of thermal paste present on the process 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.380
 Easy to remove with a little against ten 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.380
 make bottle open a little by ten 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.620
 feast china slowly about the processes and 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.140
 that you are not hard team 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.890
 further names with a piece of tropical paper 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.260
 also the processes ring so that you can see it very well in number of the process 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.840
 the processor type is in fact very village esther's my quad core build also about 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.100
 you can use this purpose to use single fever 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.100
 But don't go for the best results outside of Hamburg 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.490
 for this plays I recommend that you capture at least twice you can watch 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.330
 or other your computer simply by putting your edge pieces for a moment 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.010
 get out and see how many gigabytes or on the street 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.160
 if there is still a slot left, you can puncture it for the best 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.890
 result consult for this submit the boarding school further on it 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.930
 motherboard and 24 thinking naked by connecting it becomes the motherboard 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.930
 powered by texas connections 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:17.099
 for the hard drives connected to the board on this took care of the year on 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.729
 the cockpit store also will see a number of other contiguous ones 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:25.430
 the motherboard these are the track years of traffic on lock network cards 

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:30.709
 sound cards the bartz video card possibly or more encounters is the TV 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:31.819
 Map 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.819
 and cu sp card 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.870
 know source ap 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:37.789
 that is in 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:40.789
 i find i have a code to print a headline 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.519
 how you set up each other before the collision happened 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.539
 as a wife there the last few days 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:51.539
 they'll find out later when the judge is convicted 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.519
 and I say for you 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.279
 the
