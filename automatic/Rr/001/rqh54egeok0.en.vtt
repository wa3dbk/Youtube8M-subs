but<00:01:51.130> um<00:01:51.539> so<00:01:52.539> one<00:01:53.200> of<00:01:53.229> the<00:01:53.350> things<00:01:53.380> I<00:01:53.619> hate<00:01:53.799> is

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
but um so one of the things I hate is

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.560 
but um so one of the things I hate is
when<00:01:53.979> people<00:01:54.130> just<00:01:54.520> randomly<00:01:54.729> throw<00:01:55.240> out<00:01:55.420> the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
when people just randomly throw out the

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.969 
when people just randomly throw out the
word<00:01:55.689> awkward<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.350> when<00:01:56.500> they<00:01:56.619> say<00:01:56.770> it<00:01:56.890> they

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
word awkward and when they say it they

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.730 
word awkward and when they say it they
like<00:01:57.130> stretch<00:01:57.399> it<00:01:57.549> so<00:01:57.700> they're<00:01:57.850> like<00:01:57.939> awkward

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
like stretch it so they're like awkward

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.069 
like stretch it so they're like awkward
so<00:01:59.740> after<00:01:59.950> that<00:02:00.159> then<00:02:01.149> it<00:02:01.329> just<00:02:01.479> gets<00:02:01.600> awkward

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
so after that then it just gets awkward

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.779 
so after that then it just gets awkward
because<00:02:02.200> when<00:02:02.409> you<00:02:02.470> say<00:02:02.500> that<00:02:02.829> it's<00:02:02.979> like<00:02:03.159> well

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
because when you say that it's like well

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.850 
because when you say that it's like well
okay<00:02:03.909> like<00:02:04.539> no<00:02:04.659> one's<00:02:04.840> gonna<00:02:04.960> say<00:02:05.200> like<00:02:05.439> how

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
okay like no one's gonna say like how

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.260 
okay like no one's gonna say like how
was<00:02:06.009> it<00:02:06.159> awkward<00:02:06.250> that's<00:02:06.850> just<00:02:07.030> going<00:02:07.119> to<00:02:07.240> make

it<00:02:07.450> more<00:02:07.570> awkward<00:02:07.750> right<00:02:08.349> but<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.009> fact<00:02:09.130> that

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.559
