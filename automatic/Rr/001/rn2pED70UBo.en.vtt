00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.950 

hi<00:00:05.500> I'm<00:00:06.500> Val<00:00:06.770> I'm<00:00:07.040> here<00:00:07.490> to<00:00:07.760> talk<00:00:08.660> a<00:00:08.690> little<00:00:08.809> bit

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
hi I'm Val I'm here to talk a little bit

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.810 
hi I'm Val I'm here to talk a little bit
about<00:00:09.200> the<00:00:09.440> glass<00:00:09.680> rod<00:00:10.010> and<00:00:10.280> how<00:00:10.370> to<00:00:10.430> use<00:00:10.639> them

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
about the glass rod and how to use them

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.980 
about the glass rod and how to use them
in<00:00:10.940> fusing<00:00:11.240> sometimes<00:00:12.110> I<00:00:12.290> think<00:00:12.620> that<00:00:12.920> it's

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
in fusing sometimes I think that it's

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.359 
in fusing sometimes I think that it's
not<00:00:14.990> always<00:00:15.140> thought<00:00:15.470> that<00:00:15.680> people<00:00:16.040> can<00:00:16.189> use

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
not always thought that people can use

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:17.800 
not always thought that people can use
the<00:00:16.550> rod<00:00:16.730> and<00:00:16.939> fusing<00:00:17.390> as<00:00:17.510> well<00:00:17.689> as

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
the rod and fusing as well as

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:18.400 
the rod and fusing as well as
flameworking

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
flameworking

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.940 
flameworking
so<00:00:18.590> I<00:00:18.860> have<00:00:19.520> an<00:00:19.610> example<00:00:19.970> here<00:00:20.150> of<00:00:20.390> a<00:00:20.990> little

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
so I have an example here of a little

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.530 
so I have an example here of a little
dish<00:00:22.099> that<00:00:22.340> was<00:00:22.430> made<00:00:22.640> totally<00:00:23.090> with<00:00:23.240> the<00:00:23.270> last

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
dish that was made totally with the last

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.600 
dish that was made totally with the last
rod<00:00:23.810> and<00:00:24.050> I<00:00:24.140> have<00:00:24.349> a<00:00:24.380> I<00:00:24.770> have<00:00:25.070> it<00:00:25.189> set<00:00:25.430> up<00:00:25.579> here

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
rod and I have a I have it set up here

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.479 
rod and I have a I have it set up here
just<00:00:25.970> so<00:00:26.060> you<00:00:26.150> could<00:00:26.329> see<00:00:26.720> that<00:00:27.099> it<00:00:28.099> really<00:00:28.340> is

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:28.489 
just so you could see that it really is

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:31.089 
just so you could see that it really is
just<00:00:29.090> glass<00:00:29.390> rod<00:00:29.779> that's<00:00:30.050> laid<00:00:30.320> on<00:00:30.500> top<00:00:30.800> of

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
just glass rod that's laid on top of

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.310 
just glass rod that's laid on top of
this<00:00:31.640> turquoise<00:00:32.060> piece<00:00:32.390> of<00:00:32.540> glass<00:00:32.750> so<00:00:32.989> I<00:00:33.050> cut

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
this turquoise piece of glass so I cut

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.960 
this turquoise piece of glass so I cut
this<00:00:33.470> turquoise<00:00:33.800> piece<00:00:34.130> of<00:00:34.310> glass<00:00:34.520> to<00:00:34.760> show

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
this turquoise piece of glass to show

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.330 
this turquoise piece of glass to show
you<00:00:35.030> these<00:00:35.840> are<00:00:35.899> the<00:00:36.050> glass<00:00:36.350> rod<00:00:36.620> you<00:00:36.859> just<00:00:37.100> cut

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
you these are the glass rod you just cut

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.270 
you these are the glass rod you just cut
them<00:00:37.460> to<00:00:37.670> fit<00:00:38.019> I<00:00:40.780> often<00:00:41.780> when<00:00:42.769> I'm<00:00:42.859> cutting<00:00:43.070> the

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
them to fit I often when I'm cutting the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.799 
them to fit I often when I'm cutting the
rod<00:00:43.429> I'd<00:00:43.579> like<00:00:43.730> to<00:00:43.879> use<00:00:44.059> these<00:00:44.269> they're

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
rod I'd like to use these they're

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.169 
rod I'd like to use these they're
actually<00:00:45.140> glass<00:00:45.440> mosaic<00:00:45.980> nippers<00:00:46.399> but<00:00:47.030> they

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:47.179 
actually glass mosaic nippers but they

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.270 
actually glass mosaic nippers but they
work<00:00:47.329> really<00:00:47.539> good<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:48.050> cut<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.859> rod<00:00:49.070> as

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
work really good to cut the the rod as

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.669 
work really good to cut the the rod as
well<00:00:49.489> if<00:00:49.699> you<00:00:49.850> don't<00:00:50.030> have<00:00:50.359> them<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:50.780> you<00:00:51.530> have

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:51.679 
well if you don't have them and you have

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:53.590 
well if you don't have them and you have
glass<00:00:51.949> cutters<00:00:52.429> you<00:00:52.460> can<00:00:52.820> use<00:00:52.969> a<00:00:53.000> glass<00:00:53.300> cutter

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
glass cutters you can use a glass cutter

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.930 
glass cutters you can use a glass cutter
just<00:00:53.929> by<00:00:54.109> just<00:00:54.649> by<00:00:54.769> scoring<00:00:55.339> the<00:00:55.370> top<00:00:55.670> of<00:00:55.850> the

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
just by just by scoring the top of the

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.959 
just by just by scoring the top of the
rod<00:00:56.089> and<00:00:56.120> then<00:00:56.420> snapping<00:00:57.050> it<00:00:57.370> so<00:00:58.370> I<00:00:58.730> can<00:00:58.940> show

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
rod and then snapping it so I can show

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.020 
rod and then snapping it so I can show
you<00:00:59.269> like<00:00:59.660> this<00:01:00.019> take<00:01:00.829> your<00:01:01.010> glass<00:01:01.489> cutter<00:01:01.820> and

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
you like this take your glass cutter and

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.149 
you like this take your glass cutter and
you're<00:01:02.120> just<00:01:02.300> going<00:01:02.449> to<00:01:02.480> roll<00:01:03.409> it<00:01:03.649> on<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:03.800> top

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
you're just going to roll it on the top

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.450 
you're just going to roll it on the top
and<00:01:04.879> then<00:01:05.870> just<00:01:06.110> kind<00:01:06.320> of<00:01:06.409> break<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:06.980> away<00:01:07.100> from

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
and then just kind of break it away from

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.360 
and then just kind of break it away from
you<00:01:07.750> lay<00:01:08.750> it<00:01:08.900> to<00:01:08.930> fit<00:01:09.290> but<00:01:09.950> I'll<00:01:10.040> show<00:01:10.190> you<00:01:10.220> how

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
you lay it to fit but I'll show you how

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.720 
you lay it to fit but I'll show you how
slick<00:01:10.820> these<00:01:11.090> little<00:01:11.420> nippers<00:01:12.230> are<00:01:12.520> you<00:01:13.520> just

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
slick these little nippers are you just

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.110 
slick these little nippers are you just
kind<00:01:13.940> of<00:01:14.060> put<00:01:14.210> those<00:01:14.360> right<00:01:14.660> on<00:01:14.870> there<00:01:16.120> and

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
kind of put those right on there and

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.690 
kind of put those right on there and
bite<00:01:17.450> it<00:01:17.630> off<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.260> that<00:01:19.010> really<00:01:19.220> works<00:01:19.430> really

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
bite it off and that really works really

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.730 
bite it off and that really works really
well<00:01:19.910> too<00:01:20.180> so<00:01:20.420> you<00:01:20.780> can<00:01:20.900> see<00:01:21.080> if<00:01:21.200> I<00:01:21.320> line<00:01:21.560> them

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
well too so you can see if I line them

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.100 
well too so you can see if I line them
all<00:01:21.830> up<00:01:22.120> cover<00:01:23.120> the<00:01:23.300> whole<00:01:23.450> thing<00:01:23.480> with<00:01:23.750> rod

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
all up cover the whole thing with rod

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.900 
all up cover the whole thing with rod
I'm<00:01:24.380> going<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:24.590> get<00:01:24.710> this<00:01:24.830> really<00:01:25.130> cool<00:01:25.310> linear

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
I'm going to get this really cool linear

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.870 
I'm going to get this really cool linear
effect<00:01:26.270> at<00:01:26.450> least<00:01:26.660> I<00:01:26.840> really<00:01:27.080> like<00:01:27.260> it<00:01:27.410> and

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
effect at least I really like it and

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.240 
effect at least I really like it and
then<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.030> other<00:01:29.060> thing<00:01:29.480> that<00:01:29.890> we<00:01:30.890> started

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
then the other thing that we started

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.130 
then the other thing that we started
using<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.700> rod<00:01:31.850> for<00:01:32.090> around<00:01:32.390> here<00:01:32.690> was<00:01:32.900> we

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
using the rod for around here was we

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.480 
using the rod for around here was we
started<00:01:33.200> doing<00:01:33.500> a<00:01:33.680> lot<00:01:33.770> of<00:01:33.830> combing<00:01:34.280> in<00:01:34.400> the

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
started doing a lot of combing in the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.780 
started doing a lot of combing in the
kiln<00:01:34.730> where<00:01:35.240> we<00:01:35.390> would<00:01:35.480> put<00:01:35.510> different

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
kiln where we would put different

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.150 
kiln where we would put different
sections<00:01:37.790> of<00:01:37.910> color<00:01:38.210> in<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:39.170> kiln<00:01:39.470> then<00:01:39.830> we

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
sections of color in the kiln then we

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.640 
sections of color in the kiln then we
would<00:01:40.340> get<00:01:40.640> it<00:01:40.790> up<00:01:40.910> to<00:01:41.060> 16<00:01:41.450> 1700<00:01:42.170> degrees<00:01:42.440> and

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
would get it up to 16 1700 degrees and

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.290 
would get it up to 16 1700 degrees and
then<00:01:42.740> rake<00:01:43.040> through<00:01:43.310> it<00:01:43.550> with<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:43.880> stainless

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
then rake through it with a stainless

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.330 
then rake through it with a stainless
steel<00:01:44.450> rake<00:01:44.870> and<00:01:45.140> it<00:01:45.650> makes<00:01:45.830> these<00:01:46.010> really

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
steel rake and it makes these really

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.390 
steel rake and it makes these really
cool<00:01:46.730> patterns<00:01:47.300> but<00:01:47.960> an<00:01:48.200> easy<00:01:48.830> way<00:01:49.070> to<00:01:49.100> do<00:01:49.370> it

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
cool patterns but an easy way to do it

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.570 
cool patterns but an easy way to do it
is<00:01:49.730> to<00:01:50.000> also<00:01:50.330> use<00:01:50.510> glass<00:01:50.810> rod<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.370> just<00:01:52.370> line

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
is to also use glass rod and just line

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.640 
is to also use glass rod and just line
it<00:01:52.610> up<00:01:52.880> on<00:01:53.120> the<00:01:53.750> back<00:01:53.930> instead<00:01:54.170> of<00:01:54.350> having<00:01:54.500> to

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
it up on the back instead of having to

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.370 
it up on the back instead of having to
cut<00:01:54.830> all<00:01:55.010> kinds<00:01:55.220> of<00:01:55.430> strips<00:01:55.760> so<00:01:56.110> so<00:01:57.110> this<00:01:57.260> is

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
cut all kinds of strips so so this is

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.480 
cut all kinds of strips so so this is
what<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:57.590> looked<00:01:57.800> like<00:01:57.860> before

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
what it looked like before

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.730 
what it looked like before
after<00:01:59.300> we've<00:01:59.450> raked<00:01:59.690> it<00:01:59.930> or<00:02:00.170> after<00:02:00.470> we've

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
after we've raked it or after we've

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.840 
after we've raked it or after we've
raked<00:02:00.920> it<00:02:01.070> this<00:02:01.190> is<00:02:01.370> what<00:02:01.520> it<00:02:01.610> looked<00:02:01.790> like

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
raked it this is what it looked like

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.940 
raked it this is what it looked like
before

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
before

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.500 
before
so<00:02:03.950> glass<00:02:04.370> rod<00:02:04.640> is<00:02:04.760> really<00:02:05.000> fun<00:02:05.180> to<00:02:05.300> use<00:02:05.480> in

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
so glass rod is really fun to use in

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:13.330 
so glass rod is really fun to use in
fusing<00:02:10.000> they<00:02:11.000> do<00:02:11.150> good
