00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.950
 Welcome to the new tutorial of 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.820
 crafts for all today we are going to 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.820
 make a funny little key 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.820
 and 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.200
 Y 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:25.220
 materials that we are going to need 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:29.170
 Felt felt pen or lenzi cloth ribbon 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:33.550
 double-sided adhesive and you account 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:36.560
 ring for key ring and scissors 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.590
 crafts for all 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.780
 let's start we 'll take the ribbon 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.340
 double- sided adhesive and we're going to paste it 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.400
 or adhere on the espanyol itself 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.770
 we have it well trimmed 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.440
 and we are going to cut the piece of cloth 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:57.670
 lenzi covered by the adhesive tape of 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.400
 double sided of this piece we are going to cut 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.450
 a little triangle as if it were the 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.450
 muÃ±equita frock 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.180
 pretty much like this then we're going to 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.420
 take it with mold and cut out another 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.420
 same 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.280
 once this is done we are going to cut back a 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.160
 piece of thread that reaches us for 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.210
 form the part that holds the head 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.210
 and then the little legs 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.620
 this according to the preferred length 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:49.120
 let's thread the thread through the 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.900
 value of wood we make a knot to 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.900
 stop mode 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.980
 because it will then also serve for and 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.960
 we can go through the ring once 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.680
 done this we are going to take out the piece of paper that 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.680
 covers the glue 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.050
 although you can also stick with 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.739
 a glue for fabrics or white glue 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.739
 normal 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.690
 we say it to the little triangle and then 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.740
 we remember another piece of the same thread 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.740
 to form hands 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.440
 one of the ends we are going to knot 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.440
 also in the form of a stop 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.450
 we are going to thread the two accounts by two 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:50.970
 wooden values 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:53.580
 in this case orange and then 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.260
 that we spent the second we're going to measure the 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.260
 long we want for the little hands 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.799
 once we have the long we make a 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.799
 knot 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.440
 and cut the leftovers 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.670
 we are going to place the little arm right in the 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:20.160
 half we press a little so that it 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.320
 adhere and taking out the paper that covers 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.960
 the glue on the other piece of 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.410
 Spanish itself 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.760
 we are not going to stick one on top of the other 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.270
 closing in this way the little arms of 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.370
 the little legs inside the little dress 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.580
 now we are going to place some beads 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.520
 also on the legs or on the feet 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.690
 we tie a knot at the end of it 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.690
 way with both legs 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.540
 then we can add any 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.480
 ornament in this case we have a kind 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:03.280
 of heart-shaped clips of those that 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.910
 they open in two we close them and we 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.910
 it would be like that 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.110
 we would simply paint the 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.140
 little face we make him some eyes and a 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:19.780
 smile we put it inside hoops 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:23.530
 of the keychain we can get to decorate 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:28.270
 a little bit the dress and so we 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.930
 would be finished our merited if 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.700
 I liked you
