00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
last pretty good long time actually all

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.860 
last pretty good long time actually all
things<00:02:29.830> considered<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:31.360> might<00:02:31.510> think<00:02:31.750> that's

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
things considered you might think that's

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.760 
things considered you might think that's
quite<00:02:32.050> loose<00:02:32.320> now

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
quite loose now

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.840 
quite loose now
but<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.040> does<00:02:33.220> come<00:02:33.520> with<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.760> clamp<00:02:35.820> so<00:02:36.820> that

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
but it does come with a clamp so that

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.930 
but it does come with a clamp so that
you<00:02:37.540> can<00:02:37.720> clamp<00:02:37.989> it<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.320> table<00:02:38.880> it's<00:02:39.880> just

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
you can clamp it to the table it's just

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:47.030 
you can clamp it to the table it's just
this<00:02:40.360> kind<00:02:40.600> of<00:02:40.690> pot<00:02:41.380> here<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.690> table<00:02:44.110> and

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.680 

clamp<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.190> down<00:02:48.220> there<00:02:48.580> as<00:02:48.910> looks<00:02:49.360> like<00:02:49.570> it

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
clamp it down there as looks like it

00:02:49.690 --> 00:03:01.060 
clamp it down there as looks like it
kind<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:49.989> hooks<00:02:50.950> on<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.720> show<00:02:52.720> you

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.510 

and<00:03:02.070> screw<00:03:02.640> it<00:03:02.700> on<00:03:02.790> pretty<00:03:03.660> simple<00:03:04.020> really<00:03:04.170> and

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
and screw it on pretty simple really and

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:12.770 
and screw it on pretty simple really and
then<00:03:05.520> is<00:03:06.620> stuck<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:07.800> table<00:03:08.190> so<00:03:11.780> very

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
then is stuck to the table so very

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.130 
then is stuck to the table so very
stable<00:03:13.100> and<00:03:14.100> it<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.910> very<00:03:15.120> good<00:03:15.270> quality<00:03:15.390> you

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
stable and it is very good quality you

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.480 
stable and it is very good quality you
can<00:03:16.290> tell<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.650> know<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.860> build<00:03:17.040> quality<00:03:17.250> it

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
can tell you know the build quality it

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.910 
can tell you know the build quality it
feels<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:18.030> lot<00:03:18.510> lot<00:03:18.930> heavier<00:03:19.260> than<00:03:19.410> love<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:19.830> the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
feels a lot lot heavier than love of the

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.520 
feels a lot lot heavier than love of the
wheels<00:03:20.100> that<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.310> can<00:03:20.370> get<00:03:20.610> these<00:03:20.730> days<00:03:20.940> I

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
wheels that you can get these days I

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.450 
wheels that you can get these days I
shall<00:03:22.530> move<00:03:22.710> this<00:03:22.830> out<00:03:23.010> of<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.160> way<00:03:25.160> so<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:26.370> is

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
shall move this out of the way so it is

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.120 
shall move this out of the way so it is
completely<00:03:26.850> wireless<00:03:27.120> so<00:03:27.800> nice<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:28.980> main

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
completely wireless so nice the main

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.660 
completely wireless so nice the main
benefit<00:03:29.490> of<00:03:29.520> this<00:03:29.700> thing<00:03:29.940> will<00:03:30.150> above<00:03:30.630> others

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
benefit of this thing will above others

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.910 
benefit of this thing will above others
the<00:03:32.670> pedals<00:03:33.090> comes<00:03:34.080> in<00:03:34.200> two<00:03:34.350> parts<00:03:36.590> this<00:03:37.590> kind

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
the pedals comes in two parts this kind

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.220 
the pedals comes in two parts this kind
of<00:03:37.980> bit<00:03:38.130> kind<00:03:38.340> of<00:03:38.430> comes<00:03:38.910> up<00:03:39.060> here<00:03:39.240> and<00:03:39.450> it

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
of bit kind of comes up here and it

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.050 
of bit kind of comes up here and it
detaches<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:41.160> if<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.400> don't<00:03:41.550> need<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.820> scrap

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
detaches so if you don't need to scrap

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.520 
detaches so if you don't need to scrap
this<00:03:42.270> part<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.720> don't<00:03:42.840> have<00:03:43.020> to<00:03:43.110> have<00:03:43.200> it<00:03:43.350> but

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
this part you don't have to have it but

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.930 
this part you don't have to have it but
most<00:03:44.190> people<00:03:44.490> have<00:03:44.610> it

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
most people have it

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.040 
most people have it
pedals<00:03:45.630> themselves<00:03:47.330> it's<00:03:48.330> pretty<00:03:48.600> standard

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
pedals themselves it's pretty standard

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.140 
pedals themselves it's pretty standard
really<00:03:49.200> you<00:03:49.890> got<00:03:50.040> analog<00:03:50.400> pressure<00:03:50.700> sensitive

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
really you got analog pressure sensitive

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.180 
really you got analog pressure sensitive
controls<00:03:51.770> so<00:03:54.110> you<00:03:55.110> can<00:03:55.290> control<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.650> throttle

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
controls so you can control the throttle

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.950 
controls so you can control the throttle
and<00:03:56.490> braking<00:03:56.970> like<00:03:57.150> I<00:03:57.270> think<00:03:57.450> it<00:03:57.570> comes<00:03:57.720> with<00:03:57.900> a

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
and braking like I think it comes with a

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.190 
and braking like I think it comes with a
cable<00:03:58.140> just<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.830> connect<00:03:59.100> up<00:03:59.280> to<00:04:00.200> the

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
cable just to connect up to the

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.400 
cable just to connect up to the
controller<00:04:01.590> but<00:04:02.570> yeah<00:04:03.570> they<00:04:03.810> do<00:04:03.930> feel<00:04:04.170> pretty

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
controller but yeah they do feel pretty

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.610 
controller but yeah they do feel pretty
solid

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
solid

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.260 
solid

do overall nothing you wouldn't expect
from<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:16.170> steering<00:04:16.380> wheel<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:17.730> main<00:04:17.910> benefit

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
from the steering wheel the main benefit

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.510 
from the steering wheel the main benefit
is<00:04:18.359> that<00:04:18.810> is<00:04:19.260> completely<00:04:19.680> wireless<00:04:19.920> does<00:04:20.370> have

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
is that is completely wireless does have

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.430 
is that is completely wireless does have
a<00:04:20.549> few<00:04:20.730> nice<00:04:20.880> features<00:04:20.910> but<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:22.109> overall

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
a few nice features but the overall

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.280 
a few nice features but the overall
build<00:04:22.680> quality<00:04:22.740> is<00:04:23.100> very<00:04:23.250> high<00:04:23.690> so<00:04:24.690> it's<00:04:25.080> great

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
build quality is very high so it's great

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.960 
build quality is very high so it's great
great<00:04:25.530> steering<00:04:25.740> wheel<00:04:25.980> for<00:04:26.250> anyone<00:04:26.820> with

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
great steering wheel for anyone with

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.640 
great steering wheel for anyone with
Xbox<00:04:27.300> 360<00:04:27.780> owners<00:04:27.810> as<00:04:28.170> there<00:04:28.380> aren't<00:04:28.530> many

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
Xbox 360 owners as there aren't many
