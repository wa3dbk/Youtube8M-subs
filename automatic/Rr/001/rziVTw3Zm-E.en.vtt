00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.270
 Here is a very good visual is 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.490
 exercise that will help develop these 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.590
 fingers and not just develop develop 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.479
 their movements at the reception pour elle 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.250
 so let's get started we will hold 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.069
 index finger on the fifth fret all 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.299
 strings 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:01.319
 then the second finger, we pinch the second 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.119
 string to the sixth that is present 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.990
 take the fourth finger on the fourth 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.489
 seventh fret 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.500
 Here such a competition will be the first impulse 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.260
 then finger all stand it pinches 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.349
 this year, next second pinch 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.810
 the second in the sixth year and the fourth 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.150
 string we pinch the third finger on 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.840
 The seventh chapter is such a court with us 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.269
 turned out 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.010
 if you call then it will be dm7 we 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.440
 squeezed when the cont and now we need 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.890
 play downward movement can then be 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.890
 fingers 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.140
 the next move we will need 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.450
 play up with your thumb but here 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.580
 we will need a second finger to lift something 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.580
 there are previous all fingers and we 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.710
 leave except 2 we are raising with us 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.720
 It turns out Kazan holds all the string 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.510
 the third finger holds the fourth string 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.880
 fortitude and windows on on this chord we 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:04.000
 do 2 to 2 that their thumb is not 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.250
 so repeat 1 move we played it 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.510

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.600

 we raise the second finger everything else 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.120
 leave thumb up now 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.459
 you need to plant 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.400
 critical quirks we put second 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.319
 finger on the second place which is 6 but 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.300

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:36.020
