00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:31.110

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.200

 Peter and more here for the holy ones 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.570
 that means that we have water directly 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.159
 get in front of the houses and that is 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.619
 then of course uncomfortable 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.769
 now there are 100 people on the island 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.140
 how do you protect the houses? 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.030

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.459
 waiting 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.410

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.910
 it goes on the island a single 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.350
 paramedic what happens if you 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.799
 Something on your head 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.360

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.900

 was scary high that is the people 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.030
 will be up in the next 36 to 48 hours 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.790
 even the worst is theirs 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.400

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.500
 afternoon, thank you mister

 hebestreit and also on the reverberant 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.819
 crown a happy good luck we have 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.310
 times the impact of extreme stages in the 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.690
 wind tunnel tested 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.040
 over a month ago, storm christian 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.120
 Germany strong 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.790
 shaken up 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.290
 xaver should be even stronger at the 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.349
 coast winds are up 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.910
 160 kilometers per hour awaits trees 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.220
 bend over like matches 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.580
 we tested in the wind tunnel like yourself 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.500
 Such a storm feels 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.420
 starting with a wild wind of us 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.370
 on the fall around the ears flies 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.860
 50 kilometer per hour give fat 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.930
 Schirmer still protection at about 90 km h 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.200
 make my 85 kilos in the wind tunnel 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.240
 just enough resistance 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.580
 Well, there is no way back now 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.170
 it does but I do not want to and because of it 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.090
 now really dangerous puts Mr. 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.440
 Professor Hufnagel of the university 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.440
 darmstadt thick route 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.980
 without the good the 130 would have me 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.270
 kilometer per hour clear swept away 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.740
 otherwise we can only use this as 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.370
 strong gusts but also can 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.710
 hew down 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.750
 but we are not yet at the end it comes 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.590
 it's 560 and that's really it 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.600
 already typhoon alarm or hurricane alarm 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.390
 you can look like me on the 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.370
 hawerkamp is already because of body tension 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.320
 Everything here is enough for my sport training 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.890
 no more i feel like one 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.890
 flag in the wind 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.820
 so stay at home better 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.799
 not to risk serious injuries 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.019
 keep yourself especially from trees 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.549
 far away and do not secure anything 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.549
 riveted and nailed
