00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
at the sebring APC 480 I'm going to open

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.210 
at the sebring APC 480 I'm going to open
up<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:17.780> panel<00:00:18.780> here<00:00:19.050> there's<00:00:19.440> a<00:00:19.560> floor<00:00:19.800> sub<00:00:20.040> 2

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
up this panel here there's a floor sub 2

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.100 
up this panel here there's a floor sub 2
there<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:22.279> some<00:00:23.420> mechanism<00:00:24.420> parts

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
there and some mechanism parts

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.340 
there and some mechanism parts
so<00:00:25.920> there's<00:00:26.400> latches<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.570> either<00:00:27.630> side<00:00:28.110> right

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 
so there's latches on either side right

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.320 
so there's latches on either side right
here

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
here

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.369 
here
you<00:00:30.330> flip<00:00:30.690> this<00:00:30.870> up<00:00:31.700> I<00:00:32.700> have<00:00:33.120> one<00:00:33.600> open<00:00:33.960> or<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.140> so

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
you flip this up I have one open or a so

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:37.369 
you flip this up I have one open or a so
just<00:00:34.590> flipped<00:00:34.830> open<00:00:35.390> so<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.690> side<00:00:36.900> replaced

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
just flipped open so the side replaced

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.479 
just flipped open so the side replaced
the<00:00:37.850> fluorescent<00:00:38.850> tube<00:00:39.350> and<00:00:40.350> somebody<00:00:41.010> wanted

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
the fluorescent tube and somebody wanted

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:57.490 
the fluorescent tube and somebody wanted
a<00:00:41.760> video<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.900> the<00:00:43.170> coin<00:00:44.160> mechanism<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:45.030> here

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.930 

yeah<00:00:58.500> just<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.070> make<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.370> Orange

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
yeah just to make it Orange

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.010 
yeah just to make it Orange
you<00:01:00.540> can<00:01:00.719> change<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.200> color<00:01:01.469> or<00:01:01.649> whatever<00:01:03.020> so

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
you can change that color or whatever so

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:12.730 
you can change that color or whatever so
here's<00:01:04.440> the<00:01:05.119> coin<00:01:06.119> mechanism

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.370 

I'll<00:01:13.740> get<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> shot<00:01:14.310> from<00:01:14.549> inside<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:19.200> looks

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
I'll get a shot from inside the looks

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.910 
I'll get a shot from inside the looks
block<00:01:19.680> bonus<00:01:21.350> package<00:01:22.350> here<00:01:24.560> clings<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.770> on

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
block bonus package here clings it on

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:41.300 
block bonus package here clings it on
the<00:01:26.070> shoot<00:01:29.180> table<00:01:38.869> looks<00:01:40.009> and<00:01:41.009> we're<00:01:41.190> missing

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the shoot table looks and we're missing

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:50.380 
the shoot table looks and we're missing
the<00:01:41.610> coin<00:01:41.820> box<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:43.560> that's<00:01:43.950> all<00:01:44.159> we<00:01:44.310> have

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.030 

lubricant<00:01:51.390> we're<00:01:51.600> using<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.409> lube<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
lubricant we're using to lube the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.850 
lubricant we're using to lube the
mechanism<00:01:53.759> all<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.840> metal<00:01:55.110> parts<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:55.710> a

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
mechanism all the metal parts it's a

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.940 
mechanism all the metal parts it's a
lunar<00:01:56.189> plate<00:01:56.580> I<00:01:57.080> think<00:01:58.080> this<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.350> what<00:01:58.530> Seberg

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
lunar plate I think this is what Seberg

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.219 
lunar plate I think this is what Seberg
originally<00:01:59.869> said<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.080> use<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> mechanism

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
originally said to use on the mechanism

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.960 
originally said to use on the mechanism

there's<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.780> random<00:02:10.259> miser<00:02:11.220> thing<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:12.569> what<00:02:12.930> it

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
there's a random miser thing and what it

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.809 
there's a random miser thing and what it
would<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.380> would<00:02:13.440> have<00:02:13.620> little<00:02:13.830> photos<00:02:14.459> in

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
would it would have little photos in

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.040 
would it would have little photos in
these<00:02:15.060> in<00:02:15.360> this<00:02:15.450> window<00:02:15.840> here<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:17.480> albums<00:02:18.480> and

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
these in this window here of albums and

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.010 
these in this window here of albums and
there<00:02:20.010> would<00:02:20.100> be<00:02:20.130> lights<00:02:20.430> behind<00:02:20.670> them<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:21.239> as

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
there would be lights behind them so as

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.250 
there would be lights behind them so as
you're<00:02:22.260> selecting<00:02:22.680> your<00:02:23.550> records<00:02:24.170> one<00:02:25.170> of

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
you're selecting your records one of

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.570 
you're selecting your records one of
those<00:02:25.380> would<00:02:25.530> light<00:02:25.769> up<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.130> then<00:02:26.250> for

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
those would light up and then for

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.040 
those would light up and then for
another<00:02:26.730> quarter<00:02:27.360> or<00:02:27.540> something<00:02:27.709> you<00:02:28.709> could

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
another quarter or something you could

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.020 
another quarter or something you could
select<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.590> you're<00:02:31.769> getting<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.790> full

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
select and you're getting that full

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.809 
select and you're getting that full
album<00:02:33.450> which<00:02:33.720> would<00:02:33.900> be<00:02:34.160> album<00:02:35.160> side<00:02:35.400> probably

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
album which would be album side probably

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.970 
album which would be album side probably
which<00:02:36.269> would<00:02:36.420> be<00:02:36.510> three<00:02:36.780> songs<00:02:37.050> on<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.410> side<00:02:37.680> of

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
which would be three songs on a side of

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.120 
which would be three songs on a side of
a<00:02:38.780> 7-inch<00:02:39.780> 33<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.500> our<00:02:40.620> p3<00:02:41.220> 33<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.269> 1/3<00:02:42.330> rpm

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
a 7-inch 33 and our p3 33 and 1/3 rpm

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.059 
a 7-inch 33 and our p3 33 and 1/3 rpm
record<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.269> open<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:45.870> panel<00:02:46.500> up<00:02:46.680> there's

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
record so to open that panel up there's

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.900 
record so to open that panel up there's
a<00:02:47.130> little<00:02:47.400> lever<00:02:47.549> inside<00:02:48.319> right<00:02:49.319> here<00:02:49.910> and

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
a little lever inside right here and

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.680 
a little lever inside right here and
then<00:02:51.090> another<00:02:51.600> person<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:53.480> lift<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.750> up<00:02:55.019> and

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
then another person to lift that up and

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:04.610 
then another person to lift that up and
you'll<00:02:57.690> see<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:03.090> they<00:03:03.450> apparently<00:03:04.200> stopped

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
you'll see and they apparently stopped

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.349 
you'll see and they apparently stopped
using<00:03:04.890> that<00:03:05.070> feature<00:03:05.370> because<00:03:05.820> they<00:03:06.000> took<00:03:06.180> all

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
using that feature because they took all

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:11.110 
using that feature because they took all
the<00:03:06.480> light<00:03:06.510> bulbs<00:03:07.019> out<00:03:09.140> but<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.230> can<00:03:10.380> see<00:03:10.620> here

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
the light bulbs out but you can see here

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.150 
the light bulbs out but you can see here
these<00:03:12.120> are<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.329> sub<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:12.930> are<00:03:13.109> the<00:03:13.290> little

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
these are the sub you are the little

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.610 
these are the sub you are the little
miniature<00:03:14.340> albums<00:03:14.910> would<00:03:15.120> sit<00:03:15.390> for<00:03:15.600> those<00:03:16.410> of

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
miniature albums would sit for those of

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.730 
miniature albums would sit for those of
them

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:31.430 

no<00:03:21.400> label<00:03:22.150> except<00:03:22.510> for<00:03:22.630> this<00:03:22.750> one

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.220 

and<00:03:32.440> it<00:03:32.560> looks<00:03:32.710> like<00:03:32.800> they<00:03:33.100> put<00:03:33.310> on<00:03:33.550> some<00:03:34.230> black

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
and it looks like they put on some black

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.930 
and it looks like they put on some black
vinyl<00:03:35.530> just<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.730> cover<00:03:36.940> that<00:03:37.240> picture<00:03:37.990> up<00:03:38.940> just

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
vinyl just to cover that picture up just

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.890 
vinyl just to cover that picture up just
kind<00:03:40.120> of<00:03:40.240> flicking<00:03:40.570> off<00:03:40.810> though<00:03:42.690> it's<00:03:43.690> for

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
kind of flicking off though it's for

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.460 
kind of flicking off though it's for
double-oh-seven<00:03:44.500> bumpy<00:03:45.100> also<00:03:46.170> you<00:03:47.170> wanted<00:03:47.410> to

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
double-oh-seven bumpy also you wanted to

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.950
