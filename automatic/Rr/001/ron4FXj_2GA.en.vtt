00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.859
 published end 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.509
 2012 so first of all I wanted 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:59.780
 start what the world is a hobby like i said 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:02:04.149
 publishes the game here it is outdated before the main 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.149
 which cost companies please 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:13.489
 removed the rules of the game rules of the game 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.959
 consist of 35 pages 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:21.140
 15 these are just the rules of the game themselves. 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.670
 play and then sleeps on page 23 nec 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.260
 is votes 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.239
 i.e. a list of terms that 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.910
 used in the game as cards 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.370
 full of all sorts of characteristics 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.200
 specific terms and features 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.829
 you can see them at any time 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.019
 confusing class and move on to us 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.790
 meets learning comics by viewing 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.220
 which you may also want to start 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.299
 play learn something originally 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:52.700
 the average is so in the game comes two 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:03:00.859
 golf for me and so convenient 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:06.709
 laid out for further in the game go 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:08.769
 chips and dice chips they gave them 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.769
 to me 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:19.069
 public was one packet 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:21.629
 proper hexagons themselves into cubes 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.610
 further in the game is six coloud 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.720
 each deck belongs to some 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.580
 wicker poems 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.400
 that is, again by this principle 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.920
 come you and your friend sit down 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.830
 each one collects a cult of one deck and 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.340
 you start to fight for which there is 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.760
 everything is convenient practical game interesting 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.959
 I 'll tell you a little about the elements in the game 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:50.370
 their 6 is the ruling force of fire 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:55.290
 that's the power of fire 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:58.010
 this design on pervosti 2 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.010
 I am the forces of darkness 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:24.150
 the third is forests or dry every 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:27.080
 icon 4 element swamp fifth element it 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.080
 the mountains 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.070
 and 6 elements of this stalk 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:42.190
 it's also worth saying that besides the call part 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.250
 the 7 pack that includes everything 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.860
 6:31 deck card is a city michael 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.200
 Includes 20 mk and I have cards 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.610
 that you can mix other genera than 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:59.470
 few change the Thai balance itself 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:01.930
 tee present want to notice something 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.150
 there is like a man to meet 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.800
 for example with a peach he takes buys 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.250
 this set starts at home calmly 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.280
 play with friends with friends 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.380
 relatives and join later 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.320
 then he can buy cards 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.150
 booster buy or have a duel set 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.220
 participate all this collectible 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.700
 activities and may just stop 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.800
 on such a single set that play with 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.050
 friends then there is more likely percy 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.410
 acts not as a collectible card 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.290
 a game 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.660
 but as a live card that is because 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.390
 direction as you bought one set for you 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.150
 basis then these how any 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.490
 add-ons buy way additions to 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.530
 he is active being issued that is it 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.290
 set which also has two more 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.450
 the deck you bought the planet on watch for 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.610
 callas 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:54.070
 type of creatures or he mine also to 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.580
 slow combine and again 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:00.040
 the migration cost of the set is small it is 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:04.540
 somewhere around 40 dollar as far as 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:07.390
 I remember at the moment the window is already out 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:10.750
 moment of 2014 there is a second edition 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:15.280
 This set so he went out to 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:17.680
 bored with you but new edition came out 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.660
 nothing has changed except there were 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.730
 small changes start passed 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:25.419
 there were typos in the cards but not large and 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:26.530
 did not affect the game itself on and and were 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:29.440
 replaced 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.389
 a little bit of the rules of the game were changed and there 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.550
 new cubes 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:35.950
 Well, actually leave the field of freedom 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.470
 slightly different if here about 900 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:41.350
 please put them in and on soft 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.300
 on the couch would be convenient for you to play too 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.850
 about a new building i'm a little bit go by 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.570
 late two halves connect and field 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:52.390
 in fact it is not comfortable she 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:55.390
 arches slightly on not very comfortable 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:58.900
 but the cost of 2 costs the same to me 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:01.030
 like some kind of not buying 1 or 2 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:04.090
 saw the first night buy 1 will be 2 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:06.340
 guests buy 2 building is all he wanted 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:09.270
 would tell you buy a berserk 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.830
 play the partake of the wonderful 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.400
 collecting cards and get 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.400
 pleasure
