00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.859
 new review instruction technique and 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.529
 lifestyle channel 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.769
 This is the second video to cook 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.670
 want waterfree fusion from kuka today 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.340
 we give you some practical 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.509
 application examples show what you can do 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.509
 do with the broker 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.090
 in our first videos on youtube 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.570
 we have shown you how he 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.239
 does the benefits explained to you 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.650
 I have shown up to the technology and 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.949
 Today we want you practical 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.780
 Application examples show what we mean by that 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.790
 and above all how fast 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.830
 This is usually when you go to 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.330
 For example, I wanted to cook a tea 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.150
 you probably a kettle 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.610
 heats the water that lasts 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.760
 some time much longer 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.190
 with the fusion of their turns koka 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.140
 just open the faucet and leave that alone 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.000
 bubble boiling hot water and 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.000
 all that was needed was to let the tea go 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.290
 Of course , koka future not only offered 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.690
 around your hot water for coffee or tea 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.610
 to be taken but also it to 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.430
 cooking is very helpful because you 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.700
 saves a lot of time we have time tomorrow 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.290
 tried the sundays so to speak 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.880
 just a liter of hot water there 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.790
 and a boiling water pure 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.740
 and you gave me a cooking time they 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.780
 should the water boils properly sprudel 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.340
 More hope was here of two minutes 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:59.619
 Of course the living and the stove plate 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:02:01.750
 the first time the temperature is 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.220
 Examples of the customers are currently holding 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.770
 Of course not the only thing he's with 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.420
 you can do the fusion of poker 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.429
 I'm sure you know best why 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.709
 Everywhere the water needs and 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.380
 You have that much faster now 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.930
 available, for example, to the 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.340
 example tomatoes skin that goes completely 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.910
 Simply by now the faucet 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.680
 turn up and then cook the hot 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.880
 did have hot water on doing 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.620
 without chemicals that infect everything 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.600
 possible could do with it 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.510
 for example wax of candlesticks 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.000
 rinse with boiling water 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.400
 we can do that much faster now 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.549
 have video in a small timelapse 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.930
 prepared for you how fast 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.150
 or the differences are 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.879
 to heat behind with a water 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.150
 kettle and on a conventional 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.769
 stove plate and that is of course everything 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.930
 are scientific but the 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.209
 differences are already enormous and up 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.670
 In any case, you have that hot boiling 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.159
 hot water with the fusion of course 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.480
 immediately in contrast to the several 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.260
 minutes with the others 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.260
 equipment takes 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.680
 We advise you have this to this point 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.720
 Of course , these were only pleasures 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.459
 small examples first maybe 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.510
 Do you have any more ideas what you 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.459
 can do everything 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.860
 which of course we will become for you 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:27.240
 try it out in a third video like that 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:31.990
 to say where we once again give a conclusion 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:36.310
 new churches of krokus scalded 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.810
 200 will be around for some players 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.910
 there's another video 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.070
 if your more information about 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.930
 You need fusion then you can 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.430
 Of course, our first video about 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.960
 explain the whole technique a bit and 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:52.210
 why think so great 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.000
 you can look at that there 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.700
 take a look at our blog he will 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.229
 therefore still all left in it to the 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.030
 product even where he and the 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.460
 different versions can see from 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.790
 the angular version to the semicircular 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.979
 version to the different water 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.900
 back down then in the games are 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.990
 Many have shown in the first video 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.880
 we hope you have all the information 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.660
 cook her now on this topic 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.479
 water tap 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.590
 we hope you enjoyed it here 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.539
 should have said under already if you 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.960
 Questions have asked us in the questions 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:28.330
 comments here or in our blog 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.280
 They like to say what's up 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.280
 in the next video and we kick
