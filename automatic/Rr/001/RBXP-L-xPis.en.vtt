since I was a kid and at some point in
my<00:00:26.490> childhood<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.210> attempted<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.840> do<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.130> paint

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
see I guess I wasn't very good I was

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.100

never<00:00:35.670> very<00:00:35.790> good<00:00:36.059> at<00:00:36.239> models<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:36.960> was<00:00:37.079> a

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
never very good at models and I was a

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.229 
never very good at models and I was a
kid<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.829> kind<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.160> do<00:00:38.250> an<00:00:38.370> okay<00:00:38.700> job<00:00:38.730> if<00:00:39.149> I

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
kid I can kind of do an okay job if I

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.810 
kid I can kind of do an okay job if I
take<00:00:39.450> my<00:00:39.600> die<00:00:39.660> now<00:00:40.050> but<00:00:40.379> by<00:00:41.190> no<00:00:41.250> means<00:00:41.399> an

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
take my die now but by no means an

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.799 
take my die now but by no means an
expert<00:00:42.239> but<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.050> think<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.469> time<00:00:43.620> has<00:00:43.680> come<00:00:43.890> to

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
expert but I think the time has come to

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.970 
expert but I think the time has come to
try<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.989> do<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.320> thing<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> little<00:00:46.800> more

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
try and do this thing a little more

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.190 
try and do this thing a little more
proud<00:00:47.430> than<00:00:47.460> what<00:00:47.850> she<00:00:48.000> currently<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.050> I'm

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
proud than what she currently is so I'm

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.170 
proud than what she currently is so I'm
just<00:00:49.260> capturing<00:00:49.950> some<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> before<00:00:50.789> here

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
just capturing some of the before here

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.010 
just capturing some of the before here
and<00:00:51.719> as<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.620> see<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.660> windows<00:00:54.660> are<00:00:54.899> no

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
and as we can see the windows are no

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.430 
and as we can see the windows are no
longer<00:00:55.440> quite<00:00:55.710> clear<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:57.329> front<00:00:57.870> bumper<00:00:58.410> is

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
longer quite clear the front bumper is

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.889 
longer quite clear the front bumper is
missing<00:00:59.420> mostly<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:03.180> back<00:01:03.390> wheels<00:01:03.690> were

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
missing mostly and the back wheels were

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.990 
missing mostly and the back wheels were
crooked<00:01:04.199> I've<00:01:04.470> finally<00:01:05.159> got<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.580> one<00:01:05.790> wheel

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
crooked I've finally got the one wheel

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.530 
crooked I've finally got the one wheel
off<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.689> was<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.200> having<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.159> baby<00:01:08.369> when<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.390> was

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
off it was like having a baby when I was

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.380 
off it was like having a baby when I was
able<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.869> pry<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.290> off<00:01:10.500> with<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> axle<00:01:11.390> just

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
able to pry it off with the axle just

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.719 
able to pry it off with the axle just
slides<00:01:12.869> out<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.340> body<00:01:14.960> there<00:01:15.960> are<00:01:15.990> some

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
slides out of the body there are some

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.600 
slides out of the body there are some
plastic<00:01:17.729> clips<00:01:18.500> to<00:01:19.500> hold<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.890> axle<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.580> place

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
plastic clips to hold the axle in place

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.480 
plastic clips to hold the axle in place
which<00:01:21.119> are<00:01:21.299> broken<00:01:21.720> off<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.290> side<00:01:22.560> I'm

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
which are broken off on this side I'm

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.810 
which are broken off on this side I'm
not<00:01:23.759> sure<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.360> recent<00:01:24.990> brakes<00:01:25.820> or

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
not sure if that's recent brakes or

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.690 
not sure if that's recent brakes or
ancient<00:01:27.420> brakes<00:01:27.960> probably<00:01:28.740> ancient<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.490> would

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
ancient brakes probably ancient I would

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.480 
ancient brakes probably ancient I would
guess<00:01:29.939> because<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:31.020> plastic<00:01:31.530> seems<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.340> be<00:01:32.460> a

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
guess because the plastic seems to be a

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.429 
guess because the plastic seems to be a
little<00:01:32.729> bit<00:01:32.970> worn<00:01:33.299> there<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.049> couldn't

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
little bit worn there but I couldn't

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.560 
little bit worn there but I couldn't
guarantee<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:37.729> they're<00:01:38.729> mostly<00:01:39.119> there<00:01:39.420> in

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
guarantee it and they're mostly there in

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.149 
guarantee it and they're mostly there in
the<00:01:39.689> front<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.170> think<00:01:40.380> I'm<00:01:40.500> missing<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.920> little

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
the front I think I'm missing a little

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.609 
the front I think I'm missing a little
bit<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> one<00:01:41.820> side<00:01:42.119> here<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.720> don't<00:01:43.290> think

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
bit on the one side here I don't think

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.170 
bit on the one side here I don't think
that's<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.979> big<00:01:44.220> deal<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.729> not<00:01:44.939> going<00:01:45.119> to

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
that's a big deal it's not going to

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.090 
that's a big deal it's not going to
affect<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.630> playability<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.680> toy<00:01:46.829> or

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
affect the playability of the toy or

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.929 
affect the playability of the toy or
anything<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:49.369> just<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.490> take<00:01:50.700> note

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
anything like that and just to take note

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:51.760 
anything like that and just to take note
of<00:01:50.970> things

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
of things

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.730 
of things
I'd<00:01:52.220> already<00:01:52.430> actually<00:01:52.820> had<00:01:53.240> these<00:01:53.450> little

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
I'd already actually had these little

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.800 
I'd already actually had these little
trying<00:01:54.740> Clips<00:01:55.220> opened<00:01:55.729> a<00:01:55.850> couple<00:01:56.180> of<00:01:56.270> times<00:01:56.510> or

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
trying Clips opened a couple of times or

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.200 
trying Clips opened a couple of times or
at<00:01:56.869> least<00:01:56.930> sometimes<00:01:57.500> so<00:01:57.799> hopefully<00:01:58.310> if<00:01:59.030> I<00:01:59.150> do

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
at least sometimes so hopefully if I do

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.910 
at least sometimes so hopefully if I do
it<00:01:59.450> again<00:01:59.570> it's<00:01:59.840> not<00:02:00.020> going<00:02:00.320> to<00:02:00.440> break<00:02:00.650> them

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
it again it's not going to break them

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.790 
it again it's not going to break them
that<00:02:01.310> would<00:02:01.460> be<00:02:01.490> a<00:02:01.610> pain<00:02:01.850> in<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.090> neck<00:02:02.680> so<00:02:03.680> if

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
that would be a pain in the neck so if

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.260 
that would be a pain in the neck so if
you're<00:02:03.920> ever<00:02:04.040> thinking<00:02:04.159> of<00:02:04.580> restoring<00:02:04.970> one<00:02:05.180> of

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
you're ever thinking of restoring one of

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.120 
you're ever thinking of restoring one of
these<00:02:05.420> make<00:02:06.020> sure<00:02:06.050> you<00:02:06.229> only<00:02:06.440> take<00:02:06.740> it<00:02:06.770> apart

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
these make sure you only take it apart

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.910 
these make sure you only take it apart
but<00:02:07.369> once<00:02:07.580> if<00:02:07.850> possible<00:02:08.390> metal<00:02:09.380> breaking

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
but once if possible metal breaking

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.590 
but once if possible metal breaking
after<00:02:10.069> it's<00:02:10.369> been<00:02:10.550> bent<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:10.940> same<00:02:11.150> way<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.360> few

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
after it's been bent the same way a few

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.820 
after it's been bent the same way a few
times<00:02:12.190> so<00:02:13.420> I'm<00:02:14.420> not<00:02:14.690> sure<00:02:14.750> what<00:02:15.170> color<00:02:15.410> I'll<00:02:15.620> go

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
times so I'm not sure what color I'll go

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.949 
times so I'm not sure what color I'll go
with<00:02:16.040> yet<00:02:16.280> I'll<00:02:16.430> probably<00:02:16.670> look<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.239> up<00:02:17.360> I'd

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
with yet I'll probably look it up I'd

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.720 
with yet I'll probably look it up I'd
like<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.319> do<00:02:18.440> some<00:02:18.680> kind<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.100> metallic<00:02:19.459> paint

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
like to do some kind of a metallic paint

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.110 
like to do some kind of a metallic paint
because<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.569> seems<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:21.080> be<00:02:21.110> 60s<00:02:21.950> 70s<00:02:22.430> type<00:02:22.910> of

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
because that seems to be 60s 70s type of

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.470 
because that seems to be 60s 70s type of
book<00:02:23.680> style<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:25.220> something<00:02:25.970> like<00:02:26.000> you'd<00:02:26.269> see

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
book style so something like you'd see

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.290 
book style so something like you'd see
on<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.690> old<00:02:26.810> circus<00:02:27.560> bumper<00:02:28.160> car<00:02:28.400> rides<00:02:28.910> type

on the old circus bumper car rides type

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.240 
on the old circus bumper car rides type
of<00:02:29.480> thing<00:02:29.660> maybe<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:30.260> sort<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.739> deal<00:02:30.980> I

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
of thing maybe that sort of a deal I

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.340 
of thing maybe that sort of a deal I
don't<00:02:31.850> know<00:02:31.970> if<00:02:32.060> I'd<00:02:32.150> go<00:02:32.180> with<00:02:32.570> I<00:02:32.989> think<00:02:33.260> you

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
don't know if I'd go with I think you

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.110 
don't know if I'd go with I think you
can<00:02:33.530> kind<00:02:33.800> of<00:02:33.890> see<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.220> original<00:02:34.760> green

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
can kind of see the original green

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.210 
can kind of see the original green
underneath<00:02:35.780> here<00:02:36.310> especially<00:02:37.630> these<00:02:38.630> parts

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
underneath here especially these parts

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.490 
underneath here especially these parts
here<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.610> here<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:41.890> was<00:02:42.890> kind<00:02:43.160> of<00:02:43.220> just<00:02:43.459> a

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
here and here that was kind of just a

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.800 
here and here that was kind of just a
shamrock<00:02:45.500> green<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:46.130> guess<00:02:46.370> or<00:02:46.850> st.<00:02:47.330> Patrick's

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
shamrock green I guess or st. Patrick's

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.479 
shamrock green I guess or st. Patrick's
Day<00:02:47.870> kind<00:02:48.290> of<00:02:48.410> green<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:48.860> there<00:02:48.980> was<00:02:49.070> a<00:02:49.100> flower

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
Day kind of green and there was a flower

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.360 
Day kind of green and there was a flower
on<00:02:49.819> it<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.090> think<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.890> at<00:02:51.890> least<00:02:52.040> there<00:02:52.280> was

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
on it I think and at least there was

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.340 
on it I think and at least there was
some<00:02:52.550> on<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.850> Volkswagens<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:53.959> was<00:02:54.140> seeing

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
some on the Volkswagens I was seeing

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.949 
some on the Volkswagens I was seeing
online<00:02:54.730> it's<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.790> bit<00:02:55.970> of<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.180> damage<00:02:56.600> to<00:02:56.810> this

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
online it's a bit of a damage to this

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.520 
online it's a bit of a damage to this
wheel<00:02:57.260> here<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:58.510> rim<00:02:59.510> so<00:02:59.900> I<00:02:59.989> don't<00:03:00.200> know<00:03:00.320> if<00:03:00.440> I

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
wheel here the rim so I don't know if I

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.680 
wheel here the rim so I don't know if I
can<00:03:00.709> work<00:03:00.890> around<00:03:01.100> that<00:03:01.549> or<00:03:01.730> not<00:03:01.910> possibly<00:03:02.600> I

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
can work around that or not possibly I

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.610 
can work around that or not possibly I
could<00:03:03.019> a<00:03:03.320> little<00:03:03.980> bit<00:03:04.220> of<00:03:04.340> fixing<00:03:04.730> up<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:05.060> that

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
could a little bit of fixing up to that

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.789 
could a little bit of fixing up to that
and<00:03:07.480> then<00:03:08.480> it'll<00:03:08.630> be<00:03:08.840> just<00:03:08.989> to<00:03:09.170> see<00:03:09.350> if<00:03:09.440> I<00:03:09.560> can

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
and then it'll be just to see if I can

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.220 
and then it'll be just to see if I can
clear<00:03:10.010> up<00:03:10.190> that<00:03:10.370> glass<00:03:10.610> some<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.360> maybe

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
clear up that glass some and maybe

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.860 
clear up that glass some and maybe
restore<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:12.950> white<00:03:13.160> of<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.489> inside<00:03:13.880> I'm<00:03:14.840> sure

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
restore the white of the inside I'm sure

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.229 
restore the white of the inside I'm sure
that<00:03:15.230> plastic<00:03:15.739> is<00:03:15.860> either<00:03:16.040> dirty<00:03:16.459> or<00:03:16.700> faded<00:03:17.120> as

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
that plastic is either dirty or faded as

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.650 
that plastic is either dirty or faded as
well<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:18.130> maybe<00:03:19.130> put<00:03:19.519> some<00:03:19.730> chrome<00:03:20.000> paint<00:03:20.299> on

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
well and maybe put some chrome paint on

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.190 
well and maybe put some chrome paint on
this<00:03:20.900> just<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:22.390> spruce<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.540> up<00:03:23.690> a<00:03:23.810> little<00:03:23.959> bit

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
this just to spruce it up a little bit

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.500 
this just to spruce it up a little bit
maybe<00:03:24.769> paint<00:03:25.190> some<00:03:25.430> trim<00:03:25.730> or<00:03:25.910> something<00:03:26.360> like

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
maybe paint some trim or something like

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.710 
maybe paint some trim or something like
that<00:03:26.750> do<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.799> belts<00:03:28.160> in<00:03:28.340> black

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.050 

back<00:03:31.350> bumper<00:03:31.860> seems<00:03:32.130> to<00:03:32.340> be<00:03:32.490> in<00:03:32.580> pretty<00:03:32.760> good

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
back bumper seems to be in pretty good

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.870 
back bumper seems to be in pretty good
shape<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:34.550> at<00:03:35.550> that<00:03:35.790> point<00:03:36.120> it'll<00:03:36.360> just<00:03:36.690> be<00:03:36.930> to

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
shape so at that point it'll just be to

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.080 
shape so at that point it'll just be to
strip<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.030> body<00:03:39.270> down<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:40.730> put<00:03:41.730> some<00:03:41.940> good

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
strip the body down and put some good

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.450 
strip the body down and put some good
paint<00:03:42.360> on<00:03:42.570> that<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:43.890> think<00:03:44.130> we'll<00:03:44.250> have<00:03:44.280> a

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
paint on that and I think we'll have a

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.310 
paint on that and I think we'll have a
pretty<00:03:44.760> fun<00:03:44.970> little<00:03:45.030> rebuild<00:03:45.600> I<00:03:45.900> don't<00:03:46.170> think

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
pretty fun little rebuild I don't think

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.140 
pretty fun little rebuild I don't think
it's<00:03:46.470> going<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.740> take<00:03:46.950> too<00:03:47.130> long<00:03:47.340> for<00:03:47.670> me<00:03:47.820> to<00:03:47.850> do

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
it's going to take too long for me to do

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.630 
it's going to take too long for me to do
it<00:03:48.360> just<00:03:49.170> be<00:03:49.320> a<00:03:49.350> matter<00:03:49.560> of<00:03:49.710> grabbing<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.280> can<00:03:50.490> of

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
it just be a matter of grabbing a can of

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.800 
it just be a matter of grabbing a can of
paint<00:03:50.820> at<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.120> store<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:53.300> we'll<00:03:54.300> see<00:03:54.540> how<00:03:54.660> it

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810
