00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello hello friends with you and in the idea of 21 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.290
 from today in one battle on the highway map I 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.150
 tell you about one interesting position 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.519
 playing on 155 fosha 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.590
 and this position it will be very good 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.050
 many, but for now I ’ll tell her food 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.699
 how did i decide to take her 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.800
 it is in this battle because it is 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.900
 the principle is quite important the fact is that 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.300
 the enemy team was not fast 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.340
 tanks and the worst scenario which 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.529
 in general, there are usually pictures for 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.719
 of our lower left ares because 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.059
 some quick lt possessing 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.290
 thought of kai can fly 5 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.760
 trajectories for example here here 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.980
 wrap go somewhere back in 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.379
 the city highlight all our movement and 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.570
 enemy fri-shki who can here 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.730
 here become a great place by the way all his 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.600
 I recommend and artillery can leave 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.020
 from us alone 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.489
 horns and legs from foch very quickly 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.590
 there are horns and legs because 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.930
 great hit with good damage in 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.379
 word or rooftops at 51 puts an end immediately 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.930
 same 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.390
 all about the movement of the skin that is my 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.250
 the task is what my luck is that i 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.830
 just counting on not one 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.750
 after all, not one barge will fly from here 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.790
 I will not see and therefore I try 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.890
 cuddle up to the right 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.049
 parts of this whole movement 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.880
 cross in here moving i'm expecting 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.290
 without receiving damage in the board I hope 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.470
 I won't see anyone because the team 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.150
 the opponent is pretty slow nobody here 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.600
 especially can not quickly appear to me in 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.570
 board vpendyur that I see in four 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.689
 tank battsat gets me in the harp without 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.729
 damage is just luck and I'm somehow 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.890
 miracle they are not going to eat this one 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.290
 position she surrender and works of course 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.150
 well you don't have time to get here but if 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.210
 you have slow tanks or setups 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.000
 the opponent is fast and smart then here already 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.280
 This position certainly does not drag but what here 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.070
 I drove let's say that she gives first 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.299
 steps for which I became like them 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.829
 protect my horns range finder left very 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.930
 it will be difficult to knock me all but 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.090
 rips at the enemy then if 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.000
 enemy artillery did not move to zero 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.829
 line then here we are not languages ​​too plus well 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.550
 and finally leave the first patient he 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.390
 not even me 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.100
 sees though i see him and die oh oh 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.350
 how scary the fact is that there is a whole 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.050
 a row of bushes worth trees and opponents 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.350
 it's hard to notice here as far as I am 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.580
 understood in now with disguise there is such 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.430
 the thing is that double bushes 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.320
 especially do not work when the enemy 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.070
 drove up close but while he is far they 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.530
 work and 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.840
 This distance that us about 200 can 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.890
 be 150 meters some video shorter 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.260
 saying some guys spent 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.550
 experiments topic short in my 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.890
 there is a chance 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.560
 unnoticed and stand and smash everything 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.020
 what will come on the zero line it does 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.140
 very good deal for our team 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.250
 The trick is that all our cords are 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.470
 here they stand 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.060
 shoot here with these and they have it 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.700
 it will turn out great if they are nobody 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.800
 not for or zboard over here 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.900
 I know how uncomfortable with two 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.240
 sides of you 1 1 3 you pour nothing 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.280
 you can make hide nowhere with us 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.410
 our lower left spawn the fate of such 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.010
 on the highway, in contrast to the opposite 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.590
 Well, that's recharged like grooves between on 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.290
 spot notices over the first holes already in 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.530
 bottom broneliste here's the second hole and he 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.510
 got scared from fear missed and died here 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.000
 This is the whole trick of my position, I see that 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.730
 there is no one else from the team 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.890
 the enemy did not glow only the lion and 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.390
 out of 7 but they don't seem to be here either 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.130
 recharging calmly slowly 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.510
 go off to give it the first 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.480
 not thrown but all 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.070
 I drive already further to fight that is like 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.020
 would be a trifle it's just there bastard 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.650
 groove and become this top principle yes dads 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.510
 . 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.730
 she could take us very seriously here 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.890
 attack if it were not for our sevens which 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.050
 rode out the board grabbed us then 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.300
 gone to zero at all and it's very big 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.630
 plus for our green team in this 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.530
 time on how to say on the field tanks 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.690
 rumbled 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.459
 they all passed already passing more precisely on 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.370
 seizure of the base we have everything that is rosy 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.290
 fight he know this not from the category I drag 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.269
 just from a good position and 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.900
 thanks so much so 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:14.330
 will say so in this fight a victory but you 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.060
 Of course lucky got here with. Me and 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:21.200
 don't hit with damage don't kill but 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.780
 alpha 850 shots fly 787 of course 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.430
 I still have one projectile on now 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.730
 I'm already dangerously close to 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.370
 artillery shell am 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.050
 try a little house to hide from a shot 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.300
 artillery disappear while all of 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.700
 light and trying somehow all the same 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.700
 ever hijack see i see pawn 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.130
 the enemy is alive and there is some other of the 8 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.140
 hanging out here i'm going to him exactly to fall 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.690
 I see that I will not file because they are for 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:51.710
 by this elevator or 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:54.050
 what is there for the building but to the right is from 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.630
 families have one shell and by my by the way 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.700
 Speaking the rules in my rather experienced 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.680
 observation is not necessary 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.780
 recharge cats after everyone there 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.340
 single shot i reload only 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.880
 then who completely released all three 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.470
 because that 's what could happen in 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.350
 the very beginning of the battle something happens in 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.870
 late well I hate 1200 of course in 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.669
 board but on the other hand that's it, and then 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.620
 there is the main danger here with 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.250
 near battles here in this city when 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.570
 there is artillery in command that one and 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.510
 so I was a little shocked here 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.700
 just good healthy full of strength and 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.610
 energy and was a shock for the whole team 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.740
 for all enemy tanks at this time 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.570
 we have already come to the base there 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.030
 distracting the entire enemy team 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.730
 I have two sevens left here and this one 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.430
 lucky finish in American 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.530
 drummers what we see here now we 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.220
 see with you a typical story about foch 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.790
 Here from 7 it is worth overboard with damage 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.280
 fine 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:55.550
 out of 7 stands a stone with a diamond 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.620
 gets into ammo and now shot 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.320
 foch guys in the stern purpose sleep all 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.720
 it is impossible to miss the mark 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:06.350
 okay the armor is not broken in the stern 7 here 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.940
 such is the nature in went 155 he can 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.580
 kill in the ammo any there 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.080
 Savka tank but in the stern then its not 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.690
 punch get him a harp more 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.540
 several times this also needs to be remembered and 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.550
 to count on three shells 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.990
 which we have deafening damage 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.750
 also need with caution 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.060
 Now I try to avoid colliding with 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.500
 the point of the American word is that he is 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.630
 apparently drove me to catch up with me 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.900
 somewhere to detect now he's on 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.610
 moving back left after seven 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.770
 on the minimap I see them hiding in the houses 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.289
 to survive so that he is not in karma and 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.510
 threw bye and reload well here in 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:43.580
 in general, by and large, and a fairy tale 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.370
 the end that is the given position of which we 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:49.130
 She looked very interesting 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.150
 in order to start a good while she 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.690
 according to your support 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:56.180
 team allies and in order to 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.610
 based on the fact that she could shoot 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.570
 act further according to the situation 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.729
 the situation is very 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.260
 Rainbow very positive even 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:05.900
 then when our whole team too 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.820
 acts not bad here such a man 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.190
 just pretty damage nothing 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.349
 supernatural but still nice and 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.450
 I wonder if you like it thanks 

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:15.889
