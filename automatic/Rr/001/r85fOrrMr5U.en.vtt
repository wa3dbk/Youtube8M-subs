00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.260 

all<00:00:01.589> right<00:00:01.740> this<00:00:01.949> is<00:00:02.129> a<00:00:02.159> 1995<00:00:03.230> Honda<00:00:04.230> Civic<00:00:04.740> and

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.270 
all right this is a 1995 Honda Civic and

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.570 
all right this is a 1995 Honda Civic and
right<00:00:06.270> now<00:00:06.480> I'm<00:00:06.660> just<00:00:06.810> doing<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.470> timing<00:00:08.400> belt

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
right now I'm just doing the timing belt

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.560 
right now I'm just doing the timing belt
on<00:00:08.849> it<00:00:09.080> but<00:00:10.080> it<00:00:10.320> has<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:11.540> difficult<00:00:12.540> time

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
on it but it has a difficult time

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.650 
on it but it has a difficult time
getting<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.139> crankshaft<00:00:13.530> off<00:00:14.130> because

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
getting the crankshaft off because

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.540 
getting the crankshaft off because
crankshaft<00:00:15.660> pulley<00:00:15.809> off<00:00:16.020> because<00:00:16.369> it's<00:00:17.369> been

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
crankshaft pulley off because it's been

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.300 
crankshaft pulley off because it's been
on<00:00:17.670> there<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.060> long<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:18.600> what<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.619> did<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.279> used

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
on there so long so what I did is I used

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.650 
on there so long so what I did is I used
a<00:00:21.590> duck<00:00:22.789> duck<00:00:23.789> foot<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.210> guess<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.510> would<00:00:24.630> call

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
a duck duck foot I guess you would call

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.939 
a duck duck foot I guess you would call
it<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.080> type<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.010> polar<00:00:26.900> but<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:28.140> have<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.650> polar

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
it a type of polar but I have a polar

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.930 
it a type of polar but I have a polar
kit<00:00:29.250> here<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:31.250> you<00:00:32.250> know<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.520> comes<00:00:32.759> with

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
kit here and you know it comes with

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.030 
kit here and you know it comes with
everything<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.420> pretty<00:00:33.750> much<00:00:33.870> need<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.920> it

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
everything you pretty much need but it

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.880 
everything you pretty much need but it
doesn't<00:00:35.399> come<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:35.700> everything<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.860> what<00:00:37.860> I

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
doesn't come with everything so what I

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.119 
doesn't come with everything so what I
did<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.809> since<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:40.020> pulley<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:40.950> might

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
did is since this pulley and this might

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.270 
did is since this pulley and this might
be<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:41.460> other<00:00:41.640> pulleys<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:43.160> they<00:00:44.160> don't

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
be for other pulleys to have they don't

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.220 
be for other pulleys to have they don't
have<00:00:44.399> threaded<00:00:44.820> holes<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.329> them<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:46.050> what<00:00:46.200> I

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
have threaded holes in them so what I

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.639 
have threaded holes in them so what I
did<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.770> use<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.579> duck<00:00:48.620> foot<00:00:49.620> thing<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.789> put

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
did is use the duck foot thing and I put

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.600 
did is use the duck foot thing and I put
about<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.710> two<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.850> half<00:00:54.000> inch<00:00:54.270> bolt<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.110> it

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
about a two and a half inch bolt in it

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.750 
about a two and a half inch bolt in it
with<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> nut<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.690> washroom<00:00:58.079> behind<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.829> so

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
with a nut and a washroom behind and so

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.180 
with a nut and a washroom behind and so
this<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.539> part<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.930> then<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.440> pulley<00:01:02.010> is

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
this is part of then the pulley is

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.910 
this is part of then the pulley is
facing<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.910> engine<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.409> guess<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.769> would<00:01:04.890> be

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
facing the engine so I guess it would be

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.710 
facing the engine so I guess it would be
more<00:01:05.610> like<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.420> what<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.659> would

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
more like that so this is what you would

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.899 
more like that so this is what you would
be<00:01:06.780> looking<00:01:07.080> at<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:07.979> took<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.250> out<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.520> show

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
be looking at so I took it out to show

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.690 
be looking at so I took it out to show
you<00:01:09.830> what<00:01:10.830> these<00:01:11.010> bolts<00:01:11.310> look<00:01:11.430> like<00:01:11.580> from

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
you what these bolts look like from

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.020 
you what these bolts look like from
behind<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.240> they're<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:13.130> just<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.340> carriage

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
behind and they're just just a carriage

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.770 
behind and they're just just a carriage
bolt<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.479> guess<00:01:16.189> but<00:01:17.210> you<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.360> stick<00:01:18.540> them<00:01:18.630> in

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
bolt I guess but you just stick them in

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.120 
bolt I guess but you just stick them in
from<00:01:18.960> behind<00:01:19.080> they<00:01:19.409> don't<00:01:19.560> have<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.799> be<00:01:19.920> very

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
from behind they don't have to be very

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.640 
from behind they don't have to be very
long<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:21.450> can<00:01:21.659> get<00:01:21.900> them<00:01:21.990> behind<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:22.439> there

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
long so you can get them behind in there

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.870 
long so you can get them behind in there
if<00:01:22.740> they're<00:01:22.890> too<00:01:23.040> long<00:01:23.070> they<00:01:23.400> won't<00:01:23.580> get<00:01:23.700> in

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
if they're too long they won't get in

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.880 
if they're too long they won't get in
the<00:01:23.909> behind<00:01:24.750> there<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.140> what<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.320> did<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.680> put

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
the behind there so what I did is put

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.149 
the behind there so what I did is put
these<00:01:26.100> two<00:01:26.340> bolts<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.860> these<00:01:28.860> bolts

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
these two bolts in and these bolts

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.760 
these two bolts in and these bolts
aren't<00:01:29.400> straight<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.060> if<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.540> had<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.770> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
aren't straight so if you had a the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.440 
aren't straight so if you had a the
normal<00:01:32.070> ones<00:01:32.189> with<00:01:32.369> threads<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.850> them<00:01:33.000> you

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
normal ones with threads on them you

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.980 
normal ones with threads on them you
won't<00:01:33.630> get<00:01:33.780> anything<00:01:34.020> out<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.500> what<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:34.950> did<00:01:35.189> is

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
won't get anything out so what I did is

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.810 
won't get anything out so what I did is
you<00:01:36.990> know<00:01:37.110> line<00:01:37.320> them<00:01:37.470> up<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.549> middle

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
you know line them up to the middle

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.580 
you know line them up to the middle
there<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:40.340> just<00:01:41.340> put<00:01:41.520> two<00:01:41.899> two<00:01:42.899> lag<00:01:43.110> bolts<00:01:43.409> to

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
there and just put two two lag bolts to

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.789 
there and just put two two lag bolts to
that<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:45.600> know<00:01:45.720> once<00:01:45.990> once<00:01:46.470> that's<00:01:46.649> all

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
that and you know once once that's all

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.380 
that and you know once once that's all
lined<00:01:47.009> up<00:01:47.130> it'll<00:01:47.700> it'll<00:01:47.939> just<00:01:48.149> hold<00:01:48.329> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
lined up it'll it'll just hold the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.719 
lined up it'll it'll just hold the
pulley<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.750> place<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:50.189> duck<00:01:50.460> foot

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
pulley in place so this this duck foot

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.880 
pulley in place so this this duck foot
doesn't<00:01:50.939> move<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.479> then<00:01:52.200> as<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.530> can<00:01:52.680> see

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
doesn't move and then as you can see

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.310 
doesn't move and then as you can see
through<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.189> middle<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.640> used<00:01:54.270> a

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
through the middle I used a

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.530 
through the middle I used a
the<00:01:55.770> big<00:01:55.980> bolt<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.580> pulled<00:01:57.090> out<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.510> just

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
the big bolt to pulled out and you just

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.740 
the big bolt to pulled out and you just
turn<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:59.000> it<00:02:00.000> comes<00:02:00.270> out<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.540> there<00:02:00.660> and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
turn that and it comes out of there and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.060 
turn that and it comes out of there and
this<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.020> what<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:02.000> will<00:02:03.000> give<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.440> if
