a comment below this deck is made before
the<00:07:22.320> priority<00:07:22.950> thing<00:07:23.630> I<00:07:24.630> just<00:07:25.080> say<00:07:25.740> that<00:07:25.890> out

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:25.950 
the priority thing I just say that out

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.910 
the priority thing I just say that out
maybe<00:07:26.610> change<00:07:27.210> some<00:07:27.330> stuff<00:07:27.650> but<00:07:28.650> the<00:07:28.740> stick

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:28.920 
maybe change some stuff but the stick

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.410 
maybe change some stuff but the stick
isn't<00:07:29.190> really<00:07:29.760> hit<00:07:30.060> by<00:07:30.240> priority<00:07:31.580> yeah<00:07:32.580> yeah

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:33.420 
isn't really hit by priority yeah yeah

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.170 
isn't really hit by priority yeah yeah
yeah<00:07:34.050> nothing<00:07:34.860> really<00:07:34.950> in<00:07:35.340> here<00:07:35.670> is<00:07:35.820> hit<00:07:36.060> by

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:36.180 
yeah nothing really in here is hit by

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.020 
yeah nothing really in here is hit by
priority<00:07:36.690> so<00:07:36.900> it<00:07:37.050> doesn't<00:07:37.260> really<00:07:37.350> matter<00:07:38.480> um

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:41.030 
priority so it doesn't really matter um

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.090 
priority so it doesn't really matter um
but<00:07:42.030> yeah<00:07:42.720> I<00:07:42.750> guess<00:07:43.020> that's<00:07:43.200> it<00:07:43.290> if<00:07:43.470> the<00:07:43.770> video

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:44.100 
but yeah I guess that's it if the video

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.410 
but yeah I guess that's it if the video
if<00:07:44.250> you<00:07:44.400> haven't<00:07:44.550> checked<00:07:44.700> out<00:07:44.850> my<00:07:44.910> last<00:07:45.300> video
