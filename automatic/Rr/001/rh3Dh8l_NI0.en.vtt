his press for God's he's got his life
again<00:03:58.640> one<00:03:58.819> trigger<00:03:59.209> would<00:03:59.450> have<00:03:59.540> gone

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
again one trigger would have gone

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.420 
again one trigger would have gone
through<00:04:00.080> but<00:04:00.380> unfortunately<00:04:01.069> again<00:04:01.280> I'm

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
through but unfortunately again I'm

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.759 
through but unfortunately again I'm
unlucky<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:02.000> only<00:04:02.239> get<00:04:02.390> five<00:04:02.660> keys<00:04:02.989> so<00:04:03.739> I

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
unlucky and only get five keys so I

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.100 
unlucky and only get five keys so I
guess<00:04:04.150> trigger<00:04:05.150> wise<00:04:05.330> i'd<00:04:05.569> say<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:05.870> forked

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
guess trigger wise i'd say the forked

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.720 
guess trigger wise i'd say the forked
river<00:04:06.230> decks<00:04:06.560> got<00:04:06.830> it<00:04:06.980> set<00:04:07.190> up<00:04:07.340> it<00:04:07.549> keeps

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
river decks got it set up it keeps

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.220 
river decks got it set up it keeps
getting<00:04:07.880> its<00:04:08.090> grade<00:04:08.299> 3<00:04:08.600> as<00:04:08.660> it<00:04:08.900> keeps<00:04:09.019> getting

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
getting its grade 3 as it keeps getting

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.960 
getting its grade 3 as it keeps getting
its<00:04:09.470> triggers<00:04:09.739> but<00:04:09.860> I<00:04:09.920> guess<00:04:10.160> that's<00:04:10.370> really

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
its triggers but I guess that's really

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.990 
its triggers but I guess that's really
the<00:04:11.090> strength<00:04:11.360> of<00:04:11.600> the<00:04:11.750> forest<00:04:12.019> river<00:04:12.170> deck

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
the strength of the forest river deck

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.509 
the strength of the forest river deck
going<00:04:14.000> for<00:04:14.150> one<00:04:14.330> thing<00:04:14.510> again<00:04:14.810> again<00:04:15.230> he<00:04:15.739> mixes

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
going for one thing again again he mixes

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.479 
going for one thing again again he mixes
up<00:04:16.669> he<00:04:17.299> is<00:04:17.450> grade<00:04:17.900> 3<00:04:18.350> timing<00:04:18.859> he<00:04:19.130> was<00:04:19.280> supposed

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
up he is grade 3 timing he was supposed

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.280 
up he is grade 3 timing he was supposed
to<00:04:19.579> drive<00:04:19.790> trigger<00:04:20.000> before<00:04:20.630> checking<00:04:21.139> the

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
to drive trigger before checking the

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.620 
to drive trigger before checking the
second<00:04:21.590> trigger<00:04:21.739> bounce<00:04:22.190> play<00:04:22.880> and<00:04:23.210> then<00:04:23.510> if
