diamond so basically as you can see the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.720 
diamond so basically as you can see the
diamond<00:01:01.559> ore<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.859> just<00:01:02.039> chillin<00:01:02.370> at<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.550> top

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
diamond ore is just chillin at the top

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.399 
diamond ore is just chillin at the top
of<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.059> furnace<00:01:03.270> there<00:01:03.629> now<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.199> order<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
of the furnace there now in order to

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.219 
of the furnace there now in order to
turn<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.010> into<00:01:05.309> diamond<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.630> need<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.960> place

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
turn that into diamond you need to place

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.859 
turn that into diamond you need to place
the<00:01:07.619> coal<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.850> beautiful<00:01:09.240> piece<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.420> coal<00:01:09.689> on

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
the coal this beautiful piece of coal on

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.969 
the coal this beautiful piece of coal on
top<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.320> it'll<00:01:10.740> start<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:12.110> smelt<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.500> might

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
top and it'll start to smelt the might

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.190 
top and it'll start to smelt the might
the<00:01:14.430> diamond<00:01:14.850> ore<00:01:15.030> into<00:01:15.360> diamond<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.049> let's

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
the diamond ore into diamond so let's

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.960 
the diamond ore into diamond so let's
just<00:01:16.320> tuck<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.619> coal<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.250> top<00:01:17.460> like<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.640> and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
just tuck the coal on top like that and

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.520 
just tuck the coal on top like that and
there<00:01:18.299> we<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.630> if<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.080> give<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.350> couple

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
there we have it if you give it a couple

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.560 
there we have it if you give it a couple
of<00:01:19.650> seconds<00:01:19.979> now<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.310> diamond<00:01:20.790> ore<00:01:21.030> will<00:01:21.479> be

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
of seconds now a diamond ore will be

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.289 
of seconds now a diamond ore will be
transformed<00:01:22.380> into<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.770> nice<00:01:23.189> diamond<00:01:23.700> there<00:01:24.210> we

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
transformed into a nice diamond there we

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.390 
transformed into a nice diamond there we
have<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.540> there<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.470> furnace<00:01:25.950> has<00:01:26.130> crafted

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
have it there so the furnace has crafted

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.670 
have it there so the furnace has crafted
a<00:01:26.759> diamond<00:01:27.420> ore<00:01:27.570> into<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> diamond<00:01:28.200> forgive<00:01:28.650> a

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
a diamond ore into a diamond forgive a

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.899 
a diamond ore into a diamond forgive a
couple<00:01:29.009> more<00:01:29.100> seconds<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.579> will<00:01:29.700> create

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
couple more seconds it will create

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.630 
couple more seconds it will create
another<00:01:30.210> diamond<00:01:31.020> tore<00:01:31.170> into<00:01:31.439> some<00:01:32.310> more

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
another diamond tore into some more

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.890 
another diamond tore into some more
diamond<00:01:32.970> there<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.299> another<00:01:33.420> diamond

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
diamond there we have another diamond

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.060 
diamond there we have another diamond
