00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
much like the old one that I had back in

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.510 
much like the old one that I had back in
2007<00:01:59.429> when<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.610> had<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.759> real<00:01:59.970> one<00:02:01.399> stupid<00:02:02.399> me

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
2007 when I had a real one stupid me

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.109 
2007 when I had a real one stupid me
sold<00:02:02.910> it<00:02:03.229> like<00:02:04.229> an<00:02:04.350> 80<00:02:04.530> but<00:02:05.310> okay<00:02:05.700> here's<00:02:05.910> why<00:02:06.060> I

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
sold it like an 80 but okay here's why I

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.609 
sold it like an 80 but okay here's why I
think<00:02:06.720> it's<00:02:06.959> a<00:02:07.020> waste<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.259> money

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
think it's a waste of money

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.969 
think it's a waste of money
okay<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.550> when<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.700> first<00:02:08.850> got<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.800> took<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.890> out

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979
