00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.590
 good one of the questions that most 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.900
 they repeated on the web that they wanted 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.820
 to do to me was what it meant to me 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.920
 that I wanted to transmit with the video of you 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.200
 love 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.180
 as the same as I said before are 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.890
 own experiences of manuel rodríguez 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.840
 it's a feeling and how he thinks like 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.520
 a normal human being had 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.280
 identified many people with the subject and 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.680
 as a video since 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.010
 we all have that kind of thinking already 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.990
 that always after a person who 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.760
 it meant so much to you that he shared 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.800
 so much with you that you gave the person 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.760
 that you gave him so much for the problem or 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.339
 per team today in circumstances 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.500
 they end badly they finish what 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.500
 practically as an enemy and that is what 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.010
 I call is that of that kind of love 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.659
 a celorio is born and then but for 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.430
 that you feel hatred for such a person 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.860
 is that you still have to have a 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.409
 feeling towards her and it was what I 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.390
 I wanted to express with the video further if 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.100
 people come a little bit beyond what 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.930
 that she is used to seeing is given 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.840
 realize that it's not that it's not that I 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.229
 I wanted to put on and go out with the devil 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.380
 because I am I do not know that I am son of 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.380
 satán so I think in that there is , if 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.759
 I wanted it to be like this because I want 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.470
 see that people see that we all have 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.960
 like that alter ego that each 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.260
 person and that more than everything as it says that 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.910
 that the bad is motivated by the 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.940
 the bad things are motivated by the 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.760
 bad and then I wanted to understand the 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.390
 people that he tried drives us something 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.020
 do things like that 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.240
 that I particularly manuel rodríguez 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.150
 I get rid of myself that's the way it is in singing 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.400
 I would try to do that burning 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.119
 someone in a house, much less 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.530
 the style but if they are thoughts that 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.380
 I translate the write 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.479
 and there's the art of rhyming not 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.360
 thank God I did very well with that 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.140
 topic 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.770
 but well nothing much people also say 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.179
 that if we are atheists if all that kind 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.480
 of things 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.450
 which are comments that those who are 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.700
 ignorant in the sense that they do not know 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.950
 they do not know well the transport of what 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.079
 we are doing and sometimes that 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.219
 is what sometimes we feel bad 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.239
 because sometimes we say that we 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.680
 we write and they are not understanding 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.319
 absolutely nothing what we are 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.000
 saying why are we going for a 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.310
 side and they are understanding you is something else 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 lying we want to expose it always 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.670
 they have to go beyond what 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.830
 at least in that video it came out blue 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.240
 the one who had a devil mask and 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.980
 everyone thought it was that we were 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.750
 doing satanic rites and all that kind 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.670
 of things because that blood and all that 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.810
 kind of things when they do not see that at 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.670
 better us what we are doing 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.380
 is mocking all those kinds of beliefs 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.000
 because there are a lot of people who say no 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.250
 believe in god but then believe 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.720
 devil and believe in the devil then yes 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.130
 you believe in the devil you have to believe 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.720
 also in God because if there is the 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.310
 Devil has to exist god for you 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.170
 then there is a series of 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.060
 contradictions that people have 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.720
 and we are trying to cover 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.940
 all those things and telling us 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.760
 we own the truth the truth is 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.069
 super completely relative in many 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.659
 aspects 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.069
 and anyone can own the 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.049
 true but nobody is ever going to be the 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.760
 owner of an absolute truth of all the 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.980
 true then we are 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.480
 encompassing what all that kind of 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.340
 contradictions we are not perfect not 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.560
 we are nothing are one of the humans 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.590
 normal that we write what we 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.329
 we want what comes to us 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.219
 to mind at that time and if it 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.659
 listen well if you put it very well what 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:38.659
 we take out and that's how they are
