00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.379
 hello welcome to my fav channel and be 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.440
 Today I'm going to teach you how to make 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.929
 little pancakes we are going to use a 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.289
 refractory that is especially for 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.850
 the little tanks 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:23.760
 we will also use 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.570
 the pieces of paper and we're going to put them in 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.270
 each hole 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.270
 it does not have to stay like this we're going to light 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.840
 the oven at 180 degrees before you start 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.170
 with all the mix we are going to use two 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.530
 cups 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.739
 of wheat flour and we're going to make it 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.739
 anise 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.530
 let's add a cup of sugar 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.950
 we're going to do it live anyway 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:14.970
 We are also going to add 2 tablespoons 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.970
 of baking powder 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.650
 and you also have to serve 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.229
 let's add 4 eggs 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.840
 ah 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.150
 ah 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.050
 ah 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.380
 a cup of milk 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.410
 a cup of vegetable oil 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.630
 and with the help of the blender we will beat 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.750
 and this has to be like this 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.680
 good since we have the mixture we 're going 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.680
 to start adding 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.140
 but we're going to add it halfway 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.750
 you never have to put it up 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.900
 because if you are not going to fall 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.690
 good since we have them ready what 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.970
 We put in for 20 minutes, we're going to 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.060
 introduce a toothpick if we see that 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.180
 we still lack them we leave 5 minutes 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.180
 plus 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.180
 good as you can see so we are going to 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.420
 stay took 30 minutes in the oven 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.960
 and with the amount that I gave you 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.600
