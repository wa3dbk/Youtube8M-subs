corn goes up it doesn't know it all the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.210 
corn goes up it doesn't know it all the
way<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.960> can<00:00:43.230> kind<00:00:43.470> of<00:00:43.530> push<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.130> little

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
way you can kind of push it in a little

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.120 
way you can kind of push it in a little
bit<00:00:44.550> but<00:00:44.880> it<00:00:45.420> does<00:00:45.780> have<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> little<00:00:46.350> tail<00:00:46.770> left

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
obviously but that's fine it makes it

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.880 
obviously but that's fine it makes it
easier<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.370> store<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.510> less<00:00:52.230> cables<00:00:52.710> is

accessories but one of the reasons I

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.960 
accessories but one of the reasons I
returned<00:02:59.470> it<00:02:59.620> was<00:02:59.739> that<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.069> cord<00:03:00.340> length<00:03:00.610> was

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970

returned it was that the cord length was
long<00:03:01.840> enough<00:03:02.019> so<00:03:02.440> that's<00:03:02.560> something<00:03:02.829> you

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
long enough so that's something you

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.559 
long enough so that's something you
really<00:03:03.099> want<00:03:03.549> to<00:03:03.640> put<00:03:03.849> under<00:03:04.090> consideration

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
really want to put under consideration

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.000 
really want to put under consideration
and<00:03:05.069> teleported<00:03:06.069> I<00:03:06.310> am<00:03:07.090> 5<00:03:07.900> feet<00:03:08.170> tall<00:03:08.470> so<00:03:08.859> I'm

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
and teleported I am 5 feet tall so I'm

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.550 
and teleported I am 5 feet tall so I'm
pretty<00:03:09.220> on<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:09.670> short<00:03:09.940> side<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.510> even<00:03:11.200> though

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
pretty on the short side and even though

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.550 
pretty on the short side and even though
I<00:03:11.650> attached<00:03:12.250> it<00:03:12.459> to<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.870> outlet<00:03:14.290> I

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
I attached it to the to the outlet I

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.400 
I attached it to the to the outlet I
think<00:03:15.220> it<00:03:15.400> only<00:03:15.609> came<00:03:15.940> up<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.420> about<00:03:16.600> ear<00:03:17.049> level

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
think it only came up to about ear level

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.650 
think it only came up to about ear level
right<00:03:17.739> here<00:03:17.980> so<00:03:18.400> it<00:03:18.760> was<00:03:18.910> really<00:03:19.090> hard<00:03:19.329> to<00:03:19.480> get

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
right here so it was really hard to get

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.900 
right here so it was really hard to get
my<00:03:19.780> hairline<00:03:20.200> without<00:03:21.070> hairdryer<00:03:21.490> and<00:03:21.730> this

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
one has an appropriate and a link

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.590 
one has an appropriate and a link
support<00:03:24.370> so<00:03:24.820> something<00:03:25.300> to<00:03:25.390> put<00:03:25.570> under

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600
