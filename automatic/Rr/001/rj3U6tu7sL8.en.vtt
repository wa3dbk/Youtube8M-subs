00:00:04.038 --> 00:00:06.340
 "I had a bad habit of underestimating you. 

00:00:09.178 --> 00:00:11.069
 -My time as human is over 

00:00:11.503 --> 00:00:13.602
 "But I've never felt so alive." 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.618
 "I did not expect you to look so ... you!" 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:20.271
 In part 2 Bella wakes up like a newly created and 

00:00:20.442 --> 00:00:23.546
 She finds her daughter and her husband as a vampire. 

00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:27.990
 Bella transforms into a vampire without problems, actually. 

00:00:28.172 --> 00:00:29.624
 "We have the same temperature now. 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.897
 You watched four movies where you had an outside view of the vampires. 

00:00:34.053 --> 00:00:38.608
 Now you will have the experience of knowing what it is like to have the world view as a vampire. 

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:43.511
 Bella and Edward have the chance to be together again. 

00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:46.967
 I think when he has the kid with Bella it's a very happy start. 

00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:52.879
 The baby is Renesmee, she's this beautiful half-human half-vampire child. 

00:00:53.354 --> 00:00:55.292
 I have to report a crime. 

00:00:55.776 --> 00:00:57.037
 Oh my... 

00:00:57.393 --> 00:01:00.122
 When the Volturi find out about this child, 

00:01:00.452 --> 00:01:03.626
 They suspect that their maximum law has been broken. 

00:01:03.802 --> 00:01:07.884
 Renesmee is accused of being a child bitten by a vampire. 

00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:09.385
 "She's not an immortal child!" 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.127
 You can not raise a vampire child, punishment is death. 

00:01:14.035 --> 00:01:17.531
 The Cullens know they can not face the Volturi alone then ... 

00:01:17.738 --> 00:01:19.164
 They need some reinforcements. 

00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:21.089
 My family is in danger, I need your help. 

00:01:22.234 --> 00:01:25.932
 I think the Cullens' biggest resource is their ability to join other vampires. 

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:27.199
 That they know around the world. 

00:01:28.843 --> 00:01:29.928
 We will stay with you. 

00:01:31.902 --> 00:01:33.229
 There are many red eyes around her. 

00:01:33.248 --> 00:01:37.974
 And that will cause the cataclysmic confrontation we will see in that movie. 

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:47.443
 It's a great movie, it's hard to do something that matters so much to so many people. 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.746
 This was accumulating, accumulating, accumulating ... 

00:01:52.965 --> 00:01:55.482
 People react viscerally. 

00:01:57.522 --> 00:02:01.300
 They watch the movies for the same reasons that I do the movies. 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.242
 So I know what it's like to love something so much.
