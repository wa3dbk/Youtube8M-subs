it<00:00:02.120> will<00:00:02.300> always<00:00:02.570> going<00:00:02.870> to<00:00:02.929> land<00:00:03.170> somewhere

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:03.500 
it will always going to land somewhere

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.530 
it will always going to land somewhere
and<00:00:03.889> I<00:00:04.130> doubt<00:00:04.399> if<00:00:04.550> they<00:00:04.670> were<00:00:04.730> short<00:00:05.029> on<00:00:05.149> offers

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
and I doubt if they were short on offers

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.299 
and I doubt if they were short on offers
so<00:00:05.870> but<00:00:06.140> this<00:00:06.260> particular<00:00:06.380> move<00:00:06.800> did<00:00:06.979> surprise

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:07.309 
so but this particular move did surprise

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:08.710 
so but this particular move did surprise
me<00:00:07.490> because<00:00:07.580> personally<00:00:08.149> I<00:00:08.240> thought<00:00:08.450> is<00:00:08.570> going

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:08.720 
me because personally I thought is going

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.629 
me because personally I thought is going
to<00:00:08.780> be<00:00:08.840> Netflix<00:00:09.320> but<00:00:09.620> they've<00:00:09.980> shown<00:00:10.009> up<00:00:10.400> here

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
to be Netflix but they've shown up here

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.470 
to be Netflix but they've shown up here
and<00:00:10.700> I<00:00:11.330> think<00:00:12.259> that<00:00:12.559> they've<00:00:12.860> got<00:00:12.950> a<00:00:13.480> fantastic

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
and I think that they've got a fantastic

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.900 
and I think that they've got a fantastic
opportunity<00:00:15.129> how<00:00:16.129> big<00:00:16.309> an<00:00:16.400> opportunity<00:00:16.490> do

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
opportunity how big an opportunity do

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.519 
opportunity how big an opportunity do

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
you think it is though because it's kind

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:19.929 
you think it is though because it's kind
of<00:00:18.560> untested<00:00:19.220> as<00:00:19.340> we<00:00:19.490> heard<00:00:19.640> from<00:00:19.670> there<00:00:19.880> we

they don't the old team at least do you

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:23.679 
they don't the old team at least do you
think<00:01:22.490> that<00:01:22.700> it<00:01:22.759> was<00:01:22.850> inevitable<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.450> three

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:27.109 
it wasn't inevitable I think is highly

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:29.260 
it wasn't inevitable I think is highly
commendable<00:01:27.590> that<00:01:27.799> they<00:01:27.920> did<00:01:28.270> obviously

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
commendable that they did obviously

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.989 
commendable that they did obviously

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
we're used to but be prepared for what I

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.809 
we're used to but be prepared for what I
mean<00:02:22.689> he<00:02:22.870> does<00:02:23.349> bring<00:02:23.650> surprises<00:02:24.609> although

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
mean he does bring surprises although

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.539 
mean he does bring surprises although
that's<00:02:25.150> why<00:02:25.540> he<00:02:25.959> is<00:02:26.109> who<00:02:26.260> he<00:02:26.379> is<00:02:26.409> so<00:02:26.859> I<00:02:27.069> think<00:02:27.159> we

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
been impressed about is that talking

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.720 
been impressed about is that talking
about<00:02:43.930> cars<00:02:44.319> every<00:02:44.859> single<00:02:45.189> week<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.519> trying

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
about cars every single week and trying

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.030 
about cars every single week and trying
to<00:02:45.819> find<00:02:45.999> something<00:02:46.299> new<00:02:46.689> about<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.680> engage

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
audiences but I deeply suspect that

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.690 
audiences but I deeply suspect that

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.879 
we've heard before that there's going to
be<00:02:51.819> maybe<00:02:52.030> more<00:02:52.840> creative<00:02:53.319> freedom<00:02:53.439> with<00:02:53.799> the

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
be maybe more creative freedom with the

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:54.659 
be maybe more creative freedom with the
news<00:02:54.099> show

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:54.669
