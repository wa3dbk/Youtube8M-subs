and you can see like the colors do a
very<00:00:37.170> similar<00:00:37.380> see<00:00:37.559> Assassin's<00:00:37.890> grew<00:00:38.010> one

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
very similar see Assassin's grew one

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.850 
very similar see Assassin's grew one
animus<00:00:39.140> which<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.260> saw<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.500> very<00:00:40.680> first

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
animus which we saw in the very first

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.290 
animus which we saw in the very first
game<00:00:41.010> which<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.370> does<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.030> does<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.180> very

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
game which it does it does it very

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.110 
game which it does it does it very
similar<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.719> does<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.110> mean<00:00:43.219> possibly<00:00:44.219> this

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
similar so does this mean possibly this

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.670 
similar so does this mean possibly this
game<00:00:45.420> could<00:00:45.600> be<00:00:45.719> taking<00:00:46.140> place<00:00:46.320> before

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
game could be taking place before

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.430 
game could be taking place before
Assassin's<00:00:47.640> Creed<00:00:47.910> one<00:00:48.149> maybe<00:00:48.600> do<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.140> play<00:00:49.320> as

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
Assassin's Creed one maybe do we play as

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.369 
Assassin's Creed one maybe do we play as
subject<00:00:49.770> 16<00:00:50.129> will<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.210> play<00:00:51.420> as<00:00:54.110> some<00:00:55.110> other

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
subject 16 will we play as some other

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.990 
subject 16 will we play as some other
test<00:00:55.770> subject<00:00:56.039> they<00:00:56.100> had<00:00:56.250> any<00:00:56.430> Abstergo<00:00:56.789> labs

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
test subject they had any Abstergo labs

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.180 
test subject they had any Abstergo labs
is<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> possibility<00:00:58.289> something<00:00:58.859> we<00:00:59.070> might

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
is that a possibility something we might

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.830 
is that a possibility something we might
see<00:00:59.430> because<00:00:59.640> they<00:01:00.000> we<00:01:00.270> know<00:01:00.390> obstructive

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
see because they we know obstructive

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.540 
see because they we know obstructive
changed<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.350> Animus<00:01:01.739> now<00:01:01.920> they<00:01:02.129> don't<00:01:02.340> use

the same ones as they used previously in
Assassin's<00:01:05.519> group<00:01:05.700> 1<00:01:06.110> but<00:01:07.110> could<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.470> mean

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
Assassin's group 1 but could this mean
