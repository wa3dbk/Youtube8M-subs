over<00:02:39.940> surf<00:02:40.239> because<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:40.989> thirty<00:02:41.170> percent

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
over surf because of the thirty percent

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.229 
over surf because of the thirty percent
chance<00:02:41.769> to<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.040> burn<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:42.730> I'm<00:02:42.820> just<00:02:43.000> doing<00:02:43.180> the

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
chance to the burn so I'm just doing the

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.150 
chance to the burn so I'm just doing the
same<00:02:43.420> thing<00:02:43.660> but<00:02:43.840> in<00:02:43.989> retrospect<00:02:44.290> having<00:02:45.070> a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
same thing but in retrospect having a

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.979 
same thing but in retrospect having a
30-percent<00:02:45.760> chance<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.180> paralysis<00:02:46.480> so

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
30-percent chance to the paralysis so

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.050 
30-percent chance to the paralysis so
you<00:02:47.050> know<00:02:47.320> you<00:02:47.380> laugh<00:02:47.739> at<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.100> but<00:02:48.130> hell<00:02:48.880> is

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
you know you laugh at it but hell is

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.030
