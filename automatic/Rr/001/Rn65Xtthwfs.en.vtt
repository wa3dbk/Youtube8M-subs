planning on destroying them but the X

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.539 
planning on destroying them but the X
before<00:02:40.560> they<00:02:40.709> take<00:02:40.829> over<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.100> world<00:02:41.220> right

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
before they take over the world right

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.229 
before they take over the world right
wait<00:02:42.450> there's<00:02:42.690> computers<00:02:43.079> or<00:02:43.200> robots<00:02:43.280> um<00:02:44.280> no

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
wait there's computers or robots um no

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:52.620 
wait there's computers or robots um no
oh<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:46.579> think

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.840 

what<00:02:53.630> did<00:02:53.750> you<00:02:53.870> do<00:02:54.190> see<00:02:55.190> if<00:02:55.250> they<00:02:55.370> will<00:02:55.490> send<00:02:55.760> a

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
what did you do see if they will send a

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:56.980 
what did you do see if they will send a
robot<00:02:56.150> apocalypse

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
robot apocalypse

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.720 
robot apocalypse
no<00:02:57.560> would<00:02:57.680> you<00:02:57.740> if<00:02:57.860> you<00:02:57.980> just<00:02:58.160> left<00:02:58.370> our<00:02:58.550> flight

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
no would you if you just left our flight

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.000 
no would you if you just left our flight
equipment<00:02:58.910> it<00:02:59.180> up<00:02:59.300> with<00:02:59.420> your<00:02:59.570> axe<00:02:59.780> oh<00:03:00.260> yeah<00:03:00.980> I

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
equipment it up with your axe oh yeah I

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.870 
equipment it up with your axe oh yeah I
did<00:03:01.370> that<00:03:01.520> too

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
did that too

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.900 
did that too
uh<00:03:02.830> okay<00:03:03.830> Dukey<00:03:04.130> I<00:03:04.160> need<00:03:04.370> you<00:03:04.490> to<00:03:04.580> go<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:04.790> the

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
uh okay Dukey I need you to go to the

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:17.730 
uh okay Dukey I need you to go to the
back<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:05.270> turn<00:03:05.420> on<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.630> emergency<00:03:06.170> generator

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.120 

probably<00:03:18.740> wasn't<00:03:18.920> that<00:03:19.130> important<00:03:20.740> so<00:03:21.740> what

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
probably wasn't that important so what

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.430 
probably wasn't that important so what
did<00:03:22.220> it<00:03:22.310> look<00:03:22.370> like<00:03:22.600> what<00:03:23.600> do<00:03:23.720> I<00:03:23.750> look<00:03:23.960> like<00:03:24.020> the

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
did it look like what do I look like the

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.780 
did it look like what do I look like the
backup<00:03:24.890> generator<00:03:25.340> in<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.490> back<00:03:25.610> of<00:03:25.730> the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
backup generator in the back of the

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:36.600 
backup generator in the back of the
plane<00:03:25.940> is<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.180> working<00:03:26.510> oh<00:03:26.660> yeah<00:03:27.970> right<00:03:28.970> now<00:03:35.410> I

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
plane is it working oh yeah right now I

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.310 
plane is it working oh yeah right now I
don't<00:03:37.610> know<00:03:37.790> what<00:03:37.940> else<00:03:38.210> to<00:03:38.270> clean<00:03:38.450> the

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
don't know what else to clean the

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.390 
don't know what else to clean the
back-up<00:03:39.500> generator<00:03:39.650> go<00:03:40.370> back<00:03:40.520> to<00:03:40.670> 139<00:03:41.030> oh<00:03:41.600> yeah

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
back-up generator go back to 139 oh yeah

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.380 
back-up generator go back to 139 oh yeah
turn<00:03:43.400> on<00:03:43.520> the<00:03:43.580> generator<00:03:43.970> don't<00:03:44.150> forget<00:03:44.330> to

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
turn on the generator don't forget to

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.860 
turn on the generator don't forget to
turn<00:03:44.510> on<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.690> generator<00:03:45.020> in<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.890> back<00:03:46.010> of

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.820 

you'll<00:03:50.870> be<00:03:50.990> your<00:03:51.050> sponsor<00:03:51.290> on<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.620> backup

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
you'll be your sponsor on the backup

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.550 
you'll be your sponsor on the backup
generator<00:03:52.190> I<00:03:52.430> am<00:03:53.000> a<00:03:53.270> bad<00:03:53.510> why<00:03:54.140> don't<00:03:54.320> you<00:03:54.410> go

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
generator I am a bad why don't you go

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.410 
generator I am a bad why don't you go
there<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:54.740> fly<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.070> plane<00:03:55.310> Dubey<00:03:56.000> no<00:03:56.150> offense

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
there and fly the plane Dubey no offense

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.400 
there and fly the plane Dubey no offense
but<00:03:56.570> you've<00:03:56.660> never<00:03:56.750> been<00:03:56.900> trained<00:03:57.170> to<00:03:57.260> fly<00:03:57.350> a

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
but you've never been trained to fly a

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.660 
but you've never been trained to fly a
plane<00:03:57.500> in<00:03:57.800> situations<00:03:58.220> like<00:03:58.250> this

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
plane in situations like this

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.100 
plane in situations like this
don't<00:03:58.970> worry<00:03:59.120> making<00:03:59.480> it<00:03:59.570> only<00:03:59.660> lasts<00:03:59.900> ten

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
don't worry making it only lasts ten

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.890 
don't worry making it only lasts ten
seconds<00:04:00.530> I<00:04:00.620> can<00:04:00.680> handle<00:04:00.980> it<00:04:01.130> for<00:04:01.250> that<00:04:01.400> long<00:04:01.640> uh

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
seconds I can handle it for that long uh

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.470 
seconds I can handle it for that long uh
okay<00:04:02.900> I'll<00:04:02.990> be<00:04:03.110> right<00:04:03.260> back

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.920 

hey<00:04:08.480> Megan<00:04:09.190> thank<00:04:10.190> mast<00:04:10.610> I<00:04:11.769> know

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
hey Megan thank mast I know

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.810 
hey Megan thank mast I know
hey<00:04:14.930> you<00:04:15.860> remember<00:04:15.920> how<00:04:16.220> you<00:04:16.280> told<00:04:16.489> me<00:04:16.579> you<00:04:16.699> go

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
hey you remember how you told me you go

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
hey you remember how you told me you go
to<00:04:16.850> the<00:04:17.180> back-up<00:04:17.359> generator<00:04:18.609> yes<00:04:19.660> now<00:04:20.660> it's

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
to the back-up generator yes now it's

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.400 
to the back-up generator yes now it's
back<00:04:21.019> there

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
back there

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.379 
back there
I<00:04:21.440> saw<00:04:21.769> giant<00:04:22.100> fingers<00:04:22.760> attached<00:04:23.090> to<00:04:23.300> the

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
I saw giant fingers attached to the

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.479 
I saw giant fingers attached to the
plane<00:04:24.610> doofy<00:04:25.610> those<00:04:25.790> are<00:04:25.910> always<00:04:26.090> there
