00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.850
 a while back because the staff was 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.219
 talking about what made the texture but actually 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.870

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.000

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.620
 giving these issues and I not knowing right 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.890
 I was talking about the guy who actually did it. 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.780
 It had been another guy 's the following I'm going 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.030

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.100
 the textures and I'll use them too 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.780
 but it will be a little different for you 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.789
 Sending textures will have to send her 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.219

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.260
 I'll tell you more, too. 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.510
 body of text or whatever you go 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.860
 writing in this medium will be for example 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.860
 and I did the texture that pet me 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.909
 I used as a base the texture of the zé fire by 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.540
 example 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.500
 I also used the texture of the perez to use 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.130
 the armor soup and the swords 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.310
 the rest i did edith in some blocks is 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.659
 the heart in the water particles in the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.540
 But I want to be what not only that 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.490
 beauty then everything you are wearing 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.369
 You have to talking then if you used 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.689
 even if it's the grass of a texture you 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.640
 I used to use the texture of the face x 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.399
 It's okay for when I'm making the video. 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.649
 I can talk look who edited this 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.799
 texture and sent it to me was the person 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.409
 but it used as a basis the texture of the 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.869
 such person and also used other textures 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.009
 to complement it as for example the 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.689
 texture or person x right then so 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.689

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.450
