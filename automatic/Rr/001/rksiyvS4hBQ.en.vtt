00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.339 

so<00:04:06.650> I've<00:04:06.859> been<00:04:06.979> using<00:04:07.250> this<00:04:07.609> in<00:04:08.419> combination

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
so I've been using this in combination

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.649 
so I've been using this in combination
with<00:04:09.739> my<00:04:10.040> iPhone<00:04:10.579> while<00:04:10.790> it's<00:04:11.000> in<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:11.209> contour

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
with my iPhone while it's in the contour

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.869 
with my iPhone while it's in the contour
showcase<00:04:12.199> and<00:04:12.500> it's<00:04:12.979> been<00:04:13.129> working<00:04:13.340> just<00:04:13.519> fine

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
showcase and it's been working just fine

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.550 
showcase and it's been working just fine
and<00:04:14.329> I<00:04:14.389> think<00:04:14.599> I'll<00:04:14.720> stay<00:04:14.959> with<00:04:15.139> that<00:04:15.169> for

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
and I think I'll stay with that for

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.800 
and I think I'll stay with that for
quite<00:04:15.709> some<00:04:15.979> time<00:04:16.009> and<00:04:16.539> just<00:04:17.539> to<00:04:17.659> demonstrate

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
quite some time and just to demonstrate

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.740 
quite some time and just to demonstrate
that<00:04:18.259> I'll<00:04:18.530> slip<00:04:18.949> it<00:04:19.130> into<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.609> belt<00:04:20.509> clip

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
that I'll slip it into the belt clip

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.779 
that I'll slip it into the belt clip
case<00:04:20.779> right<00:04:21.200> now<00:04:21.229> when<00:04:21.919> I<00:04:21.950> usually<00:04:22.159> put<00:04:22.639> this

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
into the case I put it in so that the

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.499 
into the case I put it in so that the
