for like a program kind of thing with

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.730 
for like a program kind of thing with
him<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.899> pain<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> lot<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.290> money<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.649> get

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
him so the pain a lot of money to get

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.260 
him so the pain a lot of money to get
him<00:01:58.860> on<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:58.950> case<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.250> stuff<00:01:59.610> so<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.119> makes

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
him on the case and stuff so it makes

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.060 
him on the case and stuff so it makes
sense<00:02:00.360> them<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.930> create<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.200> 99<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.770> year<00:02:01.979> as

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
sense them to create a 99 this year as

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.679 
sense them to create a 99 this year as
well<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.460> mean<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.149> doesn't<00:02:03.390> really<00:02:03.479> make<00:02:03.630> sense

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
well I mean it doesn't really make sense

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.850 
well I mean it doesn't really make sense

for<00:03:40.190> this<00:03:40.280> one<00:03:40.489> so<00:03:41.150> a<00:03:41.180> little<00:03:41.329> bit<00:03:41.480> i<00:03:41.630> think

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
for this one so a little bit i think

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.030 
for this one so a little bit i think
cheaper<00:03:42.170> than<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.320> other<00:03:42.440> one<00:03:42.560> was<00:03:42.739> so<00:03:42.860> sure

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
cheaper than the other one was so sure

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.009 
cheaper than the other one was so sure
but<00:03:43.370> he's<00:03:43.880> not<00:03:44.000> in<00:03:44.060> as<00:03:44.239> good<00:03:44.299> a<00:03:44.450> formation<00:03:44.720> as

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
but he's not in as good a formation as

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.509 
but he's not in as good a formation as
the<00:03:45.140> vol<00:03:45.350> 3<00:03:45.560> 3<00:03:45.829> i'm<00:03:45.980> going<00:03:46.130> to<00:03:46.190> put<00:03:46.280> them<00:03:46.340> up<00:03:46.489> a

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
the vol 3 3 i'm going to put them up a

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.390 
the vol 3 3 i'm going to put them up a
little<00:03:46.610> bit<00:03:46.880> less<00:03:47.030> at<00:03:47.239> 4.7<00:03:48.200> k<00:03:48.380> i<00:03:48.590> believe<00:03:48.980> so

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
little bit less at 4.7 k i believe so

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.640 
little bit less at 4.7 k i believe so
I'm<00:03:49.760> nice<00:03:50.090> profile<00:03:50.420> them<00:03:50.570> to<00:03:50.720> if<00:03:50.810> they<00:03:50.930> do<00:03:50.989> so<00:03:51.410> I
