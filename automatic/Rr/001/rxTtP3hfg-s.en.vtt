00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.200
 and with friends as they have been I am 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.850
 ryder here bringing them a glitch or trick 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.529
 as you want to call it is very 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:19.330
 good and you can see here is my name and 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.610
 Well, what he wants to show you is that 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.220
 these blocks can not be broken yet 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.550
 so be creative I put a pick or 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.980
 whatever it is and do not break do not break 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.230
 with nothing and that is the click that 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.110
 today I bring the truth is very easy to 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.180
 do but the only thing that has is that 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.489
 It can only be done with syriana and 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.829
 it can also only be done in 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.829
 edges of the map that is how you can see 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.570
 I'm on one of the edges of the map only 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.039
 It can be done in any of the 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.499
 edges because right now they will see the reason 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.499
 well if we put for example I'm going to 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:58.390
 put me here a block of land 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:01.100
 I will also need a bucket of water and 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.659
 lava bucket 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.030
 good if we put a block here here 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.159
 we can not put more here is the already the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.320
 end of everything 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.659
 and now they will see if I put water 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.600
 I'll take this knife from here 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.450
 I put water over here 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.659
 is going to be heading towards the end of the world 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.820
 and as you can see is one more block or 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.640
 be the water goes to a block more than 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.710
 normal can not see until here they arrive 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.270
 normally the blocks that we can 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.830
 break and until here comes the water passes 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.860
 up here and here you can not put anything 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.530
 but if we put lava in the last 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.600
 block if you can put it or if it is 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.409
 can form obsidian and we can already 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.770
 remove here we can continue to put 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.770
 more water 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.640
 and so 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.930
 but we can not break that because of what 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.880
 is outside the limit where we can 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.110
 break the blocks and where not as 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.380
 can see here you can no longer break 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.229
 nothing and it is the trick as such 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.480
 see is very simple and everything but this 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.440
 it can serve a lot to give it or 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.060
 I do not know how to affirm our maps or 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.940
 whether we create a map and we want it 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.730
 share we can put our signature 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.099
 in the world so nobody can break this 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.700
 and nobody can take our 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.489
 rights 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.799
 well I say I do not know I do not know what they think 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.900
 you guys but I hope you have them 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.780
 liked the trick the truth is very 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.819
 interesting so you can do it like 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.519
 can see and has taken a long time doing 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.590
 those letters the truth is a bit 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.830
 difficult for when you have to do them 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.200
 for example 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.200
 where I was I think it was a 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:57.110
 I think it was here I got confused 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.970
 as you can see for example if I want 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.960
 put a letter 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.330
 and I have to start from here 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.500
 I would have to put blocks first 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.750
 well in this way to put to be able 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.610
 put a block of obsidian in the air 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.160
 then what they would have to do 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.350
 you mean assuming that this side 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.880
 is here I would have to put the water 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.350
 first here in a block and then lava 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.530
 well in that way 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.480
 in this way but on the opposite side if 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.980
 no you will not be able to do the letter 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.620
 well this is for some letters that 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.510
 they are a bit difficult to do but 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.690
 Well I hope you liked this 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.820
 tricky the truth is interesting and 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.440
 nothing like if they liked it 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.440
 I am ryder and until next time
