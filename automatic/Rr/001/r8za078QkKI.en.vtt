00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.440 

don't<00:01:23.549> know<00:01:23.640> I'll<00:01:24.479> find<00:01:24.840> something<00:01:26.060> I'll<00:01:27.060> find

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
something to do with this but I probably

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.600 
something to do with this but I probably
reduce<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.290> bright<00:01:31.470> tonight<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.220> I'll<00:01:32.400> make

reduce the bright tonight and I'll make
it<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.790> little<00:01:32.909> bit<00:01:33.090> bigger<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.720> side

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
it a little bit bigger on this side

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.730 
it a little bit bigger on this side
because<00:01:36.150> right<00:01:36.450> now<00:01:36.479> it's<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:36.990> small<00:01:37.710> I

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
because right now it's like small I

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.890 
because right now it's like small I
think<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:38.280> like<00:01:38.430> super<00:01:38.790> big<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.270> I'm<00:01:39.479> office
