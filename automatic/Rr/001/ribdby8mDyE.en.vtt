00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
and for the first time ever we've

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.560 
and for the first time ever we've

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
to achieve a design this then we had to

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.549

inside<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.150> phone<00:02:26.360> very<00:02:26.840> carefully<00:02:27.440> we've

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
inside the phone very carefully we've

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.339 
inside the phone very carefully we've
created<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.760> new<00:02:28.790> much<00:02:29.420> smaller<00:02:29.870> lightning

connector<00:02:30.800> it's<00:02:31.520> all<00:02:31.790> digital<00:02:32.030> so<00:02:32.690> it's

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
connector it's all digital so it's

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.530 
connector it's all digital so it's
designed<00:02:33.319> for<00:02:33.500> today's<00:02:33.709> uses<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.640> we<00:02:35.300> made<00:02:35.510> it

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
designed for today's uses and we made it

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.060 
designed for today's uses and we made it
reversible<00:02:36.260> so<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:36.770> fits<00:02:37.040> either<00:02:37.250> way

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070
