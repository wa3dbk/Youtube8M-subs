00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:11.890
 Yes I introduce this time here trust Fire 8 flash light t 6 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.890
 It is model of car 5 mode equipped with LED 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:20.940
 We compare at about 1000 yen that is sold at this mass retailer made by Panasonic 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.830
 It is led light 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.830
 I would like to do a little irradiation experiment 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.289
 At first it is general like 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.289
 It is this kind of feeling 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.350
 About 2 meters in diameter 2 m 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.530
 I agree 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.530
 Emmer It's a dim or illuminated place 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.260
 Followed by 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.910
 this 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.600
 If you do not thread hula trust fire resistance 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.600
 I think that want to go 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.350
 It is this difference 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:07.080
 I think that you can understand that it is completely different with the Guang Ling range 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.080
 If this is not common here 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.680
 This is the difference 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:18.310
 A mode is here and it is mode switching 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:24.370
 It is possible to switch only the mode by half pressing 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:26.930
 Press the button on the butt and press again in middle mode and boss and low mode 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.980
 Press further to flash 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:35.580
 And sos mode is this mode 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:39.870
 Will return to the strike flash high mode again 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.030
 As an excellent point of cat models, for example, low mode 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.040
 To 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.420
 Turn off 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:51.520
 It will turn on again after a few seconds 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.670
 Entero-brain mode starts with this one, and this mode also has benefits and features very much 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.229
 I This is a good usability 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.420
 If you always use high mode or low mode main 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:06.220
 Well that win and many times 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:10.720
 I will think whether to use without permission is good because there is no need to mode switching 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.590
 So there is a wall ahead about it a little 10 meters is the next would like to be referred there 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.710
 think 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.710
 First, in general, try to light in this light 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.060
 It is this kind of feeling 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.360
 Somehow with the naked eye 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:34.020
 I know that the light is standing , but what about the camera 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.020
 I would like to continue irradiating with 8 flash lights 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.969
 It is this difference 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:49.540
 Distance of demotion as is further away and brightness that are very distinctive you can see 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.540
 I think I can get 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:11.990
 I want to finish the explanation with the above, it is a light at the very end, so it is a direct eye 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.990
 Thank you so please take care not to strike
