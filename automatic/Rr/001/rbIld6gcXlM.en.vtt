comparing<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.070> using<00:01:59.490> standard<00:01:59.969> tape

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
comparing this to using standard tape

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.670 
comparing this to using standard tape
this<00:02:00.509> stuff<00:02:00.750> looks<00:02:00.840> awesome<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:03.799> carefully

this stuff looks awesome so carefully
okay<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.979> looks<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.459> will<00:02:08.610> be

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
okay so it looks like that will be

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.530 
okay so it looks like that will be
perfectly<00:02:09.340> fitting<00:02:09.849> my<00:02:09.999> stock<00:02:10.329> here<00:02:12.540> putting

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
perfectly fitting my stock here putting

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.059 
perfectly fitting my stock here putting
it<00:02:13.629> up<00:02:13.719> high<00:02:13.900> enough<00:02:13.959> where<00:02:14.170> people<00:02:14.590> can<00:02:14.739> see

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
it up high enough where people can see

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.500 
it up high enough where people can see
it<00:02:15.159> and<00:02:16.290> also<00:02:17.310> start<00:02:18.310> from<00:02:18.489> one<00:02:18.639> side<00:02:18.909> and<00:02:19.269> move

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
it and also start from one side and move

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.059 
it and also start from one side and move
down<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:20.109> way<00:02:20.230> you<00:02:20.290> can<00:02:20.499> take<00:02:20.709> out<00:02:20.889> any

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
down that way you can take out any

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.740 
down that way you can take out any
bubbles<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.819> hopefully<00:02:22.829> you<00:02:23.829> know<00:02:24.180> not<00:02:25.180> crimp

so<00:03:44.600> there<00:03:45.410> is<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.860> finished<00:03:46.190> product<00:03:46.640> I<00:03:46.820> think

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
so there is the finished product I think

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.890 
so there is the finished product I think
it<00:03:47.720> looks<00:03:47.930> really<00:03:48.020> nice<00:03:48.410> um<00:03:49.360> just<00:03:50.360> going<00:03:50.720> over

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.550 
it looks really nice um just going over
it<00:03:51.080> though<00:03:52.030> just<00:03:53.030> showing<00:03:53.270> you<00:03:53.360> i<00:03:53.450> got<00:03:53.690> small

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
it though just showing you i got small

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.250 
it though just showing you i got small
very<00:03:54.920> very<00:03:55.460> small<00:03:55.790> specks<00:03:56.240> like<00:03:56.540> right<00:03:57.050> here

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
very very small specks like right here

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.700 
very very small specks like right here
under<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.590> tea<00:03:57.830> um<00:03:58.990> most<00:03:59.990> of<00:04:00.170> the<00:04:00.260> specs<00:04:00.560> are

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
under the tea um most of the specs are

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.230 
under the tea um most of the specs are
actually<00:04:01.040> on<00:04:01.190> the<00:04:01.310> bottom<00:04:01.610> side<00:04:01.820> so<00:04:02.090> that

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
actually on the bottom side so that

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.610 
actually on the bottom side so that
could<00:04:02.420> have<00:04:02.510> been<00:04:02.570> my<00:04:02.750> air<00:04:02.960> that<00:04:03.230> could<00:04:03.380> just

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
could have been my air that could just

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.220 
could have been my air that could just
be<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.920> material<00:04:04.070> but<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.090> fact<00:04:05.300> that<00:04:05.540> you

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
be the material but the fact that you

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.860 
be the material but the fact that you
know<00:04:06.520> getting<00:04:07.520> or<00:04:07.790> ordering<00:04:08.120> a<00:04:08.330> stencil<00:04:08.750> for

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
know getting or ordering a stencil for

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.620 
know getting or ordering a stencil for
five<00:04:09.080> dollars<00:04:09.590> that<00:04:10.400> literally<00:04:11.030> takes<00:04:11.330> about

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
five dollars that literally takes about

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.630 
five dollars that literally takes about
three<00:04:12.380> hours<00:04:12.410> of<00:04:13.370> this<00:04:13.700> process<00:04:14.030> out<00:04:15.489> takes<00:04:16.489> a

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
three hours of this process out takes a

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.060 
three hours of this process out takes a
total<00:04:17.090> of<00:04:17.180> ten<00:04:17.390> minutes<00:04:17.780> to<00:04:18.080> put<00:04:18.680> this<00:04:18.799> on<00:04:19.010> the

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
total of ten minutes to put this on the

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.210 
total of ten minutes to put this on the
stock<00:04:19.370> properly<00:04:20.000> tape<00:04:20.690> it<00:04:20.870> up<00:04:21.020> paint<00:04:21.860> it<00:04:22.040> I

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
stock properly tape it up paint it I

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.890 
stock properly tape it up paint it I
don't<00:04:22.790> count<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.210> time<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.510> takes<00:04:23.600> for<00:04:23.810> the

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
don't count the time it takes for the

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.750 
don't count the time it takes for the
paint<00:04:24.110> to<00:04:24.200> dry<00:04:24.290> come<00:04:24.890> back<00:04:25.100> take<00:04:25.400> everything

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
paint to dry come back take everything

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.230 
paint to dry come back take everything
off<00:04:25.880> so<00:04:26.570> using<00:04:27.410> a<00:04:27.770> premade<00:04:28.250> stencil<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:29.000> think

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
off so using a premade stencil I think

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.880 
off so using a premade stencil I think
in<00:04:29.300> my<00:04:29.420> mind<00:04:29.450> is<00:04:29.870> a<00:04:29.930> lot<00:04:30.320> better<00:04:30.530> than<00:04:30.770> making

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
in my mind is a lot better than making

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.640 
in my mind is a lot better than making
your<00:04:31.220> own<00:04:31.330> because<00:04:32.330> you<00:04:32.810> know<00:04:32.930> you<00:04:33.260> can't<00:04:33.530> have

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
your own because you know you can't have

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.770 
your own because you know you can't have
better<00:04:33.830> penmanship<00:04:34.130> than<00:04:34.730> from<00:04:35.030> you<00:04:35.600> know<00:04:35.750> a

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
better penmanship than from you know a

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.800 
better penmanship than from you know a
typed<00:04:36.440> up<00:04:37.270> lettering<00:04:38.270> so<00:04:39.010> with<00:04:40.010> that<00:04:40.130> said<00:04:40.430> to
