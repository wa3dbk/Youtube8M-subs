00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.439
 d 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.719
 the program for next year is 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:12.300
 enormous the plan is to improve immersion and 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.620
 the connection to the game basically what 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.389
 We want to continue improving the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.150
 graphics of the game something that we have 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.890
 started with version 8.0 where 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.279
 we introduced improvements in physics and 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.279
 graphics 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:32.150
 the work on this side will continue 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.520
 we want to bring more expressions 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.930
 elements like the removable turret and 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.190
 some parts of the tank are 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.010
 will come off with the damage 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.079
 the sac-d of taksim somersault good 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.969
 we are working the physical and the 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.440
 game mechanics and introducing more 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.420
 immersive elements such as 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.970
 explosions and the sound effects of 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.540
 environment 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:01:02.300
 even without machismo explosion 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.300
 sound effect of your rondin elements 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.369
 obviously in version 8.10 we have 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.979
 the Japanese tanks that are about 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.049
 to go out and personally I'm anxious 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.509
 for playing with those tanks especially 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.189
 those in workshop 10 those tanks are more 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.030
 mobile phones compared to those of other 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.159
 nations 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.110
 its fire rate is higher and the angle of 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.820
 inclination is better so if you want 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.130
 faster tanks with higher cadence 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.640
 of shooting but less damage you should 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.640
 play these 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.579
 fast freight 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.579
 from that jump in fact it's 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.500
 what players need to know 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.440
 about this project is that it is not a 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.820
 copy of war of times on consoles 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.290
 We have 1 studios in chicago working 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.430
 in the game and what they are doing is 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.170
 make sure it offers a 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.260
 authentic console experience 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.480
 using the same tools 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.950
 we have the same supply tanks in a 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.630
 historical battlefield 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.860
 but the experience of the players 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.870
 it will be different 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.160
 It will be a console game with effects 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.160
 visuals and better gameplay 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.380
 graphic essex 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.070
 time 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.560
 and we work a lot with the community and 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.969
 we handle many different elements and 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.450
 Spanish players have a lot 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:28.450
 presence 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.620
 they like to play as a team recently 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.690
 we finished our second campaign very 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.159
 focused on high level content and 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.690
 is very focused on group combat 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.690
 so I would recommend you to try it 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.580
