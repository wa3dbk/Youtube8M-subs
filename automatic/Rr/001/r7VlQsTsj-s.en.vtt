00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.219
 in the daily fix flash of July 15, 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.960
 2015 we are not talking about the new duke nukem 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:12.059
 but yes that kratos has come to 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.100
 playstation 4 like other heroes of this 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.780
 generation with a revamped version of 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.580
 a previous game but the curious thing about 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.680
 In this case, they decided on 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.269
 the third delivery with a lot have given yes 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.490
 but with some scenes really 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:25.109
 spectacular that it seems that the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.539
 effort to raise the resolution and 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.640
 reach 60 images per second not 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.919
 Surprisingly, we will have to wait for the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.290
 real release to the next god of war 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.970
 for the new generation to see what 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.850
 can do the god of war after 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.740
 to give everything on playstation3 a few 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.630
 hours for the end of your campaign 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.550
 what starter from the team of shenmue 3 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.410
 they have published a small gift video 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.850
 it is a detail for the fans 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.490
 where we see the lake of the fireflies 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.650
 a destination to which I laugh and have new 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.970
 it took a long time to arrive but that is a 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.160
 symbol for the followers of the 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.900
 franchise that yes from the team of 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.000
 development warns that it's just a video 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.740
 that the final game will be very different and 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.540
 that we should not take it as an example 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.150
 of the game rather a little detail for 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.710
 keep awake the flame hey there will be 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.840
 who does not know what we're talking about when 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.710
 we refer to the and katana and it's fine 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.659
 forget some 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.070
 but come a little respect for it 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.500
 a rosemary that looks more and more like 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.150
 our grandmothers that does not stop being 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.070
 a whole example of what should not be 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.140
 do with a project dilate it in the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.509
 time to add many things outside of 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.880
 planning period be anchored in the 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.350
 gone with the specifications or abuse 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.600
 of how important one is in the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.490
 world to talk about your game that 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.470
 is what we have come to and if all this 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.259
 it also happens to tomonobu itagaki with 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.940
 I say start a game that mixes the blouse 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.220
 of the ninja gaiden the shots in 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.869
 first person and in third action and what 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.149
 that seems to be a decide intelligence 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.440
 artificial book or that's what we 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.649
 account to jose manuel bringas in the 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.030
 advance in ig in Spain 'our web 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.259
 it seems that in deep silver they have a 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.970
 vision different from jager's 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.800
 dÃ©veloppement regarding dead island 2 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.090
 the continuation of the game of zombies 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.979
 is back in limbo because to 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.420
 through an official statement we 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.320
 we learned that jagger is no longer 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.420
 development charge 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.850
 let's go after an incredible video 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.840
 and some demos for the press something 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.519
 it should not go well 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.019
 the Germans go out and the producer 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.030
 leave waiting for news while 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.160
 both gives the light of the creators of 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.900
 the island promises more content and 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.070
 changes for after summer you think that 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.520
 the deep silver had to have 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.620
 left 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.460
 the original equipment or it also smells like 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.460
 the summer signing
