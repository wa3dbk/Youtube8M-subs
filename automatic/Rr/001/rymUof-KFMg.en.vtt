00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
he wasn't the one he wasn't a chosen one

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.359 
he wasn't the one he wasn't a chosen one
who<00:01:38.670> would<00:01:39.229> shake<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.259> world<00:01:40.560> from<00:01:40.829> its<00:01:41.070> root

he just was able to feel things to

he just was able to feel things to

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
understand things and I believe that

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.500 
understand things and I believe that

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
that gold Roger left the one piece the

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.230 
that gold Roger left the one piece the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
treasure every pirate is looking for at

rough<00:02:40.200> tell<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.950> this<00:02:41.820> island<00:02:42.360> is<00:02:42.830> he<00:02:43.830> was<00:02:43.980> the

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
rough tell and this island is he was the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.310 
rough tell and this island is he was the
only<00:02:44.250> one<00:02:44.550> who<00:02:45.240> was<00:02:45.420> able<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.960> reach<00:02:46.170> that

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
only one who was able to reach that

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.010 
only one who was able to reach that
Island<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.920> think<00:02:47.520> that<00:02:47.700> not<00:02:48.240> even<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.510> Marines

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
Island I think that not even the Marines

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.290 
Island I think that not even the Marines
can<00:02:49.350> get<00:02:49.530> there<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:50.400> here's<00:02:50.700> my<00:02:50.760> theory<00:02:51.090> about

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
can get there so here's my theory about

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.220 
can get there so here's my theory about
this<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.990> say<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:53.100> everyone<00:02:53.910> who<00:02:54.450> carries<00:02:55.200> the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
this I say that everyone who carries the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.980 
this I say that everyone who carries the
welder<00:02:55.920> d<00:02:56.210> descent<00:02:57.210> from<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.690> ancient

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
welder d descent from that ancient

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.560 
welder d descent from that ancient
kingdom<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.710> was<00:02:58.980> there<00:02:59.220> before<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.270> black

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
kingdom that was there before the black

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.680 
kingdom that was there before the black
century<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.860> perhaps<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.460> D<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.360> first

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
century and perhaps the D is the first

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.410 
century and perhaps the D is the first
letter<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.080> that<00:03:04.410> kingdom's<00:03:04.980> name<00:03:05.250> then<00:03:05.910> one

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
letter of that kingdom's name then one

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.450 
letter of that kingdom's name then one
day<00:03:06.660> there<00:03:06.960> was<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.140> war<00:03:07.470> between<00:03:07.800> that<00:03:08.190> ancient

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
day there was a war between that ancient

kingdom and that unknown force who later

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.240 
kingdom and that unknown force who later
became<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.570> world<00:03:12.810> government<00:03:13.350> even<00:03:14.100> though

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
became the world government even though

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.490 
became the world government even though
that<00:03:14.430> ancient<00:03:14.730> kingdom<00:03:15.300> loss<00:03:15.570> was

that ancient kingdom loss was

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.430 
that ancient kingdom loss was
exterminated<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.640> erased<00:03:18.510> from<00:03:18.630> history<00:03:18.930> by

the world government saw the descendants
survived<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.220> believe<00:03:23.280> those<00:03:23.730> survivors

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
reopening live and also was able to

discover the history behind the blank

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.610 
discover the history behind the blank
century<00:03:36.080> therefore<00:03:37.080> he<00:03:37.380> must<00:03:37.410> have

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
century therefore he must have

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.380 
century therefore he must have
discovered<00:03:38.040> his<00:03:38.340> lineage<00:03:38.730> from<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:39.120> ancient

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
discovered his lineage from that ancient

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.070 
discovered his lineage from that ancient
kingdom<00:03:40.020> and<00:03:40.680> he<00:03:41.550> hid<00:03:41.880> one<00:03:42.360> piece<00:03:42.630> in<00:03:42.660> rough

tell the most inaccessible place on

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.010 
tell the most inaccessible place on
earth<00:03:46.440> so<00:03:47.160> therefore<00:03:47.400> I'm<00:03:47.880> thinking<00:03:48.510> that<00:03:48.630> one

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
earth so therefore I'm thinking that one

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.620 
earth so therefore I'm thinking that one
piece<00:03:49.350> is<00:03:49.590> all<00:03:49.860> related<00:03:50.070> to<00:03:50.489> death<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:50.970> of

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
piece is all related to death and of

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.720 
piece is all related to death and of
course<00:03:51.660> I<00:03:52.170> do<00:03:52.230> believe<00:03:52.620> that<00:03:52.770> one<00:03:53.040> pieces<00:03:53.520> is

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
course I do believe that one pieces is

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.660 
course I do believe that one pieces is
far<00:03:54.540> more<00:03:54.750> than<00:03:54.930> just<00:03:55.110> a<00:03:55.230> treasure<00:03:55.590> it's<00:03:55.920> an

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
far more than just a treasure it's an

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.630 
far more than just a treasure it's an
element<00:03:57.360> that<00:03:57.570> can<00:03:58.050> spark<00:03:58.530> a<00:03:58.680> revolution<00:03:58.830> and

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
element that can spark a revolution and

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.180 
element that can spark a revolution and
I<00:04:00.209> think<00:04:00.270> that<00:04:00.450> white<00:04:01.020> beer<00:04:01.350> was<00:04:01.560> well<00:04:01.860> test

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
I think that white beer was well test

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.970 
I think that white beer was well test
and<00:04:02.459> perhaps<00:04:02.820> dragon<00:04:03.720> roof<00:04:04.170> his<00:04:04.350> father<00:04:04.620> and

and perhaps dragon roof his father and

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.080 
and perhaps dragon roof his father and
also<00:04:05.520> a<00:04:05.730> carrier<00:04:06.270> of<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.570> world<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.989> tea<00:04:07.200> is

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
also a carrier of the world the tea is

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.479 
also a carrier of the world the tea is
running<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.270> revolution<00:04:10.020> to<00:04:10.709> not<00:04:10.890> only<00:04:11.010> top

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
running the revolution to not only top

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.760 
running the revolution to not only top
all<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:11.880> world<00:04:12.090> government<00:04:12.630> but<00:04:13.440> perhaps

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
all the world government but perhaps

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.030 
all the world government but perhaps
also<00:04:14.190> to<00:04:14.550> stop<00:04:15.420> them<00:04:15.750> from<00:04:16.350> getting<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.830> one

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
also to stop them from getting to one

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.300 
also to stop them from getting to one
