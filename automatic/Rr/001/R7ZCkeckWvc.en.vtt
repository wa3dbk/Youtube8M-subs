00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.720
 today we will look at this owl 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.589
 Grand Duke 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:13.589
 we have to make a complete assessment but 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.980
 order auscultated hans my gloves 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:15.629
 leather 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.990
 it is necessary that the employee of the association 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.100
 brian cox man finds him 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.770
 we can use it during the internships 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.810
 when he will be a little calmer their 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.980
 serves can lacerate the arm you can 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.370
 watch us but you stay you just 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:35.610
 from behind agree for several 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:38.280
 weeks the cart away from the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.660
 door scares him last time 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.590
 that I saw he was still only a 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:47.030
 fire chicks and he was not resisting 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.030
 as much when we were trying to catch him 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.630
 I'm trying to calm him down a little bit okay 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.010
 be interesting to see how much he 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:01.880
 grew up in the space of four five 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.290
 weeks it's good a tea an adult 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:09.299
 alas all his feathers we will see if he 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:11.040
 let us listen to all birds of prey 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.540
 of the association make a complete assessment 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.080
 twice a year for hans 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.750
 it's a first it's not happy not 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.979
 at all a few months old in this fact 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.930
 already an imposing size 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.979
 once his growth is complete he will have 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.869
 a span of more than one meter 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.000
 fifty and serves perfectly to 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.799
 squeeze his claws look dangerous 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.630
 and he can catch a little doe 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.790
 located very impressive I have 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.900
 examine your buttocks you have to be very 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.640
 careful when auscultates to 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.260
 the hindquarters because they can 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.260
 expelling custom saddles 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.070
 yes I know it's badly polite it was 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.000
 easy part 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.860
 now I need a sample 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.900
 sanguine 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.400
 one should make him a blood it 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.280
 has never been so it may be 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:02.240
 stressful enough for him receding roof 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.240
 he will not surely appreciate my taste 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:14.160
 but ben say-so below the calm 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.660
 willow you do not want to look but I 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.830
 could not have planted or planted 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.150
 needles so I asked him to 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.709
 come but from where he comes to see a little he 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.350
 was scared and he was stressed he 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.330
 was trying to catch brian be careful 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.750
 he does not discover it they are not 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.670
 he sees 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:37.250
 we had to keep control of the 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.250
 situation not attention auxerre
