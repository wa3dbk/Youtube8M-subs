00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.349
 we have no serious others 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.420
 get to visit 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.920
 it is so that the players are now 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.049
 last were also operational 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.630
 operational are not operational 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:24.090
 David Abraham and Shipplock become the ones 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.410
 we refrain from further and therefore is 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.369
 it for us now so that we do not 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.779
 great on new injured 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.000
 what we have to bring back of course 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.710
 a little bit the decisions 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.180
 in terms of the game Bayern MÃ¼nchen 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.820
 a bit easier so easy 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.590
 always there just like last from the almost 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.450
 can get the most out of the two 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.920
 player because it's all good for me 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.149
 always important that we keep coming back for 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.320
 the next game is maximum 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.840
 to prepare 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.910
 totally focused stay tuned by play 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.219
 play and just try so many 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.350
 to make points as possible and what 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.340
 it comes out we believe we see 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.140
 we are on a good way one 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.949
 a carefree season to play that must 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.520
 one set 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.690
 have set the ultimate goal and whether it 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.000
 Maybe we could do it 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.729
 and there you will do everything 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.320
 that we succeed and continue because 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.520
 you do not just look the best of 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.610
 play it game has it easy for us 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.250
 well done in the last weeks 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:21.210
 That's a long hard way 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.610
 we have all been incredible 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.759
 have whole sporty 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.790
 management because the responsible everyone 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.500
 his part has contributed to the 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.479
 then robots could convince simply 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.180
 that he stays with us his contract 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.829
 just extend it for us 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.009
 planning was the new one is very very much 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.899
 is important and were therefore 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.670
 Interplay of all forces that was 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.450
 very nice 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.909
 he is already a good one 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.710
 profi became in time the theme of 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.380
 Brazil came here it was 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.520
 already a rocky path for him 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.090
 but he just has the things 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.700
 are important to in the bundesliga 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.439
 to be able to exist 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.820
 and also its quality 100% 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.530
 play is the basic requirement 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.509
 the physical and 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.420
 very intense on his body 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.660
 also worked in the time now 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.890
 since we are here now and now 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:24.490
 to the athletic coach has just one 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.530
 Great base created by almost everyone 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.090
 play our strong player to be 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.500
 can 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.580
 but above all things also unbelievable 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.530
 to be robust 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.450
 you're not pushing away anymore that was 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.030
 yes in the past often a problem that one 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.870
 narrow situations easily from the ball 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.940
 was separate 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.250
 now it is like that he acts like that 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.739
 a really stable snake on the ball 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.540
 and then go and turn around 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.220
 adversary and you can not 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.170
 grab and that's the one 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.060
 extraordinary ability of one 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.300
 technically so strong players then 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.760
 then bring this dynamic and what 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.580
 simply the key is that me 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.410
 all are 60 70 percent at 60 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.569
 But the key to this 40 percent 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.010
 in the game against the ball that make him 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.050
 actually so strong that he just 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.850
 many balls conquered for us and 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.010
 actually his own goal chance 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.720
 yourself prepared by the by the 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.030
 ball conquest or by the situation 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.769
 which then conjure the team 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.410
 there is a superspieler easy 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.959
 class comes to overpayment 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.060
 so double doubling or yourself 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.680
 The pressing trigger a good thing about it 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.230
 eye and a good feeling for that 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.959
 analyzing bavaria is natural 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.060
 brutal he has an incredible bavaria 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.650
 quality even if they always 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.930
 Nobody wants to hear but Bayern had 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.859
 the best qualities single play 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.440
 believe it ever in the 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.090
 Vereinslandschaft was just there 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.519
 Stop at Bayern Five fail or 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.720
 does not matter who runs up you think 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.310
 the mono i have a great one 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.810
 Team and an actor from good 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.420
 that he could still be out there now 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.269
 Bayern also makes playing easy 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.959
 quite a few mistakes bavaria the ball 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.370
 take away is an art to give their 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.920
 just do not give that 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.890
 make dirk a simple mistake too 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.019
 if super in under pressure situations 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.670
 the solutions stay calm and have 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.390
 of course, now self-confidence 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.799
 under the roof 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.350
 Of course, you also notice that in 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.910
 unbelievably many situations and then 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.830
 Still have someone behind you 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.900
 he just stands there that way 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.620
 not to make manuel new 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.930
 to forget 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.360
 Bayern often also has situations in the game 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.330
 where it is tight but manuel new is just 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.280
 a full behind the gate inside and the 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.889
 then ensures that even bavaria 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.780
 Finally, close again 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.090
 play games or pretend games with 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.780
 a gate also certainly differed 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.780
 home drives
