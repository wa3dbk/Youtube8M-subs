00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 how about friends like they are assassin soul 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.569
 in another video tutorial for you 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.880
 hoping that you like this time the video 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.700
 tutorial that I bring you is how we can 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.059
 tame or train what are the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.420
 felines ocelots these new characters 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.280
 of the 12th update 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.200
 let's get one out 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.560
 and I will say several aspects 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.200
 important the wild ocelots like 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.470
 we see they have brown spots and apart 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.330
 They are yellow with orange the 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.470
 we can find in what is the new 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:41.980
 jungle biome and its surroundings 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.950
 so to tame it is very very 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.230
 easy the only thing we need is to take out 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.809
 a raw fish 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.579
 get a little closer and what is going to 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.220
 happen is that the ocelot is going to 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.460
 to be fixed is going to stay low 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.280
 staring and he alone is going to 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.860
 zoom in and then it will go down what it is 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.460
 its tail and well we can feed it 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.790
 I have not moved anything the ocelot alone 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.500
 he looked and already approached let's see a 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.479
 Sorry, because I moved it very 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.479
 should be sharply 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.010
 and there comes 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.690
 once your tail goes down we can already 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.550
 give the raw fish is one is at 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.670
 first with the first raw fish that 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.820
 we will no longer domestic but we 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.040
 they can spend up to ten so much 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.830
 eye 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.750
 we are going to 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.750
 to take out what is raw fish 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.310
 he alone has to approach this one 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:57.340
 12 there is another black one there are 3 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.760
 colors do not matter which color 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.560
 the difference between the 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.950
 this is going to see if we can get other 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.950
 colors 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.630
 is the black is the orange and is the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.150
 white with gray 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.620
 there's the orange, let's see if 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.620
 we can take out the one I tell them 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.840
 the one I tell you is the gray one with this 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.840
 good does not matter 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.530
 and in order to reproduce them I need 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.770
 raise them remember that to feed 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.860
 or sit down to what is your voice corn not 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.350
 you must have nothing in this case I want 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.150
 join two of the same species that would be 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.270
 this orange 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.370
 and this orange we are going to give him a fish 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.900
 raw and you will leave hearts now 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.060
 only missing that your partner also 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.120
 demos 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.459
 and as you can see a line is coming out every 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.530
 tourist that is that we can also 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:05.630
 sit 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.910
 and then let's go to lay these and 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.640
 let's make the two reproduce 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.380
 blacks remember we raise them we give them 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.680
 one borrowed each and they're going to 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.680
 play 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.920
 if they choose two of the same color 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.049
 that means that obviously it's going to 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.659
 leave the same color but if I had 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.870
 picked this orange and this black 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:34.109
 it's almost almost blown up and the 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.250
 color but then that does not matter what to see 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.069
 if we go with the most important function 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.040
 that have the ocelots we go to the 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.079
 test of fire that follow me 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.060
 one of the functions that I really have not 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:50.549
 seen and they say they do is that they attack 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.920
 I kill the chickens the truth 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.049
 I have seen and it has not touched me to see if 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.420
 someone can deny me but the 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.510
 most important function and that reaches us 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.730
 interesting is that these felines 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:06.450
 they scare what are the creepers maps 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.849
 that's how these cute kittens scare 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.620
 the big thousands creepers and right now 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:14.069
 let's do the fire test the 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.949
 test master so I'm going to take out a cri 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:20.600
 pÃ©rez in this corner in this writing a 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:24.320
 crime against the felines on that corner 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:27.190
 and I'm going to hit him a good blow 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.190
 Has to follow 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.690
 and today they'll see you how the fucked up 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.690
 come back he does not want to see the cats 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.879
 follow me not that very brave 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:46.160
 in how scared he gives me a lot of laughter 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.260
 because there are in conformity wrote for 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.660
 you are in the darkness that nothing else 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.920
 they come to explode and here they look 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.750
 fear 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.090
 and then we go to another final test so 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.750
 this more than anything is how we can 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.910
 cool what ocelots are where the 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.090
 we can find that as I said close 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.750
 of what is the new biome of the jungle 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.420
 or in the jungle and finally the skill 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.950
 important that it has to scare what 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.900
 are the writings 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.570
 so let this final test 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.540
 see how it goes and then nothing 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:26.960
 this would be all in our tutorial with 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.670
 our ocelots so remember I am 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.130
 hike without soul I send you many greetings 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.130
 take care and see you in the next video 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.190
 I recommend you domestic in many 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:42.850
 cats and put them outside your house 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.850
 go bye
