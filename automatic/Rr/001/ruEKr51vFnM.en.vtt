00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.620

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.090
 remember to always disinfect very well 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.100
 the vegetables when you are going to use them 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:45.140
 they are 4 red tomatoes I have an onion 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.780
 but we're just going to use a 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.750
 piece of onion a green chile if 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.450
 you like spicy food 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.000
 occupy for this preparation in chile in 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.280

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.860
 well, he only puts in chile like this 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.670
 whole to fry in the meat we're going to 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.050
 use to season the meat a garlic 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.570
 freshly ground pepper 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.940
 let's use salt and a little trickle 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.300
 small vinegar and olive oil 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.900
 let's start first seasoning 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.900
 the meat 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.970
 and here I am scratching the garlic remember that 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.380
 the lake must be finely cast 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.180
 grated and this we will integrate very well 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.909
 all the ingredients that we put 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.210
 here and also always remember that 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.119
 when I grab meat wash my hands 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.210
 so that it is not so to avoid 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.369
 some diseases whenever 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.920
 we grab meat we wash our hands 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.920
 we put the pepper and we're going to put 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.250
 the vinegar only a few gums of 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.130
 vinegar to remove a bit of chotis 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:58.800
 of the pork we are going to integrate 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.800
 all very well and we will continue 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.700
 now let's chop very well zucchini 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.770
 we are going to remove this the two parties 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.640
 here we are going to remove it from here 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:18.090
 and we are going to chop it finely in pictures 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.970
 small so it does not go well the 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.360
 very large pictures and good, well, this 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.510
 saucer come out very delicious and we're going 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.400
 I 'm going to show you the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.400
 bits so small 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.569
 and we are going to chop clear 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.860
 and here I am finishing applying to the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.530
 zucchini very finally also a 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.270
 recommendation that I want to make you about 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.730
 the zucchini good you 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.260
 find them must have a lot 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.380
 beware that they have to 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.200
 Zucchini look a green like this 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.330
 on and also a very good option 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.630
 is to try this part of here if you 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.670
 feel that tastes bitter better or use 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.830
 the zucchini because it can be bitter 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.130
 all the preparation since some 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.420
 Zucchini come a bit bitter sas 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.310
 Now let's move on to chop the onion 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.000
 well here I already have the zucchini 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.160
 very finely chopped and I also have 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.040
 very finely chopped the onion in 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.290
 very tiny squares so that 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.630
 be good so do not feel the 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.550
 pieces of onion, chopped onion 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.930
 very finely now let's chop the 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.930
 tomato 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.500
 and here I have a pot and I have it 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.900
 here in the fire we are going to put oil 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.870
 Olive one option if you do not want 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.299
 for health reasons fry the meat 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.090
 Well, you can boil it and then 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:52.879
 frying the onion only 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.920
 zucchini tomato and chili together 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:57.500
 and add the meat but good then I 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.590
 in my case I do it with meat 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.500
 fried because it gives a much better flavor 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.569
 to this preparation we are going to let the 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.470
 oil gets very hot and we're going to 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.470
 add the meat 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.660
 here the meat released its own juice and there 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.330
 is going to cook right there in this 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.030
 little game is going to cook and we're going 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.430
 to leave later when the juice is 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.910
 start to reduce is going to start 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:46.419
 fry is very good meat we are going to 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.970
 follow side and side only one 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.620
 lightly passed so that the meat is not left 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.530
 very dry from there we are going to start 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.330
 add the other ingredients first 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.569

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.580
 zucchini and the last tomato 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:02.860
 since he has been giving the meat to him 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.259
 let's put all the onion and lime 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.449

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:10.059

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:14.139
 Zucchini go loose their flavor 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:16.929
 together with the meat remember to be 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.969
 moving constantly so that he leaves 

00:05:16.929 --> 00:05:21.610
