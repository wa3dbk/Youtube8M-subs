00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.100 

align<00:05:22.450> blades<00:05:22.830> look<00:05:23.830> at<00:05:23.950> that<00:05:24.600> one<00:05:25.600> of<00:05:25.690> the<00:05:25.750> two

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
align blades look at that one of the two

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.480 
align blades look at that one of the two
comes<00:05:26.440> in<00:05:26.560> there<00:05:26.710> it<00:05:26.800> comes<00:05:26.980> without<00:05:27.220> spare

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
one yeah you have this carbon and always

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.210 
one yeah you have this carbon and always
just<00:05:31.030> timing<00:05:34.470> and<00:05:35.470> then<00:05:35.650> open<00:05:35.920> this<00:05:36.010> little

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
just timing and then open this little

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.830 
just timing and then open this little
box<00:05:36.520> where<00:05:36.820> he<00:05:36.850> sees<00:05:37.090> the<00:05:37.120> hole<00:05:37.660> the<00:05:37.810> other
