00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.840 

one<00:00:05.650> of<00:00:05.740> the<00:00:05.800> challenges<00:00:06.220> that<00:00:06.250> I<00:00:06.430> faced<00:00:06.700> when

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:06.850 
one of the challenges that I faced when

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.520 
one of the challenges that I faced when
I<00:00:06.940> first<00:00:07.150> started<00:00:07.450> writing<00:00:07.630> and<00:00:08.140> that<00:00:08.380> I<00:00:08.440> know

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.530 
I first started writing and that I know

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.140 
I first started writing and that I know
a<00:00:08.620> lot<00:00:08.800> of<00:00:08.860> other<00:00:09.040> amputees<00:00:09.370> face<00:00:09.790> when<00:00:10.030> they

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
a lot of other amputees face when they

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.520 
a lot of other amputees face when they
when<00:00:10.450> they<00:00:10.570> want<00:00:10.750> to<00:00:10.840> start<00:00:10.870> cycling<00:00:11.410> more

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530 
when they want to start cycling more

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.830 
when they want to start cycling more
seriously<00:00:11.980> is<00:00:12.700> that<00:00:12.910> you<00:00:13.030> you<00:00:13.330> want<00:00:13.480> to<00:00:13.600> use<00:00:13.690> a

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
seriously is that you you want to use a

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.120 
seriously is that you you want to use a
pedal<00:00:14.410> system<00:00:14.830> that<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:17.410> involves<00:00:17.890> cleats

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
pedal system that that involves cleats

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.380 
pedal system that that involves cleats
so<00:00:18.340> that<00:00:18.460> you're<00:00:18.550> actually<00:00:18.700> attached<00:00:19.180> to<00:00:19.300> the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
so that you're actually attached to the

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.790 
so that you're actually attached to the
pedals<00:00:19.720> and<00:00:19.840> you<00:00:19.960> can<00:00:20.110> generate<00:00:20.560> the<00:00:20.710> most

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
pedals and you can generate the most

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.370 
pedals and you can generate the most
power<00:00:21.100> however<00:00:22.030> that<00:00:22.360> creates<00:00:22.720> an<00:00:22.900> issue<00:00:23.020> with

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
power however that creates an issue with

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.490 
power however that creates an issue with
getting<00:00:24.100> out<00:00:24.220> of<00:00:24.369> the<00:00:24.460> cleats<00:00:24.760> which<00:00:25.630> actually

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
getting out of the cleats which actually

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.320 
getting out of the cleats which actually
even<00:00:26.710> able-bodied<00:00:27.190> cyclists<00:00:27.609> find<00:00:27.910> difficult

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
even able-bodied cyclists find difficult

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.660 
even able-bodied cyclists find difficult
at<00:00:28.449> times<00:00:28.480> but<00:00:29.320> it's<00:00:29.470> extremely<00:00:30.070> difficult<00:00:30.340> to

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
at times but it's extremely difficult to

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.899 
at times but it's extremely difficult to
rotate<00:00:31.510> the<00:00:31.660> heel<00:00:31.840> out<00:00:32.429> hard<00:00:33.429> enough<00:00:33.640> to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:33.909 
rotate the heel out hard enough to

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:36.299 
rotate the heel out hard enough to
disengage<00:00:34.719> from<00:00:34.809> the<00:00:34.960> pedal<00:00:35.319> something

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
disengage from the pedal something

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.930 
disengage from the pedal something
that's<00:00:36.460> super<00:00:36.609> easy<00:00:36.789> on<00:00:37.179> the<00:00:37.300> right-hand<00:00:37.690> side

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
that's super easy on the right-hand side

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.689 
that's super easy on the right-hand side
the<00:00:39.940> left<00:00:40.089> hand<00:00:40.329> side<00:00:40.539> is<00:00:41.370> far<00:00:42.370> more<00:00:42.550> difficult

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
the left hand side is far more difficult

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:45.539 
the left hand side is far more difficult
to<00:00:43.059> get<00:00:43.389> the<00:00:43.449> rotation<00:00:44.050> these<00:00:44.979> pedals<00:00:45.370> that<00:00:45.429> I

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:45.549 
to get the rotation these pedals that I

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:47.069 
to get the rotation these pedals that I
have<00:00:45.729> are<00:00:46.030> the<00:00:46.269> easiest<00:00:46.539> ones<00:00:46.629> I've<00:00:46.899> ever

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
have are the easiest ones I've ever

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.169 
have are the easiest ones I've ever
found<00:00:47.319> but<00:00:47.620> still<00:00:47.889> it's<00:00:48.039> it's<00:00:48.670> not<00:00:48.819> something

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:49.179 
found but still it's it's not something

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:50.910 
found but still it's it's not something
I<00:00:49.269> like<00:00:49.299> to<00:00:49.569> do<00:00:49.690> I<00:00:49.719> always<00:00:50.109> try<00:00:50.289> to<00:00:50.350> flip<00:00:50.710> out<00:00:50.889> on

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
I like to do I always try to flip out on

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.959 
I like to do I always try to flip out on
the<00:00:51.100> right<00:00:51.249> side<00:00:51.489> first

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
the right side first

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.129 
the right side first
ah<00:00:53.969> okay<00:00:54.969> well<00:00:55.179> I'll<00:00:55.359> talk<00:00:55.389> about<00:00:55.600> a<00:00:55.809> few<00:00:56.079> of

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:56.139 
ah okay well I'll talk about a few of

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:59.549 
ah okay well I'll talk about a few of
the<00:00:56.260> things<00:00:56.409> that<00:00:56.559> a<00:00:57.280> few<00:00:57.789> challenges<00:00:58.499> that<00:00:59.499> I

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
the things that a few challenges that I

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.959 
the things that a few challenges that I
faced<00:00:59.859> as<00:01:00.039> an<00:01:00.159> amputee<00:01:00.399> cycling<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:02.819> the<00:01:03.819> main

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
faced as an amputee cycling the the main

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.410 
faced as an amputee cycling the the main
the<00:01:04.330> main<00:01:04.449> thing<00:01:04.690> that<00:01:04.720> I<00:01:05.500> feel<00:01:06.400> causes<00:01:07.210> me<00:01:07.390> to

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
the main thing that I feel causes me to

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.630 
the main thing that I feel causes me to
lose<00:01:07.840> a<00:01:07.870> little<00:01:08.110> bit<00:01:08.200> of<00:01:08.290> power<00:01:08.550> when<00:01:09.550> I'm

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
lose a little bit of power when I'm

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.030 
lose a little bit of power when I'm
cycling<00:01:10.030> is<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.810> Flex<00:01:11.110> that<00:01:11.320> I<00:01:11.380> get<00:01:11.560> from<00:01:11.830> my

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
cycling is the Flex that I get from my

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.730 
cycling is the Flex that I get from my
modular<00:01:12.970> 3<00:01:13.300> my<00:01:13.720> flex<00:01:13.930> foot<00:01:14.080> modular<00:01:14.440> 3<00:01:14.620> which

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
modular 3 my flex foot modular 3 which

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.770 
modular 3 my flex foot modular 3 which
is<00:01:14.830> made<00:01:14.980> for<00:01:15.130> walking<00:01:15.580> it<00:01:16.300> has<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.450> little<00:01:16.600> bit

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
is made for walking it has a little bit

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.840 
is made for walking it has a little bit
too<00:01:16.900> much<00:01:17.020> flex<00:01:17.320> for<00:01:17.530> cycling<00:01:17.890> so<00:01:18.070> as<00:01:18.220> I<00:01:18.400> if<00:01:18.730> I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
too much flex for cycling so as I if I

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.690 
too much flex for cycling so as I if I
stand<00:01:19.120> up<00:01:19.270> out<00:01:19.420> of<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.630> pit<00:01:19.780> of<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.080> saddle<00:01:20.700> I

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
stand up out of the pit of the saddle I

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.260 
stand up out of the pit of the saddle I
feel<00:01:22.600> a<00:01:22.630> little<00:01:22.840> bit<00:01:23.050> of<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.230> bounce<00:01:23.410> or<00:01:23.830> if<00:01:24.070> I'm

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
feel a little bit of a bounce or if I'm

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.160 
feel a little bit of a bounce or if I'm
climbing<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.300> hill<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:25.750> putting<00:01:25.960> a<00:01:26.020> lot<00:01:26.110> of

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
climbing a hill and putting a lot of

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.380 
climbing a hill and putting a lot of
power<00:01:26.410> through<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.770> pedals<00:01:27.100> I'll<00:01:28.090> feel<00:01:28.360> a

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
power through the pedals I'll feel a

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.790 
power through the pedals I'll feel a
little<00:01:28.660> bit<00:01:28.810> of<00:01:28.930> a<00:01:28.990> flex<00:01:29.260> there<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:29.650> that's

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
little bit of a flex there and that's

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.600 
little bit of a flex there and that's
not<00:01:29.860> ideal<00:01:30.430> for<00:01:31.300> cycling<00:01:31.720> if<00:01:32.260> I<00:01:32.410> had<00:01:32.620> all<00:01:33.490> the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
not ideal for cycling if I had all the

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.740 
not ideal for cycling if I had all the
money<00:01:33.700> in<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:33.970> world<00:01:34.180> I<00:01:34.390> would<00:01:34.510> buy<00:01:34.630> another

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
money in the world I would buy another

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.220 
money in the world I would buy another
one<00:01:35.110> that<00:01:35.230> was<00:01:35.380> far<00:01:35.650> stiffer<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:37.450> would<00:01:38.020> not

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
one that was far stiffer it would not

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.650 
one that was far stiffer it would not
flex<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:39.130> therefore<00:01:39.610> all<00:01:39.790> of<00:01:39.820> 100%<00:01:40.480> of<00:01:40.570> my

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
flex and therefore all of 100% of my

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.700 
flex and therefore all of 100% of my
power<00:01:40.900> will<00:01:41.080> go<00:01:41.200> straight<00:01:41.350> through<00:01:41.440> to<00:01:41.680> the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
power will go straight through to the

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.590 
power will go straight through to the
pedals<00:01:44.310> another<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:45.880> another<00:01:46.360> interesting

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
pedals another and another interesting

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.980 
pedals another and another interesting
adaptation<00:01:47.409> that<00:01:47.730> my<00:01:48.730> process<00:01:48.970> has<00:01:49.330> made

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
adaptation that my process has made

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.070 
adaptation that my process has made
because<00:01:50.980> I<00:01:51.159> ride<00:01:51.430> my<00:01:51.580> bike<00:01:51.610> so<00:01:51.970> often<00:01:52.360> is<00:01:52.540> at

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
because I ride my bike so often is at

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.969 
because I ride my bike so often is at
the<00:01:53.200> back<00:01:53.409> he<00:01:54.340> rolled<00:01:54.640> rolled<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:55.870> I'm<00:01:56.770> not

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
the back he rolled rolled the I'm not

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.050 
the back he rolled rolled the I'm not
sure<00:01:57.040> what<00:01:57.250> you<00:01:57.340> call<00:01:57.460> this<00:01:57.640> but<00:01:57.760> he<00:01:57.850> rolled

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
sure what you call this but he rolled

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.810 
sure what you call this but he rolled
the<00:01:58.180> back<00:01:58.360> part<00:01:58.630> of<00:01:58.720> my<00:01:58.810> prosthesis<00:01:59.820> lower

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
the back part of my prosthesis lower

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.060 
the back part of my prosthesis lower
than<00:02:01.450> it<00:02:01.570> would<00:02:01.659> normally<00:02:01.690> be<00:02:02.110> if<00:02:02.440> I<00:02:02.560> only<00:02:02.860> used

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
than it would normally be if I only used

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.130 
than it would normally be if I only used
it<00:02:03.159> for<00:02:03.220> walking<00:02:03.760> and<00:02:04.270> that's<00:02:04.450> that<00:02:04.840> was<00:02:04.960> to

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
it for walking and that's that was to

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.380 
it for walking and that's that was to
allow<00:02:05.380> my

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
allow my

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.870 
allow my
my<00:02:07.200> pedal<00:02:07.470> stroke<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.220> go<00:02:08.340> more<00:02:08.520> smoothly

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
my pedal stroke to to go more smoothly

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.390 
my pedal stroke to to go more smoothly
so<00:02:09.630> as<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.930> as<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.619> get<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.009> point<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
so as I as I get to this point in the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.150 
so as I as I get to this point in the
pedal<00:02:11.640> stroke<00:02:11.850> it<00:02:11.970> doesn't<00:02:12.240> bind<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:13.160> that

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
pedal stroke it doesn't bind and that

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.410 
pedal stroke it doesn't bind and that
makes<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.460> far<00:02:14.670> more<00:02:14.820> comfortable<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.390> can

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
makes it far more comfortable and I can

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.170 
makes it far more comfortable and I can
ride<00:02:15.720> longer<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.770> more<00:02:16.950> effectively<00:02:17.520> because

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
ride longer and more effectively because

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.230 
ride longer and more effectively because
he<00:02:18.420> did<00:02:18.570> that<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.960> have<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.880> know<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.000> have<00:02:21.210> a

he did that I have a you know I have a

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.450 
he did that I have a you know I have a
good<00:02:21.480> push<00:02:21.720> are<00:02:22.440> pretty<00:02:22.770> decent<00:02:23.130> pull<00:02:23.310> but

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
good push are pretty decent pull but

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.160 
good push are pretty decent pull but
across<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.970> top<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.450> along<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.990> bottom

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
across the top and along the bottom

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.810 
across the top and along the bottom
because<00:02:26.040> you're<00:02:26.250> trying<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.520> you're<00:02:26.640> supposed

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
make even circles a lot of people just

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.110 
make even circles a lot of people just
mash<00:02:31.320> down<00:02:31.640> but<00:02:32.640> you're<00:02:32.730> just<00:02:32.850> supposed<00:02:32.910> to

mash down but you're just supposed to
make<00:02:33.270> even<00:02:33.540> circles<00:02:33.960> and<00:02:35.090> it's<00:02:36.090> very<00:02:36.300> hard<00:02:36.510> to

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
make even circles and it's very hard to

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.440 
make even circles and it's very hard to
do<00:02:36.780> with<00:02:37.620> your<00:02:37.800> prosthesis<00:02:38.160> because<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:38.850> you

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
do with your prosthesis because you you

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.840 
do with your prosthesis because you you
can<00:02:39.600> push<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.740> can<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.370> can<00:02:41.400> even<00:02:41.640> get<00:02:41.820> a

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
can push and you can you can even get a

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.190 
can push and you can you can even get a
pretty<00:02:42.030> good<00:02:42.210> pull<00:02:42.420> with<00:02:42.600> my<00:02:42.690> suspension

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
pretty good pull with my suspension

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.390 
pretty good pull with my suspension
system<00:02:43.730> which<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:45.800> I'll<00:02:46.800> call<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.220> pin

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
system which is a I'll call it a pin

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.670 
system which is a I'll call it a pin
system<00:02:47.850> but<00:02:49.340> pushing<00:02:50.340> along<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.730> top<00:02:50.970> and

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
system but pushing along the top and

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.500 
system but pushing along the top and
pulling<00:02:52.680> along<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.070> bottom<00:02:53.250> are<00:02:54.030> far<00:02:54.390> more

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
pulling along the bottom are far more

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.390 
pulling along the bottom are far more
difficult<00:02:54.690> they<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.680> leg<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.070> not<00:02:56.190> really

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
difficult they the leg is not really

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.060 
difficult they the leg is not really
designed<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:57.240> function<00:02:58.020> that<00:02:58.350> way<00:02:58.530> very<00:02:58.800> well

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
designed to function that way very well

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.100 
designed to function that way very well
and<00:02:59.430> so<00:02:59.820> I<00:02:59.850> end<00:03:00.150> up<00:03:00.209> being<00:03:00.360> more<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.720> push<00:03:00.930> and

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
and so I end up being more of a push and

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.090 
and so I end up being more of a push and
a<00:03:01.140> pull<00:03:01.430> cyclist<00:03:02.430> on<00:03:02.580> that<00:03:02.730> side<00:03:04.010> you<00:03:05.010> can

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
a pull cyclist on that side you can

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.740 
a pull cyclist on that side you can
always<00:03:05.220> tell<00:03:05.490> a<00:03:05.520> bike<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:05.910> I've<00:03:06.030> that<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.510> own

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
always tell a bike that I've that I own

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.240 
always tell a bike that I've that I own
because<00:03:07.200> there's<00:03:07.410> going<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.590> be<00:03:07.650> chips<00:03:07.980> along

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
because there's going to be chips along

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.729 
because there's going to be chips along
the<00:03:08.430> top<00:03:08.640> tube<00:03:08.910> here<00:03:09.240> and<00:03:10.080> that's<00:03:10.290> from<00:03:10.530> the

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
the top tube here and that's from the

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.500 
the top tube here and that's from the
from<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.280> rivet<00:03:11.610> on<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.940> inside<00:03:12.269> of<00:03:12.390> my

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
from the rivet on the inside of my

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.140 
from the rivet on the inside of my
prosthesis<00:03:12.950> which<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.040> talked<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.459> my<00:03:14.610> process

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
prosthesis which I talked to my process

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.960 
prosthesis which I talked to my process
just<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.630> lot<00:03:15.810> about<00:03:16.170> relocating<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.640> what<00:03:17.790> she

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
just a lot about relocating and what she

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.560 
just a lot about relocating and what she
told<00:03:18.209> me<00:03:18.360> no<00:03:19.730> he<00:03:20.730> said<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.000> had<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.180> be<00:03:21.300> there

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
told me no he said it had to be there

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.979 
told me no he said it had to be there
and<00:03:22.350> so<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:23.340> have<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.850> put<00:03:24.000> up<00:03:24.120> with<00:03:24.150> these<00:03:24.390> paint

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
and so I have to put up with these paint

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.110 
and so I have to put up with these paint
chips<00:03:25.080> on<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.560> top<00:03:25.739> of<00:03:25.860> my<00:03:25.980> bike<00:03:26.190> but<00:03:26.459> it's<00:03:27.030> a

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
chips on the top of my bike but it's a

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.430 
chips on the top of my bike but it's a
small<00:03:27.300> price<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.540> pay<00:03:27.690> for<00:03:27.810> being<00:03:28.110> out<00:03:28.290> on<00:03:28.320> the

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
small price to pay for being out on the

small price to pay for being out on the
road
