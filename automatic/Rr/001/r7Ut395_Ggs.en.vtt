00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.979 
proverbs you can see that I've
highlighted<00:02:58.970> different<00:02:59.970> parts<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:00.750> I

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
highlighted different parts and so I

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.229

start<00:03:01.470> out<00:03:01.590> in<00:03:01.829> orange<00:03:02.190> because<00:03:02.579> that's<00:03:02.790> we

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
start out in orange because that's we

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.140 
start out in orange because that's we
use<00:03:03.390> orange<00:03:03.840> for<00:03:04.019> names<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:04.620> it's<00:03:04.950> by<00:03:05.160> Solomon

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
use orange for names so it's by Solomon

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.610 
use orange for names so it's by Solomon
son<00:03:06.390> of<00:03:06.420> David<00:03:06.540> king<00:03:06.959> of<00:03:07.019> Israel<00:03:07.139> so<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.440> make

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
son of David king of Israel so I make

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.990 
son of David king of Israel so I make
that<00:03:07.739> orange<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.190> then<00:03:08.310> we<00:03:08.430> see<00:03:08.609> some<00:03:08.790> wisdom

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
that orange and then we see some wisdom

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.420 
that orange and then we see some wisdom
so<00:03:09.329> I<00:03:09.389> made<00:03:09.600> it<00:03:09.720> blue<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:09.959> then<00:03:10.380> I<00:03:10.560> made<00:03:11.400> it

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
so I made it blue and then I made it

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.400 
so I made it blue and then I made it
pink<00:03:11.760> when<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.120> talked<00:03:12.329> about<00:03:12.450> your<00:03:12.810> sons<00:03:13.139> and

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
pink when it talked about your sons and

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.199 
pink when it talked about your sons and
and<00:03:13.709> followed<00:03:14.400> listening<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.850> father's

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
and followed listening to father's

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.509 
and followed listening to father's
instruction<00:03:15.780> because<00:03:16.079> that's<00:03:16.319> about<00:03:16.799> family

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
instruction because that's about family

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.580 
instruction because that's about family
and<00:03:17.549> and<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.269> really<00:03:18.510> what<00:03:18.900> it's<00:03:19.049> about<00:03:19.170> it's

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
and and so really what it's about it's

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.340 
and and so really what it's about it's
