00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
a new fragrance which I am very very

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.130 
a new fragrance which I am very very
excited<00:02:20.250> about<00:02:20.700> this<00:02:21.060> one's<00:02:21.299> called<00:02:21.510> molecule

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
excited about this one's called molecule

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.920 
excited about this one's called molecule
from<00:02:22.530> eccentric<00:02:23.129> molecule<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.939> pretty<00:02:24.870> much

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
from eccentric molecule and pretty much

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.530 
from eccentric molecule and pretty much
a<00:02:25.409> very<00:02:25.680> simple<00:02:26.189> kind<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.700> description<00:02:27.269> of

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
a very simple kind of description of

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.179 
a very simple kind of description of
this<00:02:27.629> because<00:02:27.780> I'm<00:02:27.959> really<00:02:28.110> bad<00:02:28.409> at<00:02:28.439> that

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
this because I'm really bad at that

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.339 
this because I'm really bad at that
sense<00:02:29.489> that<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:30.180> doesn't<00:02:30.480> necessarily<00:02:31.049> have<00:02:31.319> a

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
sense that it doesn't necessarily have a

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.160 
sense that it doesn't necessarily have a
particular<00:02:32.189> scent<00:02:32.549> it<00:02:32.819> actually<00:02:33.450> reacts<00:02:33.870> it

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
particular scent it actually reacts it

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.720 
particular scent it actually reacts it
has<00:02:34.290> an<00:02:34.409> ingredient<00:02:34.530> in<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.099> reacts<00:02:35.430> to

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
has an ingredient in it that reacts to

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.599 
has an ingredient in it that reacts to
your<00:02:36.000> skin<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:36.870> brings<00:02:37.769> out<00:02:37.920> your<00:02:37.950> natural

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
your skin and brings out your natural

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.250 
your skin and brings out your natural
pheromones<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.480> guess<00:02:39.689> so<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.140> smells

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
pheromones I guess so it smells

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.259 
pheromones I guess so it smells
different<00:02:40.620> on<00:02:40.980> everyone<00:02:41.519> I<00:02:41.760> have<00:02:42.060> tried<00:02:42.209> to

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
Tom before and I really really like the

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.300 
Tom before and I really really like the
way<00:02:44.099> that<00:02:44.400> he<00:02:44.609> reacted<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.540> my<00:02:45.659> skin<00:02:46.129> the<00:02:47.129> day

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
way that he reacted to my skin the day

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.030 
way that he reacted to my skin the day
