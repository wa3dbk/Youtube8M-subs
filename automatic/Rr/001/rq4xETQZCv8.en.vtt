I<00:00:08.850> think<00:00:09.850> that<00:00:10.030> medicine<00:00:10.570> is<00:00:10.720> very<00:00:10.750> much<00:00:11.170> a

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200 
I think that medicine is very much a

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.709 
I think that medicine is very much a
calling<00:00:11.680> and<00:00:11.770> writing<00:00:12.190> is<00:00:12.340> equally<00:00:12.940> a<00:00:13.210> calling

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:13.719 
calling and writing is equally a calling

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:15.990 
calling and writing is equally a calling
quite<00:00:13.960> wrapped<00:00:14.260> up<00:00:14.500> in<00:00:14.710> the<00:00:14.889> in<00:00:15.190> the<00:00:15.820> same

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
quite wrapped up in the in the same

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.880 
quite wrapped up in the in the same
sentiment<00:00:16.630> that<00:00:16.750> brings<00:00:17.020> me<00:00:17.200> to<00:00:17.320> medicine<00:00:17.590> I

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
sentiment that brings me to medicine I

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.490 
sentiment that brings me to medicine I
often<00:00:18.430> think<00:00:18.580> that<00:00:18.670> I<00:00:18.760> write<00:00:19.119> in<00:00:20.020> order<00:00:20.289> to

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
often think that I write in order to

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.900 
often think that I write in order to
understand<00:00:21.010> what<00:00:21.220> I'm<00:00:21.310> thinking<00:00:21.699> there's

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
understand what I'm thinking there's

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.660 
understand what I'm thinking there's
something<00:00:22.150> absolutely<00:00:23.279> magical<00:00:24.279> about<00:00:24.490> the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
something absolutely magical about the

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.689 
something absolutely magical about the
act<00:00:24.849> of<00:00:25.090> writing<00:00:25.330> in<00:00:25.750> that<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:27.070> can<00:00:27.279> think<00:00:27.550> you

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699 
act of writing in that you can think you

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.070 
act of writing in that you can think you
know<00:00:27.849> what<00:00:28.000> you're<00:00:28.150> going<00:00:28.300> to<00:00:28.420> sit<00:00:28.599> down<00:00:28.779> write

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
know what you're going to sit down write

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.450 
know what you're going to sit down write
about<00:00:29.349> but<00:00:29.560> in<00:00:29.769> the<00:00:29.920> act<00:00:30.099> of<00:00:30.279> writing

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
about but in the act of writing

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.270 
about but in the act of writing
something<00:00:31.060> utterly<00:00:31.720> mysterious<00:00:32.380> emerges<00:00:33.250> I

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
something utterly mysterious emerges I

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.360 
something utterly mysterious emerges I
call<00:00:33.730> it<00:00:33.880> the<00:00:34.030> noose<00:00:34.780> or<00:00:35.140> call<00:00:35.380> it<00:00:35.500> the<00:00:35.710> the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
call it the noose or call it the the

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.270 
call it the noose or call it the the
right<00:00:36.550> brain<00:00:36.850> whatever<00:00:37.210> it<00:00:37.329> is<00:00:37.450> kicks<00:00:37.750> in<00:00:37.990> and

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
right brain whatever it is kicks in and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.740 
right brain whatever it is kicks in and
I<00:00:39.280> always<00:00:39.670> think<00:00:40.030> that<00:00:40.150> the<00:00:40.300> act<00:00:40.450> of<00:00:40.600> writing

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
I always think that the act of writing

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.190 
I always think that the act of writing
is<00:00:41.080> an<00:00:41.230> attempt<00:00:41.740> to<00:00:42.460> really<00:00:42.640> explain<00:00:43.060> what<00:00:43.990> one

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
is an attempt to really explain what one

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.430 
is an attempt to really explain what one
is<00:00:44.320> thinking<00:00:44.620> as<00:00:44.860> an<00:00:45.010> internist<00:00:45.520> I<00:00:45.970> I<00:00:46.570> spend<00:00:47.380> a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
is thinking as an internist I I spend a

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.380 
is thinking as an internist I I spend a
lot<00:00:47.560> of<00:00:47.590> time<00:00:47.830> listening<00:00:48.820> carefully<00:00:49.060> to

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
lot of time listening carefully to

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.390 
lot of time listening carefully to
people's<00:00:49.840> stories<00:00:49.900> and<00:00:50.230> trying<00:00:50.650> to<00:00:50.830> match

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
people's stories and trying to match

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.520 
people's stories and trying to match
them<00:00:51.730> with<00:00:51.880> my<00:00:52.090> repertoire<00:00:52.360> of<00:00:52.810> stories<00:00:53.200> or

or shortened in a physician's office so

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.410 
or shortened in a physician's office so
there's<00:01:17.440> always<00:01:17.560> this<00:01:17.860> slight<00:01:18.760> danger<00:01:19.270> and

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
there's always this slight danger and

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.150 
there's always this slight danger and
always<00:01:19.660> this<00:01:19.810> desire<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:20.200> walk<00:01:20.590> out<00:01:20.800> of<00:01:20.830> there

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
always this desire to walk out of there

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.520 
always this desire to walk out of there
with<00:01:21.370> a<00:01:21.850> clean<00:01:21.970> bill<00:01:22.480> of<00:01:22.540> health<00:01:22.690> and<00:01:23.110> so<00:01:23.290> I

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
with a clean bill of health and so I

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.860 
with a clean bill of health and so I
think<00:01:24.070> story<00:01:24.550> is<00:01:24.700> very<00:01:24.820> operative<00:01:25.690> in<00:01:25.840> the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
think story is very operative in the

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.380 
think story is very operative in the
medical<00:01:26.320> world<00:01:26.500> when<00:01:27.280> it<00:01:27.400> might<00:01:27.610> not<00:01:27.880> be<00:01:28.180> at

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
medical world when it might not be at

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.290 
medical world when it might not be at
other<00:01:28.540> times<00:01:28.930> in<00:01:29.890> a<00:01:30.040> person's<00:01:30.190> life<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:30.909> so<00:01:31.090> I

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
other times in a person's life and so I

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.610 
other times in a person's life and so I
think<00:01:31.570> it's<00:01:31.810> very<00:01:31.960> important<00:01:32.440> for<00:01:32.560> the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
think it's very important for the

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.860 
think it's very important for the
physician<00:01:32.800> to<00:01:33.040> be<00:01:33.159> aware<00:01:33.970> of<00:01:34.150> this<00:01:34.270> sense<00:01:34.570> of<00:01:34.810> a

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
physician to be aware of this sense of a

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.430 
physician to be aware of this sense of a
story<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.670> need<00:01:36.820> for<00:01:37.260> resolution<00:01:38.260> of<00:01:38.350> the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
story and the need for resolution of the

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.920 
story and the need for resolution of the
conflict<00:01:38.890> it's<00:01:39.760> not<00:01:39.940> another<00:01:40.450> level<00:01:40.810> I<00:01:40.870> think

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
conflict it's not another level I think

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.450 
conflict it's not another level I think
it's<00:01:41.229> also<00:01:41.380> important<00:01:41.920> for<00:01:42.040> physicians<00:01:42.130> to

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
it's also important for physicians to

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.360 
it's also important for physicians to
appreciate<00:01:42.940> things<00:01:43.659> like<00:01:43.780> metaphor<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:45.250> be

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
appreciate things like metaphor to be

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.690 
appreciate things like metaphor to be
able<00:01:45.460> to<00:01:45.610> appreciate<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.840> fact<00:01:47.050> that<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
able to appreciate the fact that the

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.670 
able to appreciate the fact that the
language<00:01:48.940> patients<00:01:49.690> use<00:01:49.870> is<00:01:49.960> a<00:01:49.990> very<00:01:50.200> personal

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
language patients use is a very personal

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.830 
language patients use is a very personal
language<00:01:51.010> that<00:01:51.159> we<00:01:51.280> cure<00:01:52.030> them<00:01:52.240> user<00:01:52.450> that<00:01:52.690> we

medicine that personal language is

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.000 
medicine that personal language is

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
how much we as physicians should seek

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.050 
how much we as physicians should seek
epiphanies<00:02:20.019> to<00:02:20.049> the<00:02:20.499> patients

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
epiphanies to the patients

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.390 
epiphanies to the patients
and<00:02:21.510> how<00:02:22.350> very<00:02:22.380> often<00:02:22.980> on<00:02:23.069> we<00:02:23.220> have<00:02:23.370> a

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
and how very often on we have a

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.790 
and how very often on we have a
discomfort<00:02:23.880> with<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.330> patient<00:02:24.840> it's<00:02:25.380> because

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
discomfort with a patient it's because

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.190 
discomfort with a patient it's because
the<00:02:26.010> Epiphany<00:02:26.490> doesn't<00:02:27.450> seem<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.720> be<00:02:27.840> at<00:02:27.930> hand

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
the Epiphany doesn't seem to be at hand

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.590 
the Epiphany doesn't seem to be at hand
and<00:02:28.440> is<00:02:28.530> resisting<00:02:29.069> us<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.550> in<00:02:30.209> understanding

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
and is resisting us and in understanding

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.870 
and is resisting us and in understanding
that<00:02:31.140> perhaps<00:02:31.440> is<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.100> Epiphany<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.610> the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
that perhaps is the Epiphany that the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.090 
that perhaps is the Epiphany that the
recognition<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:34.319> can't<00:02:34.620> change<00:02:34.830> the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
recognition that you can't change the

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.550 
recognition that you can't change the
medical<00:02:35.550> thing<00:02:35.840> but<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:36.990> can<00:02:37.140> begin<00:02:37.350> to

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
medical thing but you can begin to

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.590 
medical thing but you can begin to
change<00:02:37.739> everything<00:02:38.040> else<00:02:38.310> about<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.700> way<00:02:38.850> you

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
change everything else about the way you

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.290 
change everything else about the way you
look<00:02:39.780> at<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.020> patient<00:02:40.500> one<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.100> my<00:02:41.300> interests

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
look at that patient one of my interests

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.930 
look at that patient one of my interests
which<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.690> think<00:02:42.900> is<00:02:42.989> reflected<00:02:43.140> in<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.680> book

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
which I think is reflected in the book

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.309 
which I think is reflected in the book
especially<00:02:44.940> in<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.090> persona<00:02:45.420> of<00:02:45.630> dr.<00:02:46.080> Ghosh

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
especially in the persona of dr. Ghosh

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.280 
especially in the persona of dr. Ghosh
is<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.830> strongly<00:02:47.730> believe<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.630> ritual<00:02:49.140> of

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
is I strongly believe that the ritual of

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.710 
is I strongly believe that the ritual of
examining<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.830> patient<00:02:50.310> it's<00:02:51.300> particularly

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
examining the patient it's particularly

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.900 
examining the patient it's particularly
important<00:02:52.290> rituals<00:02:52.950> are<00:02:53.519> all<00:02:53.700> about

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
important rituals are all about

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.910 
important rituals are all about
transformation<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:54.930> know<00:02:54.959> we<00:02:55.200> we<00:02:55.769> get

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
transformation you know we we get

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.949 
transformation you know we we get
married<00:02:56.250> in<00:02:56.730> great<00:02:57.120> ceremonies<00:02:57.780> we

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
married in great ceremonies we

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.020 
married in great ceremonies we
inaugurate<00:02:58.500> presidents<00:02:59.190> in<00:02:59.430> great

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
inaugurate presidents in great

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.370 
inaugurate presidents in great
ceremonies<00:03:00.630> because<00:03:00.810> these<00:03:01.019> are<00:03:01.170> about

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
ceremonies because these are about

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.410 
ceremonies because these are about
transformation<00:03:02.310> well<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:02.820> would<00:03:03.060> argue<00:03:03.239> that

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
transformation well I would argue that

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.040 
transformation well I would argue that
the<00:03:03.660> ritual<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.380> one<00:03:05.040> person<00:03:05.580> allowing<00:03:06.060> the

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
the ritual of one person allowing the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.110 
the ritual of one person allowing the
touch<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:07.800> confiding<00:03:08.370> their<00:03:08.519> secrets<00:03:09.000> and

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
touch and confiding their secrets and

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.509 
touch and confiding their secrets and
letting<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.630> stranger<00:03:09.890> examining<00:03:10.890> them<00:03:11.069> is<00:03:11.459> a

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
letting a stranger examining them is a

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.910 
letting a stranger examining them is a
terribly<00:03:12.000> important<00:03:12.360> ritual<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:13.050> I<00:03:13.319> feel

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
terribly important ritual and I I feel

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.680 
terribly important ritual and I I feel
that<00:03:14.069> if<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.220> shortchange<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.090> ritual<00:03:15.420> if

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
that if you shortchange that ritual if

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.930 
that if you shortchange that ritual if
you<00:03:15.780> don't<00:03:16.019> do<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.290> with<00:03:16.470> skill<00:03:16.890> if<00:03:17.519> you<00:03:17.700> don't

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
you don't do it with skill if you don't

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.509 
you don't do it with skill if you don't
do<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.150> with<00:03:18.510> authority<00:03:18.830> and<00:03:19.830> especially<00:03:20.370> if

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
do it with authority and especially if

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:21.910 
do it with authority and especially if
you<00:03:20.580> don't<00:03:20.790> do<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:20.970> with<00:03:21.120> some<00:03:21.300> discernment

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
you don't do it with some discernment

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.160 
you don't do it with some discernment
you<00:03:22.920> do<00:03:23.069> not<00:03:23.190> have<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.760> transformation<00:03:24.269> that

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
you do not have the transformation that

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.740 
you do not have the transformation that
should<00:03:25.500> take<00:03:25.739> place<00:03:26.010> which<00:03:26.280> is<00:03:26.459> that<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.600> the

should take place which is that of the

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.960 
should take place which is that of the

so<00:03:50.010> surgical<00:03:50.549> is<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:51.720> came<00:03:52.260> across<00:03:52.560> as

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
so surgical is that I came across as

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.099 
so surgical is that I came across as
most<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.549> us<00:03:53.640> did<00:03:53.880> this<00:03:54.420> crossroads<00:03:54.930> in<00:03:55.079> my

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
most of us did this crossroads in my

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.890 
most of us did this crossroads in my
life<00:03:55.230> where<00:03:55.650> I<00:03:55.680> had<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.040> choose<00:03:56.250> between<00:03:56.310> a

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
life where I had to choose between a

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.000 
life where I had to choose between a
surgical<00:03:57.900> discipline<00:03:58.320> and<00:03:58.500> one<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:58.799> was

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
surgical discipline and one that was

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.420 
surgical discipline and one that was
more<00:03:59.760> cerebral<00:04:00.090> more<00:04:00.540> more<00:04:00.959> more<00:04:01.620> internal

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
more cerebral more more more internal

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.300 
more cerebral more more more internal
medicine<00:04:02.790> like<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.890> medicine<00:04:04.890> one<00:04:05.100> out<00:04:05.280> I

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
medicine like and medicine one out I

medicine like and medicine one out I
loved<00:04:05.700> medicine<00:04:05.940> but<00:04:06.299> I<00:04:06.359> always<00:04:06.660> had<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.810> great

loved medicine but I always had a great

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.069 
loved medicine but I always had a great
sense<00:04:07.200> of<00:04:07.410> regret<00:04:08.400> of<00:04:08.609> giving<00:04:09.000> up<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.420> the

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300
