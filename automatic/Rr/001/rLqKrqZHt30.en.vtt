00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:08.309
 hello friends with you karabash 74 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.740
 Today I will probably still have 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:17.070
 there are two reviews besides this one 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:20.130
 one i know i do n't even know how to say 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.029
 I mean, now my friend sent me 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.580
 this 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:29.730
 Ural 4320 30 I have already explained that 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.980
 4320 is like a normal Urals default but 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:38.149
 30 this means that he has a little frame 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:42.690
 for longer with a tail so to speak here and 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:47.579
 this mod he does it I think that he 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.280
 the world will not see but he sent it to me and I 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.090
 I'll show you for one simple reason 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.710
 I really liked this mod then 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.079
 there is this one of 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.550
 from some mods that me 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.980
 really liked 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.570
 it's all you can on your fingers 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.080
 count about 10 here and here 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.170
 this 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.040
 this ten that is what I 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:18.450
 liked this mod this mod has its 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.700
 the sound of the engine I now specifically so 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.490
 I will go to settings 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.490
 make a sound here 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:43.810
 i.e. it is really awesome 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:46.570
 the sound is just perfect made this 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.409
 The first reason why of course I am 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.750
 I wanted to show you the second reason for me 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.259
 really liked the texture of this Ural 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:03.880

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:05.220

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.650
 wanted and do not want to do reviews on 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.200
 some kind of paid or fashion 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.720

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.910
 view from the cabin 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.430
 I was shocked to be honest on the kind of 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.560
 cockpit is really how you sit in the Urals 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.070
 that is, I have never seen such a thing 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.220
 a light bulb works here I noticed when 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.850

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.850

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.410

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.750

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.580
 all included backed up semi 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:44.540
 that is, the Urals, in principle, as to me 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:47.330
 said still in theory unfinished but here 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:54.050

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:57.890

 feathering on the handbrake and skeptic 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.280
 here you know, that's why there’s no such 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:32.970
 binge maybe this is what pasha 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.470

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.290
 this feature 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.980

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.630
 we must urgently go out we failed rear 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:50.830
