now you can turn this off and on under
settings<00:03:36.780> if<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:36.930> prefer<00:03:37.470> so<00:03:38.160> this<00:03:38.459> also<00:03:38.640> acts

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
settings if you prefer so this also acts

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.090 
settings if you prefer so this also acts
as<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.180> trifold<00:03:39.720> crop<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.500> can<00:03:40.620> fold<00:03:40.950> it

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
back holds together pretty nicely so you

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.780 
back holds together pretty nicely so you
can<00:03:43.410> prop<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.680> up<00:03:43.769> for<00:03:44.040> your<00:03:44.280> keyboard

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
to keep it together so it doesn't flop

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.060 
to keep it together so it doesn't flop
around<00:04:02.989> now<00:04:03.989> of<00:04:04.079> course<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.380> can't<00:04:04.650> use<00:04:04.860> the

camera<00:04:05.519> when<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:05.910> do<00:04:06.150> this<00:04:06.269> but<00:04:06.480> I<00:04:06.570> have<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:06.780> do

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
camera when you do this but I have to do

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.020 
camera when you do this but I have to do
is<00:04:07.079> bend<00:04:07.380> that<00:04:07.590> flap<00:04:07.890> back<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.430> your<00:04:08.730> camera

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
is bend that flap back and your camera

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.979 
is bend that flap back and your camera
is<00:04:09.120> now<00:04:09.239> exposed<00:04:09.660> again

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
is now exposed again

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.660 
is now exposed again
now<00:04:10.380> if<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.560> flap<00:04:10.799> open<00:04:11.010> you<00:04:11.250> have<00:04:11.370> that<00:04:11.489> nice

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
now if the flap open you have that nice

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.190 
now if the flap open you have that nice
soft<00:04:12.060> material<00:04:12.209> on<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.660> back<00:04:12.810> which<00:04:13.019> feels

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
soft material on the back which feels

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.599 
soft material on the back which feels
really<00:04:13.500> nice<00:04:13.650> in<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:14.010> hand<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:14.400> then<00:04:14.489> you

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
really nice in the hand and then you

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.490 
really nice in the hand and then you
have<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.850> edge<00:04:15.060> along<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.810> side<00:04:16.109> which<00:04:16.260> adds

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
have the edge along the side which adds

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.590 
have the edge along the side which adds
some<00:04:16.590> grip<00:04:16.890> ability<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.430> your<00:04:17.609> iPad<00:04:18.000> here<00:04:18.239> but

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
some grip ability to your iPad here but

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.779 
some grip ability to your iPad here but
it<00:04:18.660> does<00:04:18.810> flex<00:04:19.200> just<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.769> little<00:04:20.310> bit<00:04:20.459> toward

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
it does flex just a little bit toward

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.070 
it does flex just a little bit toward
the<00:04:20.910> edge<00:04:21.060> when<00:04:21.329> you're<00:04:21.419> handling<00:04:21.720> it<00:04:21.900> it's

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
the edge when you're handling it it's

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.050 
the edge when you're handling it it's
not<00:04:22.200> a<00:04:22.260> big<00:04:22.500> deal<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:22.950> think<00:04:23.220> it's<00:04:23.340> pretty<00:04:23.490> minor

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
not a big deal I think it's pretty minor

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.610 
not a big deal I think it's pretty minor
now<00:04:24.180> this<00:04:24.390> trifold<00:04:24.840> case<00:04:25.020> design<00:04:25.349> works

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
now this trifold case design works

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.629 
now this trifold case design works
extremely<00:04:26.070> well

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
extremely well

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.339 
extremely well
there<00:04:26.789> are<00:04:26.909> magnets<00:04:27.419> at<00:04:27.569> the<00:04:27.689> edge<00:04:27.870> of<00:04:28.199> the

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
there are magnets at the edge of the

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:31.040 
there are magnets at the edge of the
cover<00:04:28.710> which<00:04:29.370> adhere<00:04:29.879> to<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.330> hinge<00:04:30.689> of<00:04:30.900> the

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
cover which adhere to the hinge of the

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.420 
cover which adhere to the hinge of the
smart<00:04:31.319> case<00:04:31.469> so<00:04:31.590> when<00:04:31.710> it's<00:04:31.830> folded<00:04:31.949> up<00:04:32.219> it's

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
smart case so when it's folded up it's

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.939 
smart case so when it's folded up it's
nice<00:04:32.639> and<00:04:32.939> rigid<00:04:33.180> so<00:04:33.900> if<00:04:34.020> you<00:04:34.110> have<00:04:34.319> it<00:04:34.469> in<00:04:34.680> for

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
nice and rigid so if you have it in for

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.559 
nice and rigid so if you have it in for
example<00:04:35.189> keyboard<00:04:35.669> orientation<00:04:36.210> you<00:04:36.330> can<00:04:36.360> see

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:36.569 
example keyboard orientation you can see

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:37.909 
example keyboard orientation you can see
the<00:04:36.689> way<00:04:36.870> it<00:04:36.990> folds<00:04:37.169> up<00:04:37.439> here<00:04:37.620> even<00:04:37.770> though

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
the way it folds up here even though

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.769 
the way it folds up here even though
it's<00:04:38.069> using<00:04:38.340> magnets<00:04:38.759> the<00:04:39.270> way<00:04:39.389> it<00:04:39.449> folds<00:04:39.599> up

00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:39.779 
it's using magnets the way it folds up

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.899 
it's using magnets the way it folds up
here<00:04:39.930> you<00:04:40.020> can<00:04:40.139> push<00:04:40.349> as<00:04:40.529> hard<00:04:40.560> as<00:04:41.310> you<00:04:41.460> want<00:04:41.669> on

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:41.909 
here you can push as hard as you want on

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:43.730 
here you can push as hard as you want on
it<00:04:42.180> and<00:04:42.360> it<00:04:42.509> won't<00:04:42.719> collapse<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.439> that's<00:04:43.560> just

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
it and it won't collapse and that's just

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.499 
it and it won't collapse and that's just
the<00:04:43.830> way<00:04:43.949> it<00:04:44.009> folds<00:04:44.219> up<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.639> edge<00:04:44.909> of<00:04:45.150> the

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
the way it folds up the edge of the

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.600 
the way it folds up the edge of the
cover<00:04:46.020> digs<00:04:46.349> into<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.710> hinge<00:04:47.009> so<00:04:47.249> the<00:04:47.370> harder

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
cover digs into the hinge so the harder

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.010 
cover digs into the hinge so the harder
you<00:04:47.669> push<00:04:47.849> on<00:04:47.999> it<00:04:48.029> it<00:04:48.210> won't<00:04:48.449> collapse<00:04:48.689> so

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
you push on it it won't collapse so

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.839 
you push on it it won't collapse so
again<00:04:49.169> really<00:04:49.650> nice<00:04:49.919> design<00:04:50.129> the<00:04:50.490> magnets

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
again really nice design the magnets

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.219 
again really nice design the magnets
just<00:04:50.909> kind<00:04:51.210> of<00:04:51.270> put<00:04:51.479> it<00:04:51.629> in<00:04:51.689> place<00:04:51.960> for<00:04:51.990> you

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
just kind of put it in place for you

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.950 
just kind of put it in place for you
this<00:04:52.650> also<00:04:52.860> works<00:04:53.159> the<00:04:53.310> same<00:04:53.550> in<00:04:53.819> a<00:04:54.210> landscape

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
this also works the same in a landscape

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.450 
this also works the same in a landscape
orientation<00:04:55.139> so<00:04:55.800> again<00:04:56.009> you<00:04:56.099> can<00:04:56.189> see<00:04:56.310> there's

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
orientation so again you can see there's

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.550 
orientation so again you can see there's
enough<00:04:56.759> surface<00:04:57.060> area<00:04:57.389> to<00:04:57.599> prop<00:04:57.840> up<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.139> iPad

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
enough surface area to prop up the iPad

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.080 
enough surface area to prop up the iPad
so<00:04:58.770> it<00:04:58.860> doesn't<00:04:59.129> collapse<00:04:59.279> or<00:04:59.580> knock<00:04:59.759> over

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
so it doesn't collapse or knock over

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.219 
so it doesn't collapse or knock over
when<00:05:00.270> you're<00:05:00.360> interacting<00:05:00.659> with<00:05:01.110> this

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
when you're interacting with this

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.659 
when you're interacting with this
display<00:05:01.650> so<00:05:01.710> again<00:05:01.979> that's<00:05:02.069> really<00:05:02.310> stable

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
display so again that's really stable

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.369 
display so again that's really stable
it's<00:05:03.210> also<00:05:03.330> really<00:05:03.629> strong<00:05:03.990> so<00:05:04.169> you<00:05:04.259> can

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:04.379 
it's also really strong so you can

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:06.050 
it's also really strong so you can
basically<00:05:04.560> push<00:05:05.039> on<00:05:05.250> it<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:05.550> it<00:05:05.969> won't

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
basically push on it and it won't

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.610 
basically push on it and it won't
collapse<00:05:06.419> the<00:05:06.659> harder<00:05:06.900> you<00:05:06.990> push<00:05:07.199> on<00:05:07.349> it<00:05:07.500> the

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
collapse the harder you push on it the

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.010 
collapse the harder you push on it the
more<00:05:07.830> the<00:05:08.069> hinge<00:05:08.370> digs<00:05:08.699> in<00:05:08.969> so<00:05:09.389> again<00:05:09.569> a<00:05:09.599> really

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
more the hinge digs in so again a really

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.629 
more the hinge digs in so again a really
nice<00:05:10.319> design<00:05:10.620> this<00:05:10.979> works<00:05:11.219> better<00:05:11.490> than

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
nice design this works better than

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:13.249 
nice design this works better than
something<00:05:11.849> like<00:05:11.969> the<00:05:12.240> smart<00:05:12.539> cover<00:05:12.750> which

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
something like the smart cover which

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:16.189 
something like the smart cover which
will<00:05:13.409> just<00:05:13.590> pop<00:05:13.889> off<00:05:13.919> the<00:05:14.460> iPad<00:05:15.360> so<00:05:15.930> once<00:05:16.110> again

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
will just pop off the iPad so once again

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.469 
will just pop off the iPad so once again
the<00:05:16.409> iPad<00:05:16.800> air<00:05:16.949> to<00:05:17.159> smart<00:05:17.550> case<00:05:17.759> is<00:05:17.969> perfectly

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
the iPad air to smart case is perfectly

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.659 
the iPad air to smart case is perfectly
designed<00:05:18.689> for<00:05:19.169> your<00:05:19.319> iPad<00:05:19.740> so<00:05:20.009> all<00:05:20.129> the<00:05:20.279> ports

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:54.079 
it takes a little more prying to get it
out<00:05:52.710> of<00:05:52.860> the<00:05:52.949> case<00:05:53.159> now<00:05:53.520> in<00:05:53.639> the<00:05:53.759> end<00:05:53.879> while<00:05:54.000> we

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:54.089 
out of the case now in the end while we

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:55.700 
out of the case now in the end while we
have<00:05:54.210> really<00:05:54.659> nice<00:05:54.810> materials<00:05:55.349> here<00:05:55.439> feels

have really nice materials here feels

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.170 
have really nice materials here feels
really<00:05:56.039> great<00:05:56.279> in<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.460> hand<00:05:56.639> this<00:05:56.789> is<00:05:56.969> still<00:05:57.149> a

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
really great in the hand this is still a

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.820 
really great in the hand this is still a
soft<00:05:57.599> leather<00:05:57.870> material<00:05:58.319> which<00:05:58.439> will<00:05:58.589> age

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
soft leather material which will age

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.100 
soft leather material which will age
over<00:05:59.159> time<00:05:59.189> just<00:05:59.430> like<00:05:59.849> the<00:06:00.029> iPhone<00:06:00.210> 6<00:06:00.839> cases

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
over time just like the iPhone 6 cases

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.139 
over time just like the iPhone 6 cases
so<00:06:01.800> that's<00:06:01.949> something<00:06:02.129> to<00:06:02.279> consider<00:06:02.639> here<00:06:03.000> but

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:03.149 
so that's something to consider here but

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:04.639 
so that's something to consider here but
of<00:06:03.240> course<00:06:03.270> with<00:06:03.569> those<00:06:03.629> darker<00:06:04.139> colors<00:06:04.469> this

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:06.679 
of course with those darker colors this
time<00:06:04.889> they<00:06:05.339> will<00:06:05.520> weather<00:06:05.849> better<00:06:06.240> over<00:06:06.659> time

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:06.689 
time they will weather better over time

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:08.600 
time they will weather better over time
than<00:06:07.050> those<00:06:07.199> lighter<00:06:07.469> colors<00:06:07.889> from<00:06:08.099> last<00:06:08.339> year
