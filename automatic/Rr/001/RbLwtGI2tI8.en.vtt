 Awesome order managers of you 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.830
 I attack forced as passed 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.599
 impressive that is me at least I did not 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.430
 I thought the beginning of the season 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.800
 we had these expectations but good 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.650
 watching the course of the season 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.360

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.720
 incredible death with the team and 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.340
 wanting to seal it, that's true 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.440
 it's the champions and not the europa league 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.540
 It seems that we already have it 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.670
 mathematically everyone trusts that the 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.370
 team retains that fourth place and can 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.040
 play in europe next season 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:53.950
 never have more of the education of the 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:56.480
 bear girl cooked and that you are going to the 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.010

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.140
 get to less to play in europe that 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.160
 I'm sure if it's playing as they are 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.720
 playing can get that 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.610
 they are quietly playing better than 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.150
 everyone 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.670
 it's there next 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.599

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.010
 end in champions but good 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.740
 we all know how sometimes good 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.210
 we have the streak of so many games but

 we all know that one day you can 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.570
