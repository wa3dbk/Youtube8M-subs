there's<00:01:25.149> a<00:01:25.179> couple<00:01:25.300> of<00:01:25.479> nitpicking<00:01:26.110> things

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
there's a couple of nitpicking things

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.690 
there's a couple of nitpicking things
really<00:01:26.770> number<00:01:27.610> one<00:01:27.729> no<00:01:28.600> stand<00:01:28.930> which<00:01:29.710> is<00:01:29.890> you

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
really number one no stand which is you

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.999 
really number one no stand which is you
know<00:01:30.850> getting<00:01:31.390> a<00:01:31.450> bit<00:01:31.600> these<00:01:32.439> fish<00:01:32.649> downs<00:01:32.860> and

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
know getting a bit these fish downs and

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.530 
know getting a bit these fish downs and
understand<00:01:33.369> either<00:01:33.549> which<00:01:33.939> I<00:01:34.060> still<00:01:34.240> haven't

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
understand either which I still haven't

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:43.440 
understand either which I still haven't
received<00:01:34.869> yet<00:01:38.700> no<00:01:39.700> stunts<00:01:42.329> obviously<00:01:43.329> there's

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
received yet no stunts obviously there's

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.789 
received yet no stunts obviously there's
nothing<00:01:43.600> there's<00:01:43.930> no<00:01:44.049> mics<00:01:44.259> on<00:01:44.469> the<00:01:44.500> bottom

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
nothing there's no mics on the bottom

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:45.959 
nothing there's no mics on the bottom
which<00:01:44.920> is<00:01:44.950> a<00:01:45.070> shame<00:01:45.310> because<00:01:45.369> they<00:01:45.759> could<00:01:45.880> have

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
which is a shame because they could have

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.139 
which is a shame because they could have
put<00:01:46.180> this<00:01:46.840> similar<00:01:47.200> kind<00:01:47.409> of<00:01:47.560> feel<00:01:47.860> over<00:01:48.759> you

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
put this similar kind of feel over you

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.880 
put this similar kind of feel over you
know<00:01:49.270> look<00:01:50.229> a<00:01:50.289> little<00:01:50.409> something<00:01:50.560> with<00:01:50.799> the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
know look a little something with the

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.560 
know look a little something with the
bottom<00:01:51.159> but<00:01:51.490> then<00:01:51.610> it's<00:01:51.729> supposed<00:01:51.850> to<00:01:52.030> sit<00:01:52.240> you

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
bottom but then it's supposed to sit you

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.359 
bottom but then it's supposed to sit you
know<00:01:52.600> a<00:01:52.719> table<00:01:53.259> like<00:01:53.350> that<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:57.189> other

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
know a table like that and the other

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.480 
know a table like that and the other
thing<00:01:57.640> is<00:01:57.960> all<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.439> white<00:01:59.619> panels<00:02:00.159> on<00:02:00.369> each

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
thing is all the white panels on each

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.050 
thing is all the white panels on each
side<00:02:00.820> they're<00:02:01.270> exactly<00:02:01.719> the<00:02:01.840> same<00:02:02.759> now<00:02:03.759> if<00:02:03.939> you

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
side they're exactly the same now if you

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.639 
side they're exactly the same now if you
know<00:02:04.149> anything<00:02:04.180> about<00:02:04.479> ball<00:02:04.780> cubes<00:02:05.200> they<00:02:05.530> are

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
know anything about ball cubes they are

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:06.870 
know anything about ball cubes they are
a<00:02:05.680> little<00:02:05.859> bit<00:02:06.039> different<00:02:06.340> if<00:02:06.399> you<00:02:06.490> turn<00:02:06.670> it<00:02:06.789> on

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
a little bit different if you turn it on

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.410 
a little bit different if you turn it on
this<00:02:07.090> side<00:02:07.359> and<00:02:07.810> have<00:02:08.619> it<00:02:08.739> like<00:02:08.920> that<00:02:09.340> see<00:02:10.299> the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
this side and have it like that see the

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.750 
this side and have it like that see the
top<00:02:10.660> one<00:02:10.959> you<00:02:11.400> know<00:02:12.400> it<00:02:12.489> looks<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.730> bit

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
top one you know it looks a bit

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.550 
top one you know it looks a bit
different<00:02:13.000> so<00:02:13.329> this<00:02:13.510> should<00:02:13.750> be<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:13.989> little<00:02:14.320> bit

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
different so this should be a little bit

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.310 
different so this should be a little bit
different<00:02:15.070> on<00:02:15.130> each<00:02:15.340> side<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:16.870> know<00:02:17.019> and

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
different on each side you know and

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.460 
different on each side you know and
that's<00:02:17.920> just<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.220> way<00:02:18.370> cubes<00:02:18.910> are<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:20.290> looks

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
that's just the way cubes are that looks

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.590 
that's just the way cubes are that looks
a<00:02:20.530> little<00:02:20.650> bit<00:02:20.829> like<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.220> one<00:02:21.390> should<00:02:22.390> be<00:02:22.570> a

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
a little bit like that one should be a

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.420 
a little bit like that one should be a
little<00:02:22.810> bit<00:02:22.989> different<00:02:23.380> in<00:02:23.470> each<00:02:23.500> set<00:02:23.829> but<00:02:24.250> you

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
little bit different in each set but you

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.819 
little bit different in each set but you
know<00:02:24.549> that's<00:02:24.850> just<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.120> nitpick<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:26.680> other

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
know that's just a nitpick the other

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.340 
know that's just a nitpick the other
nitpick<00:02:27.130> I've<00:02:27.280> got<00:02:27.459> is<00:02:27.670> there's<00:02:28.570> no<00:02:28.690> detail<00:02:29.140> I

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
nitpick I've got is there's no detail I

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.439 
nitpick I've got is there's no detail I
mean<00:02:29.709> it's<00:02:29.829> nicely<00:02:30.280> moulded<00:02:30.489> detail<00:02:31.209> as<00:02:31.389> you

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:31.449 
mean it's nicely moulded detail as you

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:32.960 
mean it's nicely moulded detail as you
can<00:02:31.540> see<00:02:31.900> there

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
can see there

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.670 
can see there
some<00:02:33.750> nice<00:02:33.900> molding<00:02:34.410> detail<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:35.070> there<00:02:35.490> but

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
some nice molding detail in there but

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.040 
some nice molding detail in there but
it's<00:02:37.680> just<00:02:37.980> one<00:02:38.280> solid<00:02:38.820> sort<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.530> dark<00:02:42.050> almost

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050
