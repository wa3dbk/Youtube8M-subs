00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.489
 or not 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.560
 love 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.040
 holmes 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.040
 we 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.730
 hello everyone we go all of 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.829
 following the version tutorials 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.340
 original of the angry birds do not know if I 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.479
 say okay you'll see that the 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.729
 procedure is simple and fast 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.260
 so that will not really teach you how to 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.910
 to draw but let's say it's a way 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.890
 mnemonic to draw bread 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.100
 so if you like angry birds you 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.270
 can draw it easily so for 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.790
 structure this little bird goes home 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.590
 share on a circle in which I'm going 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:28.210
 to be enough right who intersect at 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.280
 center when they cross they will do 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.300
 a point in the middle 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.729
 because in fact the beak will be just 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.160
 underneath and it will be their ultimate father 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.670
 on which we can touch our eyes and 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.560
 we also take eyebrows 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.780
 so your bird will see everything about 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.539
 the head or more I do not know what it is 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.580
 but you have to know that the first will be 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.390
 slightly more imposing and straighten 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.340
 than the second 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.649
 I quickly schematize these two 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.869
 parts in the middle will be our right 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.820
 starting point we did at the beginning and we 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.220
 will anchor the contours of the character 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.610
 then the thickness of the bird will be more 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.320
 imposing more important down so at the 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.960
 to follow directly the rounding of the 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.140
 starting circle I'm going to leave almost 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.530
 right up to the very green y until 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.440
 very horizontal to then follow 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.230
 the rounding of the circle and that will make us a 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.060
 nice belly euros we did a third of the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.920
 drawing now I place two more 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.530
 lines between the point and the edges of the 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.440
 circle to position the ends 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.540
 eyebrows a kind of landmark that goes 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.040
 help us then for the rest it will be 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.019
 a little harder to describe but that 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.910
 stay simple I lie down again 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.340
 slightly the point but this time towards 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.470
 the bottom and I draw a trapeze on 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.989
 which with the pencil I am going to modify 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.180
 the outlines to round them up so what 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.100
 trapeze the asra the bate of course and the 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.370
 upper part of the beak will be more 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.709
 big and will sting down now 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.450
 the eyes roughly at the same level as 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.270
 the right and left end of the beak 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.840
 I'm doing two half circles in which 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.670
 I like plants 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.459
 two other small circles for the 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.440
 direction of gaze once we have 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.410
 our sketch we can anchor all with 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.330
 black 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.340
 once finished, only the areas 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.540
 to color boundaries and there is nothing 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.880
 of complicated the best is to 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.130
 make landmarks each time with a 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.940
 dry pencil for variations of 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.160
 colors etc 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.500
 members or every element of the 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.010
 character I am in will be two 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.590
 pencil structures the more the task will be 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.100
 simpler we will say for the steps 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.610
 following 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.200
 so here we color with dry pastel 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.930
 coloring remains one of the steps the 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.590
 more simple past so here is our 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.880
 final drawing 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.280
 and here to delight dongling fans 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.170
 birch seat will never say the same 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.010
 way it does not matter so a little 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.090
 simple technique to anchor and 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.930
 I was going to forget something 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.320
 I received this comment from 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.180

 so I allow myself to respond to video 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.730
 delighted that you like possible drawing 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.680
 also what I do 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.019
 you say you want to make videos 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.450
 also in parentheses I quote I do not
