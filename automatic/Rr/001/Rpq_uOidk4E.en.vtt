a<00:02:02.560> good<00:02:02.890> idea<00:02:03.009> she<00:02:03.549> used<00:02:03.759> it<00:02:03.909> for<00:02:03.939> upgrades<00:02:05.040> but

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
a good idea she used it for upgrades but

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.100 
a good idea she used it for upgrades but
he<00:02:06.130> asked<00:02:06.340> for<00:02:06.520> urban<00:02:07.060> cohorts<00:02:07.540> he<00:02:07.689> has<00:02:07.810> four

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
heavy a very heavy army he's really just

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.800

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
going to be providing morale boosting in

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.990 
going to be providing morale boosting in
my<00:02:37.780> army<00:02:38.130> he's<00:02:39.130> brought<00:02:39.310> in<00:02:39.430> one<00:02:39.580> of<00:02:39.610> his<00:02:39.760> units

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
my army he's brought in one of his units

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
so I've tried to catch him with my

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.620 
so I've tried to catch him with my
legionary<00:02:44.080> cavalry<00:02:44.530> but<00:02:45.190> I<00:02:45.220> was<00:02:45.459> too<00:02:45.610> late<00:02:45.790> and

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
legionary cavalry but I was too late and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.020 
legionary cavalry but I was too late and
on<00:02:46.750> this<00:02:46.900> flank<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.530> people<00:02:48.459> stormed<00:02:48.790> for<00:02:48.910> this

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
on this flank I people stormed for this

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.910 
on this flank I people stormed for this
unit<00:02:49.299> of<00:02:49.420> urban<00:02:49.720> cohorts<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.380> then<00:02:50.530> charged

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
unit of urban cohorts and then charged

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.190 
unit of urban cohorts and then charged
them<00:02:51.190> with<00:02:51.400> my<00:02:51.970> praetorium<00:02:52.630> in<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.780> legionary

them with my praetorium in the legionary

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.280 
them with my praetorium in the legionary
so<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.190> this<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:54.849> his<00:02:55.120> weak<00:02:55.330> flank<00:02:55.660> that's<00:02:56.049> my

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
so this this is his weak flank that's my

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.860 
so this this is his weak flank that's my
weak<00:02:56.530> flank<00:02:56.860> here<00:02:57.640> once<00:02:57.940> again<00:02:58.060> my<00:02:58.420> opponent

has<00:02:58.989> made<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.500> rash<00:02:59.830> decision<00:03:00.459> that<00:03:00.640> his

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
has made the rash decision that his

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.500 
has made the rash decision that his
Praetorian<00:03:01.209> cavalry<00:03:01.810> can<00:03:01.989> charge<00:03:02.230> right

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
Praetorian cavalry can charge right

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.570 

it<00:03:04.959> didn't<00:03:05.230> happen<00:03:05.379> especially<00:03:05.890> because<00:03:06.280> my

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
it didn't happen especially because my

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.520 
it didn't happen especially because my
achillea<00:03:07.030> infantry<00:03:07.510> met<00:03:07.750> his<00:03:07.959> charge<00:03:08.260> with

his army is gonna be crushed so my

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.030 
his army is gonna be crushed so my
opponent<00:03:48.180> here<00:03:48.510> relied<00:03:49.019> on<00:03:49.050> overpowered

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
opponent here relied on overpowered

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.070 
opponent here relied on overpowered
units<00:03:50.400> rather<00:03:50.790> than<00:03:51.090> get<00:03:51.269> maneuvering<00:03:51.750> and

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
units rather than get maneuvering and

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.490 
units rather than get maneuvering and
costume<00:03:53.330> he<00:03:54.330> brought<00:03:54.600> her<00:03:54.750> van<00:03:54.900> cohorts<00:03:55.380> and

costume he brought her van cohorts and

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.990 
costume he brought her van cohorts and
just<00:03:55.650> figured<00:03:55.920> that<00:03:56.100> he'd<00:03:56.220> get<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.430> and

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
just figured that he'd get a and

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.670 
just figured that he'd get a and
praetorium<00:03:57.660> cavalry<00:03:58.080> and<00:03:58.200> figured<00:03:58.470> he<00:03:58.530> could

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
praetorium cavalry and figured he could

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.350 
praetorium cavalry and figured he could
just<00:03:58.799> get<00:03:58.920> a<00:03:58.980> blunt<00:03:59.370> force<00:03:59.670> its<00:03:59.880> way<00:04:00.000> into<00:04:00.150> my

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
just get a blunt force its way into my

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.400 
just get a blunt force its way into my
army<00:04:00.860> that<00:04:01.860> was<00:04:02.310> not<00:04:02.489> a<00:04:02.519> good<00:04:02.700> decision<00:04:03.350> so<00:04:04.350> you

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
army that was not a good decision so you

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.440 
army that was not a good decision so you
can<00:04:04.590> see<00:04:04.769> that<00:04:05.160> really<00:04:05.340> Rome<00:04:05.760> superior

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
can see that really Rome superior

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.970 
can see that really Rome superior
strength<00:04:06.750> comes<00:04:07.140> through<00:04:07.440> in<00:04:07.620> their<00:04:07.769> new

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
strength comes through in their new

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.250 
strength comes through in their new
group<00:04:08.280> which<00:04:08.970> was<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.239> case<00:04:09.450> historically<00:04:09.870> as

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
group which was the case historically as

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.540 
group which was the case historically as
well<00:04:10.430> so<00:04:11.430> even<00:04:11.760> if<00:04:11.849> you<00:04:11.940> bring

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
well so even if you bring

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.940 
well so even if you bring
fraid<00:04:14.209> to<00:04:14.239> Aryan<00:04:14.569> cavalry<00:04:15.020> and<00:04:15.170> urban<00:04:15.470> cohorts

fraid to Aryan cavalry and urban cohorts

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.310 
fraid to Aryan cavalry and urban cohorts
your<00:04:16.310> army<00:04:16.579> would<00:04:16.730> be<00:04:16.850> even<00:04:17.209> yet<00:04:17.389> better<00:04:17.660> if

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
your army would be even yet better if

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.650 
your army would be even yet better if
you<00:04:18.470> would<00:04:18.620> prove<00:04:18.919> her<00:04:19.040> properly<00:04:19.510> now<00:04:20.510> my

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
you would prove her properly now my

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.870 
you would prove her properly now my
father<00:04:20.900> played<00:04:21.169> a<00:04:21.200> good<00:04:21.350> game<00:04:21.410> he<00:04:22.130> said<00:04:22.669> good

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
father played a good game he said good

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.460

game<00:04:23.090> when<00:04:23.270> I<00:04:23.300> was<00:04:23.450> over<00:04:23.690> but<00:04:23.870> for<00:04:23.990> some<00:04:24.139> reason

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
game when I was over but for some reason

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.040 
game when I was over but for some reason
he<00:04:24.650> quit<00:04:24.950> and<00:04:25.250> it<00:04:26.000> terminated<00:04:26.450> the<00:04:26.630> game<00:04:26.810> so<00:04:27.020> I

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
he quit and it terminated the game so I

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.590 
he quit and it terminated the game so I

time<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:29.930> battle<00:04:30.080> ended<00:04:30.410> I<00:04:30.470> think<00:04:30.770> I<00:04:30.860> had

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
time the battle ended I think I had

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.850 
time the battle ended I think I had
about<00:04:31.430> 600<00:04:32.120> and<00:04:32.360> something<00:04:32.570> kills<00:04:32.960> my

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
opponent had 300 some odd kills he

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.020 
opponent had 300 some odd kills he
deployed<00:04:37.040> about<00:04:37.280> a<00:04:37.310> hundred<00:04:37.639> more<00:04:37.760> men<00:04:38.000> than

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
deployed about a hundred more men than

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.420 
deployed about a hundred more men than
me<00:04:38.330> so<00:04:38.780> you<00:04:39.470> can<00:04:39.830> see<00:04:39.860> that<00:04:40.040> was<00:04:40.130> going<00:04:40.190> to<00:04:40.310> be<00:04:40.400> a
