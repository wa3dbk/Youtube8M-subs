more<00:00:42.080> out<00:00:42.290> of<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.500> suit<00:00:42.710> I<00:00:42.890> know<00:00:42.950> that<00:00:43.250> was<00:00:43.550> a

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
more out of the suit I know that was a

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.670 
more out of the suit I know that was a
turnoff<00:00:43.850> for<00:00:44.000> some<00:00:44.270> people<00:00:44.600> but<00:00:45.290> we<00:00:45.440> have<00:00:45.560> to

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
turnoff for some people but we have to

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.230 
turnoff for some people but we have to
remember<00:00:45.800> that<00:00:46.040> Tony<00:00:46.460> is<00:00:46.580> more<00:00:46.880> than<00:00:47.000> capable

of<00:00:47.890> being<00:00:48.890> a<00:00:49.070> superhero<00:00:49.400> and<00:00:49.940> doing<00:00:50.390> good<00:00:50.570> when

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
of being a superhero and doing good when

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.720 
of being a superhero and doing good when
he's<00:00:51.050> outside<00:00:51.200> of<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:51.560> tube<00:00:51.770> he<00:00:52.310> has<00:00:52.490> to<00:00:52.640> be

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
he's outside of the tube he has to be

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.760 
he's outside of the tube he has to be
more<00:00:52.940> than<00:00:52.970> just<00:00:53.150> the<00:00:53.450> soup<00:00:53.660> and<00:00:53.810> they<00:00:54.530> did<00:00:54.740> a

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
more than just the soup and they did a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.860 
more than just the soup and they did a
good<00:00:54.920> job<00:00:54.980> I<00:00:55.490> think<00:00:55.940> highlighting<00:00:56.540> that<00:00:56.660> uh

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
good job I think highlighting that uh

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
syndrome it made him more human showing

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.550

nothing will change that but overall

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.560 
nothing will change that but overall
it's<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.410> very<00:03:16.440> it's<00:03:16.920> better<00:03:17.790> than<00:03:17.940> I<00:03:18.209> did<00:03:18.330> like

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
it's a very it's better than I did like

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.240 
it's a very it's better than I did like
it<00:03:18.600> better<00:03:18.810> than<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.019> second<00:03:19.440> one<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.739> thought

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
it better than the second one I thought

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.860 
it better than the second one I thought
the<00:03:20.430> scene<00:03:20.730> when<00:03:21.300> they're<00:03:21.420> falling<00:03:21.750> out<00:03:21.840> the

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
the scene when they're falling out the

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.720 
the scene when they're falling out the
plane<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.470> he<00:03:22.560> catches<00:03:22.769> all<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:23.370> them<00:03:23.519> I

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
plane and he catches all of them I

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.910 
plane and he catches all of them I
thought<00:03:24.090> that<00:03:24.150> was<00:03:24.450> great<00:03:24.630> only<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.590> find<00:03:25.739> out

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
thought that was great only to find out

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.940 
thought that was great only to find out
later<00:03:26.130> that<00:03:26.340> he's<00:03:26.670> remote<00:03:27.000> piloting<00:03:27.950> was

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950

post-traumatic stress syndrome attacks

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.730 
post-traumatic stress syndrome attacks
and<00:04:57.370> kind<00:04:58.370> of<00:04:58.520> because<00:04:59.300> of<00:04:59.450> that<00:04:59.630> it<00:05:00.290> allows<00:05:00.710> a

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
and kind of because of that it allows a

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.100 
and kind of because of that it allows a
little<00:05:00.980> Tron<00:05:01.190> to<00:05:01.490> achieve<00:05:02.480> what<00:05:02.780> he<00:05:02.810> set<00:05:03.080> out

little Tron to achieve what he set out

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.020 
little Tron to achieve what he set out
to<00:05:03.290> do<00:05:03.440> at<00:05:03.560> that<00:05:03.740> scene<00:05:03.980> you<00:05:04.610> know<00:05:04.640> something

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
to do at that scene you know something

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.340 
to do at that scene you know something
like<00:05:05.060> that<00:05:05.360> and<00:05:05.510> we<00:05:05.630> don't<00:05:05.750> know<00:05:05.930> yet<00:05:06.140> because

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
like that and we don't know yet because

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.800 
like that and we don't know yet because
there's<00:05:06.710> been<00:05:06.890> no<00:05:07.100> indication<00:05:07.340> as<00:05:08.060> to<00:05:08.480> whether

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
there's been no indication as to whether

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.960 
there's been no indication as to whether
or<00:05:08.990> not<00:05:09.080> Tony's<00:05:09.980> post-traumatic<00:05:10.610> stress

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
or not Tony's post-traumatic stress

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.670 
or not Tony's post-traumatic stress
syndrome<00:05:11.210> from<00:05:11.540> iron<00:05:11.780> man<00:05:11.990> 3<00:05:12.230> is<00:05:12.380> going<00:05:12.590> to

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
syndrome from iron man 3 is going to

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.230 
syndrome from iron man 3 is going to
carry<00:05:12.860> over<00:05:13.070> into<00:05:13.220> Avengers<00:05:13.820> age<00:05:13.970> of<00:05:14.030> Ultron

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
carry over into Avengers age of Ultron

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.700 
carry over into Avengers age of Ultron
so<00:05:15.020> I<00:05:15.050> think<00:05:15.140> that<00:05:15.320> would<00:05:15.440> be<00:05:15.560> pretty

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
so I think that would be pretty

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.870 
so I think that would be pretty
interesting<00:05:16.190> if<00:05:16.340> that's<00:05:16.490> something<00:05:16.669> they

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
interesting if that's something they

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.510 
interesting if that's something they
play<00:05:17.090> on<00:05:17.240> I<00:05:17.450> kind<00:05:17.900> of<00:05:18.050> hope<00:05:18.260> they<00:05:18.470> do<00:05:18.770> and<00:05:19.070> if

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
play on I kind of hope they do and if

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.340 
play on I kind of hope they do and if
nothing<00:05:19.910> else<00:05:20.060> I<00:05:20.270> kind<00:05:20.510> of<00:05:20.660> hope<00:05:20.840> that<00:05:20.870> if<00:05:21.169> they

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
nothing else I kind of hope that if they

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.230 
nothing else I kind of hope that if they
if<00:05:21.860> they've<00:05:22.070> gotten<00:05:22.370> if<00:05:22.550> they've<00:05:22.700> gone<00:05:22.940> by

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
if they've gotten if they've gone by

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.080 
if they've gotten if they've gone by
that<00:05:23.270> if<00:05:23.750> they're<00:05:24.350> leaving<00:05:24.800> that<00:05:24.950> behind<00:05:25.100> I'm

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
that if they're leaving that behind I'm

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.930 
that if they're leaving that behind I'm
kind<00:05:26.330> of<00:05:26.360> hoping<00:05:26.570> they<00:05:26.750> at<00:05:27.110> least<00:05:27.490> show<00:05:28.490> or

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
kind of hoping they at least show or

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.150 
kind of hoping they at least show or
maybe<00:05:29.120> at<00:05:29.570> least<00:05:30.140> for<00:05:30.350> a<00:05:30.380> little<00:05:30.530> bit<00:05:30.680> explain

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
maybe at least for a little bit explain

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.180 
maybe at least for a little bit explain
