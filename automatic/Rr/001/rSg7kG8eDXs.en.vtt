00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.809
 parts of belgium as a bag so yours 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.330
 may wonder how i'm in 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.379
 all star trek could not come now like 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.760
 you already knew 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.710
 has two months like that again 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.320
 announced that they are running 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.519
 do outings for both that 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.920
 as for 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.349
 comes this is players i have with then 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.230
 immediately enrolled to do revolving 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.880
 as that player and that first actually 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.920
 few expectations but then the all 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.290
 stars members we basically remained creek 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.239
 a little help after a few 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.190
 For weeks , Louis a Tiger started 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.100
 but also the ones with their godfather 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.539
 and I didn't understand well at first 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.280
 why i had to walk play with her 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.200
 because I registered as 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.940
 that player and not as competitive 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.989
 player 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.620
 now in the end it's all good 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.059
 I ended up as a station 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.789
 I was once basically home 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.680
 chilled as a pap player and not when comes 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.140
 with the player I am currently stuffing 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.540
 more that play than 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.950
 and I still speak puppies occasionally 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.330
 please touch 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.340
 because I actually myself a 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.040
 device I had put in start of place 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.140
 on line and that was the pick of all 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.020
 diamont rooms for both my primary 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.509

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.970
 primary and my specials I already have those 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.009
 coin but for my diapers it 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.900
 I agree with the FHJ 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.900
 and as the gamepad suggests am 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.640
 I am currently working with them tips 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.890

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.229
 I just got 100 shots for them 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.460

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.110

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.399
