00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 the mobility in our city is 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:10.950
 unviable we urgently need a 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.630
 solution to this calculation the memorandum 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.429
 more or less, it came into the hands of 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.690
 transport secretary from london there 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.910
 by the 19th century 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.710
 this is a problem to solve in that 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.630
 time the roughly 1 million 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.180
 inhabitants of london needed 4 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.949
 millions of horses to take care of 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.930
 your trips around the city 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.630
 the result of this is a trace of nothing 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.430
 less than six tons of coconut 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.840
 horse on the streets of london 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.719
 and then they started thinking about a 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.610
 solution because of mobility have arrived 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.370
 a project of nothing less than the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.320
 that a diaper to keep them serious 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.420
 they thought that the diapers for horse 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.370
 was a great mobility solution for 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.960
 the city of london and of course it was not 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.160
 No, I apologize for the example. 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.600
 eschatological 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
 but I think the diapers for horses 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.989
 are a great way for us to understand 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.030
 the importance of knowing what the problem is 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.680
 that we are attacking with a project 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.109
 We are proposing diapers. 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.030
 for horses is a simple solution 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.890
 to a problem that is complex 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.880
 We used to call it a problem. 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.540
 generic things like transit housing 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.490
 mobility 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.080
 indeed, these themes hide within 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.960
 of itself a tangle of problems 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.580
 complex and often local 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.140
 and it's important that we understand a 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.820
 a little more clarity what is the problem 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.770
 that people are attacking that people 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.170
 need to learn to diagnose in our 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.790
 own city in our own neighborhood 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.979
 traffic is a generic theme but the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.079
 lack of signage at the bus stop 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.390
 near my house is a problem 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.549
 palpable is in this type of problem that I 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.170
 I suggest you focus on thinking 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.689
 what kind of solution do you want to 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.430
 society the lack of bench in the square 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.350
 at the end of the street there is a lack of food 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.200
 to buy near your home 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.659
 the lack of urban furniture in the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.970
 green spaces of plants planted in the 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.649
 society, all these problems are more 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.119
 palpable are problems that people 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.100
 Can you see that we can 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.909
 realize just how they are 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.290
 formed 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.360
 My suggestion is that you get these 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.430
 problems and put that same map 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.259
 in which you had already drawn your 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.899
 and that you had already searched 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.119
 between society the clearer and more 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.770
 well defined was your biggest problem is 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.960
 the chance you can think of a 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.450
 solution that can solve it 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.310
 although this solution only has an effect on the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.020
 Scale your neighborhood from your block 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.760
 matter this is a first step 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.900
 necessary to start building a 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.670
 better place to live 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.020
 this solution you found maybe 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.940
 can be replicated elsewhere 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.350
 who have similar problems hence the 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.730
 It is important for you to be clear that 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.730
 kind of problem you're attacking 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.150
 super important that you understand that 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.880
 type of equipment what type of 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.680
 what kind of qualities does your 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.270
 neighborhood has to understand how they 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.830
 can be activated at the time of thinking 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.900
 in a solution why try to make a 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.970
 solution alone gives much more work 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.950
 use the potentials you already have in your 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.760
 region may be the way to do it. 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.770
 to work out 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.540
 remember that map of the last class in 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.580
 that you draw a path that you 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.500
 do it with a certain frequency and then 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.660
 investigated the surroundings of this route 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.510
 so I suggest you take this 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.270
 same map and try to locate there in that 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.130
 the problems of the city and the 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.160
 that can be activated in the 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.310
 their solution maps these two things 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.590
 and look there examine your map because the 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.600
 chance you have found potential 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.610
 that can be activated as solutions 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.650
 problems is great and this will be 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.490
 important when it comes to acting is the 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.490
 from our next class
