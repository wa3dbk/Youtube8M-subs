00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.800
 the idea was to find everything 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.670
 that he had closed an account where the 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.540
 creations he had done and 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.840
 naturally I could not have 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.890
 present 30 broom in the evening 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.439
 but I chose 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.480
 I chose ten pieces of ballet that's 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.970
 really traveling in the 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.309
 twenty years experience for students 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.350
 of the school to really touch a lot 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.800
 Jean Christophe's neck 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.329
 jersey and I hope an evening touch 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.059
 for him too to watch a little bit 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.410
 without any very happy ambition that the 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.280
 part of school that's what the school is 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.390
 really work 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.100
 he is completely different when 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.449
 work of the company but I hope to 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.370
 evening and also touches for him for 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.350
 revisit a little bit what happened in 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.470
 the last twenty years of his career at 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.470
 Monaco 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.089
 a few months ago when I started 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.400
 to think about this evening I started to 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.940
 watch the ballet game the choice was 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.740
 made 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.030
 according to some ballets in relation to this 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.980
 that school could do the students 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.170
 could do and after I got one 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.660
 little adventurous in five years but the 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.550
 counters but juliette not really because 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.780
 that students can do it well 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.250
 because it's the clever ones who are very 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.540
 difficult because I know it 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.560
 I was very emotional about 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.490
 christophe is a ballet that 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.080
 touches a lot 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.910
 so I'll do you these little ones these 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:36.080
 small gifts while staying very 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:37.520
 humble they are very excited 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.740
 naturally on all the excited ones of 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.990
 can do things that sees each 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.610
 year in this by the company we have 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.860
 lucky this year to work with 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.480
 last coppieters the ballet master 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.690
 the teachers of the academy 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.890
 the three professors olivier carol who 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.840
 were launched at jean christophe's 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.660
 go back the whales bernier this like 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.650
 today he comes for to clean 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.790
 a bit hard to give but the 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.050
 difficulty that was it's 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.910
 students who are not going to work with 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.080
 christophe jean so I also choose 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.950
 mainly students who had 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.750
 already worked with jean christophe 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.160
 last year who knew him a little 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.179
 more than they understood a small step 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.460
 but a little bit more what we can 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.890
 understand a few days of rehearsal 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.390
 with the choice was also made by 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.770
 relation to who was dancing what was it 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.910
 like that and after there is always a 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.620
 choice 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.850
 a natural choice that is done that wants 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.770
 say never two three people under the 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.750
 the same role is well by little here is there 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.700
 has some who learns team ago 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.800
 some who start very high but at 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.000
 as you go and progress I do not think 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.770
 that these shows is the first 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.820
 show really they understood that 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.020
 is what it means to be release 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.390
 professional because that's 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.880
 really we give the same food to 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.590
 every student and every one after he actually 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.550
 of something better from each other and 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.380
 that's where it's like in a 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.670
 company that's where we see it 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.630
 really progresses to see who makes a 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.630
 personal work too
