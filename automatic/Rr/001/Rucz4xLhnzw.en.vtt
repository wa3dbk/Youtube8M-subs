if you would want to use it just try to

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.360 
if you would want to use it just try to
steal<00:03:05.600> with<00:03:05.780> something<00:03:06.140> heavy<00:03:06.380> to<00:03:07.040> keep<00:03:07.220> the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
steal with something heavy to keep the

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.390 
steal with something heavy to keep the
coconut<00:03:07.970> oil<00:03:08.360> in<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:09.020> believe<00:03:09.380> from<00:03:10.310> what

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
coconut oil in it I believe from what

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.160 
coconut oil in it I believe from what
I've<00:03:10.670> read<00:03:10.880> coconuts<00:03:11.360> all<00:03:11.570> your<00:03:11.720> penetrates

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
I've read coconuts all your penetrates

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.690 
I've read coconuts all your penetrates
the<00:03:12.320> hair<00:03:12.350> strands<00:03:12.830> or<00:03:13.070> something<00:03:13.400> like<00:03:13.489> that

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
the hair strands or something like that

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.940 
the hair strands or something like that
so<00:03:13.910> it<00:03:14.420> gets<00:03:14.630> absorbed<00:03:14.840> into<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.380> hair<00:03:15.560> is<00:03:15.709> so

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
so it gets absorbed into the hair is so

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.240 
so it gets absorbed into the hair is so
so<00:03:16.250> when<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.550> see<00:03:16.850> you<00:03:17.030> you<00:03:17.810> are<00:03:18.250> protecting

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
the hair from losing the moisture since

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.710 
the hair from losing the moisture since
the<00:03:21.110> coconut<00:03:21.440> oil<00:03:21.560> will<00:03:21.770> go<00:03:21.920> to<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.160> head

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720
