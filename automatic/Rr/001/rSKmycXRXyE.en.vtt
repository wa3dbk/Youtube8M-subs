00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
visual issues that are just the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.600 
visual issues that are just the
occasional<00:02:04.049> glitch<00:02:04.500> then<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.130> suggest<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.460> let

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
occasional glitch then I suggest you let

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.370 
occasional glitch then I suggest you let
you<00:02:05.759> be<00:02:05.880> soft<00:02:06.090> nose<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.479> course<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:07.110> best<00:02:07.259> way

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
you be soft nose of course the best way

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.979 
you be soft nose of course the best way
they<00:02:07.799> can<00:02:08.030> nip<00:02:09.030> these<00:02:09.179> things<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.599> bud<00:02:09.750> is

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
they can nip these things in the bud is

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.110 
they can nip these things in the bud is
if<00:02:10.770> we<00:02:10.920> let<00:02:11.069> them<00:02:11.190> know<00:02:11.250> as<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.790> course<00:02:12.000> there

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120

they do actually have it ready and
raring<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.730> go<00:02:44.880> on<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.540> day<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:45.720> launch<00:02:46.050> so<00:02:46.500> I

raring to go on the day of launch so I
suggest<00:02:47.519> you<00:02:47.640> just<00:02:47.940> make<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:48.330> number<00:02:48.780> one

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
suggest you just make that number one

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.690 
suggest you just make that number one
priority<00:02:49.410> if<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.620> wanted<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.280> play<00:02:50.340> this<00:02:50.519> game
