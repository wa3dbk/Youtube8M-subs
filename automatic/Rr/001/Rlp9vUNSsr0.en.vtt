00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.530
 So far, treatments for 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.900
 mycosis for fungal infections 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:22.119
 on the feet are long and tedious and 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.930
 also with very limited results 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:28.570
 but there is a qualitative leap before 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.269
 we were talking about the laser the 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.190
 laser to treatment of infections 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.899
 by foot fungus, yes in the 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.850
 nails fundamentally as you say 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.130
 finally the laser arrived that that 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.320
 tool is not magic but let's 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.059
 say that it is almost almost magical because they are 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.190
 the innovations in you 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.899
 specialties in good podiatry 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.760
 currently it is used in 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.710
 physiotherapy is being used at the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.100
 the vascular was being used in 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.020
 ulcer healing but recently 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.640
 here in Spain is already being used in 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.079
 the US takes a little more time in 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.539
 Spain we have relatively little 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.800
 time using it in the treatment of 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.600
 mycosis in the nail 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.510
 if we are talking about a rate of 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.210
 efficiency greater than 80 percent good 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.479
 and there are authors who even talk about a 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.840
 98 percent in terms of sessions 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.950
 We are talking about three sessions 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.229
 Initially, I think it is necessary to do 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.200
 it is a crop to have the certainty that 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.240
 we are treating mushrooms that he is effective 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.650
 against fungi but is effective against 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.840
 other dermatological infections of the 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.360
 skin among other conditions today 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.520
 forgiveness of the skin of the nail once 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.990
 we have done that cultivation that what 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.369
 we are doing is that 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.649
 we apply the culture that takes 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.869
 approximately between 20 days a month 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:45.289
 between the results because a crop 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.619
 which is to apply on a medium 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:51.619
 appropriate about let's go to the field and 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:54.259
 is to apply on that planting in those 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.789
 little seeds leave that those cells and 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.080
 in it what are effectively leaving them 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.200
 grow and let's see what those are 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.390
 cells or what is the pathogenic agent 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.969
 once we have it we propose the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.930
 treatment and what we are doing is 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.910
 that with three sessions 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.940
 this note has been very very very 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.920
 high at the time of eliminating the duel a 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.320
 little bit like when we apply the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.640
 laser in hair removal hurts because what 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.860
 we have to get it is an increase of 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.570
 the temperature precisely to kill 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.230
 the fungus we have to reach a 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.420
 temperature below the nail between 44 and 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.850
 46 degrees then, as is logical 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.070
 is more a little bit if the result a 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.570
 bit annoying there is what defines it as 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.459
 very annoying and there you define it as 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.750
 slightly bothers annoyance that 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.050
 the time it ends disappear the 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.660
 session well and you have to do three 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.600
 sessions but if it's not like that 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.550
 treatment had can last for months not if 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.190
 the treatment of the nail problem 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.930
 of the nail fungus months clear 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.280
 one thing is the duration of the treatment 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.050
 and another thing is when we see the 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.450
 results when we talk about 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.580
 topical nail treatments that is 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.860
 as normal what are they doing 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.650
 they are by lacquers one of the great 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.390
 problems that we have is that you have to 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.670
 apply as you very well say you have to 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.900
 apply it for a very long time 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.970
 you would have to apply a minimum of four 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.080
 or six months depending on the collection and 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.050
 even years 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.670
 six months if there is daily 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.280
 daily applications applications 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.810
 weekly to pulsatile applications is 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.910
 say three times to the weeks twice 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.210
 a week once a week and the 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.380
 People usually end up getting tired the 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.840
 this is the other alternative that we have 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.970
 another part of the treatments is the 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.860
 systemic medication although it has 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.600
 many side effects because one 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.820
 very strong application and what it does is 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.460
 that the liver destroys it has many 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.470
 contraindications then it's not the 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.690
 panacea for the laser treatment is 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.860
 a little bit that solution that we were all 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.650
 waiting for that solution that all 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.140
 we were looking for and that we finally have 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.880
 she enters the field of podiatry 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.610
 thank goodness so juan ramón we have to 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.770
 clarify that the results although they are 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.020
 three applications but the results do not 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.030
 they are seen immediately because the nail 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.040
 it has to grow we have in mind that 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.370
 the period of nail growth is 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.470
 always the from four or five or 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.540
 six months even a year depending 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.760
 of the time that we have we are going to 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.890
 apply three sessions spaced between 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.390
 one week and fifteen days but the 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.950
 result we will not see up to three 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.810
 four five or six months 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.730
 it's a year the people one of the problems 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.310
 that we are finding is that 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.290
 they despair because they believe that by applying the 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.820
 treatment will see average results 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.820
 immediate and the results are 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.890
 conditioned to the growth of the nail 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.020
 we have observed that the nail grows 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:40.290
 much more quickly after 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.240
 apply the treatment but yes what 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.550
 that is inevitable is that until the 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.830
 union does not come complete also not 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.330
 we can re-grow for 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.580
 see if the fungi have disappeared 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.740
 complete or we have not seemed very well 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.270
 thank you very much doctor ready to 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.550
 you always come a novelty 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.490
 fantastic the application of links in 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.840
 the fungal problems in the nail very 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.660
 well because the time is shortened 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.120
 radically congratulations
