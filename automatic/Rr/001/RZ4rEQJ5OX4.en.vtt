00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.980
 Wolfgang Kolb a daughters ice dragons 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.050
 Really I have also spent this book at least in the first part of 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:13.629
 the two weekly meetings are 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:15.209
 the throne of dragonflies 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.570
 that the sequel found the time is ripe for everyday life 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.890
 I do not think so 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.819
 what is the coal mine that dragon 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:26.619
 it starts with it 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.480
 rsn prologue 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.180
 that a little girl has to experience as he moves whole village yellow 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.570
 the little one is the only survivor 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.190
 and immediately a manhunt tells the most prestigious story 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.510
 and this story is about this point 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.760
 she had a course-moving from Florian a 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.710
 the Austrian XDA has happened 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.290
 but he also warned them about them 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.170
 her whole not extinguished 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.940
 and since then they are for revenge 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.940
 she confirmed that dragons find these destroy 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.000
 It's a long way 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.080
 dangerous 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.490
 Pauli is stubbornly combative she can go well with sledges by customers 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.430
 and she knows what she wants 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.580
 on the way there 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.560
 then many allies Rapid has more or less people forcing them 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.460
 help on that last 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.730
 because she recruits she can cost whatever she wants 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.880
 consequently the level of fighting spirit Iniesta grows 6 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.920
 now 15 years 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.920
 5 of the freighter 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.810
 rtr is sure to find Aachen where they are 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.940
 Lord come 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.940
 but she lives 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.270
 and the biggest bloom certainly 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.900
 a vague one 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.100
 you can imagine that an oversized turtle 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.540
 the thing 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.609
 Red hats very strange what you notice in the book 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.749

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:23.949
 Dr Dirk Moritz learn something 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.419

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:33.479
 By the guest he is very long 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:37.939
 when her bus wanted Miltenberg's sea eagle Latus swatter 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.939
 the winner of the second phase is at take that afterwards 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.579
 «I do not want to betray criticism anymore while reading in the second part 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.449

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.959
 make everything clear after the first game 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.959
 he sums up enough again 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:21.119
 but it is good 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:24.119
 it's a fantasy-roman all-clear 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.079
 Yes 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.180

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:07.239
