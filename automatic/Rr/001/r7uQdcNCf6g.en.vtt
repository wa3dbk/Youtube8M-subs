00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:03.679
 m times perhaps the most famous western 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:04.240
 So 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.740
 and he is being written by military journals. 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.380
 factory news bulletins he's main 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.409
 TV star of the tank world 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:14.090
 the most modern Russian tank t 90 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.320
 they are both passengers in the west often not 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.300
 remembers 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.829
 nato experts 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:21.550
 about 90 climate is outdated 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.550
 Is it really true? 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.579
 All-Russian day of running 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.210
 but is it worth American and 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.470
 back 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.120
 the uninitiated can 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.180
 think that this car is of different classes 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.130
 t 90 much easier for americans 47 tons 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.220
 vs 60 4 oct he is much more compact 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.240
 does not look so impressive 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.500
 however, in the global arms markets these 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.060
 machines are not direct competitors and this 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.690
 due to their capacity we can be 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.650
 today is very and machine security 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.430
 simple comparison of injuries 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.490
 can't 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.890
 you need to know what the building consists of and 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.450
 Abrams used depleted uranium 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.450
 fans 90 built-in dynamic protection 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.689
 approval of the Americans 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.810
 frontal armor hydromassage proved 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.090
 its reliability during the war in iraq 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.110
 ninety-first and in 2030 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.180
 it can withstand the hit of the Soviet 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.510
 125 caliber armor piercing shells 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.780
 millimeters 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.040
 it does not say that 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.119
 what is it about oaz 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.479
 you yourself decommissioned as early as 70 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.000
 third years 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.740
 moreover modern 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.440
 shells share abramson then not 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.660
 fired 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.520
 but chose t 90 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.210
 during the test fired 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.670
 the latest subcaliber 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.330
 preventive shells 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.350
 the truth is not worth going along with the most 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.120
 modern projectile 120 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.150
 in china brazil 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.950
 condition 200 meters 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.430
 on the neck of the projectile 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.870
 after that the car came under its own power 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.710
 to the observation deck 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.920
 then without repairing an abortion 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.770
 people just set you up 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.850
 improved 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.090
 from grenade launchers 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.360
 The result is the same 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.820
 armor is not broken 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.830
 damage only airborne protective 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.609
 screen 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.930
 during the fighting in iraq in 2030 Spartak and 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.549
 Abrams made their way from rpg 7 and grenades 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.039
 even the very first samples 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:20.109
 in iraq revealed weaknesses and 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:20.810

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:25.149
 providing work throughout 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:26.609
 electronics at the moment 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.199
 when the main engine is plugged 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:32.379
 its easy going on caliber but machine gun 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.919
 here and 92 force is under 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.699
 main building 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:39.219
 besides t 90 even in standard 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:40.029
 performance 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:41.849
 equipped with optical complex

 electronic suppression rzh 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.530
 this system goes off enemy missiles 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.379
 the side 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.329
 Abrams bullet of such equipment 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.329
 there were situations of american tank 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.349
 unlikely to be able to resist in 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.849
 guided missile 90 launched in a year 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.659

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:03.049
 five kilometers 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.489
 accurate firing in this case 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.359
 approaching absolute 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.359
 rocket can shoot from the place and movements 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:11.229
 residents use 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:13.249
 no special skills required 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:15.189
 to patrimony 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.959
 power guns t 90 e bronze approximately 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.219
 are equivalent 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:20.989
 armor penetration domestic 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.769
 tungsten shells with nothing 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:24.789
 inferior to its competitor 

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:27.419
 American projectile cores 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.209
 from depleted uranium 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.959
 similar shells have been developed and we 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.529
 but they are extremely harmful for their crew 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:35.769
 mass production was 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.769
 postponed for a rainy day 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.609
 he can destroy not only 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.029
 armored targets 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:44.709
 but as the military say there kapa his 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:45.829
 living force 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.430
 That is, the protection of freeloaders 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.229
 in the calculations 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.959
 in this region the air is significantly 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.769
 surpasses m 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.669
 ammunition of our tank includes 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.819
 fragmentation shrapnel projectile and with 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.939
 remote undermining 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:00.579
 but you can blow right over your heads 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.989
 enemy soldiers 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.399
 in conclusions on the ice 

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:07.099
 Alas, there are no such projectiles 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.339
 For a long time, not without the help of Western 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:10.649
 military magazines 

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:12.329
 it was believed that electronics and 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.629
 optical devices to ours 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.719
 as they say imperfect 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:17.609
 in fact 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.459
 fire control complex at 90 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.729
 not inferior to NATO counterparts 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.949
 moreover, this bank belongs 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:26.949
 unofficial power record and 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.969
 rate of fire from the stands 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:29.749
 on one of the demonstrations 

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:32.329
 foreign delegations to workers 

00:04:32.329 --> 00:04:33.669
 and 90 thousand 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.210
 all 54 seconds 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.139
 and hit hard real targets 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.729
 located at a distance 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.319
 two and a half kilometers 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:44.509
 firing the outcome at a speed of 25 kilometers 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:45.479
 at one o'clock 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.559
 official record holder german 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:50.249
 leopard 2 in difficult conditions affects 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:52.860
 one goal less 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.699
 playing guided missiles amp t 90 possesses 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.449
 longest arm easel 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.719
 earlier versions of the t 90 acted quit 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:03.009
 mobility 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:04.819
 with the advent of a thousand strong engine 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.819
 our tank is almost on par with Abrams 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:10.499
 by this most important indicator 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:13.349
 dad cross-country these two tanks in general 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:14.620
 cannot be compared 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.430
 at the arms exhibition in abu dhabi 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.620
 in 93, I will tell you right away 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.010
 material student on the usual slope 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.930
 exhibition center friend 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.720
 our tank on competitive 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.830
 almost 3 thousand passed tests 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.020
 kilometers by impassable 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.120
 malay gilbert off-road in which 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.379
 make it competitors 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:36.339
 he showed himself brilliantly during 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:39.029
 march in the indian desert also arena 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:42.139
 exceeding 50 degrees 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:43.909
 an indispensable combat requirement 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:45.740
 future technology high 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.749
 computerization of machines 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:50.639
 in the near future on 3 90 will install a new 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.059
 satellite equipment 

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:54.599
 navigating this way abrams 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:56.029
 lose his last 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:59.189
 advantage over our country 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:01.659
 today up to 90 exceeds and 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:04.169
 overgrown by most indicators but 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.879
 absentee competition finish 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:08.629
 possibility of their modernization 

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:10.430
 almost exhausted 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.639
 on the battlefield soon introduced tanks in 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:13.289
 next year
