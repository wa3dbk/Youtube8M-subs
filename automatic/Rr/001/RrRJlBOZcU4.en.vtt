00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
because I would switch to the MacBook

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.740 
because I would switch to the MacBook
Pro<00:05:19.159> I<00:05:19.610> just<00:05:20.150> don't<00:05:20.270> know<00:05:20.360> like<00:05:20.389> the<00:05:20.599> main

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
Pro I just don't know like the main

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.719 
Pro I just don't know like the main
thing<00:05:20.960> for<00:05:20.990> me<00:05:21.139> is<00:05:21.530> for<00:05:22.220> some<00:05:22.370> reason<00:05:22.639> the

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
thing for me is for some reason the

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.270 
thing for me is for some reason the
upload<00:05:23.090> speed<00:05:23.240> on<00:05:23.599> this<00:05:23.840> computer<00:05:24.379> is<00:05:24.590> way

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
upload speed on this computer is way

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.309 
upload speed on this computer is way
slower<00:05:25.639> than<00:05:25.879> the<00:05:25.970> upload<00:05:26.270> speed<00:05:26.449> on<00:05:26.840> my<00:05:26.900> old

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 
slower than the upload speed on my old

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:29.529 
slower than the upload speed on my old
PC<00:05:28.039> laptop<00:05:28.520> so<00:05:28.729> it<00:05:28.819> doesn't<00:05:29.060> have<00:05:29.150> anything<00:05:29.360> to

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
PC laptop so it doesn't have anything to

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.149 
PC laptop so it doesn't have anything to
do<00:05:29.659> was<00:05:29.990> like<00:05:30.080> my<00:05:30.259> actual<00:05:30.650> like<00:05:30.770> internet

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:31.159 
do was like my actual like internet

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:34.209 
do was like my actual like internet
connection<00:05:31.840> and<00:05:32.840> then<00:05:33.199> also<00:05:33.379> I<00:05:33.860> could<00:05:34.009> return

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
connection and then also I could return

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:38.170 
connection and then also I could return
this<00:05:34.400> cord<00:05:35.469> so<00:05:36.469> I'd<00:05:36.710> get<00:05:36.860> like<00:05:36.919> 20<00:05:37.729> bucks<00:05:37.849> back

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
this cord so I'd get like 20 bucks back

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.209 
this cord so I'd get like 20 bucks back
but<00:05:38.539> I<00:05:38.810> feel<00:05:39.080> like<00:05:39.199> I<00:05:39.379> would<00:05:39.530> probably<00:05:39.770> have<00:05:40.099> to

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:40.219 
but I feel like I would probably have to

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:42.100 
but I feel like I would probably have to
end<00:05:40.370> up<00:05:40.460> getting<00:05:40.610> more<00:05:41.090> adapters<00:05:41.780> for<00:05:42.020> that

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
end up getting more adapters for that

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.409 
end up getting more adapters for that
pour<00:05:44.710> this<00:05:45.710> one<00:05:45.889> was<00:05:46.009> like<00:05:46.069> 25<00:05:46.969> I<00:05:47.000> think<00:05:47.150> but
