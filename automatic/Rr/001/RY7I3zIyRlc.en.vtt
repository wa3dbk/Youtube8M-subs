00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:07.280
 so and then we do the same 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:19.320
 I will now tie the first column 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:28.800
 here I will also link 1 1 column to the first 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:38.149
 a column of added but in the second I 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:38.149
 I will connect 2 of 2 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.680
 then again I will need all the columns 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.469
 knit one by one and here's the next one 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.629
 second to knit 2 respectively 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.730
 the distance between the bars that is here 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.399
 I tied two 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:02.210
 farther I have two times three 4 5 six 7 8 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:04.430
 and in column 9 I will tie 2, that is, on 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.950
 one has increased this distance 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.450
 between additives that is on each row 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:17.810
 this amount will increase by 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:21.530
 one bar since we only have 12 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.899
 directions and in each I add because 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.740
 column respectively on each row at 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.509
 I will be added to the 12 columns 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.030
 that is, you can track the number 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:38.659
 columns and in this way that is 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:40.190
 each time you need to add 12 and so 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.490
 so I tied the length 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.369
 dizzy with increasing loops in my 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.299
 get a round shape that is like this 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.380
 that's better to turn 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:57.829
 to make it clear here with me 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:02:02.289
 connected two times three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.289
 rows which is approximately 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:16.200
 somewhere around 13 13 half 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:19.020
 centimeters ground adding from me 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.180
 here are the stripes 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:26.310
 whole basically this circle shape but if 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:30.130
 to be quite accurate is the 12th triangle 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.200
 because places are adding in places 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:39.250
 additions turn out such small 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:41.230
 corners practically on this one can work 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.739
 finish the only thing you can 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:51.880
 add it do the harness 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:53.890
 I'm not going to leave it there and like that 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.540
 the finished job will look like this 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.239
 the only thing you need to trim 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.440
 thread and remove her tie tail 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.440
 remove her knitting
