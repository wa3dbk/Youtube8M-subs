the bad you know everything is black and

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.570 
the bad you know everything is black and
white<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.890> it's<00:02:50.790> very<00:02:51.540> fear-based<00:02:52.580> very

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
white and it's very fear-based very

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:01.100 
white and it's very fear-based very
fear-based<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:55.070> and<00:02:56.070> so<00:02:56.900> it<00:02:57.900> really<00:03:00.110> felt

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
fear-based and and so it really felt

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.130 
fear-based and and so it really felt
like<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.590> bait<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:01.920> switch<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.959> that<00:03:03.959> they

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
like a bait and switch and that they

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.040 
like a bait and switch and that they
weren't<00:03:04.350> honest<00:03:04.950> in<00:03:05.220> in<00:03:06.090> what<00:03:06.330> was<00:03:06.540> taking

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
weren't honest in in what was taking

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.860 
weren't honest in in what was taking
place<00:03:07.310> because<00:03:08.310> if<00:03:08.670> they<00:03:08.820> had<00:03:08.850> set<00:03:09.390> up<00:03:09.540> front

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
place because if they had set up front

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.560 
place because if they had set up front
that<00:03:10.020> this<00:03:10.380> was<00:03:10.650> for<00:03:10.950> Fallon<00:03:11.430> dafa<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.180> it's

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
that this was for Fallon dafa and it's

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.430 
that this was for Fallon dafa and it's
all<00:03:12.720> about<00:03:13.020> Fallon<00:03:13.380> dafa<00:03:14.300> then<00:03:15.300> I<00:03:15.570> doubt<00:03:16.200> we

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
all about Fallon dafa then I doubt we

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.300 
all about Fallon dafa then I doubt we
would<00:03:16.620> have<00:03:16.770> bought<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.280> tickets<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:19.470> I'm

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
would have bought the tickets and I'm

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.830 
would have bought the tickets and I'm
sure<00:03:20.549> that<00:03:20.580> a<00:03:20.790> lot<00:03:21.060> of<00:03:21.090> people<00:03:21.209> that<00:03:21.690> buy

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
sure that a lot of people that buy

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.870
