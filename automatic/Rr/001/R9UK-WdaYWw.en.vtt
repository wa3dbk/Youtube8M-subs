some<00:00:32.340> wires<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> bottom<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.450> will

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
some wires on the bottom and this will

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.910 
some wires on the bottom and this will
sit<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:34.190> my<00:00:35.190> seat<00:00:36.320> that'll<00:00:37.320> be<00:00:37.380> my<00:00:37.500> switch<00:00:37.680> box

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
sit in my seat that'll be my switch box

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.560 
sit in my seat that'll be my switch box
let's<00:00:38.340> go<00:00:38.460> do<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.640> alright<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.180> plug<00:00:39.390> me<00:00:39.540> a

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
let's go do that alright so I plug me a

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.779 
let's go do that alright so I plug me a
what<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.230> think<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.590> half<00:00:40.770> inch<00:00:41.899> 1/2<00:00:42.899> or<00:00:43.789> 1/2

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
what I think it's a half inch 1/2 or 1/2

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.720 
what I think it's a half inch 1/2 or 1/2
inch<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.390> hole<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.050> bottom<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.770> then

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
inch the hole in the bottom and then

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.130 
inch the hole in the bottom and then
what<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.879> did<00:00:47.969> was<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.329> measured<00:00:48.690> my<00:00:48.840> switching

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
what I did was I measured my switching

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.750 
what I did was I measured my switching
us<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.500> these<00:00:49.980> are<00:00:50.190> switches<00:00:50.489> they're<00:00:50.610> just

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
us it is these are switches they're just

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.520 
us it is these are switches they're just
a<00:00:50.820> little<00:00:50.879> momentary<00:00:51.390> switches<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:52.170> push<00:00:52.410> it

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
a little momentary switches you push it

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.090 
a little momentary switches you push it
on<00:00:52.710> 4<00:00:53.070> on<00:00:53.219> let<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.940> go<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:54.270> off<00:00:54.800> that's<00:00:55.800> all<00:00:55.949> it

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
on 4 on let it go it's off that's all it

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.189 
on 4 on let it go it's off that's all it
is<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.460> little<00:00:56.670> tiny<00:00:56.820> switch<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:58.050> what<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
is just a little tiny switch and what I

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.340 
is just a little tiny switch and what I
do<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.590> measured<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.809> 1<00:01:00.809> inch<00:01:01.910> 24<00:01:03.080> on<00:01:04.080> each

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
do is I measured this 1 inch 24 on each

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.490 
do is I measured this 1 inch 24 on each
side<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.519> then<00:01:06.330> what<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.510> did<00:01:06.720> was<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:06.960> measured

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
side and then what I did was I measured

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.850 
side and then what I did was I measured
was<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.729> think<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:09.000> 1/2<00:01:09.240> an<00:01:09.420> inch<00:01:09.540> out<00:01:09.860> on

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
was this I think it's 1/2 an inch out on

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.990 
was this I think it's 1/2 an inch out on
either<00:01:11.010> side<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.430> they're<00:01:11.580> an<00:01:11.670> inch<00:01:11.850> apart

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
either side so they're an inch apart

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.750 
either side so they're an inch apart
which<00:01:12.450> will<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.689> more<00:01:12.960> than<00:01:13.080> enough<00:01:13.229> space<00:01:13.760> for

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
which will be more than enough space for

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.210 
which will be more than enough space for
these<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.090> be<00:01:15.119> sitting<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.259> there<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.680> I'll

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
these to be sitting in there and I'll

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.859 
these to be sitting in there and I'll
still<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.549> able<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.909> hold<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.750> my<00:01:18.780> hand

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
still be able to hold this in my hand

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.070 
still be able to hold this in my hand
and<00:01:19.409> hit<00:01:19.560> both<00:01:19.830> both<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.909> them<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.270> think<00:01:21.810> what

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
and hit both both of them I think what

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.060 
and hit both both of them I think what
I'm<00:01:22.140> going<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.350> do<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.560> I'm<00:01:22.650> going<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.860> do<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
I'm going to do is I'm going to do the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.520 
I'm going to do is I'm going to do the

of that and have them I don't know I got

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.740 
of that and have them I don't know I got
to<00:01:31.650> figure<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.979> part<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.460> out<00:01:32.570> here<00:01:33.570> got

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
to figure that part of it out here got

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.620 
to figure that part of it out here got
my<00:01:33.900> holes<00:01:34.110> drill<00:01:34.850> put<00:01:35.850> my<00:01:35.939> little<00:01:36.090> switches<00:01:36.479> in

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
my holes drill put my little switches in

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.530 
my holes drill put my little switches in
there<00:01:36.810> they're<00:01:37.110> not<00:01:37.140> wired<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.070> yet<00:01:38.329> let's<00:01:39.329> see

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
there they're not wired in yet let's see

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.810 
there they're not wired in yet let's see
we<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:40.049> just<00:01:40.079> I'll<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.920> able<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.430> work<00:01:41.610> it

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
we can just I'll be able to just work it

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.649 
we can just I'll be able to just work it
just<00:01:42.060> like<00:01:42.240> that

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
just like that

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.980 
just like that
they'll<00:01:43.350> go<00:01:43.560> with<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> contour<00:01:44.280> my<00:01:44.399> hand<00:01:44.990> and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
they'll go with the contour my hand and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.069 
they'll go with the contour my hand and
what<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.170> can<00:01:46.350> reach<00:01:46.530> out<00:01:47.299> either<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.570> hand<00:01:48.899> or

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
what I can reach out either this hand or

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
but just make sure that the one power

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.570 
but just make sure that the one power
wire<00:02:19.760> comes<00:02:20.060> in<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:20.420> loops<00:02:21.020> to<00:02:21.860> each<00:02:22.040> one<00:02:22.430> of

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
wire comes in and loops to each one of

wire comes in and loops to each one of
these<00:02:24.010> all<00:02:25.010> right<00:02:25.280> here<00:02:25.520> it<00:02:25.580> is<00:02:25.700> I<00:02:26.090> had<00:02:26.810> to

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
these all right here it is I had to

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.900 
these all right here it is I had to
break<00:02:27.170> an<00:02:27.380> access<00:02:27.830> panel<00:02:28.070> on<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.430> back<00:02:28.610> which

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
break an access panel on the back which

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.160 
break an access panel on the back which
I'm<00:02:29.030> going<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.210> go<00:02:29.420> I'm<00:02:29.630> going<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.840> cover<00:02:29.990> that

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
I'm going to go I'm going to cover that

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.540 
I'm going to go I'm going to cover that
with<00:02:30.820> just<00:02:31.820> a<00:02:31.910> piece<00:02:32.090> of<00:02:32.120> duct<00:02:32.450> tape<00:02:32.510> that

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
with just a piece of duct tape that

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.860 
with just a piece of duct tape that
looks<00:02:34.550> cool<00:02:34.790> my<00:02:35.000> wife<00:02:35.180> got<00:02:35.390> some<00:02:35.540> new<00:02:35.660> duct

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
looks cool my wife got some new duct

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.260 
looks cool my wife got some new duct
tape<00:02:36.080> here's<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.560> switches<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.160> they're<00:02:38.090> all

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
tape here's the switches and they're all

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.290 
tape here's the switches and they're all
on<00:02:38.300> there<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:39.490> like<00:02:40.490> I<00:02:40.610> do<00:02:40.670> with<00:02:40.790> wire<00:02:41.000> them<00:02:41.180> up

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
on there and like I do with wire them up

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.140 
on there and like I do with wire them up
so<00:02:41.510> then<00:02:41.690> what<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:41.900> did<00:02:42.020> was<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:43.000> pulled<00:02:44.000> it

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
so then what I did was I pulled it

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.960 
so then what I did was I pulled it
through<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:45.050> I<00:02:45.140> put<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.590> electrical<00:02:46.490> tape<00:02:46.670> plug

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
through and I put a electrical tape plug

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.760 
through and I put a electrical tape plug
on<00:02:47.210> the<00:02:47.330> back<00:02:47.540> side<00:02:47.840> so<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.170> doesn't<00:02:48.200> pull<00:02:48.620> the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
on the back side so it doesn't pull the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.980 
on the back side so it doesn't pull the
wiring<00:02:48.980> any<00:02:49.310> more<00:02:49.550> than<00:02:49.820> then<00:02:50.570> what<00:02:50.720> it<00:02:50.810> needs

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
wiring any more than then what it needs

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.530 
wiring any more than then what it needs
to<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.500> then<00:02:52.370> now<00:02:52.820> I'm<00:02:52.940> going<00:02:53.090> to<00:02:53.150> cover<00:02:53.360> it

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
to and then now I'm going to cover it

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.230 
to and then now I'm going to cover it
with<00:02:53.600> some<00:02:53.870> yellow<00:02:54.110> wire<00:02:54.380> loom<00:02:54.680> all<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.040> way
