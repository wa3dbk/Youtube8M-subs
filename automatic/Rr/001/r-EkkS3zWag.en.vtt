okay<00:00:00.390> this<00:00:00.599> is<00:00:00.690> my<00:00:00.810> ode<00:00:01.050> to<00:00:01.079> Dodge<00:00:01.469> Neon<00:00:01.709> and

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
okay this is my ode to Dodge Neon and

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.590 
okay this is my ode to Dodge Neon and
I'm<00:00:02.310> going<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.550> be<00:00:02.639> changed<00:00:02.879> no<00:00:03.000> Sparkle<00:00:03.419> which

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
I'm going to be changed no Sparkle which

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.920 
I'm going to be changed no Sparkle which
is<00:00:03.720> actually<00:00:04.080> these<00:00:04.319> four<00:00:04.950> right<00:00:05.370> here<00:00:05.930> and

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
is actually these four right here and

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.259 
is actually these four right here and
then<00:00:07.109> right<00:00:07.140> here<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.500> got<00:00:07.710> some<00:00:08.059> spark<00:00:09.059> plug

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
then right here I got some spark plug

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.180 
then right here I got some spark plug
which<00:00:09.510> is<00:00:09.540> actually<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.050> radio<00:00:10.349> recommended

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
which is actually a radio recommended

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.060 
which is actually a radio recommended
for<00:00:11.580> my<00:00:11.730> type<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.030> engine<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.509> also<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.469> NTC's

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
for my type of engine and also the NTC's

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.980 
for my type of engine and also the NTC's
duplication<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.210> electric<00:00:15.630> tuner

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
duplication and the electric tuner

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.939 
duplication and the electric tuner
grease<00:00:16.379> along<00:00:17.190> with<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.600> spark<00:00:18.600> plug<00:00:18.779> socket

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.439 

the<00:00:23.189> first<00:00:23.430> thing<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.670> do<00:00:23.910> before<00:00:24.150> you

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
the first thing to do before you

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.429 
the first thing to do before you
actually<00:00:24.510> change<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.050> spark<00:00:25.289> plug<00:00:25.410> to

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
actually change the spark plug to

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.900 
actually change the spark plug to
actually<00:00:25.830> unplug<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.310> negative<00:00:26.609> side<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.820> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
actually unplug the negative side of the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.700 
actually unplug the negative side of the
battery<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.359> there<00:00:27.750> won't<00:00:27.840> be<00:00:27.960> any<00:00:28.020> shock<00:00:28.439> or

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
battery so there won't be any shock or

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.069 
battery so there won't be any shock or
electrostatic<00:00:29.099> problem<00:00:32.540> all<00:00:33.540> right<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:33.870> after

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
electrostatic problem all right so after

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.889 
electrostatic problem all right so after
unplugging<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.220> negative<00:00:35.790> side<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
unplugging the negative side of the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.020 
unplugging the negative side of the
berry<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.470> you<00:00:38.190> start<00:00:38.370> working<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> spark

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
berry and you start working on the spark

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.750 
berry and you start working on the spark
plug<00:00:39.260> so<00:00:40.260> all<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.500> had<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.650> do<00:00:40.830> is<00:00:40.980> pull<00:00:41.519> these

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
plug so all you had to do is pull these

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:54.740 
plug so all you had to do is pull these
out<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:53.760> spark<00:00:54.030> plugs<00:00:54.210> aren't<00:00:54.360> inside

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
out and the spark plugs aren't inside

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.779 
out and the spark plugs aren't inside
these<00:00:54.899> right<00:00:55.140> here<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.859> then<00:00:56.250> I'm<00:00:56.430> gonna<00:00:56.579> be

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
these right here and then I'm gonna be

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.799 
these right here and then I'm gonna be
using<00:00:57.350> one<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.379> these<00:00:58.620> long<00:00:59.120> socket<00:01:00.120> spark

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
using one of these long socket spark

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:14.190 
using one of these long socket spark
plug<00:01:00.960> socket<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.440> pull<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.739> up

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.870 

I<00:01:15.750> got<00:01:16.750> that<00:01:17.110> that<00:01:17.830> spark<00:01:18.100> plug<00:01:18.280> a<00:01:18.549> spark<00:01:18.850> plug

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
I got that that spark plug a spark plug

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.179 
I got that that spark plug a spark plug
and<00:01:19.299> that<00:01:19.540> one<00:01:19.750> and<00:01:20.170> this<00:01:20.470> is<00:01:20.619> the<00:01:20.770> last<00:01:20.979> one

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
and that one and this is the last one

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.899 
and that one and this is the last one
right<00:01:21.340> here<00:01:23.310> all<00:01:24.310> right<00:01:24.340> so<00:01:24.549> these<00:01:24.670> are<00:01:24.820> the

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
right here all right so these are the

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.219 
right here all right so these are the
first<00:01:25.119> spark<00:01:25.390> plugs<00:01:25.540> I<00:01:25.630> took<00:01:25.810> it<00:01:25.899> out<00:01:25.960> from<00:01:26.140> the

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
first spark plugs I took it out from the

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.380 
first spark plugs I took it out from the
engine<00:01:26.560> and<00:01:26.740> look<00:01:27.399> at<00:01:27.580> all<00:01:27.640> these<00:01:27.759> black<00:01:28.060> burn

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
engine and look at all these black burn

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.930 
engine and look at all these black burn
dusting<00:01:29.200> so<00:01:29.890> by<00:01:30.009> the<00:01:30.070> look<00:01:30.280> of<00:01:30.369> it<00:01:30.490> look<00:01:30.789> like

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
dusting so by the look of it look like

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.120 
dusting so by the look of it look like
carbon<00:01:31.390> burns<00:01:31.750> which<00:01:32.289> is<00:01:32.409> caused<00:01:32.649> by<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.860> air

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
carbon burns which is caused by the air

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.120 
carbon burns which is caused by the air
filter<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.600> it's<00:01:35.409> actually<00:01:35.799> that<00:01:35.920> right

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
filter and it's actually that right

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.090 
filter and it's actually that right
there<00:01:37.259> someone<00:01:38.259> to<00:01:38.409> replace<00:01:38.710> these<00:01:38.860> right

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
there someone to replace these right

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.590 
there someone to replace these right
here<00:01:39.220> so<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.820> first<00:01:40.000> thing<00:01:40.090> I<00:01:40.180> will<00:01:40.270> do<00:01:40.420> will

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
here so the first thing I will do will

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.960 
here so the first thing I will do will
be<00:01:40.630> putting<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.380> D<00:01:42.100> electric<00:01:42.520> tuner<00:01:42.640> grease

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
be putting the D electric tuner grease

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.389 
be putting the D electric tuner grease
into<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:43.450> spark<00:01:43.840> plug<00:01:43.990> booth<00:01:44.200> just<00:01:44.890> put<00:01:45.159> some

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
into the spark plug booth just put some

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.910 
into the spark plug booth just put some
around<00:01:45.729> this<00:01:45.970> thing<00:01:46.210> and<00:01:46.679> along<00:01:47.679> with<00:01:47.710> the

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
around this thing and along with the

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.760 
around this thing and along with the
other<00:01:48.090> okay<00:01:49.090> so<00:01:49.149> I<00:01:49.270> got<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:50.200> electric<00:01:50.619> grease

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
other okay so I got the electric grease

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.940 
other okay so I got the electric grease
into<00:01:51.039> all<00:01:51.250> four<00:01:51.819> of<00:01:51.850> these<00:01:52.390> plugs<00:01:52.840> now<00:01:53.770> let's

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
into all four of these plugs now let's

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.830 
into all four of these plugs now let's
work<00:01:54.130> on<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.399> spark<00:01:54.640> plug<00:01:54.819> okay<00:01:55.479> so<00:01:55.539> I'm<00:01:55.659> gonna

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
work on the spark plug okay so I'm gonna

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.289 
work on the spark plug okay so I'm gonna
be<00:01:56.020> using<00:01:56.200> this<00:01:56.409> on<00:01:56.679> gap<00:01:57.250> gauge<00:01:57.490> right<00:01:57.670> here<00:01:57.909> to

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
be using this on gap gauge right here to

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.570 
be using this on gap gauge right here to
measure<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.780> gap<00:01:59.380> for<00:01:59.649> the<00:01:59.740> spark<00:02:00.190> plug<00:02:00.399> and

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
measure the gap for the spark plug and

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.300 
measure the gap for the spark plug and
then<00:02:01.479> I<00:02:01.690> just<00:02:01.899> had<00:02:02.049> to<00:02:02.140> make<00:02:02.289> sure<00:02:02.319> that<00:02:03.130> this

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
then I just had to make sure that this

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.210 
then I just had to make sure that this
is<00:02:03.490> between<00:02:03.850> point<00:02:04.630> eighty<00:02:05.110> three<00:02:05.470> and<00:02:05.709> point

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
is between point eighty three and point

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.180 
is between point eighty three and point
ninety<00:02:06.610> six<00:02:06.850> millimeters<00:02:07.569> for<00:02:08.019> the<00:02:08.830> spark

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
ninety six millimeters for the spark

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.740 
ninety six millimeters for the spark
plug<00:02:09.369> which<00:02:09.670> is<00:02:09.700> actually<00:02:10.060> recommended<00:02:10.600> for

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
plug which is actually recommended for

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.750 
plug which is actually recommended for
my<00:02:10.840> engine<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.380> way<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.560> do<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:14.950> all<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.610> had

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
my engine so the way to do it all I had

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.289 
my engine so the way to do it all I had
to<00:02:15.850> do<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.060> put<00:02:16.299> the<00:02:16.420> gap<00:02:17.200> right<00:02:17.470> here<00:02:18.299> between

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
to do is put the gap right here between

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.900 
to do is put the gap right here between
this<00:02:19.810> right<00:02:20.019> here<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.739> make<00:02:21.070> sure<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.880> is

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
this right here and make sure it is

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.640 
this right here and make sure it is
between<00:02:22.390> point<00:02:22.600> eighty<00:02:22.840> three<00:02:23.109> and<00:02:23.140> point

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
between point eighty three and point

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.590 
between point eighty three and point
ninety<00:02:23.890> six<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.940> next<00:02:25.120> thing<00:02:25.329> I'm<00:02:25.450> going

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
ninety six so the next thing I'm going

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.680 
ninety six so the next thing I'm going
to<00:02:25.660> do<00:02:25.810> is<00:02:25.930> add<00:02:26.170> some<00:02:26.220> NTC<00:02:27.220> lubrication<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.390> the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
to do is add some NTC lubrication to the

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.449 
to do is add some NTC lubrication to the
spark<00:02:28.959> plug<00:02:28.989> so<00:02:29.410> basically<00:02:29.859> I<00:02:30.010> managed<00:02:30.430> to

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
spark plug so basically I managed to

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.550 
spark plug so basically I managed to
this<00:02:30.730> parts<00:02:31.209> I<00:02:31.359> mean<00:02:31.660> this<00:02:31.780> side<00:02:31.989> of<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.290> spark

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
this parts I mean this side of the spark

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.250 
this parts I mean this side of the spark
plugs<00:02:32.769> basically<00:02:33.370> all<00:02:33.549> these<00:02:33.760> right<00:02:33.970> there

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
plugs basically all these right there

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.830 
plugs basically all these right there
after<00:02:35.260> printer<00:02:35.500> some<00:02:35.680> NTC<00:02:36.640> lubrication<00:02:37.390> on<00:02:37.570> to

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
after printer some NTC lubrication on to

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.660 
after printer some NTC lubrication on to
the<00:02:38.079> front<00:02:38.799> of<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.160> spark<00:02:39.430> plug

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
the front of the spark plug

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.190 
the front of the spark plug
I'm<00:02:40.030> going<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.510> put<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.780> spark<00:02:41.019> plug<00:02:41.049> back

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
I'm going to put the spark plug back

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.140 
I'm going to put the spark plug back
into<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.829> engine<00:02:42.489> where<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.820> spark<00:02:43.060> was

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
into the engine where the spark was

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.030 
into the engine where the spark was
supposed<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.420> go<00:02:46.230> we're<00:02:47.230> gonna<00:02:47.470> put<00:02:47.709> that<00:02:47.859> into

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
supposed to go we're gonna put that into

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.479 
supposed to go we're gonna put that into
the<00:02:48.420> socket

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:08.120 

put<00:02:55.489> that<00:02:56.560> back<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:57.950> sucker

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.260 

okay<00:03:09.130> so<00:03:09.190> I've<00:03:09.400> done<00:03:09.550> put<00:03:09.670> all<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.880> spark<00:03:10.120> plug

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
okay so I've done put all the spark plug

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.800 
okay so I've done put all the spark plug
back<00:03:10.360> in<00:03:11.430> I'm<00:03:12.430> going<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.000> put<00:03:13.120> all<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.480> boots

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
back in I'm going to put all the boots

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:33.010 
back in I'm going to put all the boots
wire<00:03:14.080> back<00:03:14.770> into

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.560 

last<00:03:34.020> of<00:03:34.200> all<00:03:34.320> is<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.860> put<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.570> negative

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
last of all is to put the negative

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.950 
last of all is to put the negative
connection<00:03:36.840> on<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.110> battery<00:03:37.380> back<00:03:37.740> on
