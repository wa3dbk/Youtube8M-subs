00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.850

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.360
 so that the classic stories continue 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.220

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.050
 alumna reid in queens daughter of the 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.000

 hated the world and that if I want 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.690
 choose my own happy ending that 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.309
 rebellion did not sit well with the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.930
 real of the institute like for example 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.930

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.550
 no more 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.150
 and the institute was divided by a 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.430
 side the reals to those who 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.380

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.700
 pinocho returns to the next opinion 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.570
