 monopolists are beginning to alarm 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.820
 Kyrgyz citizens in bishkek more often 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.850

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.130
 Russian owners are not quite 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.130

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.750
 back through google doesn't know how 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.069
 underwent procedures before signing 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.400
 contracts turned out that it would have 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.680
 one of us put to the pharmacy too 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.379
 were therefore one of either not from the first 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.140
 answer hypotheses 2 no intention 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:25.530
 sale or transfer control process 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.730
 subscribe and speech can not advice 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.030
 strategic objects 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.640
 it is the good and the wealth of the people 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.220
 stay the same way we don't mind 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.599
 investments that will develop 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:42.840
 aero polis but without transmission however power 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:45.000
 rejects criticism of his critics Almazbek 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.129
 Atambayev commenting on the issue of the parish 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.099
 russian monopolists kyrgyzstan 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:53.639
 stated that without their large investments 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.530
 companies will not stand the competition and those 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.319
 who shout about not being 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.620
 Russneft give there any percentage 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.629
 especially 51 those actually want 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.019
 put an end to the future airport 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:09.209
 manas because the main advantage 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.290
 this future hub it should be 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.329
 cheap kerosene 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.549
 but with the arguments of the president not 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:17.370
 deputies absolutely agree according to their words 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:20.370
 government unreasonably for nothing 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:28.990
 sells the most liquid areas 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:31.300
 economically profitable 4 you 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.889
 you will agree its true fun to you 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.930
 gives you disagree 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.780
 if you want an investor showing 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.219
 not through sales how to attract you 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.999
 will be some kind of joint venture 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:43.069
 invested 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:45.319
 the influx of Russian monopolists 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:46.819
 Kyrgyzstan according to analysts and henceforth 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:49.550
 will cause some discontent 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:51.979
 social groups but experts are sure that 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.259
 if Russia does not fulfill its promises 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:56.259
 then negative attitudes will soften
