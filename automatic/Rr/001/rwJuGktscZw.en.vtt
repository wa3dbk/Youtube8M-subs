00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
not give a while doing it so this

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.190 
not give a while doing it so this
is<00:01:35.340> pretty<00:01:35.520> cool<00:01:35.729> I'm<00:01:36.090> still<00:01:36.600> kind<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:36.960> if<00:01:37.079> you

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
is pretty cool I'm still kind of if you

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200 
is pretty cool I'm still kind of if you
own<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.409> design<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.040> uh<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.520> it's<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:39.119> a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
own this design but uh it's it's it's a

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.330 
own this design but uh it's it's it's a
decent<00:01:39.509> design<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.960> do<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.530> mega<00:01:40.770> Gengar<00:01:41.159> and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
decent design I do like mega Gengar and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.039 
decent design I do like mega Gengar and
that's<00:01:41.490> why<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:41.729> made<00:01:41.850> top<00:01:42.180> 5<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.570> today's

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
that's why it's made top 5 on today's

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.800 
that's why it's made top 5 on today's
list<00:01:43.259> alright<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.369> number<00:01:44.729> 4<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.360> list<00:01:45.570> is

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
list alright so number 4 on the list is

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.139 
list alright so number 4 on the list is
going<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.079> be<00:01:46.170> mega<00:01:46.560> Alakazam<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:48.030> is

going to be mega Alakazam and this is

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.490 
going to be mega Alakazam and this is
for<00:01:48.299> pretty<00:01:48.479> much<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.720> same<00:01:48.869> reasons<00:01:49.229> as<00:01:49.290> mega

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
for pretty much the same reasons as mega

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.530 
for pretty much the same reasons as mega
Gengar<00:01:49.890> though<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.189> like<00:01:50.579> Malka<00:01:50.939> Alakazam

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
it doesn't matter cuz you aren't

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.230 
it doesn't matter cuz you aren't
touching<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:01.920> thing<00:02:02.130> anyway<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.880> can<00:02:03.060> take

have been his uh ability actually love
to<00:02:34.440> say<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.710> would've<00:02:34.860> been<00:02:34.950> pretty<00:02:35.040> cool

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
to say that would've been pretty cool

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.070 
to say that would've been pretty cool
cuz<00:02:35.490> you<00:02:35.640> know<00:02:35.730> he's<00:02:35.910> levitating<00:02:36.210> now<00:02:36.540> so

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
cuz you know he's levitating now so

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.170 
cuz you know he's levitating now so
there<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.350> go<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.860> as<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.910> like<00:02:39.030> it's

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
there you go and as you like it's

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.700 
there you go and as you like it's
designed<00:02:39.570> quite<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.810> bit<00:02:39.960> more<00:02:40.080> than<00:02:40.140> Megan

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
designed quite a bit more than Megan

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.740 
designed quite a bit more than Megan
Garth<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.100> I<00:02:41.700> think<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.000> perfect<00:02:42.390> kind<00:02:42.630> of

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
Garth and I think the perfect kind of

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.590 
Garth and I think the perfect kind of
counter<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.350> is<00:02:43.560> um<00:02:44.210> talonflame<00:02:45.210> because

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
counter to this is um talonflame because

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.750 
counter to this is um talonflame because
he<00:02:45.720> has<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.990> prior<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.380> brave<00:02:46.590> bird<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.040> it

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
he has the prior to brave bird and it

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.070 
he has the prior to brave bird and it

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
of my ex version yeah I found that I

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.610 
of my ex version yeah I found that I
liked<00:03:20.850> mega<00:03:21.150> Charizard<00:03:21.330> y<00:03:21.600> just<00:03:21.960> a<00:03:22.050> bit<00:03:22.290> more

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
liked mega Charizard y just a bit more

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.800 
liked mega Charizard y just a bit more
because<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.370> has<00:03:23.580> special<00:03:23.850> attack<00:03:24.210> it's<00:03:24.660> more

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
because it has special attack it's more

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.270 
because it has special attack it's more
of<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:24.930> special<00:03:25.200> attack<00:03:25.380> of<00:03:25.500> course<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:26.070> has

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
that attack it's more focused I guess

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.410 
that attack it's more focused I guess
because<00:03:28.800> it<00:03:28.920> has<00:03:29.070> sort<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.430> us<00:03:29.640> got<00:03:30.000> all<00:03:30.180> its

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
wise to design a little bit more like it

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.630 
wise to design a little bit more like it
over<00:03:46.290> time<00:03:46.530> I've<00:03:46.680> just<00:03:46.830> kind<00:03:47.010> of<00:03:47.040> changed<00:03:47.520> I'm

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
is a little bit better than the sort of

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.610 
is a little bit better than the sort of
really<00:03:57.030> in<00:03:57.180> your<00:03:57.360> face<00:03:57.420> transformation<00:03:58.350> the

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
really in your face transformation the

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.800 
really in your face transformation the
