00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
at this point in this season I think

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.720 
at this point in this season I think
it's<00:00:10.200> safe<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.380> say<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.679> Boston<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.429> team

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
it's safe to say that Boston is a team

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.700 
it's safe to say that Boston is a team
that's<00:00:12.000> going<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.360> fight<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.900> end<00:00:13.049> even

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.079 
that's going to fight to the end even
though<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.920> Celtics<00:00:14.340> didn't<00:00:14.670> pick<00:00:14.820> up<00:00:14.849> the
