00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.470

 very good friends friends welcome to 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.710
 point 5 x 1 this is not the new 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.630
 season is a delay in my 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.160
 vacation because yesterday I said goodbye 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.419
 all of you I thank you for 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.750
 all the comments that you have 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:30.590
 I arrived but before leaving I said 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.180
 if it goes to the beta it would announce something and the 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.649
 fact that it came out so early 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.719
 practically without giving me time to do 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.850
 nothing as I said look back one day 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.260
 my holiday march and almost without 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.480
 wait for anyone 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.340
 I bring you the video of beta 5 as 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.310
 you know I'm a jailbreak user 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.130
 I do not have to josh 7 installed but as 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.260
 I have not bothered to look for those 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.240
 reports that users are making 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.310
 they have already been testing the beta has come out 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.540
 barely a few hours ago 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.579
 It's still early and I still do not know 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.460
 they know more details or many details 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.710
 about what we have seen as a novelty of 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.140
 one beta to another beta 4 and I analyzed it 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.030
 a week ago and it 's practically 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.920
 warn because we all thought you're going to 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.830
 go for next week has come 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.200
 with a few improvements 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.290
 and we are going to analyze I am going to comment 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.180
 worth just 10 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.320
 What's new that I've seen 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.030
 everything I have read is worth more 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.710
 interesting seem or the ones that 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.720
 have been interested to tell you here to 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.430
 all of you 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.280
 the first one is in the settings menu 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.230
 because right now the menu icons 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.030
 of adjustments we all see them discolored 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.370
 in the first betas but in this beta 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.160
 has added colors now they have a few 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.350
 more colorful more colorful icons and 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.840
 good talking a little face that does not 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.780
 it's bad for the new year 7 with this 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.580
 beta 5 already then we have also seen and 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.500
 we have already observed what we saw with the 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.290
 presentation not that the application of 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.450
 apple time was very inspired in 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.860
 yahoo for not saying it was a copy of 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.229
 The official application of Yahoo 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.270
 webber then good precisely yahoo 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.350
 begins to have more importance in the 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.459
 system since it is implemented with more 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.530
 importance in the application of time 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.350
 and also in the bag application 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.120
 they retweet me so greetings to raul 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.760
 derision 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.380
 raÃºl greetings then one of the little things 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.630
 that we have also seen many of us 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.490
 betting keiko we will not see because the 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.190
 applications at the end have to 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.110
 be updated to new designs and 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.790
 precisely many of us are talking about 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.120
 example of the native twitter facebook 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.620
 flickr how they will be good for twitter 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.480
 we have already seen what could be 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.220
 because we have seen a new icon of 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.260
 twitteros I'll be putting the screen 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.360
 do not worry that as you can see, he has 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.450
 little bird is worth but with a white background 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.250
 so good news is worth it 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.590
 can let you see what the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.510
 new twitter icon in the next year 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.900
 7 I do not know if it will be the final 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.690
 I do not know how I would stick in it 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.310
 and I do not get the word on the screen 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.340
 of the applications I do not know how it would look 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.380
 a white background stuck there I do not know but 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.790
 well that would be the provisional icon of 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.090
 moment at least for the menu of 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.459
 settings 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.709
 then we have also been able to observe that 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.120
 the control center is worth so far not 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.459
 we could do it and now we can 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.650
 activate and deactivate it within a 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.989
 application then it has also been improved 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.540
 a bit in general the whole subject of the 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.709
 System stability has been improved 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.750
 Many have said that it has been improved 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.180
 enough already so if it does not go 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.980
 appearing to be a final version then 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.569
 It has also optimized the 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.730
 sliding on the lock screen 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.290
 to access the camera us when 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.700
 we are the lock screen and 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.870
 we wanted to access the camera we had 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.060
 that slide this up and 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.410
 so we made this gesture of doing it 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.060
 they have improved and polished it more for 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.819
 make it a lot easier to access 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.849
 she then also has redesigned the 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.500
 slider if you remember when I made the 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.180
 analysis of beta 4 I told you that I have 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.500
 remodeled the slider to unlock 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.510
 they had gotten in like a kind of 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.400
 little arrow well now also the 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.120
 slider to turn off the phone is the one 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.860
 it goes like that it's worth remodeling it too 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.670
 to also facilitate the shutdown of the 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.650
 system then they have also improved the 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.329
 Buttons have remodeled buttons 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.040
 when we call vale when the face comes out 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.810
 of the person who calls you and the buttons 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.459
 from here it's worth those buttons, 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.340
 they have remodeled the have improved the 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.150
 given a facelift then also 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.150
 more than more 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.420
 twitter and sky apps also 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.920
 have undergone changes or improvements rather 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.240
 in stability because if you remember in 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.800
 the beta 4 many has failed the 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.990
 twitter application when you have a 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.280
 button is not vice certain online and the 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.140
 explanation of skateboarding also failed 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.330
 Well, these two applications already 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.950
 they work perfectly and if many people 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.260
 you are going to ask and google + fernando 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:49.080
 It works, it does not work, it's still not working 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.340
 in a coma and then also 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.770
 and then also in general they have been done 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.509
 retouching and improvements to transparencies 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.189
 in the effects of blues in short a bit 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:00.819
 in those new things that we have seen in 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:02.680
 the new year 7 beta 5 so nothing 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:05.189
 guys this has been a little bit the details 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.930
 worth of these developments anyway 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:09.520
 I feel worth doing this video the most 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.870
 quick I could directly why 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.819
 I have to do many things to win 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.529
 one season and I wanted to leave it done 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:15.669
 surely they go knowing more things or 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.169
 I have left things when you have seen 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.580
 this video maybe you know of 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.199
 new things 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.669
