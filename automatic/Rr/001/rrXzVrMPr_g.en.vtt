pixel on server i've partnered up with

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.300 
pixel on server i've partnered up with
noah<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:17.960> i<00:01:18.079> are<00:01:18.229> doing<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:18.560> pixelmon<00:01:18.979> server

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
from the Archon it's just for pixelmon

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.760 
from the Archon it's just for pixelmon
and<00:01:28.149> yeah<00:01:29.149> so<00:01:29.689> there'll<00:01:30.020> be<00:01:30.049> more<00:01:30.290> details
