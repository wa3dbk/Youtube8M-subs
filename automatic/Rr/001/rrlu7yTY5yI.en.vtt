00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
on we ridiculed them so much that they

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.550 
on we ridiculed them so much that they
were<00:04:03.730> like<00:04:03.970> we<00:04:04.359> don't<00:04:04.389> want<00:04:04.660> to<00:04:04.720> do<00:04:04.870> our<00:04:05.019> show<00:04:05.260> a

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
were like we don't want to do our show a

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.729 
were like we don't want to do our show a

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
lot more we give up I actually think

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.909 
lot more we give up I actually think
that<00:04:08.859> the<00:04:09.599> some<00:04:10.599> people<00:04:10.840> had<00:04:10.959> babies<00:04:11.410> that<00:04:11.739> are

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:11.919 
that the some people had babies that are

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.289 
that the some people had babies that are
on<00:04:12.099> that<00:04:12.130> show<00:04:12.489> and<00:04:12.519> so<00:04:12.849> they<00:04:12.970> actually

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
on that show and so they actually

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.059 
on that show and so they actually
couldn't<00:04:14.140> do<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.319> show<00:04:14.439> season<00:04:14.829> we'll
