by<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.399> i'm<00:02:08.550> assuming<00:02:08.819> they're<00:02:09.179> going<00:02:09.360> to

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
by this i'm assuming they're going to

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.609 
by this i'm assuming they're going to
decide<00:02:09.660> whether<00:02:10.110> or<00:02:10.229> not

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
decide whether or not

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.070 
decide whether or not
should<00:02:10.830> make<00:02:11.819> new<00:02:12.060> instruments<00:02:12.659> and<00:02:12.840> sell

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
should make new instruments and sell

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.050 
should make new instruments and sell
them<00:02:13.200> as<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.349> bundle<00:02:13.680> which<00:02:14.190> would<00:02:14.430> be<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.879> little

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
them as a bundle which would be a little

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.520 
them as a bundle which would be a little
bit<00:02:15.269> more<00:02:15.420> tedious<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:15.989> would<00:02:16.140> take<00:02:16.319> more

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
bit more tedious and would take more

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.979 
bit more tedious and would take more
money<00:02:16.799> to<00:02:16.980> do<00:02:17.340> or<00:02:17.670> they<00:02:18.030> could<00:02:18.150> just<00:02:18.209> sell<00:02:18.599> like

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
money to do or they could just sell like

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.140 
money to do or they could just sell like
