00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.060
 I greet you on the tank history channel 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.620
 friends but today will be a little bit 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.719
 non-standard video I will not 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.320
 tell stories about interesting 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.929
 cars 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.680
 today we will see one 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.810
 interesting game but I'll tell you right this 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:25.380
 not really a game to be exact it 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:28.769
 physical simulator of soft bodies and all 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.000
 this simulation produces a physical 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.210
 havok engine 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.820
 or hallak whatever you want to call it 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.800
 why did I even want to write it on 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:44.340
 channel about tanks because we have here 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:47.340
 Well, it goes, in principle, not at all 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:52.829
 tank and what is some kind of analogy 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:55.680
 in general with this there is therefore in 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.570
 In principle, the game is interesting, I think how 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.399
 and diversify the channel is also a principle 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.670
 will go and so what we generally can do 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.820
 in this game first we can ride i 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.360
 Of course not fully understood and imbued 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.180
 prices given this simulator 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.630
 But its main feature is 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.799
 that we drive on a broken dr ride 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.170
 to roads that is, we can drill in 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:29.100
 some say so brush I can 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.619
 what then our tank even to the factory from our 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.550
 tank our btr manufacturer not 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.520
 learns by the way want to say btr here 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.280
 how to say not a non-standard car 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.810
 that is, she was not she not 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.270
 installed along with the game 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.610
 as if the mod goes but it worked 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.380
 pretty cool and principle if still 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.560
 from the gun it was possible to shoot at 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.050
 leave such craters funnels from 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.570
 shells would certainly be even cooler 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:07.010
 therefore we are not given this 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:10.140
 therefore we are content with what we can and 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.710
 so in principle also graphic 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.310
 component of the game I think I 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.130
 Now while recording a high level, 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.190
 I'm stable 60 fps 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.610
 so itâ€™s a plus that the computer is here 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.070
 not quite not strong and not weak 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.800
 weak not weak but such beauty 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:37.830
 a sort of graphical simulation it with such 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.500
 ease they lag principle is not a 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.890
 the game is maximized solely 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.470
 what 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.900
 motion blur I removed because it 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.200
 to me 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.379
 really pisses me like that even on 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.400
 weak on weak computers this 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:59.140
 the game will fly so it basically 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:02.530
 there is an incentive who loves faces ears here 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:06.420
 for those who do not like face pulleys and 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.689
 can download and play try 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.079
 that's it by the way by the way 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.480
 BTR-70 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:18.730
 on your screen did not say the name 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:21.239
 here she should swim but in spintires i 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.500
 I think it is not implemented namely 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.159
 swimming btr-70 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.959
 here we can say that here we are 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:34.030
 we are actually sailing we are just along the bottom 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:36.639
 We're going here and you can fantasize 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.090
 that in fact we are sailing by the way 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:41.920
 by the way if we have such a historical 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.409
 cognitive channel about any technology 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.780
 it is the tank then let's just about the BTR-70 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:49.120
 I'll tell you how she swims here 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.280
 behind the curtain there is this curtain 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.099
 opens and is 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.519
 about btr-70 in general at all btr of 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:04:01.090
 family btr propulsion here and which 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.740
 leads her action on it btr and 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.410
 meaning 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:09.910
 such things no one sticks out 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:13.600
 but as they call the oars here and no one 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:17.070
 rowing so it's pretty simple 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.140
 well we can say we are sailing 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.520
 turn on imagination friends here we are 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:26.220
 let's even float here we get a little stuck 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.890
 our driver has already flooded in my 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.720
 if I'm not mistaken, he has yes and no here 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.590
 she has glass so the drivers don't 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.870
 flooded don't worry here 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:40.860
 processed by graphics and physics in 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.140
 principle everything from dirt on wheels 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.890
 which sticks to them and pretty 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:49.470
 thick layer and ending with water 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.720
 which remains on the body here we are 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.770
 drove and our wheels are 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.660
 clean 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:05:00.660
 And the part to the face is dirty for some reason rather 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.540
 just the engine better visible actually 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.630
 what are we going to find fault with such here 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.690
 pies by the way let's go out of here 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:14.310
 because I am already on the water 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.960
 tired of swimming here butt butt still 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.980
 a little river 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.500
 here and trees breakdowns we are basically on 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.840
 I will not do pretty 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.350
 long videos if you will it 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.970
 it is interesting to watch then I am from you 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.430
 write it in the comments and i 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:36.840
 necessarily a couple of maybe 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:38.880
 even more video will write here if you 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.950
 of course it will be interesting now we 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.850
 got out on some strange 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:48.840
 sawmill and try them on this 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:51.510
 Russian urine drive through go hemp 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.320
 honestly it seems to me btr 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.639
 attempting to simply be uprooted stumps and 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.879
 Well 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:00.710
 In the game, this is not implemented until I 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:02.300
 for some reason, I do not doubt that it is possible to 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.650
 future it realizes if not 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:09.199
 developers toastmaster cases and that's the principle 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.749
 we will be happy with you but we are pretty 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:14.659
 strongly under the stuck we sat down belly 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:17.629
 stump and basically it's pretty 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:19.789
 bad let's wrap up friends if you 

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:21.710
 like this video then subscribe 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:23.360
 on the channel and write in the comments 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.249
 First, write in the comments 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.849
 what tank stories would you like 

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:30.560
 hear 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:33.349
 next video do not forget some 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.750
 will write will fall in my own release i 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:40.099
 I read his nickname and just do not forget 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:41.090
 did you like to write ? 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:44.529
 spintires 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:47.539
 from my face or not and is it worth you 

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:50.599
 to record these videos are moms me 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:54.710
 do you like these or not? 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:56.839
 Here such things until new soon meetings 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.659
 friends subscribe to the channel if you 

00:06:56.839 --> 00:07:03.729
 liked the video and put your fingers 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:03.729
 up to new meetings soon
