00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
in another video we're really not going

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.030 
in another video we're really not going
to<00:00:33.360> go<00:00:33.540> over<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.899> too<00:00:34.140> much<00:00:34.320> because<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.890> can

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
to go over that too much because you can

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.580 
to go over that too much because you can
get<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.730> from<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.120> video<00:00:36.300> if<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.660> need<00:00:37.380> it

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
get that from that video if you need it

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.889 
get that from that video if you need it
so<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.700> plan<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.390> video<00:00:39.660> being

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
so this is I plan on this video being

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.650 
so this is I plan on this video being
quite<00:00:40.200> short<00:00:40.969> so<00:00:41.969> what<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.390> need<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.690> do<00:00:42.870> is

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
quite short so what you need to do is

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.010 
quite short so what you need to do is
start<00:00:45.660> by<00:00:45.840> draining<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.289> fluid<00:00:46.940> and<00:00:48.020> then

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
start by draining the fluid and then

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.029 
start by draining the fluid and then
taking<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.440> pipe<00:00:49.649> off<00:00:50.570> next<00:00:51.890> we're<00:00:52.890> going<00:00:52.980> to

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
taking the pipe off next we're going to

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.889 
taking the pipe off next we're going to
pull<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.370> head<00:00:53.520> off<00:00:53.670> but<00:00:53.969> before<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:54.539> do<00:00:54.690> we're

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
pull the head off but before we do we're

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.060 
pull the head off but before we do we're
going<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.050> talk<00:00:55.260> about<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.620> plumbing<00:00:55.829> a

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
going to talk about the plumbing a

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.020 
going to talk about the plumbing a
little<00:00:56.309> bit

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.070 

looking<00:01:03.840> down<00:01:03.989> from<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.350> top<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:05.930> few<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
looking down from the top a few of the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.870 
looking down from the top a few of the
pipes<00:01:07.320> we're<00:01:07.530> going<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.710> go<00:01:07.860> over<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.700> one

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
pipes we're going to go over is this one

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.020 
pipes we're going to go over is this one
here<00:01:09.030> goes<00:01:09.270> up<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> radiator<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.409> believe

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
here goes up to the radiator I believe

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.700 
here goes up to the radiator I believe
this<00:01:12.030> one<00:01:12.240> here<00:01:12.630> loops<00:01:13.530> back<00:01:15.380> was<00:01:16.380> going

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
this one here loops back was going

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.530 
this one here loops back was going
through<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.979> carburetor<00:01:17.220> but<00:01:17.940> we<00:01:18.060> no<00:01:18.509> longer

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
through the carburetor but we no longer

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.530 
through the carburetor but we no longer
need<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.770> bypass<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.610> here<00:01:20.790> when<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.090> take

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
need this bypass in here when we take

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.170 
need this bypass in here when we take
this<00:01:21.720> off<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.950> what<00:01:23.130> we're<00:01:23.310> going<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.520> do<00:01:23.850> is

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
this off so what we're going to do is

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.950 
this off so what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:24.840> going<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.990> take<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.380> one<00:01:25.619> here

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
we're going to take this one here

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.560 
we're going to take this one here
probably<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.110> cap<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.830> off<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.490> put<00:01:30.390> this

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
probably just cap it off and put this

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.170 
probably just cap it off and put this
this<00:01:31.530> one<00:01:31.710> here<00:01:31.920> directly<00:01:32.369> into<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.940> head<00:01:33.149> of

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
this one here directly into the head of

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.940 
this one here directly into the head of
the<00:01:33.630> other<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.500> we're<00:01:34.770> going<00:01:34.920> to

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
the other one and we're going to

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.609 
the other one and we're going to
eliminate<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.910> loopback<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:37.050> over<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:37.560> is

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
eliminate the loopback this over here is

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.889 
eliminate the loopback this over here is
your<00:01:37.920> temperature<00:01:38.369> sensor<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.539> if<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.720> don't

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
your temperature sensor and if you don't

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.710 
your temperature sensor and if you don't
hook<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.170> up<00:01:40.289> correctly<00:01:40.909> or<00:01:41.909> there<00:01:42.270> isn't<00:01:42.390> a

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
hook it up correctly or there isn't a

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.580 
hook it up correctly or there isn't a
well<00:01:43.170> ground<00:01:43.590> well<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.729> not<00:01:44.909> well<00:01:45.090> grounded

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
well ground well it's not well grounded

well ground well it's not well grounded
your<00:01:46.590> template<00:01:47.340> will<00:01:47.460> come<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:47.909> when<00:01:48.030> we

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
your template will come on so when we

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.550 
your template will come on so when we
install<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.720> we<00:01:48.929> need<00:01:49.050> to<00:01:49.110> take<00:01:49.319> a<00:01:49.380> little

like this now if you want to continue to
have<00:04:56.560> this<00:04:56.710> loop<00:04:56.980> back<00:04:57.250> what<00:04:58.210> you<00:04:58.330> can<00:04:58.510> do<00:04:59.100> is

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
have this loop back what you can do is

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.700 
have this loop back what you can do is
use<00:05:01.570> your<00:05:01.980> vise<00:05:02.980> grips<00:05:03.340> and<00:05:03.690> you<00:05:04.690> can<00:05:04.960> pull

this<00:05:05.980> out<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:08.320> problem<00:05:08.740> with<00:05:08.890> that<00:05:08.920> is<00:05:09.360> then

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
this out the problem with that is then

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.730 
this out the problem with that is then
you<00:05:10.510> have<00:05:10.690> a<00:05:10.720> look<00:05:10.960> a<00:05:10.990> short<00:05:11.380> piece<00:05:11.530> that<00:05:11.710> goes

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
you have a look a short piece that goes

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.890 
you have a look a short piece that goes
from<00:05:11.950> here<00:05:12.280> to<00:05:12.310> here<00:05:13.060> and<00:05:13.240> then<00:05:13.300> this<00:05:13.420> one<00:05:13.570> goes

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
from here to here and then this one goes

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.290 
from here to here and then this one goes
up<00:05:13.930> to<00:05:14.440> the<00:05:14.530> radiator<00:05:15.430> and<00:05:16.000> this<00:05:16.120> one<00:05:16.270> just

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
up to the radiator and this one just

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.590 
up to the radiator and this one just
loops<00:05:16.690> back<00:05:17.160> to<00:05:18.160> the<00:05:18.310> scooter<00:05:18.700> I'm<00:05:19.330> going<00:05:19.540> to

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
loops back to the scooter I'm going to

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.580 
loops back to the scooter I'm going to
take<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:19.870> loop<00:05:20.020> back<00:05:20.230> out<00:05:22.020> doing<00:05:23.020> so<00:05:23.230> I<00:05:23.260> don't

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
take the loop back out doing so I don't

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.790 
take the loop back out doing so I don't
need<00:05:23.860> to<00:05:24.400> pull<00:05:24.610> this<00:05:24.930> so<00:05:25.930> I'll<00:05:26.110> do<00:05:26.290> that<00:05:26.500> and

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
need to pull this so I'll do that and

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.040 
need to pull this so I'll do that and
I'll<00:05:27.310> take<00:05:27.520> this<00:05:27.700> off<00:05:27.970> and<00:05:28.680> what<00:05:29.680> I've<00:05:29.830> gotten

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
I'll take this off and what I've gotten

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:40.730 
I'll take this off and what I've gotten
is<00:05:34.140> some<00:05:35.140> I<00:05:37.440> went<00:05:38.440> down<00:05:38.590> to<00:05:38.770> the<00:05:38.860> local

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
hardware store and I got basically

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.159 
hardware store and I got basically
vision<00:05:46.240> for<00:05:46.390> shelf<00:05:48.060> but<00:05:49.060> bit<00:05:49.360> all<00:05:49.660> I<00:05:49.690> needed

go quick here I'll take this plug push
it<00:06:10.410> down<00:06:10.560> in<00:06:10.800> there<00:06:11.570> basically<00:06:12.830> this<00:06:13.830> actually

is this holds the shelf this is for
shelfs<00:06:17.940> but<00:06:18.120> I<00:06:18.150> only<00:06:18.750> thing<00:06:18.900> I'd<00:06:19.020> find<00:06:19.320> at<00:06:19.440> the

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
shelfs but I only thing I'd find at the

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.900 
shelfs but I only thing I'd find at the
local<00:06:19.740> hardware<00:06:20.070> store<00:06:20.310> that<00:06:20.430> would<00:06:20.520> plug<00:06:20.760> it

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
local hardware store that would plug it

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.610 
local hardware store that would plug it
and<00:06:21.360> that's<00:06:22.080> fine<00:06:22.170> and<00:06:22.730> that's<00:06:23.730> capped<00:06:24.240> off

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
and that's fine and that's capped off
