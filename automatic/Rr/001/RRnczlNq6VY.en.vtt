statistics let's jump into some games
and<00:01:10.060> see<00:01:10.240> exactly<00:01:10.869> how<00:01:11.320> this<00:01:11.560> beast<00:01:12.009> performs

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.420 
and see exactly how this beast performs
online<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:14.140> first<00:01:14.170> thing<00:01:14.710> that<00:01:14.920> I<00:01:14.979> noticed

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
online the first thing that I noticed

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.450 
online the first thing that I noticed
about<00:01:15.549> him<00:01:16.000> is<00:01:16.210> that<00:01:16.420> he<00:01:16.690> is<00:01:16.720> almost

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
about him is that he is almost

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.850 
about him is that he is almost
impossible<00:01:18.460> to<00:01:18.670> push<00:01:19.000> away<00:01:19.240> his<00:01:19.840> 92<00:01:20.320> strength

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
impossible to push away his 92 strength

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.880 
impossible to push away his 92 strength
is<00:01:21.070> maybe<00:01:21.430> his<00:01:21.700> most<00:01:22.030> important<00:01:22.810> attribute<00:01:23.380> he

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
is maybe his most important attribute he

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.010 
is maybe his most important attribute he
can<00:01:24.070> just<00:01:24.280> blaze<00:01:24.670> through<00:01:25.119> defenders<00:01:25.810> and

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
can just blaze through defenders and

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.469 
can just blaze through defenders and
they<00:01:26.500> can't<00:01:26.890> do<00:01:27.159> anything<00:01:27.520> about<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:28.030> he<00:01:28.360> is

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
they can't do anything about it he is

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.289 
they can't do anything about it he is
truly<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:29.290> Hulk<00:01:29.650> of<00:01:29.920> people<00:01:30.430> finishing<00:01:31.000> wise

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
truly the Hulk of people finishing wise

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.390 
truly the Hulk of people finishing wise
he<00:01:31.690> is<00:01:31.720> deadly<00:01:32.470> he<00:01:32.619> has<00:01:32.770> a<00:01:32.799> perfect

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
he is deadly he has a perfect

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.789 
he is deadly he has a perfect
combination<00:01:33.640> of<00:01:34.210> shut<00:01:34.510> power<00:01:34.720> and<00:01:35.049> finishing

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.520 
combination of shut power and finishing
which<00:01:36.190> make<00:01:36.700> him<00:01:37.060> very<00:01:37.330> efficient<00:01:38.080> in<00:01:38.200> front

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
which make him very efficient in front

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.500 
which make him very efficient in front
of<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.830> goal<00:01:39.040> but<00:01:39.400> you<00:01:39.610> might<00:01:39.850> want<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:40.390> be

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
of the goal but you might want to be

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.170 
of the goal but you might want to be
careful<00:01:41.080> with<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:41.650> power<00:01:41.950> up<00:01:42.340> because<00:01:42.909> his

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
careful with the power up because his

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.980 
careful with the power up because his
shot<00:01:43.600> is<00:01:43.840> so<00:01:44.380> so<00:01:44.799> powerful<00:01:45.159> so<00:01:45.850> you<00:01:46.180> won't<00:01:46.720> need

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
shot is so so powerful so you won't need

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.580 
shot is so so powerful so you won't need
to<00:01:47.049> over<00:01:47.619> press<00:01:47.860> it<00:01:48.100> as<00:01:48.490> it<00:01:48.970> might<00:01:49.330> go<00:01:49.689> wide<00:01:49.990> the

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
to over press it as it might go wide the

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.530 
to over press it as it might go wide the
only<00:01:50.920> real<00:01:51.100> problem<00:01:51.460> when<00:01:51.850> it<00:01:52.000> comes<00:01:52.299> down<00:01:52.479> to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
only real problem when it comes down to

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.679 
only real problem when it comes down to
finishing<00:01:53.080> for<00:01:53.650> Hulk<00:01:53.920> is<00:01:54.280> his<00:01:54.970> two<00:01:55.299> stars

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
finishing for Hulk is his two stars

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.260 
finishing for Hulk is his two stars
Wingfoot<00:01:56.259> being<00:01:56.979> very<00:01:57.220> risky<00:01:57.580> sometimes<00:01:58.060> to

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
Wingfoot being very risky sometimes to

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.480 
Wingfoot being very risky sometimes to
finish<00:01:58.689> while<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.320> are<00:01:59.500> on<00:01:59.650> his<00:01:59.890> right<00:02:00.220> foot

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
finish while you are on his right foot

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.420 
finish while you are on his right foot
so<00:02:00.700> try<00:02:01.060> avoiding<00:02:01.450> that<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:02.049> go<00:02:02.619> most<00:02:03.009> times

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
so try avoiding that and go most times

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.630 
so try avoiding that and go most times
