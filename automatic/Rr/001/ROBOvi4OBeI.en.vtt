00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.850 
that and then they'd be able to have
communications<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:33.090> terms<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.420> video<00:00:33.690> chat

now<00:00:34.860> also<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.550> restriction<00:00:36.030> on<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.360> at<00:00:36.540> this

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
now also a restriction on this at this

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.369 
now also a restriction on this at this
time<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:37.260> Wi-Fi<00:00:37.739> only<00:00:37.770> now<00:00:38.730> obviously<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
time is Wi-Fi only now obviously the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.889 
time is Wi-Fi only now obviously the
this<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.340> very<00:00:41.489> intensive<00:00:42.180> application

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
this is a very intensive application

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.130 
this is a very intensive application
very<00:00:43.170> intensive<00:00:43.860> implementation<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.850> data<00:00:45.390> so

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
very intensive implementation of data so

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.080 
very intensive implementation of data so
why<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> strong<00:00:47.039> Wi-Fi<00:00:47.370> connection<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
why a strong Wi-Fi connection is the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.869 
why a strong Wi-Fi connection is the
best<00:00:48.300> choice<00:00:48.559> now<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.590> would<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.980> see<00:00:50.190> 3g<00:00:50.700> a

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
best choice now I would like to see 3g a

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.819 
best choice now I would like to see 3g a
apple<00:00:51.539> says<00:00:51.719> they're<00:00:51.899> working<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.680> we

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
apple says they're working on it so we

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.350 
apple says they're working on it so we
probably<00:00:53.039> won't<00:00:53.460> see<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.180> while

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
probably won't see it for a while

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.959 
probably won't see it for a while
because<00:00:54.600> ATT<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.440> kind<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.739> dicey<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.280> terms<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
because ATT is kind of dicey in terms of

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.900 
because ATT is kind of dicey in terms of
their<00:00:57.149> mobile<00:00:57.480> data<00:00:57.660> coverage<00:00:58.079> but<00:00:58.980> um<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.670> I'm

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
their mobile data coverage but um so I'm

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.549 
their mobile data coverage but um so I'm
just<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.239> give<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.539> demo<00:01:00.930> here<00:01:01.199> so

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
can go ahead and mute the conversation

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.230 
can go ahead and mute the conversation
so<00:02:01.439> he<00:02:01.560> can't<00:02:01.829> see<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.280> or<00:02:02.310> he<00:02:02.640> can't<00:02:02.850> hear<00:02:03.060> you

and then you can also end the call right

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.889 
and then you can also end the call right
here<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.820> then<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.420> button<00:02:06.750> that

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
here and then this is the button that

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.990 
here and then this is the button that
allows<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.409> change<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.670> can<00:02:08.789> go<00:02:08.910> ahead

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
and make it the rear camera which I was

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.730 
and make it the rear camera which I was
just<00:02:10.619> blocking<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.280> as<00:02:11.489> you

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
just blocking and as you

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.680 
just blocking and as you
so<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.040> can<00:02:12.340> show<00:02:12.820> them<00:02:13.000> whatever<00:02:13.180> you<00:02:13.390> want

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
so anyway so then you can again change

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.360 
so anyway so then you can again change
from<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.650> can<00:02:17.770> also<00:02:17.890> move<00:02:18.190> your

from that and you can also move your
picture<00:02:18.700> around<00:02:18.850> obviously<00:02:19.300> it's<00:02:19.870> not<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:20.080> big

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
picture around obviously it's not a big

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.900 
picture around obviously it's not a big
deal<00:02:20.350> but<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.100> is<00:02:21.190> nice<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.400> know<00:02:21.580> what<00:02:21.790> you

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
deal but it is nice to know what you

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.440

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
and then you can change orientations

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.300

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.860 
whatever the case may be so that is

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
FaceTime it's a really interesting

tools<00:02:38.020> to<00:02:38.770> implement<00:02:39.040> again<00:02:39.580> i<00:02:39.610> can't<00:02:39.940> wait

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
tools to implement again i can't wait

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.670 
tools to implement again i can't wait
for<00:02:40.120> these<00:02:40.390> aps<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.930> be<00:02:41.050> public<00:02:41.350> so<00:02:41.470> any

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
for these aps to be public so any

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.500 
for these aps to be public so any
services<00:02:42.130> are<00:02:42.250> able<00:02:42.460> to<00:02:42.550> use<00:02:42.670> them<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.030> i

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
services are able to use them and i

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.420 
services are able to use them and i
think<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:43.990> really<00:02:44.020> works<00:02:44.470> well<00:02:44.590> although

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
think that it really works well although

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.310 
think that it really works well although
over<00:02:45.790> Wi-Fi<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.450> need<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.780> good<00:02:46.990> connection

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
over Wi-Fi you need a good connection

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.960 
over Wi-Fi you need a good connection
and<00:02:47.560> i<00:02:47.740> hope<00:02:47.980> that<00:02:48.190> in<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.430> future<00:02:48.460> they

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
and i hope that in the future they

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.230 
and i hope that in the future they
support<00:02:49.420> 3g<00:02:49.840> bands<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:51.610> then<00:02:51.760> this<00:02:51.850> is<00:02:52.030> just

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
support 3g bands so then this is just

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.820 
support 3g bands so then this is just
how<00:02:52.750> they<00:02:52.930> would<00:02:53.050> send<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:53.350> one<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:53.710> you<00:02:53.770> can

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
how they would send you one and you can

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.460 
how they would send you one and you can
go<00:02:54.040> ahead<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.250> accept<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.900> after<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.230> accept

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
go ahead and accept and after you accept

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.840 
go ahead and accept and after you accept
it<00:02:56.560> takes<00:02:56.740> a<00:02:56.800> little<00:02:56.920> while<00:02:57.130> before<00:02:57.370> it

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
it takes a little while before it

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.360 
it takes a little while before it
actually<00:02:58.210> connects<00:02:58.800> but<00:02:59.800> then<00:02:59.950> it'll<00:03:00.100> finally

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
actually connects but then it'll finally

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.590 
actually connects but then it'll finally
connect<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:00.970> then<00:03:01.120> you'll<00:03:01.240> see<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.510> other

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
connect and then you'll see the other

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.320 
connect and then you'll see the other
person<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.350> you<00:03:02.440> can<00:03:02.620> do<00:03:02.800> and<00:03:03.070> then<00:03:03.760> you<00:03:04.060> just
