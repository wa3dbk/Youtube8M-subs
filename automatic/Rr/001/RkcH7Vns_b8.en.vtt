without<00:02:52.049> even<00:02:52.410> needing<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.859> because<00:02:53.129> it<00:02:53.250> is

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
without even needing it because it is

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.240 
without even needing it because it is
like<00:02:53.579> a<00:02:53.609> really<00:02:53.970> strong<00:02:54.150> medication

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
isotretinoin is literally considered one

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.220

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
of the dangerous medications to

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.680 
of the dangerous medications to
prescribe<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.700> equivalent<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.450> rat
