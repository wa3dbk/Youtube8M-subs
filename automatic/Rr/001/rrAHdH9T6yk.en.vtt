00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
available and it's actually made out of

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.440 
available and it's actually made out of
stainless<00:00:34.500> steel<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.309> not<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.760> lumen<00:00:36.239> oh

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
stainless steel so it's not a lumen oh

and this is a rare error grip which has

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.500 
and this is a rare error grip which has
a<00:00:40.590> pretty<00:00:41.399> weird<00:00:41.670> which<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.360> like<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:43.110> basically

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
a pretty weird which I like it basically

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.200 
a pretty weird which I like it basically
epoxy<00:00:45.510> mix<00:00:46.050> with<00:00:46.800> glow-in-the-dark

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210

epoxy mix with glow-in-the-dark
and<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:49.739> reason<00:00:50.010> why<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.190> decided<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.910> have

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
and the reason why I decided to have

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.360 
and the reason why I decided to have
like<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.960> now<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.590> case<00:00:52.800> that's<00:00:52.980> not<00:00:53.160> what<00:00:53.250> it

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
like this now in case that's not what it

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
gonna pretty much have to build this rod

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.410 
gonna pretty much have to build this rod
all<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.410> way<00:01:01.530> from<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> blank<00:01:02.129> because<00:01:02.699> even

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
all the way from the blank because even

be reflects effecting a marine grade it

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.470 
be reflects effecting a marine grade it
has<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.320> be<00:03:34.470> seen<00:03:34.860> from<00:03:35.250> at<00:03:35.459> least<00:03:35.730> two<00:03:36.180> miles

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
because okay I think I caught it like

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:41.760 
because okay I think I caught it like
eight<00:06:36.010> times<00:06:36.460> and<00:06:37.330> I<00:06:37.570> give<00:06:38.080> that<00:06:38.320> deep<00:06:39.300> look<00:06:40.770> so
