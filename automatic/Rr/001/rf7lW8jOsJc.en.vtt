00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.950
 hi in this video I'm going to make a 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.109
 manicure in black that will carry 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.600
 colored strips is very simple very 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.310
 pretty and also very quick to do what 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.650
 that we're going to need, they're just going to 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.480
 these guides being French who do not 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.070
 we need 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.080
 I mean I can replace them 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.640
 for other things it does not have to be this 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.160
 exactly if we have them and we want 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.740
 use them well if we can not use by 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.330
 example strips of zeal or the part of 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.710
 above the post-it 's cut out a 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.770
 thin strip and we can also 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.480
 use and we're going to need enamels from 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.539
 colors I for example I already have the base 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.420
 put because one of the requirements of 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:41.489
 This manicure is that has dried 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.649
 bottom part what would be the basis that 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.479
 are these colors to apply the base 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.809
 from above that is going to be the black 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:53.309
 I then placed the red I 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.170
 placed yellow and blue and also a 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.300
 little bit of green 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.640
 you can use the colors you want 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.370
 these are the ones that I used and also 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.539
 we're going to need the black enamel that 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.600
 is going to be the one we're going to give the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.049
 effect and then to give it a final touch 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.060
 The top coat or transparent enamel for 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.610
 put it over and protect a little 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.190
 the design and give it shine what we're going to 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.200
 to do is as I tell you to paint the base and 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.909
 wait for it to be pretty enough 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.850
 dry to be able to paste this on 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.310
 it does not take long for it to dry either 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.460
 because we do not need layers too 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.940
 fat simply having this is worth a 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.360
 base with colors I have put the 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:39.720
 lines have to go from above to 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.170
 down and has been putting the colors then 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.180
 well in dashes 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.020
 Well now what I'm going to do is 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.540
 put 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.790
 good morning these are called guides 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.560
 by the nail I can put them in a way 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.930
 horizontal or random but I 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.890
 I recommend horizontally and you can 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.170
 put the ones you want 1 2 whatever or 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.800
 also what your nail by size os 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.640
 permit 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.050
 I 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.050
 I'm going to put them 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.010
 I do not know two or three 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.590
 well I will put 3 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.620
 maybe to make it look more I've put a 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.360
 up another one and now I'm going to put another 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.760
 down 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.830
 but you can use less you can put 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.740
 two or even two fingers of 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.210
 practices maybe also bring a 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.630
 a 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.760
 longer or wider than normal 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.070
 so it 's good that it ends more but 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.660
 good in your nail what is left or what 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.280
 I wish you like it 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.750
 and now simply when we already have it 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.820
 if what I'm going to do is give it for 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.920
 over a layer of black I have chosen 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.400
 black you can use the color that 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.930
 you want but I bonus as long as 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.240
 there are not those that you have used in the 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.910
 but I like the grace that 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.200
 has is to throw the black that is the 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.260
 what else contrasts the best with the 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.140
 colorful or good a white either what 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.300
 we would have because it discards 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.069
 so what I do is go cover 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.460
 look that between the holes also 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.130
 you are putting enamel 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:21.460
 go putting as I tell you that the 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.460
 black enamel for everything like this 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.930
 and once we have it, we do not have 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.389
 to wait for it to dry completely 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.310
 because if it dries completely when removing 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:33.579
 the guides what we can get is 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.230
 that comes out from behind all the enamel or 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.050
 much of the enamel as if 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.420
 I had 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.930
 as if when we hit the enamel that 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.000
 it is split as if it had started and 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.760
 we will not look good then before 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.430
 for it to dry for example now either 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.830
 with our finger or with tweezers 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.360
 do not stain us 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:00.000
 and removing the guides that we have put and 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.740
 removing those from the nail 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.270
 I for example used these clamps 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.270
 and so I did not get stained 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.959
 and good the last 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.870
 and the design that we would have 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.760
 It would be this that as I said before I could 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.000
 vary according to the colors that 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.770
 let's use and how we place the guides and 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.620
 the number of guides that we put and so on 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.810
 etcetera the result that we obtain then 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.639
 it's quite original and the truth is that 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.190
 we have taken very very very little in 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.470
 do it now just what would have 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.419
 what to do to protect a little bit what 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.419
 that edits catch with the top coat 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.560
 and apply a layer on top 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:04.310
 well this way and now yes that already 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.050
 we would have finished the black manicure with 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.940
 Colorful stripes I hope you have 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.480
 liked and that you cheer up because it is very 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.480
 simple
