00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 very good to all welcome to a 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.470
 new video we are here by syngenta 494 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.650
 with the favorite Moor that would happen as 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.110
 I was going to say this with the Moor because I 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.000
 I am a morose and he and the moro the monkey 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.160
 teacher like this action well I'm here 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.289
 and I also have a new microphone that I've 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.369
 stolen in the josemi store and now I can 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.369
 do things like these look 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.660
 more penetrating as the sounds these that 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.480
 you can buy to put then in the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.450
 television something like that that's that's not 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.460
 has nothing to do with that but it 's very 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.399
 well take this pin of the country that I 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.469
 spare and go well we are here with the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.260
 son of the creator of the voices of the call 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.460
 of duty 4 which is the one that follows 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.460
 asking and it 's true 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:56.440
 at 15 his father 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.440
 the voices of the Moors of 4 and the molar 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:11.430
 well and let's play a little bit 44 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.290
 4 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:33.130
 the map I do not know about you but it was from my 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.720
 favorites is very very funny very good 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.820
 but if they ask you the answer the house of 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.580
 forward the left is a bit shit 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.200
 do not forget the existence and the 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.130
 life you know look at this was a trick of 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.229
 When I arrived, you came here 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.110
 and if he has that enemy then 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.040
 kill 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:55.150
 Granado well annoyances but I say yes 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.150
 as it has not been seen in your camera 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.130
 one 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.289
 and finish with everyone 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.110
 and they have not seen me fuck has one with the 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.610
 shotgun next door said 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.030
 people lately have many 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.030
 shotguns 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.990
 in all the games this sounds like revenge 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:20.180
 enemy located 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.370
 enemy does not die already mind-boggling 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.870
 I think there is some check in this 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.880
 game that they have put to the ak-47 the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:32.170
 first bullets do not impact 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:38.620
 well I feel sometimes it's a little scary 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.620
 from manco knife rather 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.290
 is to reappear and die in people is 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.540
 very vitiated to this game we have a 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.390
 up but we kill him 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.739
 and this aberration answers you but there 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.340
 one carbine with the rib is 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.330
 trying to destroy the car 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.600
 and fucking balls 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.790
 you do not show up here I do not imagine with point 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.599
 what's in there they have me signed 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.640
 I do not have ghubn and at the same time the attack 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.530
 aerial 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.640
 I think that if this bet we are 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.080
 money come on now it says screams here I 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.530
 one is left 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.540
 I'm going to fuck I have of me 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.540
 let's go the rallies 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.930
 It kills me, there are bulerÃ­as where 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.040
 walls 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.810
 but I have a helicopter where I am 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.920
 fucking playing hide and seek with ok 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.920
 pussies in syrup 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.580
 another more 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.580
 another one 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.750
 in the day you used to also for all 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.640
 sides 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.640
 and of that type the madrid as he kills uncle 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.920
 your father 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.490
 I will love 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.819
 make me of the hiatus on the way 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:08.420
 this is won or not 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:11.209
 Very bad, nothing happens 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.510
 we have types to earn something to be earned 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.900
 be won and be great the 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.200
 very large 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.880
 look nothing 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.420
 because there is a French in the other team 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.420
 it sounds 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.310
 is that the castle really is a 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.310
 modern day wonder 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.880
 of the best 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.070
 it cost him to do it 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.470
 an afternoon 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.990
 with him really with a stick or a rubber band 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.420
 the pulse is intense took a stone that 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:53.849
 they were the first bullets that tim that 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:57.050
 bread what tense very much look at ak-47 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:05:00.610
 above I call it that 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.610
 m 10 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.630
 I have air attack, air attack, no 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.650
 available 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.650
 no no no 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.410
 I have the fairest ammunition 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.430
 attack 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.250
 we go until when the cabin of the 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.250
 zoo has disappeared 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.630
 mate 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.350
 and we are finding a 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.350
 little more nothing 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:45.630
 good simple 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:49.310
 Miami by helicopter but how he sang to me 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.310
 this grenade is decisive 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.409
 I've got them up the bastards 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.849
 in what area is the question 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:00.439
 here I must see that nothing here 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:03.279
 I would like you to teach yourself to have both 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:03.279
 style like me someday 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:11.139
 no kidding 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:14.160
 and he does not want to be the best at that, that's not 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.160
 it needs reason says 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.000
 the reason 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.350
 I'm sorry what this coincidence has 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.940
 inside down in that on which floor breasts 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.160
 bestiary high neighborhood or nobody your insurance 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.770
 one leads me to one and grenades to 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.010
 who are here is here is here 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.010
 so low 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.450

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.280

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.610
 not here 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:11.970
 and in the end you run out of legs 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:15.120
 good 32 9 in the end is not bad we have 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:17.330
 started a little fucked but the 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.330
