00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:25.790 

let's<00:00:15.360> play<00:00:15.540> some<00:00:15.809> zune<00:00:16.020> games

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.280 

my<00:00:26.429> going<00:00:26.670> forward

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.620 

so<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.410> see<00:00:34.590> controls<00:00:35.040> here<00:00:35.370> or<00:00:36.180> actually<00:00:36.360> in

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
so you see controls here or actually in

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.110 
so you see controls here or actually in
the<00:00:36.720> corners<00:00:37.080> of<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.290> screen<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:38.130> you<00:00:39.000> can

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
the corners of the screen and you can

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.260 
the corners of the screen and you can
see<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.680> accelerometer<00:00:40.760> is<00:00:41.760> actually

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
see that the accelerometer is actually

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.850 
see that the accelerometer is actually
pretty<00:00:42.510> accurate<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:43.110> terms<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.470> how<00:00:43.620> well<00:00:43.830> I

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
pretty accurate in terms of how well I

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.910 
pretty accurate in terms of how well I
tilt<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.340> spring<00:00:46.310> and<00:00:47.310> the<00:00:47.430> fact<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.850> I

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
tilt the spring and the fact that I

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.410 
tilt the spring and the fact that I
can't<00:00:49.920> turn<00:00:50.370> his<00:00:50.520> only<00:00:50.760> because<00:00:51.060> I'm<00:00:51.150> holding

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
can't turn his only because I'm holding

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.820 
can't turn his only because I'm holding
the<00:00:51.510> camera<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:51.989> one<00:00:52.170> hand<00:00:52.380> and<00:00:52.530> add<00:00:52.650> my

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
the camera with one hand and add my

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.800 
the camera with one hand and add my
finger<00:00:53.310> jammed<00:00:53.700> on<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> accelerator<00:00:54.360> for<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
finger jammed on the accelerator for the

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.850 
finger jammed on the accelerator for the
other<00:00:54.989> hand<00:00:55.940> I'm<00:00:57.020> ten<00:00:58.020> seconds<00:00:58.470> behind<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
other hand I'm ten seconds behind the

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.160 
other hand I'm ten seconds behind the
leader<00:00:58.950> and<00:00:59.370> you<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.180> see<00:01:00.360> that<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.720> graphics

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
leader and you can see that the graphics

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.979 
leader and you can see that the graphics
right<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.500> pretty<00:01:01.920> fluid<00:01:02.690> there<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.780> why<00:01:03.960> i

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
right here pretty fluid there is why i

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.390 
right here pretty fluid there is why i
wasn't<00:01:04.260> going<00:01:04.350> fully<00:01:04.710> fast<00:01:05.010> there<00:01:05.280> was

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
wasn't going fully fast there was

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.010 
wasn't going fully fast there was
because<00:01:05.580> i<00:01:05.729> didn't<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.060> my<00:01:06.150> finger<00:01:06.600> fully<00:01:06.840> on

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
because i didn't have my finger fully on

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.880 
because i didn't have my finger fully on
the<00:01:07.050> accelerator<00:01:08.240> let's<00:01:09.240> slow<00:01:09.540> down<00:01:09.570> here<00:01:12.890> so

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
the accelerator let's slow down here so

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.740 
the accelerator let's slow down here so
you<00:01:13.979> see<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.190> isn't<00:01:14.460> exactly<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:15.330> arcade

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
you see this isn't exactly in arcade

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.270 
you see this isn't exactly in arcade
racer<00:01:16.140> we<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.440> just<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.710> power<00:01:16.950> slide

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
racer we can just like power slide

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.490 
racer we can just like power slide
around<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.670> corners<00:01:21.020> but<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.229> actually

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
around the corners but it is actually

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:36.910 
around the corners but it is actually
pretty<00:01:22.920> good<00:01:23.190> in<00:01:23.460> terms<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:25.580> controls<00:01:26.580> overall

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.360 

now<00:01:37.920> 16<00:01:38.460> seconds<00:01:38.910> behind<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.270> leader<00:01:40.370> but

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
now 16 seconds behind the leader but

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.070 
now 16 seconds behind the leader but
again<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.730> can<00:01:41.850> see<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> graphics<00:01:42.510> to<00:01:42.750> their

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
again you can see the graphics to their

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.760 
again you can see the graphics to their
fluid<00:01:43.620> there<00:01:43.770> fast<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.490> nothing<00:01:45.360> really<00:01:45.770> laggy

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
fluid there fast is nothing really laggy

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.560 
fluid there fast is nothing really laggy
about<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.520> controls<00:01:47.910> or<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.420> zune<00:01:48.600> HD<00:01:50.570> that's

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
about the controls or the zune HD that's

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:04.140 
about the controls or the zune HD that's
I<00:01:51.720> should<00:01:51.900> get<00:01:51.990> off<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.290> wall<00:01:52.440> here

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.730 

23<00:02:05.150> seconds<00:02:05.540> behind<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.960> leader<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.260> you<00:02:06.560> see

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
23 seconds behind the leader and you see

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.100 
23 seconds behind the leader and you see
I<00:02:06.770> did<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:06.979> full<00:02:07.220> lap<00:02:07.400> there<00:02:07.729> you<00:02:08.720> can<00:02:08.869> see<00:02:08.899> the

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
I did a full lap there you can see the

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.719 
I did a full lap there you can see the
frame<00:02:09.319> rate<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.740> it's<00:02:09.920> actually<00:02:10.250> not<00:02:10.399> too<00:02:10.459> bad

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
frame rate to it's actually not too bad

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:19.660 
frame rate to it's actually not too bad
let's<00:02:11.150> slow<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:11.390> down<00:02:18.069> yeah<00:02:19.069> that's<00:02:19.310> gaming

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
let's slow it down yeah that's gaming

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.340 
let's slow it down yeah that's gaming
with<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.790> zune<00:02:20.060> HD<00:02:20.209> minute<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.810> pause<00:02:21.020> button

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
with the zune HD minute the pause button

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.730 
with the zune HD minute the pause button
here<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.970> can<00:02:23.120> see<00:02:23.270> it's<00:02:23.420> paused<00:02:23.690> have<00:02:24.560> some

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.760 
hand corner of the camera angle so I can
do<00:02:38.570> a<00:02:38.600> different<00:02:38.810> camera<00:02:39.110> angles<00:02:39.470> me<00:02:39.560> upper
