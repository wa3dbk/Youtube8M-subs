00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.200
 powerful at the defensive or offensive level 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.700
 very good guard 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.260

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.960
 maybe the stress of taking me a 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.740
 still spoon of tabasco but there I 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.010

 second half there we completely 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.880
 changed face 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.790
 we completely changed the face of 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.410
 the team we are transformed into is a thousand 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.840
 times better 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.190

 courteous 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.050
 my goalkeeper makes a stop so I 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:39.930
 I'm sorry it's well deserved but 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:42.810

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.040

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.600
 razac on skype 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.910
 Frankly it was a big game but 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.860
 frankly it was well deserved I 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.960
 deserve my first half victory 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.910
 he ate me it was me who did not arrive 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.100
 to develop my game in the second half 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.050
 time I said I must let go 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.090
 I stop stressing I have to play 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.500
 my game I play them and I completely 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.280
 dominated the second period so the 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.410
 victory is deserved 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.360
 I hope you enjoyed this video
