okay so in this video I'm going to show

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.360 
okay so in this video I'm going to show
you<00:00:02.100> how<00:00:02.220> to<00:00:02.250> convert<00:00:02.669> an<00:00:02.939> old<00:00:03.030> one<00:00:03.360> more<00:00:04.370> to

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
you how to convert an old one more to

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.309 
you how to convert an old one more to
cut<00:00:05.580> down<00:00:05.819> trees<00:00:06.270> now<00:00:06.509> this<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:06.839> not<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.109> tree

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
cut down trees now this is not the tree

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.049 
cut down trees now this is not the tree
we're<00:00:07.470> going<00:00:07.560> to<00:00:07.620> be<00:00:07.710> cutting<00:00:07.890> down<00:00:08.059> because

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
we're going to be cutting down because

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.879 
we're going to be cutting down because
this<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.360> an<00:00:09.510> apple<00:00:09.870> tree<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.260> frankly<00:00:10.769> we

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
this is an apple tree and frankly we

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.799 
this is an apple tree and frankly we
need<00:00:11.010> it<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:11.880> just<00:00:12.030> an<00:00:12.179> idea<00:00:12.269> just<00:00:12.509> to

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
need it this is just an idea just to

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.089 
need it this is just an idea just to
give<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.139> size<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.559> what<00:00:13.740> one<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:13.920> these

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
give you the size of what one of these

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.330 
give you the size of what one of these
can<00:00:14.309> handle<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.500> well<00:00:16.500> based<00:00:16.920> on<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.190> density

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
can handle and well based on the density

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.680 
can handle and well based on the density
of<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.880> wood<00:00:18.029> you're<00:00:18.240> going<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.420> be<00:00:18.480> cutting

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
of the wood you're going to be cutting

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.300 
of the wood you're going to be cutting
it's<00:00:19.080> going<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.260> be<00:00:19.350> different<00:00:19.740> but<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.160> a

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
it's going to be different but this is a

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.830 
it's going to be different but this is a
fairly<00:00:20.609> large<00:00:20.939> tree<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.539> should<00:00:21.689> be<00:00:21.750> able

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
fairly large tree and it should be able

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.880 
fairly large tree and it should be able
to<00:00:21.960> handle<00:00:22.320> something<00:00:22.500> like<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:23.000> now<00:00:24.890> these

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
to handle something like this now these

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.380 
to handle something like this now these
are<00:00:26.010> just<00:00:26.130> two<00:00:26.369> old<00:00:26.400> lawnmowers<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.300> I've

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
are just two old lawnmowers that I've

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.080 
are just two old lawnmowers that I've
picked<00:00:27.570> out<00:00:27.980> to<00:00:28.980> provide<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.460> examples<00:00:30.000> of

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
picked out to provide you examples of

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.330 
picked out to provide you examples of
what<00:00:30.150> you're<00:00:30.420> looking<00:00:30.750> for<00:00:31.109> for<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.859> worthy

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
what you're looking for for a worthy

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.380 
what you're looking for for a worthy
candidate<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:33.559> the<00:00:34.559> conversion<00:00:35.130> now<00:00:35.610> first

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
candidate of the conversion now first

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.819 
candidate of the conversion now first
thing<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.719> both<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:36.960> these<00:00:37.200> lawnmowers<00:00:37.680> have

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
thing is both of these lawnmowers have

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.440 
thing is both of these lawnmowers have
is<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> steel<00:00:38.309> deck<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.850> what<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.120> gives<00:00:39.270> you

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
is a steel deck and what this gives you

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.580 
is a steel deck and what this gives you
is<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> ability<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:40.110> weld<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:41.010> them<00:00:41.160> easy<00:00:41.489> and

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
is the ability to weld to them easy and

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.369 
is the ability to weld to them easy and
do<00:00:43.590> modifications<00:00:43.890> pretty<00:00:44.670> quickly<00:00:44.969> too<00:00:45.379> this

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
do modifications pretty quickly too this

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.869 
do modifications pretty quickly too this
one<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.739> slightly<00:00:47.250> thicker<00:00:47.879> than<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.780> one

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
one is slightly thicker than this one

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.830 
one is slightly thicker than this one
but<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.149> not<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> one<00:00:51.570> we're<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:51.780> to

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
but this is not the one we're going to

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.420 
but this is not the one we're going to
be<00:00:51.930> using<00:00:52.140> one<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.100> things<00:00:53.219> you're<00:00:53.340> going

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
be using one of the things you're going

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.729 
be using one of the things you're going
to<00:00:53.520> look<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:53.820> as<00:00:53.910> well<00:00:53.940> as<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:55.020> distance<00:00:55.469> from

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
to look for as well as the distance from

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.729 
to look for as well as the distance from
the<00:00:56.550> front<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.910> mower<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:58.320> front<00:00:58.680> of

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the front of the mower to the front of

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.860 
the front of the mower to the front of
the<00:00:58.800> engine<00:00:59.160> here<00:00:59.370> now<00:01:00.000> some<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.329> our<00:01:00.449> lawn

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
the engine here now some of our lawn

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.540 
the engine here now some of our lawn
mowers<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.289> damaged<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.680> sideways<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.340> gives

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
mowers have damaged in sideways it gives

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.969 
mowers have damaged in sideways it gives
you<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> little<00:01:02.910> more<00:01:03.000> room<00:01:03.080> but<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.769> one

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
you a little more room but this one

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.130 
you a little more room but this one
doesn't<00:01:05.189> Jim<00:01:06.030> not<00:01:06.180> sure<00:01:06.360> if<00:01:06.450> any<00:01:06.630> lawn<00:01:06.869> mowers

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
doesn't Jim not sure if any lawn mowers

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.450 
doesn't Jim not sure if any lawn mowers
I<00:01:07.290> haven't<00:01:07.590> seen<00:01:07.740> anything<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.159> but

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
I haven't seen anything like that but

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.820 
I haven't seen anything like that but
I'm<00:01:08.549> sure<00:01:08.700> they<00:01:08.820> exist<00:01:09.170> but<00:01:10.170> since<00:01:10.680> this

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
I'm sure they exist but since this

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.500 
I'm sure they exist but since this
doesn't<00:01:11.070> tell<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.490> much<00:01:11.520> from<00:01:11.880> here<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.240> here

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
doesn't tell you much from here to here

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.300 
doesn't tell you much from here to here
because<00:01:13.080> your<00:01:13.229> blade<00:01:13.500> doesn't<00:01:13.710> always<00:01:13.950> go<00:01:14.250> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
because your blade doesn't always go to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.070 
because your blade doesn't always go to
the<00:01:14.549> front<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.939> mower<00:01:15.119> deck<00:01:15.150> what<00:01:15.930> you're

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
the front of the mower deck what you're

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.630 
the front of the mower deck what you're
really<00:01:16.259> looking<00:01:16.380> for<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.159> distance<00:01:17.490> from

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
really looking for is the distance from

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.399 
really looking for is the distance from
the<00:01:17.820> end<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.150> blade<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:18.990> front<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
the end of the blade to the front of the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.109 
the end of the blade to the front of the
motor<00:01:19.560> first<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.070> for<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.340> one<00:01:20.549> it's<00:01:20.970> about

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
motor first so for this one it's about

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.820 
motor first so for this one it's about
here<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.990> estimated<00:01:22.970> about<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.710> for<00:01:25.710> this

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
here so estimated about that for this

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.170 
here so estimated about that for this
one<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.159> about<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> same<00:01:26.610> thing<00:01:26.880> they're

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
one it's about the same thing they're

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.640 
one it's about the same thing they're
about<00:01:27.330> even<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:28.170> some<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.380> them<00:01:28.470> have<00:01:28.619> a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
about even but some of them have a

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.530 
about even but some of them have a
little<00:01:28.950> bit<00:01:29.040> more<00:01:29.250> room<00:01:29.490> like<00:01:29.939> Honda's<00:01:30.390> or

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
little bit more room like Honda's or

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.390 
little bit more room like Honda's or
whatever<00:01:30.750> they<00:01:31.110> have<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.409> lot<00:01:31.979> less<00:01:32.189> room

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
whatever they have a lot less room

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.749 
whatever they have a lot less room
because<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> valve<00:01:33.030> cover<00:01:34.759> now

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
because you have the valve cover now

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.940 
because you have the valve cover now
this<00:01:35.970> one's<00:01:36.180> also<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.900> worse<00:01:37.380> condition<00:01:37.920> than

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
this one's also in worse condition than

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.740 
this one's also in worse condition than
that<00:01:38.159> one<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.610> butterfly<00:01:39.119> valve<00:01:39.150> piece<00:01:39.570> here

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
that one the butterfly valve piece here

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.050 
that one the butterfly valve piece here
is<00:01:39.810> broken<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.979> deck<00:01:41.280> isn't<00:01:41.549> actually

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
is broken the deck isn't actually

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.490 
is broken the deck isn't actually
attached<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> handle<00:01:42.960> there<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:43.200> have

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
attached to the handle there I just have

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.580 
attached to the handle there I just have
this<00:01:43.649> old<00:01:44.149> blade<00:01:45.149> attachments<00:01:45.899> holding<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.439> on

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
this old blade attachments holding it on

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.370 
this old blade attachments holding it on
and<00:01:47.430> overall<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.570> mower<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.200> worse

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
and overall the mower is just in worse

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.069 
and overall the mower is just in worse
condition<00:01:50.299> starting<00:01:51.299> handle<00:01:51.600> isn't<00:01:51.869> quite

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
condition starting handle isn't quite

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.520 
condition starting handle isn't quite
proper<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.520> honestly<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.390> do<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> 3.75

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
proper and honestly I do like the 3.75

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.200 
proper and honestly I do like the 3.75
grades<00:01:55.829> because<00:01:56.009> they<00:01:56.189> do<00:01:56.250> work<00:01:56.549> very<00:01:56.790> well<00:01:56.850> I

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
grades because they do work very well I

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.690 
grades because they do work very well I
think<00:01:57.420> they're<00:01:57.719> very<00:01:57.750> reliable<00:01:58.430> so<00:01:59.430> first

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
think they're very reliable so first

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.469 
think they're very reliable so first
thing<00:01:59.820> we're<00:01:59.939> going<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.329> we're<00:02:00.450> just

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
thing we're going to do is we're just

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.530 
thing we're going to do is we're just
going<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.750> weld

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
going to weld

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.730 
going to weld
this<00:02:02.440> piece<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.240> deck<00:02:04.480> so<00:02:05.260> that<00:02:05.290> the<00:02:05.500> small

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
this piece to the deck so that the small

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.740 
this piece to the deck so that the small
connection<00:02:06.190> reviews<00:02:06.520> before<00:02:07.060> we<00:02:07.300> start<00:02:07.630> with

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
connection reviews before we start with

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.630 
connection reviews before we start with
the<00:02:07.840> actual<00:02:08.140> conversion<00:02:08.350> I'll<00:02:09.280> get<00:02:09.460> back<00:02:09.610> to

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
the actual conversion I'll get back to

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.700 
the actual conversion I'll get back to
them<00:02:09.910> okay<00:02:10.660> so<00:02:10.690> now<00:02:10.929> that<00:02:11.080> you<00:02:11.140> got<00:02:11.530> that

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
them okay so now that you got that

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.860 
them okay so now that you got that
tacked<00:02:12.040> together<00:02:12.340> we<00:02:13.210> can<00:02:13.420> go<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.720> next

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
tacked together we can go to the next

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.290 
tacked together we can go to the next
step<00:02:14.490> which<00:02:15.490> is<00:02:15.520> going<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.880> be<00:02:15.940> cutting<00:02:16.240> a

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
step which is going to be cutting a

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.710 
step which is going to be cutting a
semicircle<00:02:17.080> in<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.770> front<00:02:18.070> of<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.250> mower<00:02:18.720> but

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
semicircle in the front of the mower but

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.430 
semicircle in the front of the mower but
also<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.850> drew<00:02:21.850> this<00:02:21.940> outline<00:02:22.390> here<00:02:22.690> kind<00:02:23.410> of

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
also I drew this outline here kind of

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
also I drew this outline here kind of
give<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:23.650> an<00:02:23.770> idea<00:02:23.800> of<00:02:24.010> where<00:02:24.160> I'm<00:02:24.280> going<00:02:24.310> to

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
give you an idea of where I'm going to

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.310 
give you an idea of where I'm going to
be<00:02:24.550> cutting<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:24.910> but<00:02:25.600> you're<00:02:25.780> going<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.020> try<00:02:26.260> to

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
be cutting it but you're going to try to

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.570 
be cutting it but you're going to try to
leave<00:02:26.500> as<00:02:26.590> much<00:02:26.770> room<00:02:26.950> as<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.130> can<00:02:27.280> on<00:02:27.400> either

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
leave as much room as you can on either

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.610 
leave as much room as you can on either
side<00:02:27.910> where<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.270> wheels<00:02:28.450> are<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:29.170> stop<00:02:29.410> them

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
side where the wheels are to stop them

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.500 
side where the wheels are to stop them
from<00:02:29.850> flexing<00:02:30.850> so<00:02:31.000> you<00:02:31.060> cut<00:02:31.240> it<00:02:31.330> too<00:02:31.480> close

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
from flexing so you cut it too close

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.570 
from flexing so you cut it too close
there<00:02:31.990> they're<00:02:32.140> going<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.320> just<00:02:32.920> bend<00:02:33.340> the

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
there they're going to just bend the

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.330 
there they're going to just bend the
little<00:02:33.820> pieces<00:02:34.570> you<00:02:34.750> have<00:02:35.020> out<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:35.980> that's<00:02:36.100> it

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
little pieces you have out and that's it

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.160 
little pieces you have out and that's it
so<00:02:37.180> for<00:02:37.330> this<00:02:37.450> one<00:02:37.660> I'm<00:02:37.780> pretty<00:02:37.930> much<00:02:38.110> just

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
so for this one I'm pretty much just

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.870 
so for this one I'm pretty much just
going<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.560> follow<00:02:38.830> this<00:02:39.220> piece<00:02:39.610> right<00:02:39.820> here

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
going to follow this piece right here

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.760 
going to follow this piece right here
right<00:02:40.240> where<00:02:40.270> it<00:02:40.480> dips<00:02:40.750> in<00:02:40.990> anything<00:02:41.620> right

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
right where it dips in anything right

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.050 
right where it dips in anything right
there<00:02:41.980> probably<00:02:42.220> going<00:02:42.520> to<00:02:42.580> try<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.790> cut<00:02:42.970> as

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
there probably going to try to cut as

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.140 
there probably going to try to cut as
close<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.390> there<00:02:43.510> as<00:02:43.600> possible<00:02:44.790> I'm<00:02:45.790> not<00:02:45.970> going

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
close to there as possible I'm not going

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.580 
close to there as possible I'm not going
to<00:02:46.209> use<00:02:46.330> this<00:02:46.450> out<00:02:46.600> like<00:02:46.780> sit<00:02:47.140> sucks

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
to use this out like sit sucks

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.520 
to use this out like sit sucks
and<00:02:48.060> once<00:02:49.060> I<00:02:49.150> got<00:02:49.270> that<00:02:49.450> done<00:02:49.660> I'm<00:02:50.350> just<00:02:50.380> going

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
and once I got that done I'm just going

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.460 
and once I got that done I'm just going
to<00:02:50.680> show<00:02:51.130> you<00:02:51.220> what<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.400> next<00:02:51.550> step<00:02:51.790> is<00:02:55.470> okay

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
to show you what the next step is okay

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.010 
to show you what the next step is okay
so<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.739> front<00:02:57.010> has<00:02:57.190> been<00:02:57.220> cut<00:02:57.610> out<00:02:57.640> here<00:02:58.090> there

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
so the front has been cut out here there

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.729 
so the front has been cut out here there
it<00:02:59.110> is<00:02:59.200> right<00:02:59.350> there

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
it is right there

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.710 
it is right there
I'll<00:03:00.040> do<00:03:00.220> my<00:03:00.370> best<00:03:00.850> efforts<00:03:01.239> to<00:03:01.300> make<00:03:01.390> it<00:03:01.570> look

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
I'll do my best efforts to make it look

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.620 
I'll do my best efforts to make it look
pretty<00:03:01.989> she's<00:03:02.709> far<00:03:02.920> from<00:03:02.950> perfect<00:03:03.630> aesthetics

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
pretty she's far from perfect aesthetics

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.940 
pretty she's far from perfect aesthetics
is<00:03:04.750> not<00:03:04.870> what<00:03:04.989> we're<00:03:05.080> going<00:03:05.110> for<00:03:05.290> here<00:03:05.500> anyway

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
is not what we're going for here anyway

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.250 
is not what we're going for here anyway
so<00:03:06.580> it's<00:03:07.360> not<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.540> big<00:03:07.690> deal<00:03:07.989> ah<00:03:09.480> now<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:11.019> next

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
so it's not a big deal ah now the next

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.080 
so it's not a big deal ah now the next
thing<00:03:11.380> you're<00:03:11.500> going<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:11.680> want<00:03:11.769> to<00:03:11.980> do<00:03:12.160> is<00:03:12.880> get

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
thing you're going to want to do is get

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.590 
thing you're going to want to do is get
rid<00:03:13.239> of<00:03:13.330> this<00:03:13.480> metal<00:03:13.840> ring<00:03:14.019> here<00:03:15.360> yeah<00:03:16.360> and

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
rid of this metal ring here yeah and

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.220 
rid of this metal ring here yeah and
actually<00:03:16.870> since<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:17.709> be<00:03:18.120> more<00:03:19.230> constructive

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
actually since to be more constructive

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.470 
actually since to be more constructive
here<00:03:20.709> I<00:03:20.890> use<00:03:21.340> an<00:03:21.519> angle<00:03:21.820> cutter<00:03:22.000> for<00:03:22.209> this<00:03:22.330> and

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
here I use an angle cutter for this and

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.080 
here I use an angle cutter for this and
I<00:03:22.510> just<00:03:22.540> took<00:03:22.900> it<00:03:22.959> I<00:03:25.230> just<00:03:26.230> went<00:03:26.410> around<00:03:27.090> just

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
I just took it I just went around just

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.580 
I just took it I just went around just
like<00:03:28.269> that<00:03:29.730> that's<00:03:30.730> all<00:03:30.940> there<00:03:31.060> was<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.239> it<00:03:31.590> now

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
like that that's all there was to it now

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.830 
like that that's all there was to it now
there's<00:03:32.920> still<00:03:33.040> not<00:03:33.370> much<00:03:33.610> room<00:03:34.000> from<00:03:34.720> the

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
there's still not much room from the

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.060 
there's still not much room from the
front<00:03:35.049> of<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.170> mower<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.769> end<00:03:35.890> of<00:03:36.010> the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
front of the mower to the end of the

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:43.440 
front of the mower to the end of the
blade<00:03:37.049> really<00:03:38.049> don't<00:03:38.380> have<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:40.780> good<00:03:42.299> of<00:03:43.299> a

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
blade really don't have that good of a

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.470 
blade really don't have that good of a
cut<00:03:43.720> diameter<00:03:44.350> so<00:03:45.310> what<00:03:46.209> we're<00:03:46.330> probably

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
cut diameter so what we're probably

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.640 
cut diameter so what we're probably
going<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.720> do<00:03:46.840> is<00:03:46.900> we're<00:03:46.989> going<00:03:47.080> to<00:03:47.140> turn<00:03:47.500> the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
going to do is we're going to turn the

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.990 
going to do is we're going to turn the
engine<00:03:47.860> on<00:03:47.980> this<00:03:48.040> side<00:03:48.280> and<00:03:48.400> cut<00:03:48.610> a<00:03:48.640> little<00:03:48.700> bit

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
engine on this side and cut a little bit

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.710 
engine on this side and cut a little bit
deeper<00:03:50.730> okay<00:03:51.730> so<00:03:51.970> I'm<00:03:52.060> just<00:03:52.120> filming<00:03:52.570> what

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
deeper okay so I'm just filming what

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.320 
deeper okay so I'm just filming what
we've<00:03:52.870> done<00:03:53.140> since<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:53.890> last<00:03:54.040> video<00:03:54.330> we've

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
we've done since the last video we've

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.670 
we've done since the last video we've
taken<00:03:55.570> off<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.959> lawnmower<00:03:56.350> blade<00:03:56.560> and

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
taken off the lawnmower blade and

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.680 
taken off the lawnmower blade and
replace<00:03:56.980> it<00:03:57.130> with<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.310> circle<00:03:57.549> I<00:03:57.790> made<00:03:58.000> all<00:03:58.630> I

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
replace it with the circle I made all I

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.840 
replace it with the circle I made all I
did<00:03:58.900> is<00:03:58.989> find<00:03:59.260> a<00:03:59.350> piece<00:03:59.560> of<00:03:59.709> metal<00:04:00.010> those

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
did is find a piece of metal those

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.520 
did is find a piece of metal those
already<00:04:01.060> roughly<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.660> right<00:04:01.810> size<00:04:02.080> I<00:04:02.230> wanted

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
already roughly the right size I wanted

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.220 
already roughly the right size I wanted
17<00:04:02.920> inches<00:04:03.130> in<00:04:03.220> diameter<00:04:03.400> like<00:04:03.970> width<00:04:04.630> and

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
17 inches in diameter like width and

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.630 
17 inches in diameter like width and
then<00:04:05.410> just<00:04:05.590> cut<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:05.860> corners<00:04:06.160> off<00:04:06.280> to<00:04:06.430> make<00:04:06.519> it

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
then just cut the corners off to make it

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.729 
then just cut the corners off to make it
a<00:04:06.700> circle<00:04:06.940> 17<00:04:07.930> inches<00:04:08.110> in<00:04:08.170> diameter

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
a circle 17 inches in diameter

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.860 
a circle 17 inches in diameter
now<00:04:09.430> teeth<00:04:09.700> are<00:04:09.880> going<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.060> get<00:04:10.209> cut<00:04:10.419> on<00:04:10.450> to<00:04:10.750> it

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
now teeth are going to get cut on to it

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.020 
now teeth are going to get cut on to it
and<00:04:11.620> it'll<00:04:11.769> be<00:04:11.950> a<00:04:11.980> curricular<00:04:12.549> saw<00:04:12.730> blade<00:04:12.940> now

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
and it'll be a curricular saw blade now

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.150 
and it'll be a curricular saw blade now
you<00:04:13.090> can<00:04:13.269> buy<00:04:13.450> one<00:04:13.690> but<00:04:13.840> they're<00:04:14.019> expensive

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
you can buy one but they're expensive

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.220 
you can buy one but they're expensive
next<00:04:15.400> to<00:04:15.490> that<00:04:15.520> some<00:04:15.940> more<00:04:16.480> specific<00:04:17.019> to<00:04:17.110> this

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
next to that some more specific to this

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.110 
next to that some more specific to this
more<00:04:17.470> problems<00:04:17.890> we<00:04:17.950> had<00:04:18.070> was<00:04:18.220> that<00:04:18.430> primer

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
more problems we had was that primer

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.640 
more problems we had was that primer
bulb<00:04:19.390> that<00:04:19.570> had<00:04:19.690> to<00:04:19.780> crack<00:04:20.019> and<00:04:20.230> kept<00:04:20.380> leaking

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
bulb that had to crack and kept leaking

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.290 
bulb that had to crack and kept leaking
and<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.160> broken<00:04:21.550> butterfly<00:04:22.030> valve

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
and the broken butterfly valve

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.900 
and the broken butterfly valve
attachment<00:04:23.110> piece<00:04:23.620> so<00:04:24.250> we<00:04:24.340> just<00:04:24.490> replaced<00:04:24.820> the

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
attachment piece so we just replaced the

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.610 
attachment piece so we just replaced the
hole<00:04:25.090> carburetor<00:04:25.570> which<00:04:25.930> is<00:04:26.140> now<00:04:26.290> choke

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
hole carburetor which is now choke

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.800 
hole carburetor which is now choke
Ematic<00:04:27.010> choke<00:04:27.700> doesn't<00:04:28.000> didn't<00:04:28.210> work<00:04:28.360> though

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
Ematic choke doesn't didn't work though

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.420 
Ematic choke doesn't didn't work though
so<00:04:29.230> you<00:04:29.320> just<00:04:29.500> tied<00:04:29.680> it<00:04:29.710> with<00:04:29.800> a<00:04:29.920> piece<00:04:30.130> of<00:04:30.160> wire

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
so you just tied it with a piece of wire

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.920 
so you just tied it with a piece of wire
and<00:04:30.760> keep<00:04:31.450> it<00:04:31.600> open

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
and keep it open

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.650 
and keep it open
we<00:04:32.650> also<00:04:32.800> added<00:04:33.010> this<00:04:33.190> stack<00:04:33.910> it's<00:04:34.390> kind<00:04:34.600> of

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
we also added this stack it's kind of

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.030 
we also added this stack it's kind of
cool<00:04:34.840> especially<00:04:35.020> when<00:04:35.320> we<00:04:35.440> run<00:04:35.590> it<00:04:35.710> on<00:04:35.800> like<00:04:35.920> a

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
cool especially when we run it on like a

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.860 
cool especially when we run it on like a
diesel<00:04:36.490> fuel<00:04:36.700> gas<00:04:36.940> mix<00:04:37.300> creates<00:04:37.570> a<00:04:37.690> lot<00:04:37.840> of

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
diesel fuel gas mix creates a lot of

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.830 
diesel fuel gas mix creates a lot of
smoke<00:04:38.880> I'm<00:04:39.880> also<00:04:40.090> going<00:04:40.300> to<00:04:40.360> just<00:04:40.450> reinforce

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
smoke I'm also going to just reinforce

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.560 
smoke I'm also going to just reinforce
the<00:04:41.260> deck<00:04:41.530> around<00:04:42.280> like<00:04:42.430> a<00:04:42.460> piece<00:04:42.760> of<00:04:42.940> metal

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
the deck around like a piece of metal

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.480 
the deck around like a piece of metal
here<00:04:43.600> it's<00:04:43.870> kind<00:04:44.080> of<00:04:44.110> thick<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:44.620> tack<00:04:45.160> it<00:04:45.190> on

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
here it's kind of thick and tack it on

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.400 
here it's kind of thick and tack it on
and<00:04:46.060> one<00:04:46.270> on<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:46.450> other<00:04:46.510> side<00:04:46.660> and<00:04:47.050> maybe<00:04:47.170> one

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
and one on the other side and maybe one

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.660 
and one on the other side and maybe one
on<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.590> back<00:04:47.770> to<00:04:47.950> attach<00:04:48.190> them<00:04:48.430> if<00:04:48.520> it's

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
on the back to attach them if it's

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.890 
on the back to attach them if it's
necessary<00:04:50.130> she<00:04:51.130> starts<00:04:51.460> and<00:04:51.640> runs<00:04:51.790> fine<00:04:52.180> but

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
necessary she starts and runs fine but

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.600 
necessary she starts and runs fine but
then<00:04:53.050> this<00:04:53.590> thing<00:04:53.830> adds<00:04:54.010> a<00:04:54.190> lot<00:04:54.310> of<00:04:54.370> weight

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
then this thing adds a lot of weight

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.610 
then this thing adds a lot of weight
it's<00:04:54.940> it<00:04:55.270> takes<00:04:55.540> forever<00:04:55.750> to<00:04:55.870> slow<00:04:56.260> down<00:04:56.440> and

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
it's it takes forever to slow down and

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.050 
it's it takes forever to slow down and
speed<00:04:56.830> up<00:04:57.040> but<00:04:57.220> it's<00:04:57.340> got<00:04:57.430> a<00:04:57.490> lot<00:04:57.760> of<00:04:57.790> momentum

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
speed up but it's got a lot of momentum

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
speed up but it's got a lot of momentum
it's<00:04:58.570> got<00:04:58.750> way<00:04:59.650> more<00:04:59.680> than<00:04:59.950> the<00:05:00.660> grass<00:05:01.660> cutting

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
it's got way more than the grass cutting

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.140 
it's got way more than the grass cutting
blade<00:05:02.320> did<00:05:02.590> so<00:05:03.580> we're<00:05:03.700> just<00:05:03.730> going<00:05:03.910> to<00:05:04.000> cut

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
blade did so we're just going to cut

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.660 
blade did so we're just going to cut
teeth<00:05:04.420> into<00:05:04.720> that<00:05:04.870> and<00:05:05.310> we'll<00:05:06.310> probably<00:05:06.520> just

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
teeth into that and we'll probably just

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.090 
teeth into that and we'll probably just
show<00:05:06.910> you<00:05:06.970> how<00:05:07.120> well<00:05:07.330> it<00:05:07.390> works

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
show you how well it works

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.350 
show you how well it works
one<00:05:09.550> more<00:05:09.730> thing<00:05:09.760> when<00:05:09.910> you<00:05:10.030> just<00:05:10.150> going<00:05:10.300> to

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
one more thing when you just going to

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.310 
one more thing when you just going to
mention<00:05:10.510> is<00:05:10.750> that<00:05:10.870> you're<00:05:10.990> probably<00:05:11.140> gonna

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
mention is that you're probably gonna

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.320 
mention is that you're probably gonna
want<00:05:11.500> to<00:05:11.560> bypass<00:05:11.710> the<00:05:12.130> governor<00:05:12.460> so<00:05:13.030> that<00:05:13.150> when

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
want to bypass the governor so that when

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.110 
want to bypass the governor so that when
you're<00:05:13.480> under<00:05:13.630> a<00:05:14.080> lot<00:05:14.350> of<00:05:14.380> load<00:05:15.000> under<00:05:16.000> that

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
you're under a lot of load under that

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.720 
you're under a lot of load under that
blade<00:05:16.750> right<00:05:16.990> there<00:05:17.290> you<00:05:17.830> can<00:05:18.010> just<00:05:18.130> open<00:05:18.580> the

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
blade right there you can just open the

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.390 
blade right there you can just open the
butterfly<00:05:19.660> valve<00:05:19.690> all<00:05:20.140> the<00:05:20.320> way<00:05:20.440> or<00:05:21.130> close<00:05:21.370> it

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
butterfly valve all the way or close it

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.270 
butterfly valve all the way or close it
it's<00:05:22.360> up<00:05:22.480> to<00:05:22.600> you<00:05:25.170> okay<00:05:26.170> so<00:05:26.230> here<00:05:26.920> she<00:05:27.160> is

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
it's up to you okay so here she is

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.880 
it's up to you okay so here she is
finished<00:05:27.790> the<00:05:28.720> at<00:05:28.990> tree<00:05:29.200> cutting<00:05:29.500> one<00:05:29.620> more<00:05:29.800> is

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
finished the at tree cutting one more is

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.480 
finished the at tree cutting one more is
done<00:05:30.100> and<00:05:30.340> this<00:05:31.090> video<00:05:31.390> is<00:05:31.450> actually<00:05:31.780> a<00:05:32.490> long

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
done and this video is actually a long

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.370 
done and this video is actually a long
time<00:05:33.730> afterwards<00:05:34.210> this<00:05:34.300> is<00:05:34.450> a<00:05:34.480> year<00:05:34.870> after<00:05:35.260> the

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
time afterwards this is a year after the

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.950 
time afterwards this is a year after the
last<00:05:35.770> video<00:05:36.669> segment<00:05:37.090> you<00:05:37.390> had<00:05:37.510> what<00:05:37.690> happened

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
last video segment you had what happened

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.230 
last video segment you had what happened
is<00:05:38.020> I<00:05:38.140> forgot<00:05:38.500> to<00:05:38.710> actually<00:05:39.070> film<00:05:39.700> it<00:05:39.880> when<00:05:40.150> it

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
is I forgot to actually film it when it

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.680 
is I forgot to actually film it when it
was<00:05:40.330> done<00:05:40.630> I<00:05:40.870> took<00:05:41.440> her<00:05:41.770> to<00:05:41.800> the<00:05:42.010> property

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
was done I took her to the property

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.610 
was done I took her to the property
she's<00:05:43.690> been<00:05:43.840> there<00:05:43.960> for<00:05:44.020> about<00:05:44.169> a<00:05:44.260> year

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
she's been there for about a year

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.070 
she's been there for about a year
throughout<00:05:44.919> winter<00:05:45.190> we<00:05:45.790> used<00:05:46.030> it<00:05:46.240> and<00:05:46.480> now

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
throughout winter we used it and now

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.390 
throughout winter we used it and now
he's<00:05:47.260> brought<00:05:47.470> her<00:05:47.590> back<00:05:47.770> to<00:05:47.830> sharpen<00:05:48.310> the

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
he's brought her back to sharpen the

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.800 
he's brought her back to sharpen the
blade<00:05:48.640> and<00:05:48.850> I<00:05:48.910> decided<00:05:49.270> well<00:05:49.390> now<00:05:49.510> would<00:05:49.690> be<00:05:49.720> a

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
blade and I decided well now would be a

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.380 
blade and I decided well now would be a
great<00:05:50.169> time<00:05:50.440> to<00:05:50.770> finally<00:05:51.610> make<00:05:51.730> the<00:05:51.940> final

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
great time to finally make the final

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.100 
great time to finally make the final
entry<00:05:52.810> and<00:05:53.080> I<00:05:54.180> don't<00:05:55.180> know<00:05:55.390> if<00:05:55.480> you<00:05:55.570> can<00:05:55.750> see

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
entry and I don't know if you can see

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.650 
entry and I don't know if you can see
we've<00:05:56.320> kind<00:05:56.650> of<00:05:56.800> cleaned<00:05:57.730> up<00:05:58.000> the<00:05:58.180> residue

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
we've kind of cleaned up the residue

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.140 
we've kind of cleaned up the residue
that<00:05:58.810> was<00:05:58.960> on<00:05:59.169> it<00:05:59.350> but<00:05:59.860> it<00:05:59.950> was<00:06:00.070> very<00:06:00.730> very

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
that was on it but it was very very

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.610 
that was on it but it was very very
Brown<00:06:01.540> there<00:06:01.870> so<00:06:03.240> okay<00:06:04.470> sharpness<00:06:05.470> is

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
Brown there so okay sharpness is

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.140 
Brown there so okay sharpness is
actually<00:06:05.919> pretty<00:06:06.460> bad<00:06:06.669> so<00:06:06.850> we're<00:06:06.940> just<00:06:07.060> gonna

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
actually pretty bad so we're just gonna

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.330 
actually pretty bad so we're just gonna
take<00:06:07.300> a<00:06:07.419> dremel<00:06:07.720> and<00:06:08.200> just<00:06:08.860> go<00:06:09.010> out<00:06:09.100> up<00:06:09.190> the

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
take a dremel and just go out up the

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.379 
take a dremel and just go out up the
teeth<00:06:09.610> and<00:06:11.010> show<00:06:12.010> you

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389 
teeth and show you

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.800 
teeth and show you
fastened<00:06:14.199> it<00:06:14.379> there<00:06:14.740> it<00:06:15.009> is<00:06:15.159> I<00:06:15.659> want<00:06:16.659> to<00:06:16.719> flip

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
fastened it there it is I want to flip

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.100 
fastened it there it is I want to flip
it<00:06:16.960> too<00:06:17.110> much<00:06:17.289> they<00:06:17.469> don't<00:06:17.620> want<00:06:17.740> spilled<00:06:18.009> gas

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
it too much they don't want spilled gas

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:30.719 
it too much they don't want spilled gas
I'm<00:06:20.110> a<00:06:20.289> doc<00:06:20.500> and<00:06:23.669> I<00:06:25.080> cut<00:06:26.080> it<00:06:26.110> up<00:06:26.289> with<00:06:26.680> a<00:06:29.729> sawzall

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:30.729 
I'm a doc and I cut it up with a sawzall

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:34.529 
I'm a doc and I cut it up with a sawzall
all<00:06:31.090> the<00:06:31.330> teeth<00:06:31.620> did<00:06:32.620> those<00:06:32.830> and<00:06:33.330> that's<00:06:34.330> why

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:34.539 
all the teeth did those and that's why

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:36.689 
all the teeth did those and that's why
they're<00:06:34.689> so<00:06:35.020> poorly<00:06:35.379> space<00:06:35.800> but<00:06:36.099> actually

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:36.699 
they're so poorly space but actually

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:38.550 
they're so poorly space but actually
balance<00:06:37.360> wise<00:06:37.569> is<00:06:37.780> still<00:06:37.990> pretty<00:06:38.169> good<00:06:38.379> so<00:06:38.500> I'm

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
balance wise is still pretty good so I'm

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.719 
balance wise is still pretty good so I'm
just<00:06:38.710> going<00:06:38.830> to<00:06:38.860> start<00:06:39.129> this<00:06:39.250> thing<00:06:39.430> and<00:06:39.580> show

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:39.729 
just going to start this thing and show

00:06:39.729 --> 00:07:30.540 
just going to start this thing and show
you<00:06:39.789> how<00:06:39.939> it<00:06:40.060> works

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:30.550 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.509 

so<00:07:31.550> that<00:07:31.639> was<00:07:31.729> just<00:07:31.879> to<00:07:31.969> show<00:07:32.149> you<00:07:32.209> it<00:07:32.360> ran<00:07:32.599> and

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:33.519 
so that was just to show you it ran and

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:37.839 
so that was just to show you it ran and
honestly<00:07:34.519> I<00:07:35.499> it<00:07:36.499> does<00:07:36.769> cut<00:07:37.009> trees<00:07:37.339> it<00:07:37.519> doesn't

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:37.849 
honestly I it does cut trees it doesn't

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:39.279 
honestly I it does cut trees it doesn't
really<00:07:37.939> cut<00:07:38.209> too<00:07:38.419> large<00:07:38.659> because<00:07:38.809> you<00:07:38.989> can<00:07:39.110> see

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:39.289 
really cut too large because you can see

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:43.540 
really cut too large because you can see
that<00:07:39.439> the<00:07:40.360> cutting<00:07:41.360> radius<00:07:42.199> diameter<00:07:42.619> isn't

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:43.550 
that the cutting radius diameter isn't

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.399 
that the cutting radius diameter isn't
very<00:07:43.699> large<00:07:44.059> but<00:07:44.599> you<00:07:44.689> can<00:07:44.809> kind<00:07:44.959> of<00:07:45.019> work<00:07:45.199> your

00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:45.409 
very large but you can kind of work your

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:47.169 
very large but you can kind of work your
way<00:07:45.499> around<00:07:45.649> the<00:07:45.919> tree<00:07:46.159> and<00:07:46.189> get<00:07:46.399> it<00:07:46.519> pretty

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:47.179 
way around the tree and get it pretty

00:07:47.179 --> 00:07:50.109 
way around the tree and get it pretty
decent-sized<00:07:47.869> I<00:07:48.199> didn't<00:07:49.189> I<00:07:49.309> can't<00:07:49.999> really

00:07:50.109 --> 00:07:50.119 
decent-sized I didn't I can't really

00:07:50.119 --> 00:07:51.699 
decent-sized I didn't I can't really
make<00:07:50.269> a<00:07:50.330> video<00:07:50.629> of<00:07:50.689> it<00:07:50.839> cutting<00:07:51.169> trees<00:07:51.439> really

00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:51.709 
make a video of it cutting trees really

00:07:51.709 --> 00:07:54.820 
make a video of it cutting trees really
because<00:07:52.519> there's<00:07:52.909> no<00:07:53.029> trees<00:07:53.330> here<00:07:53.749> that<00:07:53.899> I<00:07:54.439> can

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:54.830 
because there's no trees here that I can

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.169 
because there's no trees here that I can
cut<00:07:55.069> down<00:07:55.099> without<00:07:55.519> getting<00:07:55.759> in<00:07:55.849> trouble

00:07:56.169 --> 00:07:56.179 
cut down without getting in trouble

00:07:56.179 --> 00:07:58.239 
cut down without getting in trouble
but<00:07:56.539> maybe<00:07:56.719> in<00:07:56.899> the<00:07:57.019> future<00:07:57.199> I<00:07:57.409> might<00:07:57.619> put

00:07:58.239 --> 00:07:58.249 
but maybe in the future I might put

00:07:58.249 --> 00:07:59.769 
but maybe in the future I might put
another<00:07:58.459> video<00:07:58.789> of<00:07:58.909> it<00:07:59.029> actually<00:07:59.179> cutting

00:07:59.769 --> 00:07:59.779 
another video of it actually cutting

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:01.809 
another video of it actually cutting
down<00:07:59.899> a<00:07:59.929> tree<00:08:00.069> proof<00:08:01.069> too<00:08:01.219> that<00:08:01.369> it<00:08:01.459> does<00:08:01.610> work

00:08:01.809 --> 00:08:01.819 
down a tree proof too that it does work

00:08:01.819 --> 00:08:05.019 
down a tree proof too that it does work
ok<00:08:02.509> thank<00:08:02.959> you
