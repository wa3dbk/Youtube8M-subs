play a low note once in a while to
establish<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:48.300> root<00:03:48.450> feeling<00:03:48.930> or<00:03:49.680> you<00:03:49.830> can<00:03:49.950> go

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
establish the root feeling or you can go

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.650 
establish the root feeling or you can go
into<00:03:50.280> some<00:03:50.460> other<00:03:50.490> style<00:03:51.030> as<00:03:51.210> you<00:03:51.300> notice<00:03:51.570> I

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
into some other style as you notice I

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.730 
into some other style as you notice I
did<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:52.130> in<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.310> second<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:54.560> didn't<00:03:55.560> use<00:03:55.710> a

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
did it in the second I didn't use a

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.610 
did it in the second I didn't use a
block<00:03:56.010> chord<00:03:56.280> style<00:03:56.610> that<00:03:56.790> I<00:03:56.820> just<00:03:57.620> played

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
block chord style that I just played

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.980 
block chord style that I just played
that<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.370> chord<00:03:59.730> progression<00:04:00.210> that<00:04:00.330> existed

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
that the chord progression that existed

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.800 
that the chord progression that existed
at<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.290> time<00:04:01.320> which<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.430> an<00:04:02.550> interesting

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
at the time which is an interesting

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.110 
at the time which is an interesting
declension<00:04:03.810> by<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:03.990> way<00:04:04.140> you<00:04:04.230> start<00:04:08.000> you<00:04:09.000> can

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
declension by the way you start you can

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.390 
declension by the way you start you can
call<00:04:09.270> that<00:04:09.420> a<00:04:09.690> minor<00:04:10.470> I<00:04:10.590> guess<00:04:10.890> except<00:04:11.280> it's

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
call that a minor I guess except it's

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.870 
call that a minor I guess except it's
got<00:04:11.520> an<00:04:11.610> F<00:04:11.730> in<00:04:11.850> it<00:04:11.940> so<00:04:12.030> I<00:04:12.090> call<00:04:12.330> it<00:04:12.450> f<00:04:12.690> 9<00:04:13.700> and<00:04:14.700> then

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
got an F in it so I call it f 9 and then

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:22.940 
got an F in it so I call it f 9 and then
a<00:04:15.030> flat<00:04:15.570> minor<00:04:16.410> 7th<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.130> then<00:04:21.260> ok<00:04:22.260> but<00:04:22.800> my

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
a flat minor 7th and then ok but my

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.940 
a flat minor 7th and then ok but my
point<00:04:23.160> is<00:04:23.400> have<00:04:23.970> that<00:04:24.330> block<00:04:24.600> style<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.740> right

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
point is have that block style the right

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.620 
point is have that block style the right
hand<00:04:26.160> plays<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.610> chords<00:04:26.820> under<00:04:27.210> the<00:04:27.300> melody
