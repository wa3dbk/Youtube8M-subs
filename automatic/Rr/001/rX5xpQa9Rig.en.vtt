the<00:00:35.790> white<00:00:35.969> membrane<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.780> then<00:00:37.170> I'm<00:00:37.290> using<00:00:37.320> a

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
the white membrane and then I'm using a

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.549 
the white membrane and then I'm using a
mandolin<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.610> I'm<00:00:39.390> using<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.350> thicker

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
mandolin and I'm using it on the thicker

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.389 
mandolin and I'm using it on the thicker
slice<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.790> you're<00:00:42.510> just<00:00:42.629> gonna<00:00:42.750> take<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
slice and you're just gonna take and

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.139 
slice and you're just gonna take and
slice<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:45.170> good

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149

dehydrator sheet I'm using a TSM
dehydrator<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.910> I'm<00:01:00.329> probably<00:01:00.539> half<00:01:00.780> at

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
dehydrator and I'm probably half at

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.650 
dehydrator and I'm probably half at
about<00:01:01.140> 105<00:01:01.800> 110<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:02.969> use<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.270> higher<00:01:03.449> if

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
about 105 110 you can use it higher if

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.719 
about 105 110 you can use it higher if
you<00:01:03.690> want<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:04.019> know<00:01:04.170> some<00:01:04.430> dehydrators<00:01:05.430> don't

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
you want to know some dehydrators don't

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.170 
you want to know some dehydrators don't
have<00:01:06.080> temperature<00:01:07.080> controls<00:01:07.520> this<00:01:08.520> one<00:01:08.729> does

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
have temperature controls this one does

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.580 
have temperature controls this one does
I<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> temperature<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.080> control<00:01:10.439> that

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
I like a temperature to control that

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.940 
I like a temperature to control that
make<00:01:10.799> way<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.310> still<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.610> raw<00:01:11.909> food<00:01:12.680> so<00:01:13.680> you're

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
make way it's still a raw food so you're

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.380 
make way it's still a raw food so you're
gonna<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.280> take<00:01:14.460> these<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.060> put<00:01:15.240> them<00:01:15.330> in

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.200 
gonna just take these in and put them in
the<00:01:15.479> dehydrator<00:01:15.950> probably<00:01:16.950> about<00:01:17.100> 24<00:01:17.549> hours<00:01:17.759> I

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
the dehydrator probably about 24 hours I

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.070 
the dehydrator probably about 24 hours I
noticed<00:01:18.830> when<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.890> go<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.580> get<00:01:20.759> them<00:01:20.850> out<00:01:21.080> you

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
spots so then to store them when they're

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.370
