00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
the original colossal the only really

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.910 
the original colossal the only really
big<00:02:50.920> differences<00:02:51.430> this<00:02:51.640> one<00:02:51.820> doesn't<00:02:52.030> have

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
big differences this one doesn't have

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.530 
big differences this one doesn't have
the<00:02:53.920> strong<00:02:54.340> smell<00:02:54.580> of<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.090> original

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
the strong smell of that the original

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.600 
the strong smell of that the original
colossal<00:02:55.989> mascara<00:02:56.440> does<00:02:56.620> because<00:02:57.010> the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
colossal mascara does because the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.890 
colossal mascara does because the
original<00:02:58.000> one<00:02:58.150> kind<00:02:58.360> of<00:02:58.390> has<00:02:58.570> a<00:02:59.010> rose<00:03:00.720> scent<00:03:01.720> to

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
original one kind of has a rose scent to

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.280 
original one kind of has a rose scent to
it<00:03:02.880> but<00:03:03.880> I<00:03:03.940> mean<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:04.180> was<00:03:04.270> nothing<00:03:04.570> bad<00:03:04.690> so<00:03:05.050> this

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
it but I mean it was nothing bad so this

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.009 
it but I mean it was nothing bad so this
one<00:03:05.530> doesn't<00:03:06.310> have<00:03:06.519> this<00:03:06.730> scent<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.810> the

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
one doesn't have this scent that the

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.830 
one doesn't have this scent that the
urgent<00:03:08.470> one<00:03:08.590> does<00:03:08.800> but<00:03:09.100> this<00:03:09.280> one<00:03:09.690> pretty<00:03:10.690> much

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
urgent one does but this one pretty much

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.449 
urgent one does but this one pretty much
did<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.200> exact<00:03:11.500> same<00:03:11.709> thing<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:12.040> didn't<00:03:12.340> really

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
did the exact same thing I didn't really

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.870 
did the exact same thing I didn't really
see<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:13.690> whole<00:03:14.290> cat<00:03:14.739> eye<00:03:14.980> effect<00:03:15.430> that<00:03:15.730> you're

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
see the whole cat eye effect that you're

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.490 
see the whole cat eye effect that you're
supposed<00:03:16.180> to<00:03:16.330> get<00:03:16.510> that<00:03:16.870> says<00:03:17.080> that<00:03:17.320> it's

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
supposed to get that says that it's

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.340

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480 
to my channel and check it out but this

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.320 
to my channel and check it out but this
one<00:05:40.770> does<00:05:41.770> tend<00:05:42.130> to<00:05:42.190> clump<00:05:42.550> in<00:05:42.820> some<00:05:43.060> places

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
one does tend to clump in some places

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.630 
one does tend to clump in some places
and<00:05:44.080> you<00:05:44.290> really<00:05:44.530> have<00:05:44.710> to<00:05:44.740> kind<00:05:44.980> of<00:05:45.070> work<00:05:45.280> hard

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
and you really have to kind of work hard

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.690 
and you really have to kind of work hard
to<00:05:46.030> get<00:05:46.270> it<00:05:46.420> to<00:05:46.450> uncle<00:05:46.870> um<00:05:46.960> but<00:05:47.370> so<00:05:48.370> that<00:05:48.400> was

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
to get it to uncle um but so that was

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.360 
to get it to uncle um but so that was
really<00:05:49.030> the<00:05:49.180> only<00:05:49.510> con<00:05:50.470> I<00:05:50.500> had<00:05:50.860> and<00:05:51.100> that<00:05:51.220> it

really the only con I had and that it

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.250 
really the only con I had and that it
was<00:05:51.460> kind<00:05:52.030> of<00:05:52.150> difficult<00:05:52.660> to<00:05:52.720> remove<00:05:53.020> at<00:05:53.170> the

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.440 
was kind of difficult to remove at the
end<00:05:53.410> of<00:05:53.530> the<00:05:53.620> day<00:05:53.770> like<00:05:54.550> with<00:05:54.700> the<00:05:54.940> comb

have<00:05:59.980> to

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
have to

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.149 
have to
put<00:06:01.009> in<00:06:01.129> a<00:06:01.250> little<00:06:01.520> bit<00:06:01.639> more<00:06:01.819> of<00:06:01.939> an<00:06:02.060> effort<00:06:02.270> to

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159 
put in a little bit more of an effort to

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:08.569 
at the end of the day overall I thought

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:10.420 
at the end of the day overall I thought
those<00:06:08.719> pills<00:06:08.900> are<00:06:08.960> really<00:06:09.050> good<00:06:09.409> mascara<00:06:10.189> I

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
those pills are really good mascara I

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.740 
those pills are really good mascara I
