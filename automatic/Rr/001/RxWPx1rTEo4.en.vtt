hey guys Maurice here coming at you once

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.120 
hey guys Maurice here coming at you once
again<00:00:11.880> with<00:00:12.059> another<00:00:12.440> maplestory<00:00:13.440> commentary

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
again with another maplestory commentary

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.300 
again with another maplestory commentary
and<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> cubing<00:00:16.080> video<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.800> know<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.070> have

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
and this is a cubing video I know I have

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.460 
and this is a cubing video I know I have
never<00:00:17.520> actually<00:00:17.820> done<00:00:18.029> one<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.420> these<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:19.080> my

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
never actually done one of these on my

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.590 
never actually done one of these on my
channel<00:00:19.949> but<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.220> decided<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.900> know<00:00:21.930> I

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
channel but I decided that you know I

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.330 
channel but I decided that you know I
probably<00:00:24.600> should<00:00:25.080> because<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.470> really<00:00:25.949> do<00:00:26.160> want

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
probably should because I really do want

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.730 
probably should because I really do want
to<00:00:26.400> cube<00:00:26.609> as<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:27.000> see<00:00:27.180> I'm<00:00:27.740> two

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
to cube as you can see I'm two

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.030 
to cube as you can see I'm two
mil-to-mil<00:00:28.980> clean<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:30.510> alpha<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.410> obviously

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
mil-to-mil clean on alpha and obviously

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.990 
mil-to-mil clean on alpha and obviously
I'm<00:00:32.130> too<00:00:32.250> much<00:00:32.399> mean<00:00:32.669> on<00:00:33.090> beta<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:35.000> basically

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
I'm too much mean on beta so I basically

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.229 
I'm too much mean on beta so I basically
1/2<00:00:36.840> cube<00:00:37.140> only<00:00:37.440> one<00:00:37.890> thing<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.610> there's

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
1/2 cube only one thing and there's

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.180 
1/2 cube only one thing and there's
really<00:00:39.450> one<00:00:39.750> thing<00:00:39.989> left<00:00:40.260> for<00:00:40.469> me<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.649> cube

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
really one thing left for me to cube

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.970 
really one thing left for me to cube
that<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.629> my<00:00:42.750> weapon<00:00:42.989> if<00:00:43.860> you

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
that is and that is my weapon if you

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.470 
that is and that is my weapon if you
actually<00:00:44.100> take<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> look<00:00:44.670> at<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
actually take a look at it like the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.510 
actually take a look at it like the
actual<00:00:45.840> potential<00:00:46.230> I'm<00:00:46.590> fine<00:00:46.950> with<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> bonus

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
actual potential I'm fine with the bonus

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.580 
actual potential I'm fine with the bonus
potential<00:00:47.820> there<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.750> an<00:00:48.809> attack<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.469> some

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
potential there just an attack and some

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.650 
potential there just an attack and some
percent<00:00:49.860> total<00:00:49.950> damage<00:00:50.399> 2%<00:00:51.000> strength<00:00:51.300> all

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
percent total damage 2% strength all

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.970 
percent total damage 2% strength all
three<00:00:52.020> lines<00:00:52.230> are<00:00:52.500> good<00:00:53.149> so<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.180> won't<00:00:54.980> really

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
three lines are good so I won't really

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.139 
three lines are good so I won't really
want<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.250> touch<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.520> now<00:00:57.329> my<00:00:58.160> actual<00:00:59.160> top

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
want to touch that now my actual top

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.319 
want to touch that now my actual top
potential<00:01:00.750> as<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.140> call<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.820> it's<00:01:02.820> only<00:01:03.000> 40%

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
potential as I call it it's only 40%

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.070 
potential as I call it it's only 40%
boss<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.140> 2%<00:01:04.769> attack<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.760> 7%<00:01:06.150> all<00:01:06.479> stats<00:01:06.810> is

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
boss and 2% attack the 7% all stats is

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.620 
boss and 2% attack the 7% all stats is
kind<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.500> wasted<00:01:07.830> stat<00:01:08.100> because<00:01:08.970> for<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> top

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
kind of a wasted stat because for a top

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.890 
kind of a wasted stat because for a top
line<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.860> just<00:01:11.580> don't<00:01:11.790> see<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.150> being<00:01:12.390> worth<00:01:12.630> it

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
line I just don't see it being worth it

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.950 
line I just don't see it being worth it
so<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.170> decided<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.799> buy<00:01:15.259> 24<00:01:16.460> cubes<00:01:17.460> or<00:01:18.000> how<00:01:18.900> many

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
so I decided to buy 24 cubes or how many

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.120 
so I decided to buy 24 cubes or how many
wait<00:01:19.380> no<00:01:19.650> how<00:01:20.610> many<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.060> 22<00:01:21.750> cube<00:01:21.990> sorry<00:01:22.259> 22

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
wait no how many is it 22 cube sorry 22

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.080 
wait no how many is it 22 cube sorry 22
cubes<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.600> am<00:01:24.720> going<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
cubes and with that I am going to

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.760 
cubes and with that I am going to
hopefully<00:01:27.090> get<00:01:27.570> at<00:01:27.750> least<00:01:27.960> two<00:01:28.229> line<00:01:28.500> of

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
hopefully get at least two line of

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.100 
hopefully get at least two line of
attack<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.400> don't<00:01:29.670> really<00:01:29.820> care<00:01:30.060> about<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.630> 80%

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
attack I don't really care about the 80%

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.499 
attack I don't really care about the 80%
boss<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.189> would<00:01:32.369> lose<00:01:32.579> if<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.909> lose<00:01:33.119> attack

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
boss that I would lose if I lose attack

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.530 
boss that I would lose if I lose attack
because<00:01:33.900> attack<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.829> much<00:01:35.250> more<00:01:35.400> valuable<00:01:35.790> so

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
because attack is much more valuable so

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.859 
because attack is much more valuable so
anyways<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.920> basically<00:01:38.340> me<00:01:38.689> doing<00:01:39.689> my

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
anyways this is basically me doing my

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.240 
anyways this is basically me doing my
final<00:01:40.200> cubing<00:01:40.829> video<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.400> my<00:01:41.820> zero<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:43.250> let's

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
final cubing video on my zero and let's

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.450 
final cubing video on my zero and let's
get<00:01:44.490> started<00:01:45.090> if<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.630> here<00:01:45.899> we<00:01:45.960> go<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.770> here

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
get started if I can here we go so here

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.569 
get started if I can here we go so here
it<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.700> say<00:01:48.090> goodbye<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.450> 40%<00:01:49.200> boss<00:01:49.369> 10%<00:01:50.369> attack

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
it is say goodbye to 40% boss 10% attack

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.730 
it is say goodbye to 40% boss 10% attack
and<00:01:50.880> some<00:01:51.060> personal<00:01:51.360> stats<00:01:51.659> if<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.470> absolutely

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
and some personal stats if I absolutely

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.520 
and some personal stats if I absolutely
have<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.700> because<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.509> get<00:01:54.689> like<00:01:54.840> some<00:01:55.079> complete

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
have to because I get like some complete

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.399 
have to because I get like some complete
trashcan<00:01:56.070> stats<00:01:56.430> which<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.149> really<00:01:57.630> pray<00:01:58.170> that

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
trashcan stats which I really pray that

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.730 
trashcan stats which I really pray that
I<00:01:58.439> don't<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.310> will<00:02:00.270> wreak<00:02:00.540> uyb<00:02:00.840> eventually

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
I don't I will wreak uyb eventually

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.190 
I don't I will wreak uyb eventually
obviously<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.820> here<00:02:03.360> we<00:02:03.450> go<00:02:03.570> here's<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.990> first

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
obviously so here we go here's the first

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.800 
obviously so here we go here's the first
cube<00:02:04.619> I've<00:02:05.369> done<00:02:05.579> in<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.759> very<00:02:05.880> long<00:02:06.000> time<00:02:06.420> and

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
cube I've done in a very long time and

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.990 
cube I've done in a very long time and
it's<00:02:08.420> trash<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.810> got<00:02:10.319> one<00:02:10.649> line<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:11.069> attack<00:02:11.340> one

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
it's trash I got one line of attack one

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.660 
it's trash I got one line of attack one
line<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.270> strength<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.750> do<00:02:12.810> not<00:02:13.080> want

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
line of strength I do not want

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.940 
line of strength I do not want
obviously<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:15.690> don't<00:02:16.170> want<00:02:16.320> to<00:02:16.350> hit<00:02:16.470> OK<00:02:16.920> on

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
obviously so I don't want to hit OK on
