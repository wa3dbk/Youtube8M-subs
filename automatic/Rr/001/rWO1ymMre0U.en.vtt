00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.080
 if you are thinking of leaving for le 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.059
 holidays remember that yours too 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.920
 car needs some special care 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.400
 the car with liquids the most fundamental 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.220
 of all and the engine oil for 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.450
 check that the oil level is 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.899
 at the right height the car is fine 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.700
 that it has been hot for a few minutes 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.770
 so that the oil deposits in the cup 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.879
 of the engine after which you will find one 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:38.940
 oil plug you will have to extract it clean it 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.020
 then re-insert it and withdraw it 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.749
 out 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.570
 you will need to make sure the oil is there 

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:47.820
 exactly where there is a notch where there is 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.920
 are indications and all 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.629
 builders indicate it you will see that 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.359
 the oil must be more or less in the middle 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.039
 if it is a little less than half maybe it is 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.839
 better to top up I'd say it's better 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.629
 move to a service area 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.489
 equipped is important before leaving 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.949
 also check the liquid level 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.100
 cooling contained in a 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.610
 transparent tank always from which it is 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.530
 easy to see the level if it wasn't al 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.380
 right level is very simple 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.360
 open in any supermarket in areas 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.219
 of service found the liquids from 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.799
 you can also add liquids 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:24.240
 mix so don't worry 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.450
 the last important level from 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.670
 check is the water in the squeegee 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.560
 I would suggest not adding water to the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.500
 tap in the meantime because limestone a 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.090
 end annoys the nozzles used i 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.490
 liquids that you also find those from 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.560
 supermarket or service areas 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.329
 add it was mouthfuls at this point 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.979
 you are ready to go 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.450
 other fundamental thing before 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.579
 travel and check the 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.350
 tire pressure go into 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.539
 service area whatever you can 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.700
 do it safely from you controlled 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.979
 in the car instructions booklet 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.710
 on the door sill are 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.469
 report operating pressures 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.570
 take the pressure gauge and connect it to the 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.210
 valve tires should not 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.490
 be warm so you should be in 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.649
 recently travel if tires were 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.170
 hot considered a little more than the 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.060
 pressure that is indicated on the threshold 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.110
 of the door because then it will be reduced to 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.000
 cold driving safety 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.860
 car skills and above all i 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.580
 consumption travel with a pressure 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.680
 low 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.090
 greatly increases car consumption 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.090
 remember the good journey
