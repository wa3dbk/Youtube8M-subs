photos together for you so if we look at
that<00:03:04.470> there<00:03:04.739> you<00:03:05.239> take<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.360> first<00:03:06.599> one<00:03:06.870> and

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
that there you take the first one and

that there you take the first one and
it's<00:03:07.530> got<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.680> recorded<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.550> then<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.180> just

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
it's got I recorded and then you just

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.330 
it's got I recorded and then you just
move<00:03:09.569> it<00:03:09.690> around<00:03:09.780> until<00:03:10.349> you've<00:03:10.920> lined<00:03:11.129> that

move it around until you've lined that

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.399 
move it around until you've lined that
square<00:03:11.760> up<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.269> it<00:03:12.870> will<00:03:12.959> tell<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.230> if<00:03:13.319> you're

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
square up and it will tell you if you're

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.589 
square up and it will tell you if you're
doing<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.709> wrong<00:03:13.950> there<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:14.730> go<00:03:14.849> so<00:03:15.060> pulled<00:03:15.480> it

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
doing it wrong there you go so pulled it

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:16.880 
doing it wrong there you go so pulled it
down<00:03:15.629> a<00:03:15.750> little<00:03:15.930> bit<00:03:16.110> if<00:03:16.409> you<00:03:16.500> follow<00:03:16.739> the

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
down a little bit if you follow the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.650 
down a little bit if you follow the
arrows<00:03:17.159> until<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:17.489> bind<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.849> up

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.540
