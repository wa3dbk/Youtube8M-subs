00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.030
 23,586 years when the shit is dry 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.800
 or they split in half they take the egg out of 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.630
 which has even left the chick what 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.330
 they throw it away and they keep the shit 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.340
 dry after doing the same process 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.260
 but with marbles and the crap of but with 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.960
 they already have the ball where they 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.880
 hide the surprise and you will see that the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.100
 interior is vain because it is because 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.130
 from the factory they run inside him 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.660
 I imagined it is true then stick the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.759
 two pieces with super glue and the 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.800
 wrapping sanz remains taken from a 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.020
 mine and painted with spray paint 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.060
 flammable and toxic and then it 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.310
 distribute in all markets of the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.940
 world with the idea of ​​being sold and in 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.740
 that they eat more meats and fried things 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.630
 we always get the peca peeling shirt 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.910
 loosens that galley to make soft liquid 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.590
 poop shit water or whatever you want to call 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.720

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.580

 It has two almonds that are actually 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.369
 black and white chocolate stones and in the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.070
 another side the pathetic surprise that they are 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.110
