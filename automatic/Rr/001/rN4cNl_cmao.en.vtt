I<00:00:00.110> visit<00:00:01.110> when<00:00:01.260> again<00:00:01.500> they<00:00:01.709> like<00:00:01.890> to<00:00:02.040> talk<00:00:02.220> a

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
I visit when again they like to talk a

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.889 
I visit when again they like to talk a
little<00:00:02.490> more<00:00:02.639> about<00:00:02.760> diminished<00:00:03.510> seventh

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
little more about diminished seventh

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.480 
little more about diminished seventh
chords<00:00:04.259> because<00:00:04.589> they<00:00:04.710> had<00:00:04.950> so<00:00:05.339> many

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
chords because they had so many

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.700 
chords because they had so many
qualities<00:00:06.120> I<00:00:06.359> think<00:00:06.990> I<00:00:07.080> showed<00:00:07.319> you<00:00:07.500> there's

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
qualities I think I showed you there's

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.350 
qualities I think I showed you there's
only<00:00:07.890> three<00:00:08.250> diminished<00:00:08.700> seventh<00:00:09.030> chords

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
only three diminished seventh chords

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.990 
only three diminished seventh chords
those<00:00:09.570> three<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.620> then<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.700> encompasses

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
those three and then that encompasses

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.410 
those three and then that encompasses
all<00:00:12.540> twelve<00:00:12.990> notes<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.559> diatonic<00:00:14.009> scale

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.859 

that's<00:00:18.420> four<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.779> them<00:00:20.270> four<00:00:21.270> more<00:00:21.510> three

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
that's four of them four more three

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.689 
that's four of them four more three
times<00:00:22.080> four<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.350> twelve<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.070> we<00:00:23.189> use<00:00:23.310> all<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
times four is twelve so we use all the

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.820 
times four is twelve so we use all the
notes<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.150> scale<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.810> therefore<00:00:25.260> any

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
notes of the scale and therefore any

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.580 
notes of the scale and therefore any
note<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.550> chord<00:00:27.150> can<00:00:27.990> be<00:00:28.109> called<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
note of that chord can be called the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.870 
note of that chord can be called the
root<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.099> court<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.400> other<00:00:29.490> words<00:00:29.730> that's

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
root of that court in other words that's

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.540 
root of that court in other words that's

person and that's another person just to
have<00:01:06.240> step<00:01:06.479> away<00:01:06.659> from<00:01:06.810> each<00:01:07.020> other<00:01:07.229> and

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
have step away from each other and

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.490 
have step away from each other and
that's<00:01:08.700> all<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.540> diminished<00:01:09.900> seventh<00:01:10.200> chords

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
that's all the diminished seventh chords

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.530 
that's all the diminished seventh chords
there<00:01:10.650> are<00:01:10.830> now<00:01:11.549> we've<00:01:11.700> said<00:01:11.909> if<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.119> didn't<00:01:12.330> or

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
there are now we've said if we didn't or

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.690 
there are now we've said if we didn't or
any<00:01:12.840> one<00:01:13.200> note<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.650> diminished<00:01:14.369> 7th<00:01:14.640> chord

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
any one note of a diminished 7th chord

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.940 
any one note of a diminished 7th chord
we'd<00:01:15.000> get<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> dominant<00:01:15.720> seventh<00:01:16.049> or<00:01:16.140> okay<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
we'd get a dominant seventh or okay and

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.310 
we'd get a dominant seventh or okay and
that's<00:01:17.549> useful<00:01:17.759> because<00:01:18.119> then<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.930> dominant

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
that's useful because then the dominant

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.870 
that's useful because then the dominant
seventh<00:01:19.619> chord<00:01:19.860> wants<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.250> go<00:01:20.400> someplace

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
seventh chord wants to go someplace

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.550 
seventh chord wants to go someplace
it<00:01:21.210> wants<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.509> modulate<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.140> before<00:01:22.470> it

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
it wants to modulate it before it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.090 
it wants to modulate it before it
doesn't<00:01:22.860> know<00:01:22.939> what's<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.060> fourth<00:01:24.299> up<00:01:24.450> from<00:01:24.659> me

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
get TV that way say we're playing in C

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.520 
get TV that way say we're playing in C
and<00:01:33.310> we<00:01:33.580> get<00:01:33.760> the<00:01:33.940> main<00:01:34.479> 7th<00:01:34.900> chord<00:01:35.170> we<00:01:35.320> lower

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
and we get the main 7th chord we lower

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.020 
and we get the main 7th chord we lower
one<00:01:35.860> note<00:01:36.900> I'm<00:01:37.900> seeing<00:01:38.320> me<00:01:38.619> and<00:01:39.460> we<00:01:39.700> have<00:01:39.880> it

one note I'm seeing me and we have it

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.920 
one note I'm seeing me and we have it
equal

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
equal

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.210 
equal
right<00:01:43.630> or<00:01:44.630> if<00:01:44.750> we<00:01:44.960> want<00:01:45.410> to<00:01:45.470> go<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.620> cheat<00:01:45.980> wheel

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
right or if we want to go to cheat wheel

right or if we want to go to cheat wheel
or<00:01:46.400> a<00:01:46.730> flat<00:01:47.680> 2d<00:01:49.660> and<00:01:50.660> I<00:01:50.750> think<00:01:51.020> it's<00:01:51.140> ready<00:01:51.320> okay

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.469 
or a flat 2d and I think it's ready okay
because<00:01:51.890> v<00:01:52.960> 7g<00:01:53.960> is<00:01:54.220> d7m<00:01:55.220> okay<00:01:55.610> so<00:01:55.670> we<00:01:56.150> will<00:01:56.300> over

let's<00:04:01.980> see<00:04:02.130> if<00:04:02.250> we<00:04:02.400> lowered<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.360> bottom

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
let's see if we lowered the the bottom

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.840 
let's see if we lowered the the bottom
notes<00:04:03.900> at<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.260> 2nd<00:04:04.710> note

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.640 

we<00:04:08.850> get<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.000> 6<00:04:09.270> quart<00:04:09.420> no<00:04:09.600> we're<00:04:09.780> okay

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
we get a 6 quart no we're okay

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:21.830 
we get a 6 quart no we're okay
and<00:04:11.280> I'm<00:04:12.030> major<00:04:12.240> six<00:04:12.540> quart<00:04:14.030> that's<00:04:20.630> how<00:04:21.630> about

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
and I'm major six quart that's how about

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.290 
and I'm major six quart that's how about
if<00:04:21.930> we<00:04:22.049> lower<00:04:22.230> say<00:04:23.220> at<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.400> top<00:04:23.610> of<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.910> bottom

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
if we lower say at the top of the bottom

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.270 
if we lower say at the top of the bottom
top<00:04:24.570> of<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.870> say<00:04:25.080> one<00:04:26.480> that's<00:04:27.480> named<00:04:27.690> plastic

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
top of the say one that's named plastic

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.410 
top of the say one that's named plastic
they're<00:04:29.280> always<00:04:29.400> gonna<00:04:29.580> be<00:04:29.760> inverted<00:04:30.120> except

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
they're always gonna be inverted except

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.960 
they're always gonna be inverted except
for<00:04:30.600> one<00:04:30.800> so<00:04:31.800> just<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:32.190> summarize<00:04:32.610> if<00:04:32.820> you

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970

lower<00:04:44.880> any<00:04:45.300> two<00:04:45.570> nodes<00:04:45.750> we<00:04:46.380> get<00:04:46.500> a<00:04:46.530> major<00:04:46.770> sixth

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
lower any two nodes we get a major sixth

lower any two nodes we get a major sixth
chord<00:04:47.490> okay<00:04:48.170> now<00:04:49.170> there's<00:04:49.410> lots<00:04:49.680> of<00:04:49.860> food<00:04:50.070> for

chord okay now there's lots of food for

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.460 
chord okay now there's lots of food for
thought<00:04:50.370> in<00:04:50.850> this<00:04:51.240> so<00:04:51.540> I<00:04:51.570> want<00:04:51.930> you<00:04:52.050> to<00:04:52.140> spend<00:04:52.350> a

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
thought in this so I want you to spend a

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.320 
thought in this so I want you to spend a
lot<00:04:52.560> of<00:04:52.620> time<00:04:52.920> just<00:04:52.950> trying<00:04:53.310> that<00:04:53.760> out<00:04:53.820> on<00:04:54.150> on

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
lot of time just trying that out on on

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.480 
lot of time just trying that out on on
those<00:04:54.690> three<00:04:54.990> chords<00:04:55.290> I<00:04:55.590> think<00:04:56.100> all<00:04:56.220> three

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
those three chords I think all three

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.880 
those three chords I think all three
chords<00:04:56.880> and<00:04:57.050> make<00:04:58.050> those<00:04:58.260> transformations

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
chords and make those transformations

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.950 
chords and make those transformations
those<00:04:59.370> are<00:04:59.490> advanced<00:04:59.820> transformations<00:05:00.720> and

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
those are advanced transformations and

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.680 
those are advanced transformations and
they're<00:05:01.770> really<00:05:02.130> great<00:05:02.370> for<00:05:02.690> improvisation

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
they're really great for improvisation

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.980 
they're really great for improvisation
and<00:05:03.900> for<00:05:04.640> modulation<00:05:05.810> okay<00:05:06.810> and

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
and for modulation okay and

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.240 
and for modulation okay and
transposition<00:05:07.410> too<00:05:07.920> so<00:05:09.140> go<00:05:10.140> to<00:05:10.200> work<00:05:10.410> and<00:05:10.710> see

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
transposition too so go to work and see

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.560 
transposition too so go to work and see
what<00:05:11.400> you<00:05:11.520> can<00:05:11.640> discover<00:05:11.760> that<00:05:12.180> there's<00:05:12.390> a<00:05:12.450> lot

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
what you can discover that there's a lot

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.880 
what you can discover that there's a lot
more<00:05:12.750> that<00:05:12.930> I<00:05:12.960> haven't<00:05:13.140> talked<00:05:13.530> about<00:05:13.710> that

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
more that I haven't talked about that

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.070 
you can discover those are it's a kind
of<00:05:17.250> a<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.400> doorway<00:05:17.790> to<00:05:17.820> the<00:05:18.090> infinite<00:05:18.600> almost
