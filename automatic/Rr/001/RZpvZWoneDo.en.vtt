00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
making that landing now in our case

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.310 
making that landing now in our case
we've<00:02:52.820> pitched<00:02:53.209> for<00:02:53.570> our<00:02:53.630> best<00:02:53.900> glide<00:02:54.260> speed

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
we've pitched for our best glide speed

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.920 
we've pitched for our best glide speed
we've<00:02:55.190> chosen<00:02:55.580> our<00:02:55.790> best<00:02:56.090> land<00:02:56.420> area<00:02:56.810> which

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
we've chosen our best land area which

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.540 
we've chosen our best land area which
happened<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:57.290> be<00:02:57.380> right<00:02:57.590> below<00:02:57.800> us<00:02:58.100> it<00:02:58.280> was<00:02:58.430> an

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
happened to be right below us it was an

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.110 
happened to be right below us it was an
airport<00:02:58.970> I<00:02:59.150> really<00:02:59.450> do<00:02:59.630> suggest<00:02:59.930> you<00:03:00.410> guys

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
airport I really do suggest you guys

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.870 
airport I really do suggest you guys
practice<00:03:02.120> these<00:03:02.480> into<00:03:02.959> airports<00:03:03.410> as<00:03:03.709> well<00:03:04.190> so

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
practice these into airports as well so

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.910 
practice these into airports as well so
you<00:03:04.970> can<00:03:05.239> really<00:03:05.480> see<00:03:05.870> how<00:03:06.200> that<00:03:06.440> airplane

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
you can really see how that airplane

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.420 
you can really see how that airplane
glides<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:07.760> performs<00:03:08.420> all<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:09.260> way<00:03:09.410> down<00:03:09.800> to

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
glides and performs all the way down to

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.949 
glides and performs all the way down to
the<00:03:10.700> ground<00:03:10.970> and<00:03:11.239> what<00:03:11.360> you're<00:03:11.510> going<00:03:11.630> to<00:03:11.690> see

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
the ground and what you're going to see

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.280 
the ground and what you're going to see
here<00:03:12.440> is<00:03:13.300> we're<00:03:14.300> just<00:03:14.540> going<00:03:14.690> to<00:03:14.720> treat<00:03:15.050> this

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
here is we're just going to treat this

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.180 
here is we're just going to treat this
as<00:03:15.580> literally<00:03:16.580> a<00:03:16.760> normal<00:03:17.660> landing<00:03:18.260> as<00:03:18.739> you'll

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
as literally a normal landing as you'll

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.340 
as literally a normal landing as you'll
see<00:03:19.400> I'm<00:03:19.550> just<00:03:19.730> over<00:03:20.060> flying<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.600> field<00:03:20.870> we're

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
see I'm just over flying the field we're

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.440 
see I'm just over flying the field we're
actually<00:03:21.620> going<00:03:22.100> to<00:03:22.400> swing<00:03:22.820> it<00:03:22.850> around<00:03:23.150> for<00:03:23.390> a

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
actually going to swing it around for a

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.500 
actually going to swing it around for a
left<00:03:23.780> downwind<00:03:24.500> on<00:03:24.709> runway<00:03:25.550> two<00:03:25.610> eight<00:03:26.180> it's<00:03:26.420> a

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
left downwind on runway two eight it's a

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.180 
left downwind on runway two eight it's a
traffic<00:03:26.780> pattern<00:03:27.350> you<00:03:27.530> know<00:03:27.650> we've<00:03:27.830> flown

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
traffic pattern you know we've flown

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.640 
traffic pattern you know we've flown
thousands<00:03:29.090> of<00:03:29.270> times<00:03:29.570> so<00:03:30.350> we're<00:03:30.500> going<00:03:30.590> to

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
thousands of times so we're going to

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.410 
thousands of times so we're going to
treat<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.010> just<00:03:31.400> like<00:03:31.580> a<00:03:31.730> normal<00:03:31.940> Lane<00:03:32.269> and

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
treat it just like a normal Lane and

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.509 
treat it just like a normal Lane and
here<00:03:32.600> we<00:03:32.690> are<00:03:32.720> over<00:03:32.989> fly<00:03:33.350> in<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:33.590> runway<00:03:33.890> to

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
here we are over fly in the runway to

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.520 
here we are over fly in the runway to
eight<00:03:34.730> we're<00:03:35.239> going<00:03:35.360> to<00:03:35.450> turn<00:03:35.600> a<00:03:35.660> nice<00:03:36.019> tight

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
eight we're going to turn a nice tight

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.620 
eight we're going to turn a nice tight
downwind<00:03:37.130> we're<00:03:37.580> not<00:03:37.790> going<00:03:37.970> to<00:03:38.030> use<00:03:38.090> flaps

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
downwind we're not going to use flaps

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.660 
downwind we're not going to use flaps
until<00:03:39.080> we<00:03:39.170> know<00:03:39.380> we've<00:03:39.590> got<00:03:39.799> that<00:03:39.830> runway<00:03:40.400> made

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
until we know we've got that runway made

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.090 
until we know we've got that runway made
and<00:03:41.000> we're<00:03:41.360> still<00:03:41.630> going<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:41.989> hold<00:03:42.350> that<00:03:42.680> best

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
and we're still going to hold that best

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.920 
and we're still going to hold that best
glide<00:03:43.820> speed<00:03:45.580> now<00:03:46.580> when<00:03:47.000> coming<00:03:47.450> in<00:03:47.540> here<00:03:47.780> it's

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
glide speed now when coming in here it's

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.729 
glide speed now when coming in here it's
super<00:03:48.200> important<00:03:48.920> to<00:03:48.980> remember<00:03:49.489> that<00:03:49.910> it<00:03:50.600> is

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
super important to remember that it is

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.060 
super important to remember that it is
easier<00:03:51.739> to<00:03:52.000> lose<00:03:53.000> altitude<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.380> is<00:03:54.590> to

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
easier to lose altitude that it is to

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.580 
easier to lose altitude that it is to
gain<00:03:55.640> altitude<00:03:56.260> obviously<00:03:57.260> in<00:03:57.440> this

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
gain altitude obviously in this

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.830 
gain altitude obviously in this
situation<00:03:57.650> so<00:03:58.519> here<00:03:59.030> we<00:03:59.150> are<00:03:59.180> in<00:03:59.360> the<00:03:59.420> dow<00:03:59.600> and

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
situation so here we are in the dow and

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.770 
situation so here we are in the dow and
watch<00:04:00.049> how<00:04:00.380> tight<00:04:00.769> we<00:04:01.070> turn<00:04:01.370> our<00:04:01.610> base<00:04:01.880> we<00:04:02.630> want

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
watch how tight we turn our base we want

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.050 
watch how tight we turn our base we want
to<00:04:02.930> keep<00:04:03.080> everything<00:04:03.470> nice<00:04:04.220> and<00:04:04.250> tight<00:04:04.760> and

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
to keep everything nice and tight and

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.930 
to keep everything nice and tight and
close<00:04:05.600> in<00:04:05.930> again<00:04:06.470> much<00:04:06.950> easier<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.489> lose<00:04:07.730> at

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
close in again much easier to lose at

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.990 
close in again much easier to lose at
altitude<00:04:08.450> through<00:04:08.750> a<00:04:08.840> slip<00:04:09.230> or<00:04:09.440> something

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
altitude through a slip or something

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.240 
altitude through a slip or something
rather<00:04:11.000> than<00:04:11.480> trying<00:04:12.049> to<00:04:12.350> get<00:04:12.799> some<00:04:13.070> of<00:04:13.220> that

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
rather than trying to get some of that

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.430 
rather than trying to get some of that
altitude<00:04:13.850> back<00:04:14.180> when<00:04:14.450> we<00:04:14.540> don't<00:04:14.900> have<00:04:14.989> that

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
altitude back when we don't have that

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.969 
altitude back when we don't have that
thrust<00:04:16.100> so<00:04:16.850> we're<00:04:17.540> turning<00:04:17.900> our<00:04:18.290> base<00:04:18.620> right

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
thrust so we're turning our base right

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.880 
thrust so we're turning our base right
about<00:04:19.669> now<00:04:20.390> as<00:04:20.720> you<00:04:20.870> can<00:04:20.989> see<00:04:21.200> we're<00:04:21.320> coming<00:04:21.650> in

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
about now as you can see we're coming in

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.770 
about now as you can see we're coming in
in<00:04:22.100> just<00:04:22.550> a<00:04:22.760> second<00:04:23.210> I'm<00:04:23.360> going<00:04:23.479> to<00:04:23.570> add<00:04:23.750> a

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
in just a second I'm going to add a

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.780 
in just a second I'm going to add a
knotch<00:04:24.169> flaps<00:04:24.590> because<00:04:25.070> when<00:04:25.340> I<00:04:25.370> was<00:04:25.520> turning

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
knotch flaps because when I was turning

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.219 
knotch flaps because when I was turning
this<00:04:26.000> uh<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:26.450> final<00:04:26.660> approach<00:04:26.930> here's<00:04:27.140> my

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
this uh the final approach here's my

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.830 
this uh the final approach here's my
flaps<00:04:27.530> now<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:28.669> realized<00:04:29.360> I<00:04:29.419> was<00:04:29.540> a<00:04:29.570> little<00:04:29.750> bit

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
flaps now I realized I was a little bit

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.740 
flaps now I realized I was a little bit
high<00:04:30.020> you<00:04:30.350> know<00:04:30.680> I<00:04:30.710> had<00:04:31.130> that<00:04:31.370> runway<00:04:32.120> made<00:04:32.479> I

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
high you know I had that runway made I

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.409 
high you know I had that runway made I
knew<00:04:33.140> I<00:04:33.169> could<00:04:33.470> use<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:34.099> flaps<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:34.849> I'm

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
knew I could use the flaps and I'm

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.300 
knew I could use the flaps and I'm
simply<00:04:35.840> coming<00:04:36.380> in<00:04:36.500> I've<00:04:36.650> made<00:04:36.860> all<00:04:37.099> the

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
simply coming in I've made all the

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.220 
simply coming in I've made all the
proper<00:04:37.700> radio<00:04:37.970> calls<00:04:38.240> especially<00:04:38.539> if<00:04:38.870> you're

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
proper radio calls especially if you're

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.870 
proper radio calls especially if you're
you<00:04:39.380> lay<00:04:39.470> in<00:04:39.590> this<00:04:39.710> situation<00:04:40.310> you<00:04:40.670> need<00:04:40.760> to

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
you lay in this situation you need to

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.520 
you lay in this situation you need to
let<00:04:41.000> everyone<00:04:41.300> know<00:04:41.450> what<00:04:41.750> you're<00:04:41.870> doing<00:04:42.200> let

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
let everyone know what you're doing let

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.230 
let everyone know what you're doing let
me<00:04:42.590> know<00:04:42.650> it's<00:04:42.800> a<00:04:42.890> simulated<00:04:43.490> engine<00:04:44.090> out

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
me know it's a simulated engine out

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.740 
me know it's a simulated engine out
simulated<00:04:44.900> engine<00:04:45.260> failure<00:04:45.710> and<00:04:46.660> bringing<00:04:47.660> in

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
simulated engine failure and bringing in

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.810 
simulated engine failure and bringing in
for<00:04:47.930> a<00:04:47.960> nice<00:04:48.110> smooth<00:04:48.470> landing<00:04:48.650> I<00:04:48.980> also<00:04:49.130> really

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
for a nice smooth landing I also really

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.640 
for a nice smooth landing I also really
recommend<00:04:50.390> when<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.050> engine<00:04:51.440> when<00:04:51.530> you've

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
recommend when the engine when you've

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.070 
recommend when the engine when you've
gone<00:04:51.800> from<00:04:51.980> like<00:04:52.130> 2,000<00:04:52.850> 3,000<00:04:53.510> feet<00:04:53.720> all<00:04:54.020> the

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
gone from like 2,000 3,000 feet all the

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.160 
gone from like 2,000 3,000 feet all the
way<00:04:54.470> down<00:04:54.830> to<00:04:55.270> down<00:04:56.270> to<00:04:56.450> the<00:04:56.480> ground<00:04:56.780> with<00:04:57.080> the

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
way down to down to the ground with the

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.740 
way down to down to the ground with the
engine<00:04:57.560> idle<00:04:57.920> I<00:04:58.070> really<00:04:58.580> recommend<00:04:59.060> you<00:04:59.150> back

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
engine idle I really recommend you back

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.240 
engine idle I really recommend you back
taxi<00:05:00.320> rather<00:05:00.530> than<00:05:00.740> trying<00:05:00.980> to<00:05:01.100> do<00:05:01.220> a

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
taxi rather than trying to do a

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.070 
taxi rather than trying to do a
touch-and-go<00:05:01.550> in<00:05:01.910> this<00:05:02.030> situation<00:05:02.600> much

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
touch-and-go in this situation much

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.730 
touch-and-go in this situation much
easier<00:05:03.620> on<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:04.480> the<00:05:05.480> engine<00:05:05.930> so<00:05:06.170> what<00:05:06.680> we

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
easier on the the engine so what we

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.680 
easier on the the engine so what we
talked<00:05:06.980> about<00:05:07.130> was<00:05:07.340> the<00:05:07.460> ABCs<00:05:08.120> of<00:05:08.150> an<00:05:08.450> engine

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
talked about was the ABCs of an engine

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.630 
talked about was the ABCs of an engine
failure<00:05:08.930> a<00:05:09.140> for<00:05:09.470> airspeed<00:05:09.830> B<00:05:10.190> for<00:05:10.460> best

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
failure a for airspeed B for best

failure a for airspeed B for best
landing<00:05:11.060> area<00:05:11.330> keep<00:05:11.540> in<00:05:11.660> mind<00:05:11.810> that<00:05:11.900> best<00:05:12.110> lane

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
landing area keep in mind that best lane

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.870 
landing area keep in mind that best lane
area<00:05:12.620> might<00:05:12.770> be<00:05:12.800> behind<00:05:13.130> you<00:05:13.370> or<00:05:13.520> below<00:05:13.760> you

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
area might be behind you or below you
