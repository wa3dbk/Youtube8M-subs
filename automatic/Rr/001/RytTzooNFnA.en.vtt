included in this program that does not

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.039 
included in this program that does not
seem<00:01:18.250> that<00:01:18.280> work<00:01:18.759> is<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.299> fact<00:01:19.540> that<00:01:19.630> you<00:01:19.899> can

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
seem that work is the fact that you can

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.050 
seem that work is the fact that you can
initialize<00:01:20.619> a<00:01:20.890> keyboard<00:01:21.399> hook<00:01:21.640> what<00:01:21.880> that

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
initialize a keyboard hook what that

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.420 
initialize a keyboard hook what that
means<00:01:22.360> is<00:01:22.689> instead<00:01:22.990> of<00:01:23.380> having<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:24.100> go<00:01:24.220> over

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
means is instead of having to go over

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.219 
means is instead of having to go over
here<00:01:24.670> and<00:01:24.729> activate<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.390> Start<00:01:25.630> screen<00:01:25.659> you

here and activate the Start screen you

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:27.719 
here and activate the Start screen you
can<00:01:26.409> just<00:01:26.439> allow<00:01:26.920> that<00:01:27.189> just<00:01:27.460> to<00:01:27.640> be

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
can just allow that just to be

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.940 
can just allow that just to be
completely<00:01:28.390> gone<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:29.140> only<00:01:29.469> allow<00:01:29.890> the
