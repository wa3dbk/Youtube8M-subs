00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 today we will talk about a topic 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:08.460
 quite strange as we will always talk 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.250
 about which hotels are 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.130
 most amazing ice that we can 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.049
 find on our planet obviously 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.150
 these hotels are located in some 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.660
 from the coldest areas of the planet 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.910
 land where 0 degrees centigrade that is 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.000
 the temperature at which the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.699
 water is not a temperature that generates 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.059
 annoyance in its inhabitants upside down is 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.210
 a nice temperature because today we're going 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.489
 to start with the number 1 position with a 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.420
 hotel that may be older than its 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.329
 kind a hotel in sweden known as 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.300
 jackass harvey its awesome 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.539
 structure has to be reconstructed in the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.879
 last month of each year but despite 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.110
 it always keeps offering a 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.690
 awesome environment 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.620
 that part of the oldest of its kind the 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.890
 larger we also find a group 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.610
 of good hotels the complex is called 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.310
 tax noten article resort in saariselkÃ¤ 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.180
 in Finland, look that we are going to 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.900
 Finland as the customer what he asks 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.240
 here they are given to choose let's say that a 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.870
 person could go here and choose either 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.050
 between a glass igloo or an original one 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:33.080
 made of snow on the other hand we have a 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.330
 already more known hotel that is the hotel of 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.610
 glass in quebec in canada 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.370
 it is known because it only remains 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.610
 open and standing for 3 to 4 months 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.850
 concretely concretely pardon between 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.000
 December and March the customers in fact 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.210
 can rest on a bed made of 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.400
 a block of ice covered by 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.070
 of skins or woods that 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.490
 they help to warm up I do not know I think that 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.650
 It would be quite uncomfortable to sleep in a 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.780
 block of ice is practically like 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.200
 sleep on the floor but not good 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.870
 situation is curious we have another 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.290
 hotel that is the balear ice hostel in 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.629
 sirte zuara in romania 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.269
 that in order to get there the first thing 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:24.180
 what to do is take the cable car but 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.609
 once up there are let's say like a 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.329
 kind of ice restaurant a bar 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:33.269
 of ice and the ice church as not 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:36.120
 also the ice hotel practically 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.069
 everything at the top is made of ice not 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.519
 only the hotel thing that is also 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:46.909
 curious we also have the al pen 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:49.019
 igloo igloo bile in tail in austria here 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:52.379
 well this is basically is for 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.720
 enjoy the ice sculptures that 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.370
 artists from all over the world is there in 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.159
 this place 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.799
 you can also spend the night in one of 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:04.080
 the centuries of the ski resort but 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.599
 basically this is a place that combines 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.780
 the beauty of ice sculptures 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:12.569
 an accommodation in an igloo 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:18.230
 then we also have the sorry without iva 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:21.170
 igloo house in hostel in high norway 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.629
 As you can see here, the cold is from 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.030
 several degrees below zero minus 20 minus 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.180
 30 even many times less than 40 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.950
 degrees the advantage that these social 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.280
 they vanish with increasing 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.060
 temperature is that they create the opportunity 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.760
 to be remodeled every year 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.459
 what they do need good sacks 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.489
 of plush sleep and jacuzzis for 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.370
 grab the heat because obviously be 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:51.370
 here it can generate serious problems of 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:55.420
 health we also have the aurora eyes 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.830
 museum in fairbanks in alaska and good 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.220
 although the purpose was to maintain the 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.840
 hotel all year aurora was reduced to a 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.360
 bar museum after the 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.019
 warm temperatures melted the 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:11.260
 first structure in the year 2004 by 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:14.230
 misfortune could not be preserved and the 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.709
 last we have it in snow willits snow 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.320
 house the in kit and the one in finland the 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:24.840
 walls are art in the 30 rooms 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.970
 made of ice and snow from this hotel 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.400
 the truth is that they are all hotels 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.370
 curious amazing hotels I have not 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.860
 visited none eye I'm sure that 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.320
 the vast majority of you no more 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.940
 that nothing because they are hotels 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.699
 excessively cold when one goes to a 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.220
 hotel is not looking for a hotel that is 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.320
 the same temperature as the outside goes 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.930
 looking for a hotel where there is heating 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.650
 and where it is comfortable therefore this 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.510
 type of hotels are not excessively 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.240
 frequented however if one day 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.510
 you want to do something original they are a 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.639
 good alternative to spend a day 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.990
 rather curious not a day and a night 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.690
 pretty curious 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.000
 the truth is that the cold ravages these 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.470
 places so you better go warm 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.470
 in case you go
