00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.180
 we would have small farm and to eat said 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.130
 farmers so today a new 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.980
 presentation video it's a map 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.869
 graph it seems disproportionate at the same 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.300
 time these two fans of ten 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.260
 centimeters that to cool that we 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.860
 comes from msi this is the gaming series 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:43.590
 gtx 760 gpu with these new nankin 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.110
 series of home lives with the famous 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.690
 gold dragon go to the new color code 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.930
 it's just perfect red black 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.649
 we love the black pcb we like a lot 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.410
 also the map to a reinforcement bar 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.170
 on top of the big heat pipes 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.329
 so that promises it requires a 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.720
 connection upi of a 6 pin connection for 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.729
 operate look at the logo that's 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.869
 really very very pretty you want 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.789
 take a tour of the graphics card 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:18.350
 it must be recognized that it is rather a 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:18.350
 very very beautiful card 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.730
 at the level of the outputs she will us 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.820
 propose two outputs dvi an output 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:31.330
 hdmi a port display output now 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.850
 we will be interested in the frequencies then 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.940
 frequency level the gpu is at 1020 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:41.170
 my guys with the boost at 1085 keep me 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:45.820
 the memory is sitting the map giguÃ¨re 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:49.090
 benefit necessarily 2152 cuda cores and 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.230
 of 2 gigabytes of gddr5 interfaced in 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.810
 256 bits 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:56.610
 so we go bng and we give you a one 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.610
 test very quickly goodbye
