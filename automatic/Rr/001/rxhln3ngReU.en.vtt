episode<00:00:04.040> in<00:00:05.040> today's<00:00:05.400> episode<00:00:05.640> I'm<00:00:06.060> gonna

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
episode in today's episode I'm gonna

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.780 
episode in today's episode I'm gonna
show<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.509> how<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.779> have<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.560> nice<00:00:07.950> automated

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
show you how to have a nice automated

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.580 
show you how to have a nice automated
source<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.330> mana<00:00:11.780> maybe<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.559> could

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
source of mana maybe that you could

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.189 
source of mana maybe that you could
increase<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.849> get<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.179> bit<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.450> mana<00:00:16.039> so<00:00:18.199> this

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
increase and get a bit of mana so this

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.859 
increase and get a bit of mana so this
is<00:00:19.380> pretty<00:00:20.250> much<00:00:20.340> using<00:00:20.820> entirely<00:00:21.180> vanilla

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
is pretty much using entirely vanilla

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.200 
is pretty much using entirely vanilla
mechanics<00:00:23.210> I've<00:00:24.210> set<00:00:24.600> up<00:00:24.720> here<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:26.210> chicken

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
mechanics I've set up here a chicken

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.200 
mechanics I've set up here a chicken
farm<00:00:28.130> which<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.310> cooking<00:00:29.580> chicken<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:32.210> this

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
farm which is cooking chicken and this

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.319 
farm which is cooking chicken and this
design<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.170> by<00:00:34.440> eczema<00:00:35.010> void<00:00:35.309> exhume<00:00:36.030> avoid

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
design is by eczema void exhume avoid

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.440 
design is by eczema void exhume avoid
even<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.340> it's<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.550> quite<00:00:38.730> simple<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.210> make

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
even and it's it's quite simple to make

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.290 
even and it's it's quite simple to make
and<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:40.500> produces<00:00:41.010> quite<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.550> good<00:00:42.000> bit<00:00:42.270> of

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
and it produces quite a good bit of

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.850 
and it produces quite a good bit of
chicken<00:00:42.899> once<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.290> gets<00:00:43.530> going<00:00:45.379> so<00:00:46.379> what<00:00:46.739> we

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
chicken once it gets going so what we

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.590 
chicken once it gets going so what we
want<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.129> do<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.610> basically<00:00:47.940> we're<00:00:48.450> going<00:00:48.539> to

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
want to do is basically we're going to

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.529 
want to do is basically we're going to
take<00:00:48.840> out<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.230> bitch<00:00:51.800> and<00:00:52.800> we're<00:00:53.789> gonna<00:00:53.910> put

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
take out this bitch and we're gonna put

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.920 
take out this bitch and we're gonna put
in<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.809> bit<00:00:54.960> more<00:00:56.180> probably<00:00:57.180> put<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.449> here<00:00:57.899> I

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
in a bit more probably put it here I

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.660 
in a bit more probably put it here I
think<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.379> probably<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.770> best<00:00:59.250> place<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.520> put

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
think is probably the best place to put

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.170 
think is probably the best place to put
it

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
it

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.020 
it
we're<00:01:01.079> gonna<00:01:01.199> put<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:02.030> 1/2<00:01:03.030> an<00:01:04.280> open<00:01:05.280> crash<00:01:05.610> from

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
we're gonna put a 1/2 an open crash from

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.350 
we're gonna put a 1/2 an open crash from
batana<00:01:06.590> here<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.250> we're<00:01:08.460> gonna<00:01:08.549> run<00:01:08.880> hoppers

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
batana here and we're gonna run hoppers

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.399 
batana here and we're gonna run hoppers
into<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.750> thing<00:01:09.960> then<00:01:11.150> get<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.299> here<00:01:14.960> cool<00:01:15.960> so

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
into this thing then get in here cool so

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.480 
into this thing then get in here cool so
there<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:16.890> go

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.890 

so<00:01:20.490> now<00:01:20.640> everything<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.270> going<00:01:21.509> into<00:01:21.750> this

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
so now everything is going into this

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.899 
so now everything is going into this
crate<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.350> stitch<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.950> it's<00:01:23.340> gonna<00:01:23.549> drop

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
crate and stitch and it's gonna drop

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.240 
crate and stitch and it's gonna drop
down<00:01:24.150> straight<00:01:24.840> out<00:01:24.990> there<00:01:25.409> like<00:01:26.040> those

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
down straight out there like those

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.640 
down straight out there like those
feathers<00:01:26.700> now<00:01:27.420> we<00:01:27.810> could<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:27.990> probably

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
feathers now we could just probably

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.289 
feathers now we could just probably
leave<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.979> feathers<00:01:29.340> there<00:01:29.579> because<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.210> be

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
leave the feathers there because to be

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.120 
leave the feathers there because to be
honest<00:01:30.630> LD<00:01:30.990> spawn<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.470> while<00:01:31.680> they'll<00:01:31.979> be<00:01:32.100> a

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
honest LD spawn in a while they'll be a

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.210 
honest LD spawn in a while they'll be a
load<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.460> them<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:33.030> who<00:01:33.420> cares<00:01:33.979> around<00:01:34.979> that

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
load of them but who cares around that

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.170 
load of them but who cares around that
