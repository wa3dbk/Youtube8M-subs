00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.810
 good evening it can be good weekend 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.210
 what is it like to look like time 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.080
 typical of the Halloween wind of the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.849
 clouds rain 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.440
 well we'll have it going to change at 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.389
 from tomorrow all is in preparation 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.130
 on the Atlantic it will concern the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.869
 France in the coming hours with 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.039
 a great stir and melted better 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.570
 also bad weather today 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.109
 near the Mediterranean the trend will be 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.760
 improvement 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.840
 after the heavy rains that occurred in 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.430
 the region of marseille also in 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.619
 Corsican we had in a few hours 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.000
 morning the equivalent of two weeks of 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.560
 more in normal times and thunderstorms that 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.960
 piled up they still concerned 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.610
 in the late afternoon the south east of the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.590
 Corsican so tomorrow improvement in 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.850
 Mediterranean but degradation that will 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.230
 so concern a large northern half 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.940
 with clouds at first 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.260
 rather discrete wells of the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.309
 champagne from the Paris basin to 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.079
 country of the Loire some skinny 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.520
 thinnings near the coasts of the sleeve 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.320
 in the afternoon the clouds will occupy the 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.789
 field on a very very large half 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.980
 north with rains this time supported 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.120
 in Brittany winds also they 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.980
 will be supported who had blown over 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.789
 in stronger before tomorrow night in 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.170
 revenge in the south 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.910
 improvement with a simple sky 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.399
 veiled in the Mediterranean regions 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.439
 the temperatures the sweetness to us 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.119
 regards and so from tomorrow on 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.310
 will be able to say goodbye to the frosts on a 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.750
 much of the country even if tomorrow 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.820
 morning dating temperatures still 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.040
 quite low on the central massif the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.330
 center in progress burgundy redoux on 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.890
 the Atlantic coast is also 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.930
 so over a large part normandy 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.470
 with temperatures close to 10 degrees 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.030
 the afternoon 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.680
 temperatures still quite low on a 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.299
 eastern part of the northeastern 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.470
 country but already we will approach the 20 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.830
 degrees in the Mediterranean on the coast 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.560
