00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.810 
thoughts on it why is it happening now
and<00:00:18.380> pretty<00:00:18.859> much<00:00:19.010> the<00:00:19.190> state<00:00:19.340> of<00:00:19.369> boxing<00:00:19.730> at

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
and pretty much the state of boxing at

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.089 
and pretty much the state of boxing at
the<00:00:19.910> moment<00:00:20.179> why<00:00:20.929> thinks<00:00:21.140> it<00:00:21.199> exciting<00:00:21.919> time

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
the moment why thinks it exciting time

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:23.919 
the moment why thinks it exciting time
for<00:00:22.130> boxing<00:00:22.699> and<00:00:23.210> that's<00:00:23.419> probably<00:00:23.749> one<00:00:23.900> of

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:23.929 
for boxing and that's probably one of

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:25.179 
for boxing and that's probably one of
the<00:00:24.050> reasons<00:00:24.080> it's<00:00:24.439> happening<00:00:24.740> now<00:00:24.859> I<00:00:25.009> mean

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
the reasons it's happening now I mean

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.529 
the reasons it's happening now I mean
there's<00:00:25.369> so<00:00:25.550> much<00:00:25.669> going<00:00:25.849> on<00:00:26.029> in<00:00:26.179> the<00:00:26.240> sport

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
there's so much going on in the sport

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:27.999 
there's so much going on in the sport
and<00:00:26.689> we<00:00:26.869> needed<00:00:27.109> our<00:00:27.169> super<00:00:27.470> bowl<00:00:27.589> we<00:00:27.800> needed

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
and we needed our super bowl we needed

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.769 
and we needed our super bowl we needed
our<00:00:28.070> world<00:00:28.310> cup<00:00:28.429> and<00:00:28.669> that's<00:00:29.210> what<00:00:29.419> it<00:00:29.509> is<00:00:29.630> and

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
our world cup and that's what it is and

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:30.970 
our world cup and that's what it is and
I<00:00:29.810> think<00:00:30.050> this<00:00:30.109> was<00:00:30.289> the<00:00:30.409> right<00:00:30.560> time<00:00:30.710> for

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
I think this was the right time for

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.890 
I think this was the right time for
everyone<00:00:31.279> involved<00:00:31.519> you<00:00:32.180> know<00:00:32.270> HP<00:00:32.570> I<00:00:32.630> wanted

and i think i've got almost two months
to<00:01:15.829> go<00:01:15.950> i<00:01:15.979> think<00:01:16.280> that<00:01:16.399> by<00:01:16.579> the<00:01:16.640> time<00:01:16.850> this<00:01:16.999> goes

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
to go i think that by the time this goes

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.219 
to go i think that by the time this goes
down<00:01:17.329> it's<00:01:17.509> going<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:17.659> be<00:01:17.749> the<00:01:17.840> biggest<00:01:18.020> fight

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
in history by far by far and and i think

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.809

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
and i think that it's a really

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.560 
and i think that it's a really
fascinating<00:02:56.810> interesting<00:02:57.650> time<00:02:57.830> for<00:02:57.860> boxing

dibella<00:03:01.400> who<00:03:01.820> wins<00:03:02.030> this<00:03:02.209> fight<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:03.160> mean<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.370> I

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
dibella who wins this fight I mean it I

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.009 
dibella who wins this fight I mean it I
think<00:03:04.880> Floyd<00:03:05.090> wins<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:05.390> fight<00:03:05.570> I<00:03:05.720> mean<00:03:05.900> it's

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
think Floyd wins the fight I mean it's

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.479 
think Floyd wins the fight I mean it's
hard<00:03:06.110> I<00:03:06.290> can't<00:03:06.680> pick<00:03:06.830> up<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.070> I<00:03:07.100> haven't

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
hard I can't pick up and I haven't

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.850 
hard I can't pick up and I haven't
picked<00:03:07.610> against<00:03:07.880> floyd<00:03:08.090> in<00:03:08.470> many<00:03:09.470> many<00:03:09.620> many

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
picked against floyd in many many many

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.550 
picked against floyd in many many many
years<00:03:10.100> i'm<00:03:10.310> not<00:03:10.400> going<00:03:10.519> to<00:03:10.580> start<00:03:10.790> now<00:03:10.900> i<00:03:11.900> think

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
years i'm not going to start now i think

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.490 
years i'm not going to start now i think
that<00:03:12.709> if<00:03:12.830> Floyd<00:03:13.100> engages<00:03:14.000> many<00:03:14.600> more<00:03:14.870> if<00:03:15.050> it

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
that if Floyd engages many more if it

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.720 
that if Floyd engages many more if it
becomes<00:03:15.769> more<00:03:16.070> of<00:03:16.160> a<00:03:16.190> fight<00:03:16.370> in<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.519> middle<00:03:16.700> of

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
becomes more of a fight in the middle of

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.190 
becomes more of a fight in the middle of
the<00:03:16.850> ring<00:03:17.000> then<00:03:17.690> it<00:03:17.870> could<00:03:17.989> be<00:03:18.080> more

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
the ring then it could be more

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.650 
the ring then it could be more
interesting<00:03:18.709> than<00:03:18.890> then<00:03:19.820> I<00:03:19.850> would<00:03:20.150> think<00:03:20.330> like

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
interesting than then I would think like

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.289 
interesting than then I would think like
you<00:03:21.650> know<00:03:21.739> if<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.430> more<00:03:22.579> Floyd<00:03:22.850> trades<00:03:23.150> with

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
you know if the more Floyd trades with

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.220 
you know if the more Floyd trades with
Mandy<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.630> more<00:03:23.750> interesting<00:03:24.079> it<00:03:24.170> becomes

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
Mandy the more interesting it becomes

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.710 
Mandy the more interesting it becomes
but<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:24.890> think<00:03:25.400> Floyd<00:03:25.670> speed<00:03:26.120> and<00:03:26.360> boxing

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
but I think Floyd speed and boxing

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.210 
but I think Floyd speed and boxing
ability<00:03:26.810> angles<00:03:27.590> whatever<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:27.950> think<00:03:28.070> it's<00:03:28.160> be

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
ability angles whatever I think it's be

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.130 
ability angles whatever I think it's be
very<00:03:28.400> very<00:03:28.670> hard<00:03:28.940> for<00:03:29.120> Manny<00:03:29.299> to<00:03:29.780> overcome

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
very very hard for Manny to overcome

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.479 
very very hard for Manny to overcome
that<00:03:30.260> but<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:30.709> think<00:03:30.799> it's<00:03:31.070> a<00:03:31.130> great<00:03:31.250> matchup

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
that but I think it's a great matchup

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.970 
that but I think it's a great matchup
and<00:03:31.850> look<00:03:31.970> it's<00:03:32.150> it's<00:03:32.360> it's<00:03:32.930> it's<00:03:33.260> v<00:03:33.530> matchup

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
and look it's it's it's it's v matchup

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.009 
and look it's it's it's it's v matchup
it's<00:03:34.400> v<00:03:34.700> it's<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.090> biggest<00:03:35.420> thing<00:03:35.630> we<00:03:35.870> could

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
it's v it's the biggest thing we could

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.020 
it's v it's the biggest thing we could
do<00:03:36.230> in<00:03:36.440> our<00:03:36.769> sport<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:37.160> it's<00:03:37.579> been<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.790> long

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
do in our sport and it's been a long

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.090 
do in our sport and it's been a long
time<00:03:38.329> since<00:03:38.660> we've<00:03:39.230> done<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:39.590> biggest<00:03:39.920> thing

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
time since we've done the biggest thing

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.770 
time since we've done the biggest thing
we<00:03:40.280> could<00:03:40.430> do<00:03:40.579> for<00:03:40.610> our<00:03:40.880> sport<00:03:41.120> so<00:03:41.630> I<00:03:41.660> think

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
we could do for our sport so I think

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.030 
we could do for our sport so I think
that<00:03:41.989> this<00:03:42.200> is<00:03:42.260> going<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.650> be<00:03:42.739> a<00:03:42.769> great<00:03:43.010> night

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
that this is going to be a great night

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.039 
that this is going to be a great night
May<00:03:43.430> second<00:03:43.820> for<00:03:43.910> boxing<00:03:44.299> and<00:03:44.450> a<00:03:44.780> great<00:03:45.019> night

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
this whole period leading up to it and

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.850 
this whole period leading up to it and
particularly<00:03:48.079> with<00:03:48.200> all<00:03:48.350> the<00:03:48.500> boxing<00:03:48.799> that's

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
particularly with all the boxing that's

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.949 
particularly with all the boxing that's
