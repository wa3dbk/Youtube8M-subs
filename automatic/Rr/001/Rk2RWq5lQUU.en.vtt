00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 I greet you my lie 

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.040
 sports friends i am simon beyer muscle 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.859
 make it with the biceps cologne it comes 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.389
 on the muscle really under 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.889
 to get tension 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.139
 I have often told you something about the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.340
 phases of movement tells of it I want 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.780
 do not tell again 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.400
 I do not want you any more now 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.109
 with the lever laws of physics 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.850
 teaching to the eighth or ninth 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.920
 great boring but the whole 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.449
 Now you can get in practice 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.430
 So imitate it yourself and could 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.960
 I am experiencing you now in this 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.070
 video signs also on your own 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.689
 feel the body 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.450
 you've got to just think about the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.250
 biceps cologne at what time in 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.800
 which position is yours? 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.200
 arm musculature in which form below 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.030
 So how much do they stand to the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.649
 respective motion pumps so if 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.870
 we just stop it, so to speak 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.100
 under tension and that's exactly what I'm going to do 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.440
 Just show you now 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.760
 I 've got him so much weight there 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.530
 I still talk in any case it 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.500
 can I go now in the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.780
 starting position in the mine upper arm 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.820
 not fully stretched is so completely 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.379
 important now we enforced that 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.489
 I would not have any more tension here 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.719
 on the muscle, I could synonymous right 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.180
 nice to lose the tension 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.750
 this is the starting position firmer 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.420
 resorted to 95 percent just straightened 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.040
 tension is so on the muscle but 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.290
 not much pulls the weight 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.210
 downstairs I have no problems with this 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.970
 I hold the trade too 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.350
 very close to the body so now we go 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.610
 us with him in the target position ever 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.680
 after how high you want to go is 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.060
 that here the target position again 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.180
 relatively similar to the dumbbell bar 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.650
 is close to the body so now 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.810
 Let's take the whole movement phase 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.939
 through here I will be the tension 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.159
 more more more more more 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.659
 here the maximum voltage is reached 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.840
 in her area she takes again 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.140
 slowly and up here she is again 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.640
 near zero point in the rear 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.070
 movement in the eccentric again exactly 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.869
 the same voltage extremely high extreme 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.090
 high extremely high and now it takes 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.520
 slow down again and we are 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.150
 here again in the starting situation like that 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.120
 the whole 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.610
 again in clear text in the 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.050
 starting situation is the dumbbell bar 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.110
 close to the body 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.009
 the lever is a very cheap one 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.740
 accordingly, the tension is on the 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.990
 musculature a very low in the course 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.700
 the movement takes the tension to her 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.280
 leads the dumbbell bar straight at one 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.680
 Classic cologne from the body in a form 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.810
 the lynx elliptical for the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.340
 rod away from the body , it still looks 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.950
 a bit different but the tension 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.860
 Takes it up here again in 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.530
 the target position is near the zero point 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.930
 the whole thing means in plain text at the beginning 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.580
 And in the end , I have no particular 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.130
 great tension on the muscles 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.410
 the whole movement sweg brings you 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.330
 not as much as the maximum 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.220
 voltage range so there is one 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.620
 area even if it is rather unpleasant 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.380
 but exactly in this area is the 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.090
 biceps maximum under tension and exactly 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.010
 in this area finds the 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.440
 Muscle building start exactly in this 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.000
 you have to go into the area even if it is 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.530
 painful there is of course 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.390
 some instruments i have now 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.700
 recently presented these clubs 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.310
 I also like to drink extremely well 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.810
 with biceps volumes from my sight that 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.030
 best what you do for the biceps 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.640
 can something like that support something 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.860
 are intensification techniques to easy 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.180
 again one to put on it but 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.380
 Basically, you should 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.090
 every case also pay attention 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.940
 those the areas small upper arm 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.130
 have your tension in the muscle 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.810
 Run the movement changed and that it 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.000
 it depends on the maximum 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.830
 also exploit voltage range and 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.360
 not to skip that 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.610
 All right, I hope I can 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.050
 could help thicker biceps is 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.300
 no coincidence see you next 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.300
 video many greetings emma
