next<00:03:26.700> week<00:03:26.909> to<00:03:27.090> finally<00:03:27.390> dig<00:03:27.659> it<00:03:27.750> get<00:03:27.959> his

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
next week to finally dig it get his

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.300 
next week to finally dig it get his
final<00:03:28.290> approval<00:03:28.799> so<00:03:28.950> we<00:03:29.040> could<00:03:29.159> actually

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
final approval so we could actually

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.910 
final approval so we could actually
start<00:03:29.640> making<00:03:29.940> them<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.239> mouse<00:03:30.480> so<00:03:30.780> yeah<00:03:31.680> I

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
think it was started with the prime team

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.210

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
level actually just starting from the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.170 
level actually just starting from the
base<00:03:38.849> just<00:03:39.540> 3d<00:03:40.080> designs<00:03:40.440> 3d<00:03:41.010> models<00:03:41.370> let's<00:03:42.030> get

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
base just 3d designs 3d models let's get

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.910 
base just 3d designs 3d models let's get
to<00:03:42.330> the<00:03:42.599> really<00:03:42.810> bare<00:03:42.989> bones<00:03:43.200> stuff<00:03:43.470> before<00:03:43.830> we
