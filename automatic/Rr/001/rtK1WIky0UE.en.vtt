would<00:01:55.030> just<00:01:55.420> put<00:01:55.630> all<00:01:55.810> of<00:01:55.840> it<00:01:56.080> into<00:01:56.260> the

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
would just put all of it into the

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.830 
would just put all of it into the
transfer<00:01:56.890> into<00:01:57.160> a<00:01:57.190> Z<00:01:57.490> account<00:01:57.850> as<00:01:58.060> you<00:01:58.600> can<00:01:58.720> see

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
transfer into a Z account as you can see

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.020 
transfer into a Z account as you can see
that's<00:01:59.050> what<00:01:59.200> I<00:01:59.260> just<00:01:59.320> did<00:01:59.650> and<00:02:00.460> then<00:02:00.760> pull<00:02:01.000> out

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
that's what I just did and then pull out

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.640 
that's what I just did and then pull out
your<00:02:01.240> time<00:02:01.420> bomb<00:02:01.660> and<00:02:01.900> hit<00:02:02.080> your<00:02:02.230> time<00:02:02.410> bomb

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.560 
your time bomb and hit your time bomb
now<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:02.890> logic<00:02:03.310> behind<00:02:03.430> this<00:02:03.730> is<00:02:03.970> when<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:04.420> go

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
now the logic behind this is when you go

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.060 
now the logic behind this is when you go
back<00:02:04.600> in<00:02:04.990> time<00:02:05.200> you're<00:02:05.380> going<00:02:05.560> to<00:02:05.650> travel<00:02:05.950> back

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
back in time you're going to travel back

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.339 
back in time you're going to travel back
in<00:02:06.460> time<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.330> point<00:02:07.540> when<00:02:07.780> you<00:02:07.930> had<00:02:08.110> money

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
in time to the point when you had money

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.069 
in time to the point when you had money
in<00:02:08.619> your<00:02:08.709> pocket<00:02:09.129> as<00:02:09.789> you<00:02:10.479> can<00:02:10.599> see<00:02:10.750> I<00:02:10.780> have<00:02:11.049> a

account<00:02:55.100> now<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.370> logic<00:02:55.700> behind<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.300> is<00:02:56.450> when

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
account now the logic behind it is when

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.870 
account now the logic behind it is when
you<00:02:56.840> travel<00:02:57.080> back<00:02:57.500> in<00:02:57.739> time<00:02:57.770> you're<00:02:58.700> going<00:02:58.820> to

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
you travel back in time you're going to

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.610 
you travel back in time you're going to
