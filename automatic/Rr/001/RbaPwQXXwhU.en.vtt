00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.630
 A) Yes 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.470
 hello friends welcome to a new video 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.060
 of the tuna channel this time 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.770
 we make this video to show you the 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.680
 range of rectangular awnings of the house 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.390
 direct we have arranged the awnings on 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.970
 a mother line so you can compare 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.620
 the sizes of each one and make a 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.420
 idea of ​​what it would serve according to the 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.910
 manufacturer's specifications we are going to 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.350
 draw another one within the range of awnings 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.600
 rectangular that the brand offers us 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.870
 we draw we find these three models 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.309
 the first and largest with the size xl 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.320
 It would be the one that measures four and a half meters 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.900
 for three with a weight of one thousand twenty 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.210
 grams in our backpack offers us 16 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.220
 perimeter anchor points and 3 in the 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.870
 Top is the awning that the brand 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.130
 advises us for a long olive grove 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.470
 duration is to say when we have to 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.330
 be several days and we want to have 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.310
 a skillful space within 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.650
 comfortable enough to be 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.690
 well the one that would continue would be the size m 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.330
 an awning is three meters and a half 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.380
 long by two meters 40 wide you can 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.110
 see the difference in size 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.820
 here it looks perfectly the same 16 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.700
 exterior anchor points and 3 for the 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.530
 top part with a total weight of 740 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.110
 grams this everything would be adequate by 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.030
 example to cover our hammock 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.950
 live with our brand would be enough 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.380
 as to cover it perfectly and 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.750
 remind us of a rain we can see 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.790
 like all the tapes in the points of 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.770
 anchorage are very well cooked and 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.420
 topped with reinforcements in the part 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.760
 inside so as not to damage the awning when 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.520
 we exercise strength in the finishes are 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.680
 very well and finally we have the 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.900
 tiny one lathe two meters 80 by 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.170
 meter 50 the same 16 anchor points 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.250
 the top three with a weight of 430 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.950
 grams in our backpack 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.450
 the manufacturer advises us would not be 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.209
 the most suitable to cover a hammock 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.090
 but for a proper ground bivouac 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:16.300
 once seen this we know the range of 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.010
 rectangular awnings we direct here 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.510

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.820
 reference for you to do a good 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.240
 idea of ​​the size of the three 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.750
 awning models 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.550
 and nothing else is everything when I what 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.800
