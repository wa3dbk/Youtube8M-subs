00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:26.699
 hi i'm felipe let's go and look 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:32.199
 together with a quality tour here we are 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:35.469
 to start the tour, let's be this 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:38.460
 here the Arezzo of the box where you get to one 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:42.790
 very very fast curve then in full 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.710
 nice to do here we come here to one 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.589
 slow part of the circuit a break 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:51.339
 in second gear right then another 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:53.519
 braking for a curve to the left must 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.869
 find all their output equal 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:01:01.119
 traction where a curve gets a lot 

00:00:55.869 --> 00:01:04.530
 fast here we go to get one here 

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:08.159
 some Greek part of the circuit that 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.670
 which is a very difficult third curve 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.310
 march and here also another curve 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.650
 where there is always important understeer 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.850
 use as much is entered but also the output 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.800
 for the attraction we arrive here at 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.979
 old straight of the boxes where there is 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.270
 also a very very fast curve here 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.119
 just moles and tones in 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.640
 in the acceleration here also one of the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.070
 most beautiful parts of the curve circuit 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.649
 very very fast right now 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.009
 own direction is a downward march 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:45.020
 now another change of direction where it is 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:48.390
 arrives straight behind that 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.700
 important because you can cool a 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.649
 little the tires that always arrives now the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.569
 faster call as fi longer have the 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.990
 understeer and also beautiful 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.119
 then he arrives at the braking for the last one 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.150
 part of the circuit 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:08.830
 but yes that in slow where also the 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.080
 how important to have one 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.910
 good traction defines the turn of 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.260
 silverstone which is a track that I like 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.260
 much to drive
