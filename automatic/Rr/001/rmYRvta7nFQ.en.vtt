00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.369 
little things but uh they use about the
same<00:00:49.829> style<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.910> size<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.989> trio's<00:00:52.350> and

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
same style and size on the trio's and

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.200 
same style and size on the trio's and
people<00:00:52.890> seem<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.129> get<00:00:53.370> along<00:00:53.489> with<00:00:53.760> them<00:00:53.940> but

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
but it could use like a rubberized

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.600 
but it could use like a rubberized
texture<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.380> would<00:01:58.590> help<00:01:58.770> but<00:01:59.250> you

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610
