a sort of a low frequency Rumble coming
out<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.260> thing<00:00:22.519> I<00:00:23.519> installed<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.449> myself

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
out of the thing I installed this myself

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.960 
out of the thing I installed this myself
everything<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.949> hooked<00:00:26.160> up<00:00:26.369> according<00:00:26.939> to

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
everything is hooked up according to

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.320 
everything is hooked up according to
code<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.689> cartoon<00:00:28.199> Navion<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.760> mounted

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
code and the cartoon Navion it's mounted

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.299 
code and the cartoon Navion it's mounted
on<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.539> piece<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.500> wood<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.450> wish<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.600> would<00:00:33.840> have

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
on a piece of wood I wish I would have

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.130 
on a piece of wood I wish I would have
added<00:00:35.309> some<00:00:35.579> shock<00:00:35.940> mounts<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.870> didn't

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
added some shock mounts but it didn't

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.549 
added some shock mounts but it didn't
say<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.559> any<00:00:37.770> place<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> directions<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
say that any place in the directions and

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.770 
say that any place in the directions and
now<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:40.829> very<00:00:41.190> difficult<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:42.149> pry<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.629> away

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
now it's very difficult to pry it away

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.819 
now it's very difficult to pry it away
from<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.320> wall<00:00:43.730> since<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:45.539> all<00:00:45.719> plumped<00:00:46.140> now

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
from the wall since it's all plumped now

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.979 
from the wall since it's all plumped now
what<00:00:47.039> I'm<00:00:47.129> going<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.370> do<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.879> turn<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
what I'm going to do is turn on the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.389 
what I'm going to do is turn on the
water<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> kitchen<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:51.559> see<00:00:52.559> how<00:00:53.160> this

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
water in the kitchen and see how this

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.580 
water in the kitchen and see how this
thing<00:00:53.600> responds<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.809> when<00:00:55.020> there's<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.260> call

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
thing responds so when there's a call

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:17.160 
thing responds so when there's a call
for<00:00:55.800> heat

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:25.330 

just<00:01:17.680> came<00:01:17.979> on<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.549> world

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:37.000 

rumbles<00:01:26.240> through<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.630> whole<00:01:26.810> house

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.670 

none<00:01:37.580> of<00:01:37.760> the<00:01:38.030> cameras<00:01:38.660> picking<00:01:38.990> up<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:39.500> low

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
none of the cameras picking up the low

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.750 
none of the cameras picking up the low
frequency<00:01:40.370> noise<00:01:40.610> or<00:01:40.940> not<00:01:41.120> but<00:01:41.480> it's<00:01:41.690> so<00:01:41.960> very

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
frequency noise or not but it's so very

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.420 
frequency noise or not but it's so very
objectionable<00:01:43.760> and<00:01:44.600> I<00:01:45.200> can<00:01:45.710> hear<00:01:45.860> it<00:01:45.920> every

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
objectionable and I can hear it every

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.100 
objectionable and I can hear it every
place<00:01:46.670> in<00:01:46.910> the<00:01:47.000> house<00:01:47.150> when<00:01:47.420> it<00:01:47.480> comes<00:01:47.720> on<00:01:47.900> no

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
place in the house when it comes on no

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.380 
place in the house when it comes on no
matter<00:01:48.290> where<00:01:48.590> I<00:01:48.620> go<00:01:48.860> in<00:01:49.760> here<00:01:50.000> through<00:01:50.300> the

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
matter where I go in here through the

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.440 
matter where I go in here through the
walls<00:01:51.520> because<00:01:52.520> of<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:52.910> way<00:01:53.060> it's<00:01:53.240> mounted

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
walls because of the way it's mounted

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.420 
walls because of the way it's mounted
and<00:01:54.350> I<00:01:54.560> think<00:01:54.920> they<00:01:55.040> should<00:01:55.720> shockmount<00:01:56.720> the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
and I think they should shockmount the

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.670 
and I think they should shockmount the
internal<00:01:58.430> unit<00:01:58.760> inside<00:01:59.120> the<00:01:59.180> cabinet<00:01:59.900> with

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
internal unit inside the cabinet with

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.640 
internal unit inside the cabinet with
with<00:02:01.040> rubber<00:02:01.340> grommets<00:02:02.000> to<00:02:02.350> isolate<00:02:03.350> it<00:02:03.500> from

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
with rubber grommets to isolate it from

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.870 
with rubber grommets to isolate it from
the<00:02:03.830> house<00:02:04.420> maybe<00:02:05.590> tune<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.830> fan<00:02:07.100> down<00:02:07.370> just<00:02:07.760> a

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
the house maybe tune the fan down just a

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.800 
the house maybe tune the fan down just a
little<00:02:07.910> bit<00:02:08.180> I<00:02:08.540> just<00:02:09.140> had<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:10.360> entire<00:02:11.360> gas

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
little bit I just had the entire gas

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.900 
little bit I just had the entire gas
line<00:02:12.230> replaced<00:02:12.800> from<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.190> street<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.790> the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
line replaced from the street to the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.250 
line replaced from the street to the
house<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.450> new<00:02:15.020> commercial<00:02:15.410> meter<00:02:17.020> one<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.170> a

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
house a new commercial meter one and a

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.070 
house a new commercial meter one and a
half<00:02:18.500> inch<00:02:18.800> all<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.220> way<00:02:19.370> in<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:20.210> so<00:02:20.780> I've<00:02:20.840> got

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
half inch all the way in and so I've got

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.970 
half inch all the way in and so I've got
money<00:02:21.380> of<00:02:21.910> volume<00:02:22.910> I've<00:02:23.180> got<00:02:23.390> one<00:02:23.690> inch<00:02:23.980> which

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
money of volume I've got one inch which

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.580 
money of volume I've got one inch which
runs<00:02:25.310> about<00:02:25.520> 20<00:02:26.150> feet<00:02:26.360> from<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.810> meter<00:02:27.050> to<00:02:27.560> the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
runs about 20 feet from the meter to the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.800 
runs about 20 feet from the meter to the
unit<00:02:28.130> on<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.550> wall<00:02:28.760> it's<00:02:29.030> not<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.540> first

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
unit on the wall it's not on the first

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.690 
unit on the wall it's not on the first
floor<00:02:30.050> I'm<00:02:30.350> going<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.620> turn<00:02:31.190> off<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.580> hot

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
floor I'm going to turn off the hot

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.850 
floor I'm going to turn off the hot
water<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.390> see<00:02:32.720> what<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.050> does<00:02:33.200> when<00:02:33.260> it<00:02:33.500> ramps

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
water and see what it does when it ramps

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:49.900 
water and see what it does when it ramps
down

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.630 

water<00:02:50.480> shut-off

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:10.910 

so<00:02:57.640> making<00:02:57.969> lots<00:02:58.269> of<00:02:58.480> noise

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.380 

now<00:03:11.920> this<00:03:12.129> would<00:03:12.310> be<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.459> great<00:03:12.640> unit<00:03:13.090> if<00:03:13.209> it

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
now this would be a great unit if it

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.899 
now this would be a great unit if it
were<00:03:13.540> quieter<00:03:14.079> and<00:03:14.409> you<00:03:14.799> made<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.159> last<00:03:15.370> burst

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
were quieter and you made the last burst

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.910 
were quieter and you made the last burst
and<00:03:16.329> I<00:03:16.480> haven't<00:03:16.810> even<00:03:16.959> turned<00:03:17.260> on<00:03:17.530> any<00:03:17.739> of<00:03:17.829> the
