00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
that was really interesting because a

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.890 
that was really interesting because a

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
gun-free zones and they're not something

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:38.990 
gun-free zones and they're not something
that<00:03:37.830> I<00:03:37.890> thought<00:03:38.070> was<00:03:38.250> interesting<00:03:38.400> as<00:03:38.850> well

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000
