guess we're gonna have to give them the

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:45.640 
guess we're gonna have to give them the
recipe<00:04:43.610> here's<00:04:44.610> a<00:04:44.669> list<00:04:44.910> of<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.150> ingredients

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
recipe here's a list of the ingredients

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.440 
recipe here's a list of the ingredients
we<00:04:46.650> actually<00:04:47.190> made<00:04:47.370> our<00:04:47.490> own<00:04:47.520> garbanzo<00:04:48.419> flour

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
we actually made our own garbanzo flour

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.159 
we actually made our own garbanzo flour
by<00:04:49.260> taking<00:04:49.680> dry<00:04:49.950> garbanzo<00:04:50.639> beans<00:04:50.940> and<00:04:51.240> putting

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
by taking dry garbanzo beans and putting

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.200 
by taking dry garbanzo beans and putting
them<00:04:52.290> in<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.530> nutribullet<00:04:52.950> with<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.700> milling

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
them in the nutribullet with the milling

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.500 
them in the nutribullet with the milling
attachment<00:04:54.840> if<00:04:55.320> you<00:04:55.530> have<00:04:55.680> a<00:04:55.710> nutribullet

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
attachment if you have a nutribullet

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.730 
attachment if you have a nutribullet
that's<00:04:57.510> the<00:04:57.750> best<00:04:57.960> way<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.169> make<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.500> flour

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
that's the best way to make the flour

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.000 
that's the best way to make the flour
because<00:04:59.010> it's<00:04:59.160> probably<00:04:59.610> a<00:04:59.639> lot<00:04:59.880> cheaper<00:05:01.010> also

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
because it's probably a lot cheaper also

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:08.760 
because it's probably a lot cheaper also
we<00:05:02.370> is<00:05:02.930> 3/4<00:05:03.979> cup<00:05:04.979> of<00:05:05.010> peas

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.000 

and<00:05:08.890> here's<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:09.700> directions<00:05:09.940> just<00:05:10.740> hit<00:05:11.740> pause

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
and here's the directions just hit pause
