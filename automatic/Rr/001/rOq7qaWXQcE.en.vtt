00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.930
 Hello everyone, my name is noemi oristano e 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.860
 now today I will show you all mine 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.050
 cover that I have then the first one that I have 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.080
 bought was this black in plastic 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.369
 it's not a classic I wanted to say in how it is 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.039
 He says 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.419
 let's say siliconata goes however it was made 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.239
 with another substance that I now do not 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:26.359
 I'm remembering if I remember it I did 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:33.650
 I say the second one I bought is 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:35.420
 been this here in hard plastic style 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.010
 very autumnal as supporting them 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.840
 I'm leaving this winter 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.720
 sail covers we always put all the 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.890
 genres are black I'm putting so more 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.350
 used to other things that are a lot 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.560
 more beautiful, in short, I hope you too 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.720
 if you complete a cover type 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.280
 the next day bought a very cover 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.950
 more beautiful view than missed 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.170
 you bought before various normal 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.030
 this goes p 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.750
 then the third cover who says that I am 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.149
 bought used this hard hard plastic 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.819
 but so publishing does not protect for 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:12.619
 no cell phone 

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:14.719
 this one is on mary phones instead 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:22.280
 to be fuchs this fuchs cover e 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:26.060
 neon appears purple type if yes 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.729
 he had a white cell phone here 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:34.670
 appeared he was xuxian and we say his 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:39.409
 natural color but even more neon and 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:43.340
 as highlighted kidney olive then the part 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.499
 that I bought this very well e 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.619
 very elegant and I must say that since 

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:53.179
 were bought that some 2008 po 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:54.289
 more three examples I don't know I must say 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.450
 that not a single one has been raised 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:01.390
 glitter from how you see even one 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:04.370
 very beautiful diamond 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.290
 it completes this water of the Chinese oh well 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.630
 then when I contrade the price I will 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:13.490
 I say to the last, however, very beautiful 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:16.760
 elegant inside is a side mirror 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.770
 and so it does not even cover this here 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.330
 above and even solved things 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.920
 sides 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:28.810
 however then we say that the fifth cover 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:34.840
 it's not even a cover or cell phone holder 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:38.450
 This very pretty here or contrata 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:45.290
