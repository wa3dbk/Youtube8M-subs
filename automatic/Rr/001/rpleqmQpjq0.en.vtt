00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.630
 it's been more business at both ends 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.099

 it can not be a little butter either 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.720
 because if it takes butter it takes 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.600

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.650
 meanwhile here in a little bag a 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.650
 little bit wider 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.740
 This is good 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.740
 let's put them alone to bake 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.660
 the cocoa 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.320

 to thread shape 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.340
 so that it continues to hold consistency and 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.340
