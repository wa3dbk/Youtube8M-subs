00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
piece that kind of looks like the front

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.410 
piece that kind of looks like the front
piece<00:00:59.390> but<00:00:59.899> is<00:01:00.320> just<00:01:01.220> one<00:01:01.399> piece<00:01:01.579> and<00:01:01.820> has<00:01:02.180> a

straight<00:01:03.350> lining<00:01:03.590> like<00:01:03.829> this<00:01:04.040> instead<00:01:04.250> of

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
straight lining like this instead of

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.910 
straight lining like this instead of
going<00:01:04.580> up<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.960> sleeves<00:01:06.200> look<00:01:06.409> really<00:01:06.710> weird

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
measurements and stuff in a second and

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.910 
measurements and stuff in a second and
also<00:01:10.640> we're<00:01:10.760> gonna<00:01:10.820> need<00:01:11.060> some<00:01:11.210> ribbon<00:01:11.920> before

also we're gonna need some ribbon before
I<00:01:12.979> take<00:01:13.130> my<00:01:13.159> measurements<00:01:13.550> I<00:01:13.880> am<00:01:14.380> looking<00:01:15.380> at

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
I take my measurements I am looking at

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.530 
I take my measurements I am looking at
the<00:01:15.620> measurements<00:01:16.340> from<00:01:16.729> another<00:01:17.120> bolero

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
the measurements from another bolero

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.270 
the measurements from another bolero
that<00:01:17.810> I<00:01:17.840> have<00:01:18.020> this<00:01:18.229> is<00:01:18.380> one<00:01:18.530> that's<00:01:18.710> from<00:01:18.860> H&amp;M

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
that I have this is one that's from H&amp;M

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.180 
that I have this is one that's from H&amp;M
you<00:01:20.000> can<00:01:20.180> use<00:01:20.360> any<00:01:20.659> kind<00:01:20.930> of<00:01:21.110> a<00:01:21.409> sweater<00:01:21.860> or

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
you can use any kind of a sweater or

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.310 
you can use any kind of a sweater or
t-shirt<00:01:22.610> t-shirt<00:01:23.150> that<00:01:23.540> really<00:01:23.810> fits<00:01:24.049> you

t-shirt t-shirt that really fits you

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.649 
t-shirt t-shirt that really fits you
basically<00:01:24.710> we<00:01:24.979> just<00:01:25.159> want<00:01:25.340> to<00:01:25.400> make<00:01:25.549> sure<00:01:25.659> that

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
basically we just want to make sure that

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.830 
basically we just want to make sure that
we<00:01:26.750> get<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.140> right<00:01:27.760> measurements<00:01:28.760> so<00:01:29.720> the

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
we get the right measurements so the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.460 
we get the right measurements so the
measurements<00:01:30.290> that<00:01:30.409> we're<00:01:30.530> gonna<00:01:30.710> need<00:01:30.979> are

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
measurements that we're gonna need are

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.899 
measurements that we're gonna need are
shoulder<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:34.850> shoulder<00:01:35.229> meaning<00:01:36.229> where<00:01:36.909> the

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
shoulder to shoulder meaning where the

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.990 
shoulder to shoulder meaning where the
puff<00:01:38.150> starts<00:01:38.780> add<00:01:39.170> four<00:01:40.130> centimeters<00:01:40.640> to<00:01:40.820> that

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
puff starts add four centimeters to that

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.280 
puff starts add four centimeters to that
entire<00:01:41.540> measurement<00:01:42.260> then<00:01:43.189> you<00:01:43.400> need<00:01:43.580> to<00:01:43.729> know

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
entire measurement then you need to know

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.260 
entire measurement then you need to know
this<00:01:45.290> measurement<00:01:45.920> right<00:01:46.070> here<00:01:46.520> which<00:01:47.090> will

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
this measurement right here which will

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.090 
this measurement right here which will
also<00:01:47.479> determine<00:01:47.720> these<00:01:49.330> measurements<00:01:51.100> you

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
also determine these measurements you

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.289 
also determine these measurements you
need<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.520> know<00:01:52.760> this<00:01:53.390> measurement<00:01:54.290> right<00:01:54.740> here

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
need to know this measurement right here

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.260 
need to know this measurement right here
which<00:01:56.299> means<00:01:56.600> that<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:56.900> need<00:01:57.080> to<00:01:57.259> know<00:01:57.439> the

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
which means that you need to know the

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.960 
which means that you need to know the
girth<00:01:59.270> I<00:01:59.630> guess<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.380> your<00:02:01.040> arm<00:02:01.280> like<00:02:01.790> where

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
girth I guess of your arm like where

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.910 
girth I guess of your arm like where
it's<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.299> thickest<00:02:03.759> and<00:02:04.759> we<00:02:05.630> need<00:02:05.920> this

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
it's the thickest and we need this

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.039 
it's the thickest and we need this
doesn't<00:02:07.549> really<00:02:07.729> need<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.090> measurements<00:02:08.719> just

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
doesn't really need a measurements just

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.239 
doesn't really need a measurements just
add<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.229> couple<00:02:09.409> of<00:02:09.529> centimeters<00:02:09.799> here

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:10.249 
add a couple of centimeters here

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:11.750 
add a couple of centimeters here
depending<00:02:10.579> on<00:02:10.700> how<00:02:10.849> low<00:02:11.060> Dom<00:02:11.269> you<00:02:11.389> want<00:02:11.599> it

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
depending on how low Dom you want it

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.229 
depending on how low Dom you want it
to<00:02:11.849> go<00:02:12.000> also<00:02:12.810> you'll<00:02:13.170> need<00:02:13.379> your<00:02:13.980> waist<00:02:14.519> or<00:02:15.030> not

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
onto the main piece which means that we

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.330 
onto the main piece which means that we
have<00:05:44.919> to<00:05:45.039> flip<00:05:45.310> the<00:05:45.490> main<00:05:45.669> piece<00:05:45.909> inside<00:05:46.479> out
