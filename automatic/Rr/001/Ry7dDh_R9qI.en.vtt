okay<00:00:13.320> once<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.740> have<00:00:13.889> all<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.309> required

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
okay once you have all the required

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.180 
okay once you have all the required
stuff<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:16.170> need<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.560> get<00:00:16.710> your<00:00:16.859> soldering

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
stuff you need to get your soldering

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.609 
stuff you need to get your soldering
iron<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.699> heat<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.060> up<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.449> you're<00:00:19.380> going<00:00:19.470> to

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
iron and heat it up and you're going to

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.150 
iron and heat it up and you're going to
need<00:00:19.800> some<00:00:20.100> rosin<00:00:20.520> core<00:00:20.550> solder<00:00:21.890> or<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.010> can

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
need some rosin core solder or you can

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.220 
need some rosin core solder or you can
use<00:00:23.310> flux<00:00:23.550> coated<00:00:24.000> which<00:00:24.390> might<00:00:24.779> work<00:00:24.990> better

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
use flux coated which might work better

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.550 
use flux coated which might work better
in<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.529> case<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.070> hold<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.400> down<00:00:26.630> I<00:00:27.630> have<00:00:28.349> some

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
in this case to hold it down I have some

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.779 
in this case to hold it down I have some
right<00:00:28.710> here<00:00:28.740> but<00:00:29.010> I'm<00:00:29.099> gonna<00:00:29.220> use<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> rosin

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
right here but I'm gonna use the rosin

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.310 
right here but I'm gonna use the rosin
core<00:00:31.130> and<00:00:32.130> then<00:00:32.640> once<00:00:33.180> your<00:00:33.540> once<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.170> have

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
core and then once your once you have

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.530 
core and then once your once you have
your<00:00:34.440> motherboard<00:00:34.800> flipped<00:00:35.190> over<00:00:35.390> I'm<00:00:36.390> going

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
your motherboard flipped over I'm going

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.700 
your motherboard flipped over I'm going
to<00:00:36.600> zoom<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.960> where<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.200> need<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.440> solder

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
to zoom in to where you need to solder

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.970 
to zoom in to where you need to solder
this<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.640> near<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.180> hold<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.800> near

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
this is near the hold on this is near

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.090 
this is near the hold on this is near
the<00:00:41.010> power<00:00:41.309> plug<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.680> where<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.800> plug<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
the power plug of the where you plug the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.670 
the power plug of the where you plug the
power<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.430> for<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.640> xbox<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.260> going<00:00:46.469> to

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
power in for the xbox and it is going to

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.729 
power in for the xbox and it is going to
be<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.129> center<00:00:47.820> let<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.750> focus

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.950 

alright<00:00:55.739> also<00:00:55.980> move<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.160> out<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.309> little<00:00:56.489> there

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
alright also move it out a little there

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.209 
alright also move it out a little there
okay<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.020> as<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.379> can<00:00:58.559> see<00:00:58.739> it's<00:00:58.859> going<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.100> be

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
okay so as you can see it's going to be

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.729 
okay so as you can see it's going to be
the<00:00:59.340> center<00:00:59.730> point<00:01:00.030> right<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:01.559> is

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
the center point right here and that is

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.929 
the center point right here and that is
our<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.670> 12-volt<00:01:03.210> spot<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:05.790> we're

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
our that is a 12-volt spot so we're

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.190 
our that is a 12-volt spot so we're
going<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.210> need<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.630> solder<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.170> positive

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
going to need to solder the positive

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.200 
going to need to solder the positive
wire<00:01:08.189> for<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.580> LEDs<00:01:08.909> onto<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:11.090> you<00:01:12.090> need

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
wire for the LEDs onto that and you need

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.690 
wire for the LEDs onto that and you need
to<00:01:12.330> put<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> resistor<00:01:13.020> here<00:01:13.380> if<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.740> want<00:01:14.040> or

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
to put a resistor here if you want or

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.670 
to put a resistor here if you want or
you<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.090> put<00:01:15.240> around<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.509> negative<00:01:15.659> end<00:01:16.049> it

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
you can put around the negative end it

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.760 
you can put around the negative end it
really<00:01:16.830> doesn't<00:01:16.979> matter<00:01:17.810> or<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.049> can<00:01:19.200> wear

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
really doesn't matter or you can wear

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.070 
really doesn't matter or you can wear
them<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.040> series<00:01:21.030> instead<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.509> parallel<00:01:21.780> but

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
them in series instead of parallel but

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.170 
them in series instead of parallel but
I'm<00:01:22.170> going<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.590> doing<00:01:22.710> parallel<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:24.000> I'm

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
I'm going to be doing parallel so I'm

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.289 
I'm going to be doing parallel so I'm
going<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.390> hook<00:01:24.720> these<00:01:24.869> LEDs<00:01:25.530> up<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.939> wire

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
going to hook these LEDs up to the wire

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.590 
going to hook these LEDs up to the wire
and<00:01:27.540> then<00:01:28.470> I'll<00:01:28.619> um<00:01:29.070> I'll<00:01:29.670> come<00:01:30.270> back<00:01:30.420> when

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
and then I'll um I'll come back when

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.999 
and then I'll um I'll come back when
that's<00:01:30.750> done<00:01:32.180> okay<00:01:33.180> once<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:34.020> have<00:01:34.259> your<00:01:34.439> LEDs

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
that's done okay once you have your LEDs

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.660 
that's done okay once you have your LEDs
wired<00:01:35.280> up<00:01:36.229> we're<00:01:37.229> going<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.530> want<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.100> connect

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
wired up we're going to want to connect

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.649 
wired up we're going to want to connect
a<00:01:40.430> resistor<00:01:41.430> somewhere<00:01:41.670> along<00:01:42.090> here<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.570> I'm

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
a resistor somewhere along here and I'm

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.300 
a resistor somewhere along here and I'm
going<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.960> do<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.200> directly<00:01:43.530> onto<00:01:43.770> here

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
going to do it directly onto here

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.039 
going to do it directly onto here
you<00:01:45.000> probably<00:01:45.210> shouldn't<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:45.780> I'm<00:01:45.899> just

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
you probably shouldn't but I'm just

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.560 
you probably shouldn't but I'm just
doing<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.470> for<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.770> tutorial<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.549> it'll<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:48.540> a

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
doing this for a tutorial so it'll be a

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.440 
doing this for a tutorial so it'll be a
lot<00:01:48.780> faster<00:01:50.000> so<00:01:51.000> I'm<00:01:51.090> going<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.240> take<00:01:51.420> a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
lot faster so I'm going to take a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:59.770 
lot faster so I'm going to take a
12-volt<00:01:52.110> resistor

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.750 

and<00:01:59.930> position<00:02:00.890> it<00:02:01.010> to<00:02:01.190> where<00:02:01.340> it's<00:02:01.549> not<00:02:01.700> going

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
and position it to where it's not going

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.030 
and position it to where it's not going
to<00:02:01.940> block<00:02:02.090> any<00:02:02.360> other<00:02:02.540> points<00:02:03.020> or<00:02:03.409> touch<00:02:03.860> any

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
to block any other points or touch any

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:14.910 
to block any other points or touch any
other<00:02:04.250> points<00:02:07.660> probably<00:02:08.660> be<00:02:09.550> about<00:02:10.550> there

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.820 

yeah<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:15.900> then<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.050> just<00:02:17.080> hack<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.710> your

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
yeah and then you just hack to your

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.260 
yeah and then you just hack to your
solder<00:02:18.069> it<00:02:18.250> out<00:02:20.430> I'm<00:02:21.430> gonna<00:02:21.640> use<00:02:21.850> some<00:02:21.880> pliers

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
solder it out I'm gonna use some pliers

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.540 
solder it out I'm gonna use some pliers
because<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.900> wire<00:02:23.080> heats<00:02:23.350> up<00:02:23.590> very<00:02:23.860> fast<00:02:24.069> and

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
because the wire heats up very fast and

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.250 
because the wire heats up very fast and
you<00:02:24.730> might<00:02:24.940> you're<00:02:25.390> probably<00:02:25.690> going<00:02:25.990> to<00:02:26.140> have

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
you might you're probably going to have

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.809 
you might you're probably going to have
to<00:02:26.290> hold<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.709> down<00:02:26.830> for<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:27.190> long<00:02:27.370> period<00:02:27.760> of

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
to hold it down for a long period of

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.820 
to hold it down for a long period of
time<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:28.690> get<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:29.080> solder<00:02:29.500> on<00:02:29.800> the

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
time to get the solder on the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:46.300 
time to get the solder on the
motherboard<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.640> flow

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.809 

I<00:02:46.340> get<00:02:46.880> semester<00:02:47.390> slaughter

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:03:00.020 

it's<00:02:53.150> probably<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.569> little<00:02:53.659> too<00:02:53.810> much

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.980 

all<00:03:00.569> right<00:03:00.720> that's<00:03:00.959> good

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.660 

and<00:03:04.080> that<00:03:04.710> wire<00:03:04.860> is<00:03:05.010> going<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.190> be<00:03:05.280> really<00:03:05.520> hot

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
and that wire is going to be really hot

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.860 
and that wire is going to be really hot
so<00:03:05.880> I'm<00:03:05.940> going<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.180> leave<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.420> alone<00:03:06.480> for<00:03:06.810> a

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
so I'm going to leave it alone for a

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.460 
so I'm going to leave it alone for a
little<00:03:07.050> bit<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:11.120> I<00:03:12.120> guess<00:03:12.630> I<00:03:12.750> could<00:03:12.930> connect

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
little bit and I guess I could connect

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.670 
little bit and I guess I could connect
it<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:14.070> positive<00:03:14.370> lead<00:03:14.880> right<00:03:15.210> now<00:03:15.680> not

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
it to the positive lead right now not

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:31.740 
it to the positive lead right now not
the<00:03:16.860> led<00:03:19.190> let<00:03:20.190> me<00:03:20.280> zoom<00:03:20.490> out

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:51.530 

that'll<00:03:32.440> work

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.500 

okay<00:03:52.319> and<00:03:52.650> then<00:03:52.890> you're<00:03:53.129> going<00:03:53.310> to<00:03:53.430> solder<00:03:54.239> the

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
okay and then you're going to solder the

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.289 
okay and then you're going to solder the
negative<00:03:54.989> led<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:56.129> negative<00:03:56.519> lead<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:57.030> the

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
negative led the negative lead to the

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.369 
negative led the negative lead to the
LEDs<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:58.489> this<00:03:59.489> point<00:03:59.760> right<00:04:00.030> here<00:04:00.540> which<00:04:01.319> is

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
LEDs to this point right here which is

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.199 
LEDs to this point right here which is
the<00:04:01.650> point<00:04:01.860> closest<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.670> edge<00:04:02.849> of<00:04:03.060> the

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
the point closest to the edge of the

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.240 
the point closest to the edge of the
board<00:04:03.420> on<00:04:03.689> the<00:04:03.840> bottom<00:04:03.989> of<00:04:04.379> the<00:04:04.799> three<00:04:05.040> rows

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
board on the bottom of the three rows

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.470 
board on the bottom of the three rows
and<00:04:05.519> there<00:04:06.510> should<00:04:06.689> be<00:04:06.810> a<00:04:06.840> M<00:04:07.170> next<00:04:07.799> to<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.480> that

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
and there should be a M next to it that

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.830 
and there should be a M next to it that
should<00:04:09.810> be<00:04:10.129> traced<00:04:11.129> out<00:04:11.340> by<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.579> box<00:04:11.970> surrounded

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
should be traced out by a box surrounded

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.920 
should be traced out by a box surrounded
by<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:12.989> should<00:04:13.290> be<00:04:13.409> in<00:04:13.530> white<00:04:13.709> color<00:04:14.159> and<00:04:14.930> then

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
by it should be in white color and then

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.140 
by it should be in white color and then
you<00:04:16.169> just<00:04:16.410> take<00:04:16.949> the<00:04:17.100> negative<00:04:17.250> of<00:04:17.639> the<00:04:17.789> LEDs

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
you just take the negative of the LEDs

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:30.549 
you just take the negative of the LEDs
and<00:04:18.590> then<00:04:19.590> solder<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.639> on<00:04:20.729> there

00:04:30.549 --> 00:04:30.559 

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:33.069 

and<00:04:31.429> there<00:04:31.669> you<00:04:31.789> go<00:04:31.849> that's<00:04:32.119> basically<00:04:32.809> how

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:33.079 
and there you go that's basically how

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:36.969 
and there you go that's basically how
you<00:04:33.109> can<00:04:33.379> hook<00:04:33.559> up<00:04:33.709> LEDs<00:04:34.609> here<00:04:34.959> at<00:04:35.959> about<00:04:36.229> 360<00:04:36.559> I

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
you can hook up LEDs here at about 360 I

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.619 
you can hook up LEDs here at about 360 I
will<00:04:37.399> have<00:04:37.579> some<00:04:37.759> extra<00:04:38.179> powerpoints<00:04:38.839> in<00:04:38.989> the

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:40.629 
will have some extra powerpoints in the

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:43.659 
will have some extra powerpoints in the
description<00:04:41.629> showing<00:04:42.349> where<00:04:43.129> you<00:04:43.309> can<00:04:43.519> hook

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
description showing where you can hook

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:44.799 
description showing where you can hook
these<00:04:43.849> up<00:04:43.909> and<00:04:44.209> where<00:04:44.329> you<00:04:44.389> can<00:04:44.539> get<00:04:44.659> power

00:04:44.799 --> 00:04:44.809 
these up and where you can get power

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:46.809 
these up and where you can get power
sources<00:04:45.259> of<00:04:45.559> negative<00:04:46.099> power<00:04:46.309> sources<00:04:46.669> for

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
sources of negative power sources for

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:47.289 
sources of negative power sources for
this

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:47.299 
this

00:04:47.299 --> 00:04:50.739 
this
I<00:04:47.329> mean<00:04:47.869> ground<00:04:48.109> and<00:04:49.299> yeah<00:04:50.299> that's<00:04:50.539> about<00:04:50.599> it

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:50.749 
I mean ground and yeah that's about it

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.509 
I mean ground and yeah that's about it
I'm<00:04:50.989> gonna<00:04:51.169> hook<00:04:51.409> up<00:04:51.589> the<00:04:51.739> Xbox<00:04:51.949> without

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:52.519 
I'm gonna hook up the Xbox without

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:54.969 
I'm gonna hook up the Xbox without
putting<00:04:52.669> the<00:04:52.909> case<00:04:53.179> back<00:04:53.389> on<00:04:53.799> just<00:04:54.799> to<00:04:54.949> show

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
putting the case back on just to show

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.719 
putting the case back on just to show
you<00:04:55.159> how<00:04:55.729> it's<00:04:56.049> that<00:04:57.049> it<00:04:57.169> works<00:04:57.489> so<00:04:58.489> I'll<00:04:58.609> be

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
you how it's that it works so I'll be

00:04:58.729 --> 00:04:59.229 
you how it's that it works so I'll be
right<00:04:58.849> back

00:04:59.229 --> 00:04:59.239 
right back

00:04:59.239 --> 00:05:01.599 
right back
ok<00:04:59.959> so<00:05:00.019> basically<00:05:00.319> I<00:05:00.649> just<00:05:01.009> made<00:05:01.219> sure<00:05:01.249> that

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:01.609 
ok so basically I just made sure that

00:05:01.609 --> 00:05:04.149 
ok so basically I just made sure that
there<00:05:01.789> wasn't<00:05:01.969> any<00:05:02.739> connections<00:05:03.739> that<00:05:04.039> we're

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
there wasn't any connections that we're

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:07.809 
there wasn't any connections that we're
crossing<00:05:04.429> on<00:05:04.849> the<00:05:05.449> back<00:05:05.629> and<00:05:06.459> I'm<00:05:07.459> not<00:05:07.669> going

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819 
crossing on the back and I'm not going

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.249 
crossing on the back and I'm not going
to<00:05:07.879> actually<00:05:08.029> keep<00:05:08.389> this<00:05:08.539> on<00:05:08.749> so<00:05:08.959> I'm<00:05:09.079> just

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
to actually keep this on so I'm just

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.739 
to actually keep this on so I'm just
gonna<00:05:09.639> show<00:05:10.639> you<00:05:10.669> it<00:05:10.909> without<00:05:11.179> the<00:05:11.359> case<00:05:11.509> on

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:11.749 
gonna show you it without the case on

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:13.659 
gonna show you it without the case on
which<00:05:11.959> you<00:05:12.349> shouldn't<00:05:12.769> do<00:05:12.949> because<00:05:13.339> the<00:05:13.489> fan

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
which you shouldn't do because the fan

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:15.099 
which you shouldn't do because the fan
will<00:05:13.909> be<00:05:14.029> able<00:05:14.149> to<00:05:14.239> cool<00:05:14.389> to<00:05:14.509> eat<00:05:14.539> sinks<00:05:14.959> down

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:15.109 
will be able to cool to eat sinks down

00:05:15.109 --> 00:05:16.839 
will be able to cool to eat sinks down
which<00:05:15.829> is<00:05:15.949> why<00:05:16.069> I'm<00:05:16.189> only<00:05:16.279> going<00:05:16.579> to<00:05:16.639> show<00:05:16.699> you

for a couple seconds that the only D's

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:21.489 
for a couple seconds that the only D's
do<00:05:18.679> power<00:05:18.889> up<00:05:19.069> from<00:05:19.369> the<00:05:19.549> Xbox<00:05:20.259> I'm<00:05:21.259> gonna<00:05:21.409> just

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:21.499 
do power up from the Xbox I'm gonna just

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:22.539 
do power up from the Xbox I'm gonna just
press<00:05:21.649> the<00:05:21.859> button<00:05:21.949> which<00:05:22.189> is<00:05:22.219> right<00:05:22.519> over
