00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
Shore and paddle on one side that was

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.510 
Shore and paddle on one side that was
incredibly<00:04:54.840> difficult<00:04:55.080> I<00:04:55.650> injured<00:04:56.340> myself

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
incredibly difficult I injured myself

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.159 
incredibly difficult I injured myself
before<00:04:56.940> that<00:04:57.240> paddle<00:04:57.600> and<00:04:57.660> I<00:04:57.750> had<00:04:57.840> a<00:04:57.870> crack<00:04:58.139> in

before that paddle and I had a crack in
my<00:04:58.410> hand<00:04:58.650> so<00:04:58.889> I<00:04:58.919> had<00:04:59.100> to<00:04:59.190> deal<00:04:59.370> with<00:04:59.520> that<00:05:00.979> the

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:06.289 
one of these paddles had been a

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:08.949 
one of these paddles had been a
once-in-a-lifetime<00:06:06.799> experience<00:06:07.899> I've<00:06:08.899> seen

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:08.959

once-in-a-lifetime experience I've seen
California<00:06:09.859> coastline<00:06:10.249> I<00:06:10.399> think<00:06:10.699> I'm

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:10.819 
California coastline I think I'm

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:12.159 
California coastline I think I'm
probably<00:06:10.939> one<00:06:11.239> of<00:06:11.269> the<00:06:11.419> only<00:06:11.539> individuals<00:06:12.139> I

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:13.519 
know I'm the only guy on the stand-up

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:15.549 
know I'm the only guy on the stand-up
paddleboard<00:06:13.999> that<00:06:14.179> looked<00:06:14.749> at<00:06:14.899> California

from the oceans perspective to the land
I've<00:06:20.839> seen<00:06:21.049> it<00:06:21.199> that<00:06:21.319> way<00:06:21.379> from<00:06:21.709> the<00:06:21.859> oceans

00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:22.189 
I've seen it that way from the oceans

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:25.029
