unique things about this cardigan making

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.930 
unique things about this cardigan making
it<00:00:33.960> perfect<00:00:34.440> for<00:00:34.559> travel<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.430> first<00:00:35.670> thing

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
it perfect for travel so the first thing

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.400 
it perfect for travel so the first thing
is<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:36.480> made<00:00:36.660> from<00:00:36.899> an<00:00:37.050> eco-friendly

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
is that it's made from an eco-friendly

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.700 
is that it's made from an eco-friendly
and<00:00:37.950> sustainable<00:00:38.239> material<00:00:39.239> yay<00:00:39.899> but<00:00:40.620> it's

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
and sustainable material yay but it's

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.010 
and sustainable material yay but it's
also<00:00:40.829> really<00:00:41.399> really<00:00:41.579> soft<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.450> another

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
also really really soft and another

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.470 
also really really soft and another
reason<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.579> opaque<00:00:45.090> so

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
reason I like it is that it's opaque so

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.209 
reason I like it is that it's opaque so
it's<00:00:45.719> not<00:00:45.960> sure<00:00:46.440> even<00:00:46.920> though<00:00:47.039> it's

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
it's not sure even though it's

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.580 
it's not sure even though it's
lightweight<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:48.600> wear<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> white<00:00:48.989> top<00:00:49.410> under

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
lightweight I can wear a white top under

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.680 
lightweight I can wear a white top under
and<00:00:49.950> even<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.399> bright<00:00:50.640> light<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.360> doesn't

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
and even in a bright light it doesn't

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.270 
and even in a bright light it doesn't
show<00:00:51.840> through<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.500> other<00:00:52.649> really<00:00:52.890> unique

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
show through and the other really unique

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.279 
show through and the other really unique
feature<00:00:53.550> about<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.239> chrysalis<00:00:54.629> cardi<00:00:55.110> is

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
feature about the chrysalis cardi is

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.900 
feature about the chrysalis cardi is
