not always economy or whatever but that
they<00:01:29.329> feel<00:01:29.600> very<00:01:29.869> different<00:01:30.229> going<00:01:30.469> from

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
they feel very different going from

we've<00:02:27.930> gotten<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.260> lot<00:02:28.409> of<00:02:28.620> various<00:02:29.010> bits<00:02:29.459> of

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
we've gotten a lot of various bits of

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.039 
we've gotten a lot of various bits of
feedback<00:02:29.970> when<00:02:30.209> we<00:02:30.269> talked<00:02:30.480> about<00:02:30.569> it<00:02:30.780> being

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
feedback when we talked about it being

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.309 
feedback when we talked about it being
three<00:02:31.439> chapters<00:02:32.159> but<00:02:32.849> this<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.269> by<00:02:33.569> itself<00:02:34.019> the

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
three chapters but this is by itself the

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.599 
three chapters but this is by itself the
biggest<00:02:34.620> single<00:02:34.920> player<00:02:35.069> campaign<00:02:35.459> we've

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
biggest single player campaign we've

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.940 
biggest single player campaign we've
done<00:02:35.819> I<00:02:36.000> think<00:02:36.090> by<00:02:36.450> far<00:02:36.480> especially<00:02:37.290> if<00:02:37.680> from<00:02:37.890> a

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
done I think by far especially if from a

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.849 
done I think by far especially if from a
Content<00:02:38.280> perspective<00:02:38.430> for<00:02:38.939> sure<00:02:39.439> and<00:02:40.439> even<00:02:40.739> in

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
Content perspective for sure and even in

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.589 
Content perspective for sure and even in
time<00:02:41.069> I<00:02:41.340> think<00:02:41.400> in<00:02:41.790> general<00:02:41.970> just<00:02:42.209> playing

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
time I think in general just playing

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.449 
time I think in general just playing
through<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:42.870> takes<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.379> long<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.829> and<00:02:44.129> the

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
through it takes that long and and the

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.940 
through it takes that long and and the
fun<00:02:44.670> factor<00:02:44.819> of<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.239> all<00:02:45.359> is<00:02:45.629> our<00:02:46.230> best<00:02:46.590> the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
fun factor of it all is our best the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.720 
fun factor of it all is our best the
storytelling<00:02:47.579> has<00:02:48.290> advanced<00:02:49.290> in<00:02:49.650> starcraft<00:02:50.519> 2

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730

storytelling has advanced in starcraft 2
in<00:02:50.879> a<00:02:50.970> number<00:02:51.269> of<00:02:51.299> different<00:02:51.540> ways<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.319> it's

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
in a number of different ways and it's

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.470 
in a number of different ways and it's
very<00:02:52.889> exciting<00:02:53.430> for<00:02:53.639> us<00:02:53.700> because<00:02:53.760> there's<00:02:54.389> a

in between missions to something that

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.440 
in between missions to something that
we're<00:03:10.200> trying<00:03:10.349> out<00:03:10.650> for<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.920> first<00:03:11.159> time

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
invited into the beta that then use it

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.780 
invited into the beta that then use it
as<00:04:31.480> a<00:04:31.510> demo<00:04:31.780> of<00:04:31.900> starcraft<00:04:32.380> 2<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:32.860> that's<00:04:33.520> just

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
as a demo of starcraft 2 and that's just

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.330 
as a demo of starcraft 2 and that's just
a<00:04:33.880> very<00:04:34.090> small<00:04:34.180> part<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:34.930> we're<00:04:35.560> specifically

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
a very small part and we're specifically

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.100 
a very small part and we're specifically
not<00:04:36.580> doing<00:04:37.090> some<00:04:37.420> things<00:04:37.630> with<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:37.900> beta

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
not doing some things with the beta

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.230 
not doing some things with the beta
because<00:04:38.500> we<00:04:38.680> worry<00:04:38.920> about<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:39.310> land<00:04:39.520> grab<00:04:39.850> you

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
because we worry about the land grab you

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.330 
because we worry about the land grab you
know<00:04:40.360> going<00:04:40.540> off<00:04:40.750> to<00:04:40.990> go<00:04:41.590> for<00:04:41.920> example<00:04:42.250> we

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
know going off to go for example we

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.980 
know going off to go for example we
don't<00:04:42.520> have<00:04:42.670> AI<00:04:42.850> in<00:04:43.180> the<00:04:43.510> gamer<00:04:43.690> and<00:04:43.870> we've

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
don't have AI in the gamer and we've

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.080 
don't have AI in the gamer and we've
very<00:04:44.230> easy<00:04:44.470> we<00:04:44.830> want<00:04:44.980> it<00:04:45.070> there<00:04:45.250> as<00:04:45.430> a<00:04:45.520> sandbox

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
very easy we want it there as a sandbox

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.390 
very easy we want it there as a sandbox
so<00:04:46.810> people<00:04:47.080> can<00:04:47.200> just<00:04:47.440> build<00:04:47.680> up<00:04:47.860> and<00:04:48.130> look<00:04:48.280> at

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
so people can just build up and look at

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.040 
so people can just build up and look at
the<00:04:48.490> tech<00:04:48.670> tree<00:04:48.850> in<00:04:49.000> that<00:04:49.030> sort<00:04:49.330> of<00:04:49.360> thing<00:04:49.450> but

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
the tech tree in that sort of thing but

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.100 
the tech tree in that sort of thing but
we<00:04:50.140> didn't<00:04:50.440> want<00:04:50.710> to<00:04:50.920> put<00:04:51.310> the<00:04:52.270> full<00:04:52.540> a<00:04:52.750> eyes<00:04:52.900> in

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
we didn't want to put the full a eyes in

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.690 
we didn't want to put the full a eyes in
there<00:04:53.200> because<00:04:53.410> especially<00:04:53.950> now<00:04:54.340> that<00:04:54.370> people

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
there because especially now that people

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.610 
there because especially now that people
can<00:04:54.910> plan<00:04:55.090> for<00:04:55.120> a<00:04:55.300> while<00:04:55.420> I<00:04:55.450> feel<00:04:56.140> like<00:04:56.320> people

can plan for a while I feel like people

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.290 
can plan for a while I feel like people
are<00:04:57.100> going<00:04:57.250> to<00:04:57.310> run<00:04:57.460> over<00:04:57.520> and<00:04:57.880> just<00:04:58.000> look<00:04:58.180> at

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
each other of like skills so we can

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.510 
each other of like skills so we can
really<00:05:44.080> look<00:05:44.500> at<00:05:44.560> those<00:05:44.770> numbers<00:05:44.920> understand

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
really look at those numbers understand

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.000 
really look at those numbers understand
what<00:05:45.610> it<00:05:45.700> is<00:05:45.730> get<00:05:45.970> it<00:05:46.060> right<00:05:46.240> for<00:05:46.510> ship<00:05:47.010> that

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
what it is get it right for ship that

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.980 
what it is get it right for ship that
takes<00:05:48.280> time<00:05:48.550> to<00:05:48.970> do<00:05:49.150> i<00:05:49.360> I<00:05:49.420> would<00:05:49.750> even<00:05:49.840> say

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
takes time to do i I would even say

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.410 
takes time to do i I would even say
we're<00:05:50.560> still<00:05:50.830> probably<00:05:51.220> months<00:05:52.090> away<00:05:52.390> from

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
we're still probably months away from

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.780 
we're still probably months away from

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
really seeing it doesn't give an example

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.450 
really seeing it doesn't give an example
this<00:05:55.180> morning<00:05:55.630> and

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:05.420 
region the Zerg are very dominant in

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
United States and there's somewhere in

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.870 
United States and there's somewhere in
the<00:06:06.720> middle<00:06:06.930> in<00:06:07.169> Europe<00:06:07.770> so<00:06:08.009> all<00:06:08.370> over<00:06:08.430> the

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
the middle in Europe so all over the

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.129 
the middle in Europe so all over the
world<00:06:08.970> were<00:06:09.210> seeing<00:06:09.449> players<00:06:09.630> with<00:06:09.810> different

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 
world were seeing players with different

world were seeing players with different
play<00:06:10.289> styles<00:06:10.319> and<00:06:10.860> different<00:06:10.979> play<00:06:11.310> abilities

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:11.789 
play styles and different play abilities

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:13.279 
play styles and different play abilities
may<00:06:11.940> be<00:06:12.000> certainly<00:06:12.419> different<00:06:12.720> ideas<00:06:13.259> about

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
may be certainly different ideas about

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:14.570 
may be certainly different ideas about
what<00:06:13.680> should<00:06:13.889> and<00:06:14.039> shouldn't<00:06:14.069> work<00:06:14.340> in<00:06:14.490> the

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
what should and shouldn't work in the

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.370 
what should and shouldn't work in the
game<00:06:14.759> it's<00:06:15.240> very<00:06:15.599> challenging<00:06:15.810> for<00:06:16.110> us<00:06:16.229> to

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
game it's very challenging for us to

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.540 
game it's very challenging for us to
balance<00:06:16.650> at<00:06:16.740> this<00:06:16.830> point<00:06:17.039> we<00:06:17.130> don't<00:06:17.160> want<00:06:17.490> to

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
balance at this point we don't want to

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.800 
balance at this point we don't want to
make<00:06:17.639> separate<00:06:17.880> versions<00:06:18.300> for<00:06:18.750> different

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
make separate versions for different

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.360 
make separate versions for different
countries<00:06:19.410> so<00:06:19.440> we're<00:06:19.710> willing<00:06:19.949> to<00:06:20.039> do<00:06:20.160> at<00:06:20.280> this

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
countries so we're willing to do at this

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.309 
countries so we're willing to do at this
point<00:06:20.460> it's<00:06:20.789> sort<00:06:20.910> of<00:06:20.970> watch<00:06:21.210> wait<00:06:21.990> and<00:06:22.169> see

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 
point it's sort of watch wait and see

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:24.170 
point it's sort of watch wait and see
collect<00:06:22.680> a<00:06:22.740> lot<00:06:22.860> of<00:06:22.949> data<00:06:23.099> and<00:06:23.370> see<00:06:23.880> sort<00:06:24.150> of

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
collect a lot of data and see sort of

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.730 
collect a lot of data and see sort of
you<00:06:24.270> know<00:06:24.330> where<00:06:24.930> the<00:06:25.080> truth<00:06:25.289> really<00:06:25.560> lies

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
you know where the truth really lies

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.990 
you know where the truth really lies
between<00:06:26.009> all<00:06:26.280> of<00:06:26.340> these<00:06:26.819> different

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
between all of these different

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.700 
between all of these different
playstyles<00:06:27.389> we're<00:06:27.780> seeing<00:06:27.990> all<00:06:28.169> of<00:06:28.229> the<00:06:28.560> world

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
playstyles we're seeing all of the world

playstyles we're seeing all of the world
I<00:06:28.949> hope<00:06:29.669> that<00:06:29.910> people<00:06:30.120> will<00:06:30.270> give<00:06:30.479> it<00:06:30.630> the

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 
I hope that people will give it the

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.629 
I hope that people will give it the
opportunity<00:06:31.349> to<00:06:31.410> understand<00:06:31.740> this<00:06:32.039> is<00:06:32.220> a<00:06:32.250> this

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 
opportunity to understand this is a this

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:33.950 
opportunity to understand this is a this
is<00:06:32.759> only<00:06:32.910> a<00:06:33.000> very<00:06:33.210> small<00:06:33.330> part<00:06:33.599> of<00:06:33.720> the<00:06:33.780> game

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
is only a very small part of the game

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.839 
is only a very small part of the game
and<00:06:34.139> it<00:06:34.229> is<00:06:34.470> it's<00:06:34.889> at<00:06:35.039> the<00:06:35.160> core<00:06:35.430> of<00:06:35.460> the<00:06:35.580> game

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:35.849 
and it is it's at the core of the game

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:37.550 
and it is it's at the core of the game
but<00:06:36.300> it's<00:06:36.479> still<00:06:36.690> ultimately<00:06:36.870> there's<00:06:37.380> all

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
but it's still ultimately there's all

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.770 
but it's still ultimately there's all
these<00:06:37.680> other<00:06:37.889> ways<00:06:38.280> that<00:06:38.550> we<00:06:38.699> want<00:06:39.360> people<00:06:39.599> to

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
these other ways that we want people to

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.570 
these other ways that we want people to
play<00:06:40.020> and<00:06:40.229> people<00:06:40.590> can<00:06:40.860> play<00:06:41.039> the<00:06:41.220> game<00:06:41.340> ones

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
play and people can play the game ones

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.490 
play and people can play the game ones
that<00:06:41.849> are<00:06:41.970> ultimately<00:06:42.180> releases<00:06:43.080> we're<00:06:43.440> just

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 
that are ultimately releases we're just

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.629 
that are ultimately releases we're just
trying<00:06:43.710> to<00:06:43.770> create<00:06:43.949> the<00:06:44.070> best<00:06:44.310> quality

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:46.349 
experience we can possibly create it the

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:48.710 
experience we can possibly create it the
other<00:06:46.470> day<00:06:46.680> it<00:06:47.220> is<00:06:47.430> up<00:06:47.580> to<00:06:47.669> the<00:06:47.759> fans<00:06:48.000> what<00:06:48.690> they
