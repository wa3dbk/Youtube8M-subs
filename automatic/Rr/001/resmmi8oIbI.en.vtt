00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.219
 no video in this video I wanted you 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.949
 tell about a project I have 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.869
 participated last year and yes if 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.470
 realized towards the end of the year 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.480
 or the creation of these two kits 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.750
 babe me and the other girls 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.939
 of the rai the academy we thought for 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.619
 thread and to sign these kits then one 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.930
 really very important for us 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.120
 and very very beautiful because we have it 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.539
 just seen us being born 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.940
 decisions is then seen in the final part 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.400
 or the sale will tell you 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.050
 quickly of these two kits too 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.970
 because the information box below is there 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.489
 I send the link what if you want to see in the 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.680
 detail of what it is then the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.500
 kit and number one is composed of the spot 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.180
 finally finally sold 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.950
 especially for those who use enamels 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.680
 therefore he does not know the world of 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.760
 reconstruction does not buy online does not know 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.009
 where to find things 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.040
 finally also in perfumery there will be 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.409
 the spot after pleasure also came in one 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.569
 ultra bright fixer to fix 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.609
 obviously rhinestones in sauce are 

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:16.069
 very useful very very beautiful because 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:18.149
 obviously I also immediately 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:20.880
 used in reconstruction without 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.429
 I will show you problems in detail 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.289
 and the spot that what we say 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.799
 I was more interested in Merka than she is 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.689
 however during the nike tour 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.700
 academy has finally noticed personal 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.979
 they asked you but this gigolo here where 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.590
 you buy because you do something too 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.049
 easy cute where you can find and to 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.450
 faith that is apart from saying for whom 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.450
 if he knew, however, also from essen if not 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.180
 therefore always lies 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.729
 comes the ad in question is composed 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.530
 from two points one smaller and one more 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.759
 great and useful you use it 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.520
 quietly even in the 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.799
 reconstruction a normal spot not 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.299
 I know if this kit will be sold part 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.490
 because I imagine it has so many people not 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.860
 interested has ceased re or not interest 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.170
 strass this thing obviously not 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.660
 I sincerely know the prices induce them 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.760
 I know elected in the information box on 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.510
 link where you can possibly see i 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.489
 clash 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.410
 I still liked the idea of ​​doing 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.540
 see what is realized also because 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.160
 all these things especially for the kit 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.890
 brushes we have done a lot of 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.370
 test really lasted a lot of months 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.959
 these tests and therefore we say that they are 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.390
 glad to show you mine 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.980
 project is true that most of 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.680
 those who are watching this video 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.040
 they already know the brushes they know 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.989
 already as a commercial or not interested in how 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.450
 product because obviously he already sees them 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.370
 at home doing the reconstruction among the 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.310
 still liked to show you what I am 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.730
 even doing beyond these videos 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.709
 according to kit which is the one where there 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.150
 we really put in the body 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.340
 even more and even it was a lot 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.609
 the creation is much more difficult 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.769
 kit number 2 where we find two brushes 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:05.190
 then the penne we find the brush 0 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.459
 10 which is that of ultrà precision and 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.440
 then we find the zero which is that of 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.079
 definition or filling I recommend 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.670
 one thing to always keep the caps e 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.130
 the case because once it comes 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.440
 clean you have to put the hood back on 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.970
 to keep fit and put back into 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.459
 I strongly recommend their custody 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.709
 who knows what I recommend in general 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.630
 with all the brushes to always keep 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.090
 their caps or their own 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.190
 casing because it protects them then 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.099
 let's start from the one pointing to 0 is more 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.329
 thin that is exactly this 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.790
 very useful of course to do the 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.610
 streak technique very useful for 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.040
 do 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.540
 thin I found myself very well and there 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.880
 I also say a secret is the truth in the 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.530
 meaning that during the test there are 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.600
 arrived a series of brushes and 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.910
 to the only asylum try the same in the 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.170
 reconstruction I honestly did not have 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.760
 big problems 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.310
 and among other things these were 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.350
 precisely chosen by all therefore that is 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.910
 it really struck us all 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.590
 same product without obviously that 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.630
 we had agreed because if not 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.950
 head our interior 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:11.110
 instead then there is the one at zero point that 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.570
 to outline define that slightly 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.030
 pilato that is exactly this 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.549
 the brushes are cleaned with the 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.640
 classic acetate solvent 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.620
 the vat enamel obviously advise to 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.870
 use leverage enamel pupa as it is 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.810
 been tested tested with these 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.000
 products obviously pupa once 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.980
 cleaned clean well in all its 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.169
 parts you have to close it in the hood 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.850
 put back in the package 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.130
 this was a project like vi 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.720
 I repeat very important for those who follow me 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.390
 you should already know this because I put it 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.080
 however a picture of us of the pupa in the 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:49.270
 happens there along with the brushes on 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.460
 facebook I put it and nothing 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.620
 just pressed before making you come to 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.530
 knowledge of this project which is one 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.810
 of the two I made this year 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.610
 so one and this is the other one later 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.260
 you will be able to reveal all the secrets 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.479
 I hope this video is there anyway 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.740
 like it even though it is very very simple 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.740
 now hello
