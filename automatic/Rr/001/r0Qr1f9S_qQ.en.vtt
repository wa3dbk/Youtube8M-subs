00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:12.389
 hey people are welcome here it 's more 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.570
 a video of maine from axn and today i dont 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.940
 I'll show you what's new in August. 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.859
 I came here just switch idea even 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.529
 There are a lot of people asking to do more 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.140
 videos de mayo blocks whats cool but 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.420
 The problem is that more blocks as already 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.090
 had mentioned many and many 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.790
 often manipulated is a bit 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.989
 limited in the sense of new things until 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.790
 the creator released the new version which 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.040
 I did talk to him last night. 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.410
 days including this week in the week 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.140
 I do not know and I asked him. 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:51.510
 died had any intention of releasing 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.500
 is any update any team in 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.219
 brief 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.370
 He said he has but does not know soon. 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.489
 will be due to the fact that he is 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.280
 busy with other projects that are 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.330
 spending more time on it 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:15.560
 one of them is the most blocks 2 is 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.560
 working and the other if I 'm not mistaken is 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.299
 mentioned another project that is 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.830
 working then basically this is the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.680
 reason why you are not leaving 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.070
 updates are frequent 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.500
 understood but why the main goal 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.820
 It's just that he's launching more docs 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.770
 two not too long now and with 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.950
 In fact, I do not even know what the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.649
 his plan and more blocks 2 the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.079
 and I currently prefer one 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.030
 locution a much more kind 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.170
 I liked it so much more than the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.240
 another version 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.659
 but it 's the one that's here in the game 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.250
 expensive or not I so positive talk 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.930
 What he has to do, he said that 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.369
 will launch that will launch a brand new 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.009
 update 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.209
 maybe even coming but he does not have 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:12.420
 So sure, now we 're at 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.800
 January that they do not update 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.690
 it will take so long 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.240
 but he also does not know how much time is going 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.450
 take much less what will be 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.780
 present in the update understood then 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.010
 so is it okay thing this 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.220
 update 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.070
 the other novelty I can tell 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.240
 for you here maybe I'll be part 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.610
 I do not know yet 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.940
 how's the craziest thing to do? 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.160
 I know how to come back telling the guys that 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.220
 it's happening 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.500
 I received an invitation and have your 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.090
 advantages and disadvantages in my case the 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.150
 The advantage is that I can do it. 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.750
 any type of video that is not 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.120
 breaking no glass harry and I go 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.250
 being let go because now you have 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.500
 too much trouble with videos already warned either 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.250
 make a video but it is not always possible 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.920
 because he has some is some 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.760
 Companies that do not allow you to make 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:20.430
 videos from your games even when 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:22.739
 I make a video on youtube it 's air strip 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.830
 He does not take it that way, but in reality 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.260
 he did not let you monetize and as you 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.570
 they do not know how to type the whole thing from the 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.270
 youtube is that you have the possibility 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.830
 monetize your videos and earn 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.050
 money with it 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.030
 so if you already do the pleasure what 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.470
 it would be more interesting to win 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.209
 some money from this 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.209
 then one of the advantages of joining 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:49.260
 a network is the fact that you 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:52.650
 power is to make more videos and have fewer 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.260
 problems with cop hearing in case of 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.280
 major companies that has partnered with 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.280
 China 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.989
 So you have a partner from china you 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.540
 will be able to make videos of these decide 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.370
 any of these games without any problem and 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.300
 will monetize what is well 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.970
 cool huh 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.400
 As I said since you make the videos. 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.799
 Kind of worth getting a bit of 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.959
 Money is also what you buy with this 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.820
 equipment and does other things more 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.640
 money I do not know if you have a channel 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.700
 It's too big for you to live, said 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.700
 so it depends a lot on what level 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.970
 with you 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:34.330
 it will be in reality I as I said 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.040
 still in the beginning nettheim type 20 thousand and 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.380
 few subscribers 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.900
 I'm still getting does not for me okay 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.260
 making a lot of fun 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.730
 The money I pay you but it's already good. 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.130
 understood all the money that goes in is good 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.980
 Well then so is my goal good for me 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.600
 has always been sending traffic to 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.630
 my site that free games for 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.150
 dot com and so far what am i going to do 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.610
 here's another one too, I'm going to do it, I'm going 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.340
 Teaching you how to make a game site 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.520
 because in reality I go back and do 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.070
 in the pro free games in another in 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.440
 using the dot with br 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.210
 so in reality today if you 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.130
 in any of the two points with 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.130
 the dot with br dot goes to the same 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.170
 place but soon in the future come back and 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.000
 making a dot with br dot will be a 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.730
 totally new site 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.590
 maybe the design will be the same but in 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.120
 reality it will be located in 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:32.140
 another type part on another server 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.390
 because the point 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.040
 with br br in Brazil so I 'll go 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.940
 looking for is receiving traffic from 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.530
 Brazil, contrary to the point with which 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.180
 you may receive more traffic here from 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.710
 united states portugal and in others 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.300
 places too 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.820
 and in reality when you have two 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.040
 and are much more likely to be 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.470
 appearing on google and also if your 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.380
 website is monetizing you will be able to 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.690
 make money like I told you if you already 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.070
 does something would be interesting if 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.470
 had the chance to win 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.270
 money you make then it's for 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.070
 This is what I'm going to show you. 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.010
 other initiatives that are also 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:12.240
 involved in creating games and seeing that 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.680
 The game now tasso tasso and this is 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.010
 Another thing I 'm doing now is 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.900
 development of games and even 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.780
 some cool projects there that I go 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.790
 be participating and then come back 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.950
 sharing with you there and has even 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.210
 companies that are starting to enter me 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.160
 contact me wanting me to 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.200
 I develop games for them 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.140
 Which is what's cool, right? 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.310
 Actually, I'm a programmer but I'm not 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.510
 designer 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.990
 so in reality I'm going to have to do 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.590
 partner with some people or pay 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.450
 someone to 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.280
 do the graphics and this has some 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:49.600
 interested people but so far not 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:51.220
 I have seen no one who has such a kind a type 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.080
 so the legal graphics that would give 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.140
 make a partnership even with a 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.400
 game to work or even to 

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.930
 other companies 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.550
 but that's it guys this video that was 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.710
 more to exchange an idea than to 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.540
 show anything here on the blog 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.160
 as soon as some update is out 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.110
 bringing you here and showing you the 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.790
 What is new? I'm staying here. 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:13.500
 Thank you very much. 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.500
 This video was worth it and until the next
