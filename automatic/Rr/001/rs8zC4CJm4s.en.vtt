00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.429 
butter a project butter basically is a
technology<00:01:43.829> which<00:01:44.250> enables<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:46.020> CPU<00:01:46.380> and

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
technology which enables so the CPU and

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.499 
technology which enables so the CPU and
GPU<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.860> run<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.100> parallel<00:01:47.280> because<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.329> which

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
GPU to run in parallel because of which

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.840 
GPU to run in parallel because of which
you<00:01:48.659> get<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> really<00:01:49.229> smooth<00:01:50.040> transition<00:01:50.610> now

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
you get a really smooth transition now

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.190 
you get a really smooth transition now
these<00:01:50.970> transitions<00:01:51.450> happening<00:01:51.780> at<00:01:51.899> 60<00:01:52.170> frames

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
these transitions happening at 60 frames

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.830 
these transitions happening at 60 frames
per<00:01:52.439> second<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.979> know<00:01:53.070> because<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.430> which

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
per second you know because of which

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.840 
per second you know because of which
they're<00:01:54.840> really<00:01:55.229> blazing<00:01:55.890> fast<00:01:56.100> something

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
they're really blazing fast something

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.969 
they're really blazing fast something
totally<00:01:57.659> different<00:01:57.960> from<00:01:58.200> what<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.710> may<00:01:58.860> have

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
totally different from what you may have

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.179 
totally different from what you may have
seen<00:01:59.159> on<00:01:59.310> other<00:01:59.450> android<00:02:00.649> iterations<00:02:01.649> the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
seen on other android iterations the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.289 
seen on other android iterations the
next<00:02:02.369> thing<00:02:02.430> I'd<00:02:02.549> like<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.670> talk<00:02:02.820> about<00:02:02.969> is

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
next thing I'd like to talk about is

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.870 
next thing I'd like to talk about is
widgets<00:02:04.049> now<00:02:04.680> widgets<00:02:05.159> are<00:02:05.280> something<00:02:05.640> that

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
widgets now widgets are something that

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.419 
widgets now widgets are something that
separates<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.170> Android<00:02:07.619> from<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.039> Apple<00:02:08.310> iOS

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
separates the Android from the Apple iOS

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.979 
separates the Android from the Apple iOS
and<00:02:08.849> jelly<00:02:09.479> bean<00:02:09.539> are<00:02:09.750> some<00:02:09.869> interesting

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
and jelly bean are some interesting

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:10.840 
and jelly bean are some interesting
improvement

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
improvement

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.670 
improvement
let's<00:02:11.180> see<00:02:11.300> what<00:02:11.480> that<00:02:11.630> is<00:02:11.810> now<00:02:12.290> when<00:02:12.410> I<00:02:12.470> hold

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
let's see what that is now when I hold

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.610 
let's see what that is now when I hold
on<00:02:12.710> to<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:12.920> widget<00:02:13.250> it<00:02:14.230> goes<00:02:15.230> on<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.500> home

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
on to a widget it goes on to the home

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.470 
on to a widget it goes on to the home
screen<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:16.100> see<00:02:16.790> what's<00:02:17.000> happening<00:02:17.300> in<00:02:17.420> the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
screen and see what's happening in the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.790 
screen and see what's happening in the
background<00:02:17.570> it's<00:02:17.990> basically<00:02:18.380> trying<00:02:18.680> to

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
background it's basically trying to

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.710 
background it's basically trying to
rearrange<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.460> apps<00:02:19.640> was<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.150> fit<00:02:20.480> in<00:02:20.600> this

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
rearrange the apps was to fit in this

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.150 
rearrange the apps was to fit in this
widget<00:02:20.930> this<00:02:21.380> is<00:02:21.470> a<00:02:21.560> ready<00:02:21.740> impression

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
widget this is a ready impression

feature once it's loaded onto the home
screen<00:02:25.850> you<00:02:25.880> can<00:02:26.150> further<00:02:26.780> on<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:28.160> know

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
screen you can further on you know

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.040 
screen you can further on you know
adjust<00:02:28.670> its<00:02:28.850> size<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.420> apps<00:02:29.630> around<00:02:29.810> it

adjust its size and the apps around it

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.020 
adjust its size and the apps around it
will<00:02:30.200> automatically<00:02:30.740> readjust<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:31.730> this<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:31.970> a

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
will automatically readjust so this is a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.540 
will automatically readjust so this is a
really<00:02:32.120> interesting<00:02:32.240> touch<00:02:33.220> moving<00:02:34.220> on<00:02:34.370> we

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
really interesting touch moving on we

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.370 
really interesting touch moving on we
would<00:02:34.700> like<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:34.970> show<00:02:35.210> you<00:02:35.380> notifications

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
would like to show you notifications

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.590 
would like to show you notifications
which<00:02:36.830> is<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.220> next<00:02:37.370> improvement<00:02:38.120> in

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
which is the next improvement in

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.830 
which is the next improvement in
jellybean<00:02:39.970> notifications<00:02:40.970> as<00:02:41.210> you<00:02:41.510> can<00:02:41.630> see<00:02:41.810> a

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
jellybean notifications as you can see a

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.080 
jellybean notifications as you can see a
stack<00:02:42.140> one<00:02:42.530> below<00:02:42.710> the<00:02:42.740> other<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.220> you<00:02:43.880> can

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
stack one below the other and you can

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.240 
stack one below the other and you can
actually<00:02:44.300> use<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.320> two<00:02:45.560> finger<00:02:45.710> gesture<00:02:46.130> to

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
actually use a two finger gesture to

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.350 
actually use a two finger gesture to
actually<00:02:46.580> see<00:02:46.700> what's<00:02:46.970> within<00:02:47.240> a

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
actually see what's within a

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.630 
actually see what's within a
notification<00:02:47.740> so<00:02:48.740> that's<00:02:48.980> an<00:02:49.190> interesting

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
notification so that's an interesting

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.920 
notification so that's an interesting
touch<00:02:49.820> if<00:02:50.270> you<00:02:50.420> want<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.720> remove<00:02:50.870> a

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
touch if you want to remove a

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.540 
touch if you want to remove a

like that so that is notifications the
next<00:02:59.630> interesting<00:03:00.080> thing<00:03:00.290> is<00:03:00.820> google<00:03:01.820> now

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
next interesting thing is google now

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.410 
next interesting thing is google now
when<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.340> go<00:03:04.340> on<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.520> lockscreen<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:05.210> get

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
when you go on the lockscreen you get

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.540 
when you go on the lockscreen you get
options<00:03:06.020> to<00:03:06.110> unlock<00:03:06.440> this<00:03:06.770> and<00:03:07.010> you<00:03:07.190> have<00:03:07.340> this

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
options to unlock this and you have this

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.730 
options to unlock this and you have this
thing<00:03:07.850> called<00:03:07.900> google<00:03:08.900> but<00:03:09.170> this<00:03:09.320> is<00:03:09.410> not<00:03:09.500> just

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
thing called google but this is not just

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.890 
thing called google but this is not just
a<00:03:09.830> search<00:03:10.010> by<00:03:10.220> google<00:03:10.250> now<00:03:10.760> now<00:03:11.540> Google<00:03:11.690> now

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
a search by google now now Google now

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.960 
a search by google now now Google now
basically<00:03:12.230> has<00:03:12.680> this<00:03:12.860> whole<00:03:13.040> cart<00:03:13.340> system<00:03:13.760> and

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
basically has this whole cart system and

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.500 
basically has this whole cart system and
it<00:03:14.180> basically<00:03:14.720> is<00:03:16.030> dependent<00:03:17.030> on<00:03:17.150> your

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
it basically is dependent on your

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.360 
it basically is dependent on your
location<00:03:17.750> so<00:03:18.140> it's<00:03:18.320> basically<00:03:18.650> contextual

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
location so it's basically contextual

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.430 
location so it's basically contextual
search<00:03:19.660> there<00:03:20.660> are<00:03:20.750> more<00:03:20.900> cars<00:03:21.080> know<00:03:21.290> right

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
search there are more cars know right

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
increasing now you see it's 43 mb and

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.450 
increasing now you see it's 43 mb and
once<00:06:49.960> it<00:06:50.140> goes<00:06:50.320> ahead<00:06:50.530> that<00:06:50.860> means<00:06:51.070> you<00:06:51.340> know

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
once it goes ahead that means you know

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.130 
once it goes ahead that means you know
you<00:06:51.940> have<00:06:52.030> reached<00:06:52.180> a<00:06:52.330> maximum<00:06:52.450> limit<00:06:52.900> and<00:06:53.020> you

you have reached a maximum limit and you

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.860 
you have reached a maximum limit and you
have<00:06:53.380> to<00:06:53.530> start<00:06:54.100> zooming<00:06:54.280> in<00:06:54.520> so<00:06:55.180> we<00:06:55.660> don't

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
have to start zooming in so we don't

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.520 
have to start zooming in so we don't
really<00:06:56.020> like<00:06:56.920> this<00:06:57.450> idea<00:06:58.450> of<00:06:58.960> you<00:06:59.110> know<00:06:59.230> having

really like this idea of you know having
a<00:06:59.740> limit<00:07:00.040> on<00:07:00.160> the<00:07:00.460> amount<00:07:00.520> of<00:07:00.850> map<00:07:01.180> area<00:07:01.360> you

a limit on the amount of map area you
can<00:07:01.720> download<00:07:02.370> late<00:07:03.390> so<00:07:04.390> that's<00:07:04.690> about<00:07:04.870> it<00:07:05.020> I
