00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 Hey guys maybe looking at the brs 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.490
 stock with samsung galaxy 5 mi and com 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.870
 samsung as well as the galaxy to 5 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.330
 You already saw what I already did the test. 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.250
 that there are not five and I'm going to do it here now 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:22.170
 test one on the note is back on a5 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:25.830
 and I will not do the test 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.619
 both are in version 5 6 1 and if they delay 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.859
 a little more nationally you've already seen 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.160
 21,700 one about this one I do not 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.760
 I know how much his score will be. 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.480
 but this one the s 5 mini he has one 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.360
 quadcore processor of 1.4 and we have 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.590
 here pro agree 1.2 but this is 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.789
 a snapdragon 410 com is that the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.829
 64-bit instructions for this one he 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.550
 It's a processor I do not think is 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.590
 64-bit 32-bit still or the first 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.320
 who left for r 5 million left with 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.930
 requirements of samsung think series 5 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.430
 of samsung or 5 thousand in something and 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.920
 now it looks like it's being inept 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.700
 It may be that he's leaving. 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.259
 with snapdragon 470 410 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.840
 but what caught my attention here 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.729
 usually the inept dragon he comes with 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.390
 processor with the graphics processor or 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.390
 the adriano and it seems that here it 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.790
 are you seeing with mali? it's a business 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.180
 weird because usually the mali Cusa 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.579
 if we produce or even for others 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.180
 processors cause other chipsets 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.180
 huh 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.899
 and apps generally dragon qualcomm 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.060
 she usually uses the adreno that makes more 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.049
 a marriage and between the processor 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:58.619
 and the processor is central to the 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:02:00.390
 the mind to the mind is that of the mobile phone, right? 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.350
 even a little bit later it seems that he 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.360
 already gave a lean back here remembering 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.239
 the two devices they have the same 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.080
 resolution only the screen of a 5 is 5 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:17.480
 inches and 256 inches of 4 inches and 6 to 1 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.970
 but we will see in 720p 1280 points 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.550
 let's see here the a5 he was up to a 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.280
 little more erased because I only have 13% 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.530
 I have 57 but no battery 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.720
 It is plugged into the power saving all 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.700
 are there with free processor for 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.400
 be able to hit the peak peak and 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:41.490
 processing has already passed 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.170
 Passed but often does not mean 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.970
 nothing to the now we are in the graphic part 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.580
 until nothing new appears that the 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.530
 two have the same performance both this 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.300
 part now let's enter part 3 of 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.280
 we will even generate 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:09.750
 So we can see part three of each one. 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:11.940
 Let's get it going to end more or less. 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.040
 here you can get a sense of who is 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.830
 best in 3d part 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.700
 I see that s 5 mi he is one 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:23.400
 little faster than 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.790
 as well as my impression but left 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:32.930
 when patting here fps 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.930
 4,241 problem even the same average and fps 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.989
 does not change much 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:46.860
 here it fell pretty 2.1 both ne 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:48.209
 2.9 now this little end is what has 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.769
 a better performance all 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:55.170
 appliances here 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:56.850
 15 15 17 is more of the devices are 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.530
 more or less on average see with how much 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.900
 was the score of each 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:06.860
 This one I know the more the better. 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:11.580
 twenty-one thousand seven hundred and 748 here gave 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.900
 19,019 1901 the score gave up a little 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.780
 below it being a processor of 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:20.850
 1.4 it came down in relation to which the 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.490
 a5 processor 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.760
 Come on, I want to see the details here. 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.760
 now 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.700
 devices we have here is a 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.360
 processor and not the operating system 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:40.050
 is 32 bits is a qualcomm snapdragon 400 and 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.090
 410 same resolution the adrian is a 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.330
 adriano processor is not a lytha 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.450
 adriano 305 adriano 306 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.430
 processor is basically the same as the 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.190
 s3 honey then I need to do an act 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.950
 also with the s3 not go here O 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.240
 in the part of the processors here is more 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.920
 information 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:04.320
 this is a corttex at 53 and 61 corttex at 7 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.910
 you can see corttex at 53 corttex at 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:12.360
 7 snapdragon 410 32-bit and 64-bit 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:16.410
 here his steppe goes from 300 to a thousand and 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.560
 400 best here from 2 200 to 1,000 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:22.500
 only one kernel running 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.990
 for every 113 staff you saw there 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.210
 even having a higher clock 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.360
 it has a slightly smaller performance 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.100
 than the other has a clock of 1.2 and the 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.560
 64-bit instructions 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.170
 But anyway, I see that you had a 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.190
 very good performance the 5 good mini 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.360
 so this is personal 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.830
 I hope you have enjoyed yourself 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.120
 Did you like it, please ? It's already a lot. 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.640
 important for the channel 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.640
 Thank you so much and said people
