00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.830
 hello today, shorter sunday 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.840
 do not particularly dick decided to do again 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.620
 carbon or something or 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.699
 basically this one here is the reason shorter 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.100
 carbon here here blown away the whole impudent 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:23.279
 because there are problem areas 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.850
 it turns out when I glue here from goes 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.279
 ribs 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.670
 and when you pull out of here and out of here 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.740
 It turns out fucked up the tension that without 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.600
 root primer probably not a damn 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.960
 would never have stuck here now 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.829
 There is no it and there is less here but mostly 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.870
 it looks like this 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.739
 we will try this a little bit now 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.890
 later I wanted to say something 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.800
 today did just such a crap that is 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.430
 Carbon coated with this handy valve 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:02.550
 which always thunders naturally well and 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:05.430
 here is this thing they write to me a lot of people 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.939
 Those who have seen that I pasted all 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.460
 panel 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.740
 entirely pretty bad it happened 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.250
 I have such a picture here as there 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.619
 small joint too due to strong 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.080
 perry thrust from here i pulled 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.540
 general this way down and here 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.670
 it turns out that way 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.299
 its here this place but immediately got up then 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.240
 there is again 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.850
 I don’t have a primer therefore I’m shorter 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.329
 le him drink nothing would be up to 21 she 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.210
 will rise 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.479
 it's okay not everything is beautiful ok about 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.450
 barely peeled off but nothing here and I write something 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.490
 that like so here so yes pokleit carbon 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.610
 so it worked out well that all 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.520
 great here you answer from everything just 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.590
 that is, here to paste over such 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.670
 horseradish, moreover, it turned out all fucking awesome 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.890
 without any shoals even he did not expect that 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.340
 there you just need to take the parts and there 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.840
 rub here on jeans 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.810
 cut a piece of carbon fiber there he is on 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.119
 centimeter will tell the king more here 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.520
 put it here and so say show 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.220
 and just to and attach down all 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.290
 then turn it over and start all 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.079
 flat surfaces we 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.269
 roll out this thing here do not touch 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.590
 here we will study like this and 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.969
 pimples okay too 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.409
 stick with stick with that 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:27.540
 we do that here with us too 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:31.260
 surface is flat but here and so it pro 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.629
 took a bit of a hairdryer once a warmed cube 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.040
 so here it is here 1 and here is the edge here 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.099
 while temporarily wrapped 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.849
 Well, the riots didn’t cuddle up 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.319
 here you are on the corners here I did 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.650
 differently so i have here here 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:50.010
 Shumka stuck well this type of Carpet on 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.169
 this sticker garbage here that is like this 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.870
 Now it's here, as it were adjacent 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:57.959
 tightly close now I'll show it all not 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.659
 trembles that is about normal and not 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:04.290
 closes tightly I'm not doing well 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:05.010
 I'm here go carbon simply cut straight 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.939
 on the edge 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.459
 time neatly and everything is exactly here 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:13.590
 also just a finger on the heated while rolling 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.840
 a little bit of it here the other side is straight 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.489
 i use regular legs which is there 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.109
 clerical and that's not a dick 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.090
 here and so on the edge straight knife video 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.949
 video video video we all strip it 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.500
 cut here with your finger again 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:31.319
 also with all rolled 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.000
 then you have a shorter cut detail 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.040
 It turns out here so here you have it 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.530
 tightened 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.560
 we lay down or put in Russian how to say 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.159
 I do not know everything and we heat this part entirely 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.220
 fen nozzle directed this one 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:49.379
 part of the heat and so here from here 1 time 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.180
 here is so narrow your zapping on 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:55.379
 banners in the end when the film is shorter 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:58.109
 stretch over here from here 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.569
 it can be cut that is just 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:04.439
 legs put forward code on this edge 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:06.959
 right here and from now to this 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:10.949
 aside proline cut and aside 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.530
 cut turn over here with us 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:16.979
 it turns out cut straight rovnenko those up 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:20.370
 these and still five heat the film and and time 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:22.380
 Once there we glue this side 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.629
 we have her circumcised here just when 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.910
 rolled here and now show closer 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:32.599
 fucking not seen anyway oh so here 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:35.030
 they came there all warmed up good he 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:38.000
 let it dry here 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.629
 these here highlight the light no dick 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.270
 see but these little corners that's all too 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:49.099
 finger straight once nail rolled with 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:51.770
 this side turned here now 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.900
 so here we put the knife and 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.780
 neatly 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.180
 cut everything cool you have turned 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.449
 normal workpiece polina eyes not 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.099
 distinguish which is shorter made of plastic 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:07.580
 everything is fine nothing on nowhere 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:09.800
 being bullied nothing different with her 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.099
 it happens even with deflectors 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.940
 the thing here is 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:19.819
 surface smooth surface bent 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:22.759
 stuck everything and start from the edges he 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:26.270
 natural must be removed and so here 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:28.400
 there hire skis shorter and all he 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:32.330
 It turns out in the Carboniferous there is not visible inside 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.520
 here here everything is closed all here are 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:38.960
 Things karoch everything is easy to do with 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.880
 the panel and the base there go crazy here 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.770
 Now short look at what we here 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:50.229
 here we insert it like that 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:55.880
 do you hear it as if it’s already deaf? 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:58.400
 all were not any in the world as it is 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.159
 demagogues nothing all that beautiful 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.319
 It turns out as if a little bit can not 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.909
 harmonizes but still this account u 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:08.360
 By the way, I like the last time 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:11.830
 some kind of film is covered incomprehensibly but 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:17.569
 no trouble there it will deal with it all 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:19.610
 excellent spiders go on take shorter 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:22.370
 Here is this thing, it generally stretches easily 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.849
 wait here you can see some pigtails 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.940
 remained 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:28.810
 that is there on these for it I did not 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:32.479
 trim in general just here even 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:35.050
 he turns out like this but the elder 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:35.050
 not visible 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.220
 right i mean everything is normal here 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:46.360
 Now that is take the film, even here 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:49.270
 Now for the corner let's say everyone took it 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.430
 here it is and here I am right so hard here 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.090
 this hand in hand hold the other 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.390
 finger and and 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:58.780
 just pulled the harp forehead glued all 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:00.700
 the form took is super but from 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.250
 dough here the surface is again exactly 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:06.310
 that is, nothing needs to be done and so here 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:08.230
 best from the middle came down 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.750
 of these here especially here the corner 

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:13.630
 smaller it is easier here to the corner 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:15.670
 reached the other hand took from one hand 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:19.020
 not yet show it here so here 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:24.780
 warms and at the same time more time here 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:28.470
 little corner turns out perfect well and for 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:31.090
 harmony shorter here its here 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:34.600
 we put in with it will climb hard 

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:42.550
 pro because there now interferes 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:45.940
 chicken but here and so basically everything 

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:48.730
 beauty indicate noticed another shoal here 

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:53.590
 me something plenochka little scars 

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:57.670
 Well, maybe it's all a drag 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:59.800
 and it turns out that's such a thing yet 

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:02.530
 nice to us they confuse my attention 

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.300
 drawn to the temporary almost not 

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:07.420
 works 

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:09.240
 I think that I myself am burning music 

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:15.570
 an hour shorter I'll do this thing 

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:15.570
 try to do something if you make a video
