suggest<00:00:26.480> that<00:00:26.630> leaders<00:00:26.960> must<00:00:27.199> have<00:00:27.349> certain

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
suggest that leaders must have certain

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.560 
suggest that leaders must have certain
traits<00:00:27.919> such<00:00:28.460> as<00:00:28.519> intelligence<00:00:29.390> or

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
so she ability maybe even being tall

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.140 
so she ability maybe even being tall
others<00:00:38.110> say<00:00:38.380> it's<00:00:38.530> about<00:00:38.739> technique<00:00:39.309> or<00:00:39.610> skill

that<00:04:41.900> differentiated<00:04:42.890> leaders<00:04:43.430> are<00:04:43.700> able<00:04:44.090> to

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
that differentiated leaders are able to

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.010 
that differentiated leaders are able to
