00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
put some eyes on it I like putting eyes

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.490 
put some eyes on it I like putting eyes
and<00:02:13.400> on<00:02:13.489> my<00:02:13.519> bait<00:02:14.480> fish<00:02:14.810> patterns<00:02:15.290> especially

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
and on my bait fish patterns especially

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.800 
and on my bait fish patterns especially
the<00:02:16.250> ones<00:02:16.430> I<00:02:16.519> tied<00:02:16.700> for<00:02:16.880> pike<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:17.360> don't<00:02:17.630> have

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
the ones I tied for pike I don't have

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.840 
the ones I tied for pike I don't have
much<00:02:17.959> confidence<00:02:18.489> fishing<00:02:19.489> one<00:02:19.610> that<00:02:19.730> doesn't

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
much confidence fishing one that doesn't

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.130 
much confidence fishing one that doesn't
have<00:02:19.940> eyes<00:02:20.150> on<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.510> I<00:02:20.569> don't<00:02:20.720> know<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:21.049> it

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
have eyes on it I don't know that it

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.770 
have eyes on it I don't know that it
makes<00:02:21.350> tremendous<00:02:21.799> amount<00:02:22.130> of<00:02:22.190> difference<00:02:22.610> I

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
makes tremendous amount of difference I

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.930 
makes tremendous amount of difference I
certainly<00:02:23.780> have<00:02:24.049> caught<00:02:24.290> fish<00:02:24.560> after<00:02:25.519> eyes

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
certainly have caught fish after eyes

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.770 
certainly have caught fish after eyes
have<00:02:26.209> fallen<00:02:26.420> off<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.810> fly<00:02:27.670> but<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:28.940> just<00:02:29.630> like

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
have fallen off the fly but I just like

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.070 
have fallen off the fly but I just like
having<00:02:30.080> eyes<00:02:30.230> on<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.819> so<00:02:31.819> we're<00:02:32.810> gonna<00:02:32.870> use

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
having eyes on it so we're gonna use

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.000 
having eyes on it so we're gonna use
some<00:02:33.230> of<00:02:33.260> these<00:02:33.350> holographic<00:02:33.769> eyes<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:36.010> they

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
some of these holographic eyes and they

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.870 
some of these holographic eyes and they
a<00:02:37.040> little<00:02:37.540> they're<00:02:38.540> sticky<00:02:38.959> they<00:02:39.080> gotta<00:02:39.880> just

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
a little they're sticky they gotta just

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.130 
a little they're sticky they gotta just
stick<00:02:41.060> them<00:02:41.150> on<00:02:41.299> the<00:02:41.360> back<00:02:41.540> of<00:02:41.750> them<00:02:41.840> which

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
stick them on the back of them which

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.900 
stick them on the back of them which
makes<00:02:42.319> it<00:02:42.470> handy<00:02:42.650> we'll<00:02:42.920> stick<00:02:43.130> that<00:02:43.160> right<00:02:43.489> on

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
makes it handy we'll stick that right on

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.960 
makes it handy we'll stick that right on
a<00:02:44.560> nice<00:02:45.560> big<00:02:45.860> thread<00:02:46.220> head<00:02:46.459> that<00:02:46.670> we've<00:02:46.760> built

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
a nice big thread head that we've built

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:56.620 
a nice big thread head that we've built
up<00:02:47.239> there<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:50.090> one<00:02:50.329> on<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.540> other<00:02:50.570> side<00:02:55.630> it'll

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
up there and one on the other side it'll

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.390 
up there and one on the other side it'll
cover<00:02:56.840> up<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.170> rest<00:02:57.350> of<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:57.530> thread<00:02:57.920> head<00:02:58.160> so

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
cover up the rest of that thread head so

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.940 
cover up the rest of that thread head so
you<00:02:58.459> don't<00:02:58.670> even<00:02:58.760> see<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.060> anymore<00:02:59.799> that's<00:03:00.799> why

you don't even see it anymore that's why

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:01.900 
you don't even see it anymore that's why
you<00:03:01.010> don't<00:03:01.220> have<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.400> be<00:03:01.489> worried<00:03:01.730> about

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
building up too big of a thread head
you're<00:03:03.859> not<00:03:04.660> it's<00:03:05.660> not<00:03:05.810> gonna<00:03:06.370> make<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.489> fly

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
you're not it's not gonna make the fly

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.220 
you're not it's not gonna make the fly
look<00:03:07.880> any<00:03:08.030> worse<00:03:08.209> don't<00:03:08.810> you<00:03:08.870> stick<00:03:09.079> the<00:03:09.200> eyes

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
look any worse don't you stick the eyes

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.900 
look any worse don't you stick the eyes
on<00:03:09.560> you<00:03:09.680> can't<00:03:09.890> see<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.190> thread<00:03:10.430> name<00:03:10.609> there

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
on you can't see the thread name there

thread<00:03:11.180> head<00:03:11.390> anymore<00:03:11.690> anyways<00:03:11.989> make<00:03:12.709> sure

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
thread head anymore anyways make sure

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.930 
thread head anymore anyways make sure
they're<00:03:12.950> even<00:03:13.150> in<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.329> right<00:03:14.480> place<00:03:14.750> and<00:03:15.940> then

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
they're even in the right place and then

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.770 
they're even in the right place and then
we're<00:03:17.090> gonna<00:03:17.180> use<00:03:17.269> some<00:03:18.100> this<00:03:19.100> tough<00:03:19.400> fly<00:03:19.780> or

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
we're gonna use some this tough fly or

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.900 
we're gonna use some this tough fly or
epoxy<00:03:21.109> substitute<00:03:21.769> it's<00:03:21.890> an<00:03:21.950> acrylic<00:03:22.190> epoxy

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
epoxy substitute it's an acrylic epoxy

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.610 
epoxy substitute it's an acrylic epoxy
substitute<00:03:23.420> works<00:03:23.720> very<00:03:23.989> well<00:03:24.079> for<00:03:24.230> this<00:03:24.470> and

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
substitute works very well for this and

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.800 
substitute works very well for this and
we're<00:03:24.709> just<00:03:24.739> gonna<00:03:24.920> fill<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.400> gaps<00:03:25.810> between

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
we're just gonna fill the gaps between

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.610 
we're just gonna fill the gaps between
the<00:03:27.139> eyes<00:03:27.260> top<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:27.829> bottom<00:03:28.100> and<00:03:28.190> that'll

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
the eyes top and bottom and that'll

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.470 
the eyes top and bottom and that'll
adhere<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.769> fly<00:03:30.980> right<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.700> nursery

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
adhere the fly right to the nursery

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.050 
adhere the fly right to the nursery
adhere<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:32.989> eyes<00:03:33.139> right<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:33.769> the<00:03:33.859> fly<00:03:34.069> and<00:03:34.459> it

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
adhere the eyes right to the fly and it

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.699 
adhere the eyes right to the fly and it
makes<00:03:35.269> it<00:03:35.450> absolutely<00:03:35.720> bomb-proof<00:03:36.350> it

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
makes it absolutely bomb-proof it

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.520 
makes it absolutely bomb-proof it
completely<00:03:37.069> covers<00:03:37.340> up<00:03:37.459> your<00:03:37.609> thread<00:03:37.850> head<00:03:38.530> so

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
they will not come off and I found that

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.840 
they will not come off and I found that
when<00:04:00.170> you<00:04:00.290> just<00:04:00.470> glue<00:04:00.740> the<00:04:00.950> eyes<00:04:00.980> on<00:04:01.370> they

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850

does<00:06:00.229> is<00:06:00.409> it<00:06:00.500> just<00:06:00.590> puts<00:06:00.860> a<00:06:01.030> just<00:06:02.030> a<00:06:02.090> hard

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
does is it just puts a just a hard

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.999 
does is it just puts a just a hard
coating<00:06:02.690> over<00:06:02.870> top<00:06:03.050> of<00:06:03.080> the<00:06:03.289> epoxy<00:06:03.590> you<00:06:03.800> don't

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.009 
coating over top of the epoxy you don't

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:05.290 
coating over top of the epoxy you don't
really<00:06:04.099> need<00:06:04.370> the<00:06:04.550> hardness<00:06:04.880> of<00:06:04.970> it<00:06:05.090> but<00:06:05.210> it

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
really need the hardness of it but it

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.580 
really need the hardness of it but it
takes<00:06:05.449> away<00:06:05.630> the<00:06:05.690> tacky<00:06:06.070> tacky<00:06:07.070> residue<00:06:08.590> and

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
takes away the tacky tacky residue and

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:15.300 
takes away the tacky tacky residue and
just<00:06:10.370> let<00:06:10.520> dry<00:06:10.940> this<00:06:11.000> is<00:06:11.270> the<00:06:11.800> completed<00:06:12.800> fly

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.249 

now<00:06:16.310> you<00:06:16.370> can<00:06:16.759> also<00:06:16.940> add<00:06:17.330> some<00:06:17.659> black<00:06:17.870> fire

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:18.259 
now you can also add some black fire

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:19.600 
now you can also add some black fire
markings<00:06:18.650> with<00:06:18.770> a<00:06:18.800> sharpie<00:06:19.219> or<00:06:19.250> something

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
markings with a sharpie or something

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.080 
markings with a sharpie or something
like<00:06:19.699> that<00:06:19.810> to<00:06:20.810> really<00:06:21.620> make<00:06:22.460> it<00:06:22.490> look<00:06:22.669> like<00:06:22.940> an

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090
