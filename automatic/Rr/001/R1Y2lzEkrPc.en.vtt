00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 Our first report today will 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.509
 show a tree that draws a lot of 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.529
 attention of our viewers 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.660
 jatoba 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.250
 among the various emails we receive 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.830
 about the subject look here 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.139
 erika midori as the prudent and 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.170
 the Guimaraes of Rio Negro are 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.070
 paulo want to know how the planting is done 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.650
 from jatobá 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.539
 from the seed you will see that 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.510
 there is a little secret to make the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.240
 germination of trees 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.880
 jatobá is a tree native to Brazil 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.950
 also known as jataí the people 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.290
 finds jatobá in several states of the 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.629
 country from amazon to paraná 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.320
 the tree can reach 20 meters 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.079
 height and trunk one meter in diameter at 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.000
 jatobá wood is hard and resistant is 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.610
 one hardwood 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.730
 the fruit is a brown pod usually 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.809
 with two seeds inside a pulp 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.300
 yellowish coat protects seeds 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.160
 this flour is rich in calcium and some 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.780
 households with more than one 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.360
 mato grosso do sul are 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.570
 industrializing the product that can be 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.299
 used for the manufacture of sweets and breads 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.450
 with all this attractive many people want 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.790
 to make jatobá seedlings like our two 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.950
 viewers who wrote to the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.450
 saying that it is difficult to do 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.400
 the germinating seed 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.970
 so we went after who knows the best 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.040
 way to accomplish this eric max we 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.320
 we are in a farm in piracicaba are 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.659
 paulo and here is a jatobá foot with a 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.180
 estimated age in about 30 years 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.030
 We are going to talk to the biologist now. 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.430
 alessandro morais alessandro is difficult 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.710
 collect the fruit of jatobá 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.640
 the future jatobá is a bit complicated 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.720
 be collected 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.790
 you can be putting him 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.549
 directly from the water or some batches 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.729
 which fell 1 down from the tree even those 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.070
 fruits fell here they will serve the voice 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.810
 changes because the jatobá he has 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.820
 a very resistant seed 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.479
 Let's get these, they'll get this one. 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.759
 You see that the fruit it is hard is not 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.710
 easy is withdrawing the seed from within 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.300
 so even those here who seemingly 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.470
 are very mature looks that the seed 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.920
 It 's good in here. 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.020
 the opel it is very nice to avoid some 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.930
 some united pets do not play here 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.600
 Look, it 's all accident, look. 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.610
 obviously, the process argues that the 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.190
 popularly called bark 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.960
 that it allows to protect the embryo that is 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.220
 which will give a new plant a new 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.530
 tree in the future 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.080
 the other way of collecting the fruits is 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.060
 use pruning shears with extensor 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.060
 to reach the top of the tree 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.970
 so now we will provide for us 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.260
 show how you do the processing 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.520
 of seeds 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.000
 Let's go at first I'll show you 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.010
 little side is good now we already 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.530
 we're in the nursery of a company 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.910
 specialized in the production of 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.030
 native species 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.560
 alessandro that is now done then already 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.610
 is obviously drawing inside the 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.380
 flow 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.790
 I'll use this piece of wood. 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.790
 same breaking board here 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.170
 here we have a mass would make inacia 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.959
 that the jatobá pulp 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.209
 the staff usually eats as usual 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.580
 eating this little we will use 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.200
 here a little water 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:26.160
 katalin 'cause she has to take this 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.230
 That's when we get the flu a little 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.050
 more spoiled and you can already 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.000
 removing it more easily 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.910
 in the case of ants they have done this 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.890
 cleaning after cleaning is time to 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.739
 to break the seed 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.590
 allow water to enter and then start 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.510
 the process of germination here in the nursery 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.810
 they found a practical way of 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.970
 do this using a piece of wood with 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.430
 the seed-size hole for 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.080
 sanding the surface to the advantage in this 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.060
 the producer when he does not have much 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.959
 practice with production of seedlings production 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.000
 of seed 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.650
 he will not be shaving leshan from the 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.780
 finger he may be doing several 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.660
 the seeds and 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.370
 scraping on the hard and rough surface or 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.340
 also here we have a 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.989
 lima file that the file he has 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.510
 in his farm he may be 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.609
 using the same wood up to one or 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.810
 a death some other tool and 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.810
 such as she 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.830
 careful not to shave too much and 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.380
 damage the embryo 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.360
 I saw that you always did in the belly of the 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.070
 seeds can not do in the corner 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.560
 It is not very important not to be 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.080
 scar of the seed because here is where 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.940
 will leave ahadi vat where it will be issued 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.680
 the future queen of the moult 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.180
 in case we do the ends 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.400
 again we can be 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.990
 harming and sometimes not 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.830
 being born not ending form 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.610
 proper 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.530
 let's come close to sauce 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.229
 We'll leave the seeds in the sauce for 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.270
 48 hours being changed every 12 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.940
 hours for clean water again 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.440
 see that after 48 hours in the water the 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.110
 seed becomes swollen 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.850
 our team is ready to begin the 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.160
 This is the old one that we can 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.320
 to be directly sowing a bag 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.380
 the alley where the producer was producing 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.650
 changes to prepare the substrate should be 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:20.260
 use two subsoil parts one 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.919
 part of sand and part of manure 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:27.100
 tune and notice another trick that 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.960
 they use a cut pvc tube here 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.470
 to facilitate the completion of the 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.470
 bags 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:39.820
 and it's good to remember always put the seed 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:43.120
 sideways and not standing up to ensure that 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.010
 it will germinate approach to the world 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.130
 field in six months is not ready to 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.560
 bridge a eric martyr then if you 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.430
 take such care will be seedlings 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.990
 jatobá, how are you? 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.419
 this is a good time to plant 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.200
 jatobá seedlings because we are still in the 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.630
 summer 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.650
 and you saw the secret is sanding the canister 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.080
 of the seed 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.139
 if you do not do so the chance of germination 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:11.220
 repair less than half compared to the 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.220
 way we show
