00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
hey guys another product review today

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.490 
hey guys another product review today
this<00:00:02.669> is<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:03.000> question<00:00:03.720> and<00:00:03.929> this<00:00:04.110> is<00:00:04.319> in

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
this is the question and this is in

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.519 
this is the question and this is in
particular<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.160> barbecue<00:00:05.549> flavor<00:00:06.259> so<00:00:07.259> thanks

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
particular the barbecue flavor so thanks

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:20.330 
particular the barbecue flavor so thanks
Mike<00:00:07.680> resign<00:00:08.040> these<00:00:08.250> gotcha<00:00:11.090> surprise<00:00:19.070> so<00:00:20.070> the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
Mike resign these gotcha surprise so the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.500 
Mike resign these gotcha surprise so the
chip<00:00:20.550> again<00:00:21.090> it's<00:00:21.240> baked<00:00:21.949> there's<00:00:22.949> no<00:00:23.100> soy<00:00:23.510> but

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
chip again it's baked there's no soy but

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.759 
chip again it's baked there's no soy but
you<00:00:24.630> see<00:00:24.779> via<00:00:25.260> seasoning<00:00:25.920> on<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.160> show<00:00:30.769> you

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
you see via seasoning on the show you

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.580 
you see via seasoning on the show you
can<00:00:31.920> really<00:00:32.040> taste<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.460> barbecue<00:00:34.910> and<00:00:35.910> deep

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
can really taste the barbecue and deep

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.049 
can really taste the barbecue and deep
and<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.710> will<00:00:37.890> initial<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.520> texture<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.030> like

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
and this will initial a texture is like

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.740 
and this will initial a texture is like
a<00:00:39.800> fake<00:00:40.800> ship<00:00:41.809> but<00:00:42.809> once<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:44.329> get<00:00:45.329> or<00:00:45.570> then

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
a fake ship but once you get or then

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.590 
a fake ship but once you get or then
when<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.770> when<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.700> chip<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.090> turning<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.570> a

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
when the when the chip is turning to a

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.520 
when the when the chip is turning to a
pulp<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.399> guess<00:00:50.399> neither<00:00:50.640> protein<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.410> gets<00:00:52.410> a

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
pulp I guess neither protein it gets a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.270 
pulp I guess neither protein it gets a
little<00:00:52.739> sandy<00:00:54.710> it's<00:00:55.710> kind<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.949> hard<00:00:56.219> to

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
little sandy it's kind of hard to

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.560 
little sandy it's kind of hard to
describe<00:00:59.870> so<00:01:00.870> at<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.140> point<00:01:02.210> scandal<00:01:03.210> sandy

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
describe so at this point scandal sandy

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.880 
describe so at this point scandal sandy
you<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:03.960> because<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.439> high<00:01:04.530> protein

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
you just because of the high protein

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.090 
you just because of the high protein
content<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.430> anytime<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.000> put<00:01:06.740> your<00:01:07.740> protein

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
content so anytime you put your protein

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.560 
content so anytime you put your protein
into<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> product<00:01:08.729> or<00:01:08.820> more<00:01:09.180> protein<00:01:09.540> than

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
into a product or more protein than

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.789 
into a product or more protein than
usual<00:01:10.400> especially<00:01:11.400> with<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> protein<00:01:12.510> bar

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
usual especially with like a protein bar

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.289 
usual especially with like a protein bar
the<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.130> texture<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> fact<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.090> going<00:01:15.240> to

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the the texture of the fact is going to

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.310 
the the texture of the fact is going to
just<00:01:15.450> be<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.840> lot<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.549> lot<00:01:17.549> harder<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:19.140> lot

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
just be a lot a lot harder and a lot

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.630 
just be a lot a lot harder and a lot
more<00:01:19.560> dense<00:01:21.259> but<00:01:22.259> they<00:01:22.409> do<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> good<00:01:22.799> job<00:01:22.860> at

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
more dense but they do a good job at

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.820 
more dense but they do a good job at
least<00:01:23.880> initially<00:01:24.320> when<00:01:25.320> you're<00:01:25.439> biting<00:01:25.590> to

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
least initially when you're biting to

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.859 
least initially when you're biting to
the<00:01:25.920> trip<00:01:26.299> the<00:01:27.299> texture<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.720> very<00:01:27.780> Airy<00:01:29.869> we

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the trip the texture is very Airy we

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.050 
the trip the texture is very Airy we
know<00:01:31.020> similar<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.439> lift<00:01:31.799> up<00:01:31.950> tribe<00:01:34.579> and<00:01:35.579> again

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
know similar to lift up tribe and again

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.880 
know similar to lift up tribe and again
when<00:01:36.270> you're<00:01:36.450> finishing<00:01:37.259> off<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.619> ship<00:01:37.799> in

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
when you're finishing off the ship in

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.910 
when you're finishing off the ship in
your<00:01:38.009> mouth<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:39.060> keep<00:01:39.240> chewing<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:40.470> texture

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
your mouth you keep chewing the texture

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.300 
your mouth you keep chewing the texture
is<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.850> bit<00:01:41.970> sandy<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.869> see<00:01:46.020> here<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.890> trip

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
is a bit sandy and you see here the trip

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.330 
is a bit sandy and you see here the trip
is<00:01:47.460> also<00:01:48.049> I<00:01:49.049> guess<00:01:49.470> aerated<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> little<00:01:50.220> bit

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
is also I guess aerated a little bit

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.940 
is also I guess aerated a little bit
just<00:01:50.460> because<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.909> baking<00:01:51.240> process<00:01:51.950> so

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
just because of the baking process so

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.100 
just because of the baking process so
that's<00:01:53.250> how<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.490> initial<00:01:54.329> texture<00:01:54.780> is

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
that's how that initial texture is

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.959 
that's how that initial texture is
achieved<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.950> macros<00:01:59.549> for<00:01:59.579> one<00:02:00.479> bag<00:02:00.689> two

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
achieved and the macros for one bag two

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:07.850 
achieved and the macros for one bag two
grams<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.119> fat<00:02:04.280> five<00:02:05.280> carbohydrate<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.860> 20

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
grams of fat five carbohydrate and 20

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.180 
grams of fat five carbohydrate and 20
grams<00:02:08.160> protein<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:09.390> this<00:02:10.259> one<00:02:10.649> bag<00:02:10.860> has<00:02:11.160> a

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
grams protein so this one bag has a

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.220 
grams protein so this one bag has a
total

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
total

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.809 
total
grams<00:02:12.650> protein<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.810> if<00:02:14.810> your<00:02:15.110> are<00:02:15.489> all<00:02:16.489> right<00:02:16.670> I

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
grams protein so if your are all right I

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.899 
grams protein so if your are all right I
guess<00:02:17.090> if<00:02:17.239> you<00:02:17.360> want<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:19.250> know<00:02:19.340> satisfy

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 
guess if you want to you know satisfy

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.170 
guess if you want to you know satisfy
your<00:02:20.150> your<00:02:20.510> protein<00:02:21.140> macros<00:02:21.560> for<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.799> day

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
your your protein macros for the day

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.720 
your your protein macros for the day
yeah<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.360> would<00:02:23.560> be<00:02:24.560> sufficient<00:02:24.739> because<00:02:25.129> the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
yeah it would be sufficient because the

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.180 
yeah it would be sufficient because the
the<00:02:26.060> grams<00:02:26.299> protein<00:02:26.540> is<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.500> lot<00:02:27.950> higher<00:02:28.129> than

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
the grams protein is a lot higher than

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.050 
the grams protein is a lot higher than
the<00:02:28.640> fat<00:02:29.390> carbohydrate<00:02:30.190> within<00:02:31.190> one<00:02:31.670> serving

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
the fat carbohydrate within one serving

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.089 
the fat carbohydrate within one serving
which<00:02:32.299> is<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.629> whole<00:02:33.140> back<00:02:33.319> okay<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:33.530> next<00:02:33.830> I'm

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
which is a whole back okay so next I'm

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.039 
which is a whole back okay so next I'm
going<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.459> try<00:02:34.640> this<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:35.150> sour<00:02:35.660> cream<00:02:35.780> and

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
going to try this the sour cream and

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:49.710 
going to try this the sour cream and
onion<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:47.090> just<00:02:47.420> taste<00:02:47.599> like<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.579> delays

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
onion you just taste like the delays

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.300 
onion you just taste like the delays
sour<00:02:50.720> cream<00:02:50.930> onion<00:02:51.019> think<00:02:51.620> that<00:02:51.769> we<00:02:52.160> also

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
sour cream onion think that we also

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.869 
sour cream onion think that we also
we've<00:02:52.519> all<00:02:52.670> grown<00:02:53.329> up<00:02:53.510> with<00:02:57.700> texture<00:02:58.700> similar

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
we've all grown up with texture similar

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.589 
we've all grown up with texture similar
to<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.239> BBQ<00:03:00.879> and<00:03:01.879> let's<00:03:02.000> move<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.239> macros

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
to the BBQ and let's move the macros

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.550 
to the BBQ and let's move the macros
exactly<00:03:03.319> the<00:03:03.410> same<00:03:04.090> two<00:03:05.090> grams<00:03:05.299> of<00:03:05.450> fat<00:03:05.629> five

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
exactly the same two grams of fat five

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.520 
exactly the same two grams of fat five
grams<00:03:06.829> of<00:03:06.980> carb<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:07.790> twenty<00:03:08.720> grams<00:03:08.989> of

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
grams of carb and twenty grams of

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.470 
grams of carb and twenty grams of
protein<00:03:11.230> so<00:03:12.230> again<00:03:12.849> similar<00:03:13.849> texture<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:14.450> the

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
protein so again similar texture and the

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.409 
protein so again similar texture and the
flavor<00:03:15.290> is<00:03:15.650> just<00:03:16.129> like<00:03:16.340> if<00:03:16.700> you've<00:03:17.000> got<00:03:17.239> a

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:17.419 
flavor is just like if you've got a

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.559 
flavor is just like if you've got a
Lay's<00:03:17.840> potato<00:03:18.459> thousand<00:03:19.459> Friday<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:20.269> number

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
Lay's potato thousand Friday and number

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.780 
Lay's potato thousand Friday and number
three<00:03:20.810> is<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:22.069> salt<00:03:22.310> vinegar<00:03:23.739> sick

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
three is the salt vinegar sick

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.140 
three is the salt vinegar sick
wheelchair<00:03:30.459> it<00:03:31.459> definitely<00:03:31.760> smells<00:03:31.940> like

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
wheelchair it definitely smells like

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:42.520 
wheelchair it definitely smells like
vinegar<00:03:40.090> vinegar<00:03:41.090> taste<00:03:41.419> isn't<00:03:41.720> so<00:03:42.079> intense

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
vinegar vinegar taste isn't so intense

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.830 
vinegar vinegar taste isn't so intense
but<00:03:42.880> it's<00:03:43.880> definitely<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.329> definite<00:03:44.690> taste

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
but it's definitely a definite taste

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.990 
but it's definitely a definite taste
like<00:03:44.959> salt<00:03:45.200> measure<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:48.260> same<00:03:48.500> deal<00:03:48.910> when<00:03:49.910> you

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
like salt measure the same deal when you

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.569 
like salt measure the same deal when you
get<00:03:50.150> toward<00:03:50.389> them<00:03:50.560> it's<00:03:51.560> just<00:03:51.919> the<00:03:52.069> touch<00:03:52.400> is

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
get toward them it's just the touch is

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:53.710 
get toward them it's just the touch is
kind<00:03:52.819> of<00:03:52.880> sandy<00:03:53.120> just<00:03:53.239> because<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:53.690> the

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
kind of sandy just because of the

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.979 
kind of sandy just because of the
protein<00:03:54.200> content<00:03:54.319> list<00:03:54.790> close<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.940> macros<00:03:56.329> so

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
protein content list close the macros so

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.039 
protein content list close the macros so
again<00:03:57.349> exact<00:03:57.680> same<00:03:57.859> macros<00:03:58.720> I'm<00:03:59.720> sure<00:03:59.870> they

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
again exact same macros I'm sure they

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:01.659 
again exact same macros I'm sure they
use<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:00.290> same<00:04:00.319> base<00:04:00.709> and<00:04:00.980> then<00:04:01.099> put<00:04:01.340> a<00:04:01.370> water

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:01.669 
use the same base and then put a water

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:05.530 
use the same base and then put a water
flavoring<00:04:02.209> that<00:04:03.220> is<00:04:04.220> indicated<00:04:05.209> on<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.359> bag

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
flavoring that is indicated on the bag

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.809 
flavoring that is indicated on the bag
so<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:06.109> graph<00:04:06.859> at<00:04:07.129> five<00:04:07.489> grams<00:04:07.700> of

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
so to graph at five grams of

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.819 
so to graph at five grams of
carbohydrate<00:04:08.359> and<00:04:08.599> twenty<00:04:09.079> of<00:04:09.169> grass<00:04:09.349> protein

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
carbohydrate and twenty of grass protein

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.360 
carbohydrate and twenty of grass protein
and<00:04:10.430> all<00:04:11.389> three<00:04:11.629> bags<00:04:11.810> also<00:04:12.560> have<00:04:12.859> 120
