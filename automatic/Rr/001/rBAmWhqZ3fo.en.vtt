00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.119
 for waterproofing foundations 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:21.669
 floors and exterior or interior walls 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.039
 as basements swimming pools tunnels 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:26.560
 or water tanks the use is recommended 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.930
 of music 1 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.779
 for its correct application it must be 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.870
 previously control porosity firmness 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:38.550
 and cleaning the surface areas to 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.550
 cover should be moist 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.620
 to make waterproof plasters 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.870
 it is recommended to mix a part of 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.559
 Portland cement every three parts of 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:55.479
 sand using a part of sica 1 in 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.479
 10 parts of the mixing water 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.390
 Mix for 5 minutes and apply 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.180
 by using spoon squeezing 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.600
 well against the substrate do not conform 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.149
 layers more than one centimeter thick 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.350
 the process can be repeated forming 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.350
 a double layer 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.009
 the plasters must be kept moist and 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.649
 in the shade for at least 72 hours 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.619
 to avoid cracks by shrinking the 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.390
 cement at the end of the application 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.950
 will proceed to clean the remains of 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.950
 fresh mortar with water
