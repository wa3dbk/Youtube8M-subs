00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.200
 the president dilma rousseff gave a 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.690
 explanation for the tax increase 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.570
 about imported cars announced this 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.700
 month, the goal is to keep the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.679
 jobs of Brazilians some models 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.650
 have already risen in price, Brazil is one of the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.990
 countries where cars are more expensive 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.720
 even the vehicles manufactured here are 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.400
 sold at a lower price abroad 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.500
 Antonio is interested that in this car 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.060
 while 27 thousand 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.310
 and did you know that a car just like 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.890
 The one in manufacturing in Brazil walks two thousand 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.110
 miles of ship truck and arrives 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.790
 the cheapest Argentina here not 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.800
 I knew you think that 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.540
 It's absurd that 's our correspondent. 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.610
 jacques gomes son went to a 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.280
 dealership in buenos aires check 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.739
 that's right here in Argentina the same 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.160
 car cost the equivalent of 19 thousand 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.640
 30% cheaper and 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.350
 sellers here risks an explanation 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.449
 Never tango blind the camera in front of us 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.879
 increases according to oscar 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.370
 the Argentines would not get used to 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.650
 increase and raise the price would decrease 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.020
 the purchase of cars but their 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.729
 influences on the purchase of 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.799
 sao paulo back we asked 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.780
 represent the manufacturers of 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.430
 because the car is more expensive in the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.310
 Brazil anfavea did not want to record 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.570
 interview but sent a note 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.580
 responsible for cost Brazil and the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.770
 imposed the Brazilian cost that that value 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.479
 paid for both energy for transportation 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.009
 for labor costs 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.200
 this does not make sense since the car 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.880
 sold in Argentina it was manufactured 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.350
 here in Brazil what we see is a 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.780
 tax lawyer to try 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.939
 understand the difference in taxes 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.700
 nelson lacerda explains that the 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.770
 taxes in Brazil reaches 40% in price 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.140
 of the car but when the vehicle will be 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.509
 sold outside the automakers receive 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.090
 abatement of these taxes and 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.159
 earn credits to use here in the country 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.380
 so they can sell cheaper on the 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.000
 Argentina is interesting for industries 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.270
 including the doors and not a penny 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 because it is delivered dcm credit ipi 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.219
 That she's going to the good Brazilian. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.290
 charge 40% and stay in the money 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.390
 we then asked him to do the math 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.509
 what is the price of the car without taxes 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.879
 in the two countries and came another surprise 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.580
 in Brazil that car that was bought 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.070
 for 27 thousand reais 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.830
 costs $ 16,000 without taxes on 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.680
 Argentina costs 13 thousand as the same 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.930
 car erased freight and still remained 3 thousand 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.970
 cheaper this consultant of your 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.400
 opinion we have some 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.220
 international studies showing that the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.990
 profit margin in Brazil is also higher 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.240
 than in other countries 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.570
 the tax is more expensive but the margin of 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.570
 profit as well
