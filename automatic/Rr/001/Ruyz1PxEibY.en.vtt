00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 the everyone so today I 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.290
 do not he was and words on the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 mascara every 2 million China 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.280
 sectioning this fairly new mascara in 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.719
 pharmacies it's been about a month 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.260
 I got you that mascara and I loved it 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.090
 very much 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.009
 I waited a few weeks for 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.630
 film the magazine because I think with 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.430
 a beauty product we can not base 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.880
 his opinion only on a first 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.470
 impression 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.300
 So why I am really test 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.980
 a few weeks to give you my 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.140
 opinion this mascara that is pretty liquid 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.720
 that I prefer to compare a mascara that has 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.949
 rather a dryer formula because 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.369
 I think with a mascara that then 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.080
 liquid 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.460
 it takes a lot less time to do 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.660
 bumps he so my opinion you know I 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.070
 always make two layers of mascara 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.300
 but if you really have morning posting 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.550
 a layer that you really have 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.350
 the desired effect very quickly because when 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.760
 just is in a shape and the most 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.079
 liquids it's much faster or 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.040
 if I find that mascara hard work 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.570
 All day long 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.670
 at the end of the evening I have no 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.379
 lumpy name on my face mascara very 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.289
 easy to remove because it's not 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.730
 one who will be born task and the outline of 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.289
 sky level eyes so it's really 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.420
 easy I feel good makeup remover then 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.949
 everything will be removed me I have the version 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.780
 not water repellent but also a version 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.550
 water repellent its first version 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.229
 water repellent it will really help you to 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.670
 keep your course throughout the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.680
 day even though I had it on our beds 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.250
 from refuge to thanks to the brush that is 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.869
 curve 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.939
 it's going to be really keeping the curve 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.520
 of vaud heaven then me naturally here 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.259
 are very straight but if they are very 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.150
 right and co so that gives you an idea 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.470
 So this mascara I really like 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.360
 costs plus the packaging finds it 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.950
 really bumped a metallic pink what 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.060
 is still quite different so I 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.680
 really recommend all those who 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.909
 like to try mascara again 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.740
 for sure I will surely 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.270
 redeem the future a fart version 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.920
 especially water repellent that summer without 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.600
 vierimaa sibylline is surely the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.430
 best in pharmacy of my opinion 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.900
 I really tried a lot then that 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.400
 it's still another very good so 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.750
 just before started their cottage that I 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.670
 door on my lips right now 5 in 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.229
 2010 and its spades three hours is 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.990
 really seen humorist lipstick 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.430
 more really it's a beautiful purple pink 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.170
 new so I really like a lot 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.579
 so first I came bent 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.229
 but if it's a step that I 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.970
 never neglects because I have the styles 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.530
 rather straight and cut so I like 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.070
 really curled up paper this mascara 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.070
 I use 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.640
 here is the nearest brush so the 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.170
 points are plastic and it's a 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.850
 curl brush that will really help 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.090
 to suck the only ones even more 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.080
 then the top that makes me see them 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.120
 points are much shorter which 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.310
 will help really brush them up and 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.480
 finally do that no lumps then 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.250
 then the wood hairs are a lot 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.989
 longer well that's going to bring a lot 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.989
 more volume and length to the cl 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.069
 the tip of the brush to really good 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.319
 to go to reach the small islands 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.680
 in the outer corner is in the corner 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.680
 internal 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.170
 then the curve of the base is here 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.170
 very well kept but curved 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.540
 so with only a room layer 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.739
 brings many length and volume 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.660
 then now with what's left on the 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.660
 brush I'm going to do the bottom eyelashes 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.280
 so this sectionals but to see do 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.579
 the second coach always likes to come 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.450
 bend missiles again 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.450
 without weighing too much 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.200
 now for the second layer I 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.090
 am going to use the slower hairs of the 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.420
 brush to come and buy more than 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.420
 language 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.410
 so if you are like me you have 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.030
 often safe mascara 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.790
 wait until it's dry and then 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.790
 first worried and it's just going 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.870
 so that's it for this video
