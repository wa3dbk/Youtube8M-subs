then your filter removes and you have
your<00:04:17.959> filter<00:04:18.260> out<00:04:19.090> so<00:04:20.090> you'll<00:04:20.299> do<00:04:20.900> that<00:04:20.959> so<00:04:21.410> you

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
your filter out so you'll do that so you

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.659 
your filter out so you'll do that so you
