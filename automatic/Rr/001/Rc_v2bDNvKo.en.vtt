things you should go through make you
stronger<00:02:09.500> or<00:02:09.770> or<00:02:10.190> destroy<00:02:10.550> you

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
stronger or or destroy you

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.270 
stronger or or destroy you
and<00:02:11.060> since<00:02:11.390> he<00:02:11.540> survived<00:02:11.960> he's<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.680> stronger

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
and since he survived he's a stronger

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.970 
and since he survived he's a stronger
individual<00:02:13.790> I<00:02:13.910> think<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.620> I'm<00:02:15.620> old<00:02:15.860> enough

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
individual I think and I'm old enough

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.880 
individual I think and I'm old enough
now<00:02:16.250> I've<00:02:16.400> gone<00:02:16.550> through<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.820> few<00:02:17.030> things<00:02:17.300> and

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
now I've gone through a few things and

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.130 
now I've gone through a few things and
and<00:02:18.890> had<00:02:19.730> good<00:02:19.940> times<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.330> bad<00:02:20.390> times<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:20.900> that

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
and had good times and bad times so that

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.720 
and had good times and bad times so that
there's<00:02:21.350> a<00:02:21.440> certain<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:22.730> guess<00:02:23.570> wisdom<00:02:24.170> or

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
there's a certain I guess wisdom or

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.520 
there's a certain I guess wisdom or
experience<00:02:25.730> that<00:02:25.820> comes<00:02:26.120> with<00:02:26.330> age<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:27.140> URI

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
experience that comes with age that URI

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.560 
experience that comes with age that URI
seems<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:28.040> have<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.460> and<00:02:28.820> I<00:02:28.910> hope<00:02:29.030> I've<00:02:29.240> gotten

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
seems to have and and I hope I've gotten

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.880 
seems to have and and I hope I've gotten
a<00:02:29.690> little<00:02:29.810> bit<00:02:30.020> of<00:02:30.170> through<00:02:30.650> my<00:02:30.710> life<00:02:32.890> it's

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
a little bit of through my life it's

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.130 
a little bit of through my life it's
tough<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:35.120> compare<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.720> original

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
tough to to compare to the original

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.050 
tough to to compare to the original
Japanese<00:02:36.740> because<00:02:37.340> we<00:02:37.550> see<00:02:37.730> it<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:37.910> said

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
Japanese because we see it and said

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.510 
Japanese because we see it and said
small<00:02:38.300> chunks<00:02:38.810> it's<00:02:39.560> not<00:02:39.770> like<00:02:39.920> we<00:02:40.070> get<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.220> see

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
small chunks it's not like we get to see

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.180 
small chunks it's not like we get to see
the<00:02:40.940> whole<00:02:41.120> thing<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:42.080> our<00:02:42.470> whole<00:02:42.680> episode

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
the whole thing and our whole episode

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.020 
the whole thing and our whole episode
and<00:02:44.260> so<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.350> comparison<00:02:45.620> is<00:02:45.950> line<00:02:46.190> by<00:02:46.430> line<00:02:46.460> so

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
and so the comparison is line by line so

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.960 
and so the comparison is line by line so
I<00:02:47.810> think<00:02:48.170> I'm<00:02:48.260> not<00:02:48.410> very<00:02:48.620> clear<00:02:48.950> on<00:02:49.160> from<00:02:49.700> me

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
I think I'm not very clear on from me

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.870 
I think I'm not very clear on from me
how<00:02:50.900> my<00:02:51.080> character<00:02:51.140> relates<00:02:51.740> to<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.280> the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
how my character relates to the the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.420 
how my character relates to the the
Japanese<00:02:53.270> interpretation<00:02:54.160> because<00:02:55.160> a<00:02:55.190> lot<00:02:55.400> of

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
Japanese interpretation because a lot of

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.180 
Japanese interpretation because a lot of
what<00:02:55.550> we<00:02:55.670> try<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:55.850> do<00:02:56.060> is<00:02:56.470> not<00:02:57.470> imitate<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.010> but

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
what we try to do is not imitate it but

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.390 
what we try to do is not imitate it but
match<00:02:58.430> it<00:02:58.730> in<00:02:59.150> its<00:02:59.600> in<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.709> emotional

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
match it in its in a to emotional

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.660 
match it in its in a to emotional
content<00:03:01.880> or<00:03:02.209> in<00:03:02.600> its<00:03:02.770> local<00:03:03.770> dynamics<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:04.640> a

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
content or in its local dynamics to a

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.640 
content or in its local dynamics to a
certain<00:03:04.910> extent<00:03:05.239> but<00:03:05.989> we<00:03:06.140> need<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.380> interpret

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
certain extent but we need to interpret

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.940 
certain extent but we need to interpret
it<00:03:06.890> for<00:03:07.130> an<00:03:07.630> American<00:03:08.630> audience<00:03:08.750> so<00:03:09.680> that's<00:03:09.800> a

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
it for an American audience so that's a

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.470 
it for an American audience so that's a
lot<00:03:10.100> of<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.280> direction<00:03:10.550> that<00:03:10.700> we<00:03:10.880> get<00:03:11.060> is

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
lot of the direction that we get is

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.750 
lot of the direction that we get is
trying<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.620> make<00:03:12.800> it<00:03:13.989> seem<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.290> same<00:03:15.560> or<00:03:16.459> mean

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
trying to make it seem the same or mean

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.250 
trying to make it seem the same or mean
the<00:03:16.940> same<00:03:17.180> I<00:03:17.420> guess<00:03:17.690> to<00:03:17.780> an<00:03:17.870> American<00:03:18.170> audience

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
the same I guess to an American audience

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.229 
the same I guess to an American audience
that<00:03:18.620> it<00:03:18.709> would<00:03:18.830> for<00:03:19.190> for<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:19.850> Japanese

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
that it would for for the Japanese

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.390 
that it would for for the Japanese
audience<00:03:23.050> approach<00:03:24.050> characters<00:03:24.440> is<00:03:24.680> visually

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
audience approach characters is visually

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.479 
audience approach characters is visually
I<00:03:25.660> need<00:03:26.660> to<00:03:26.750> see<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:26.989> character<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:27.920> sized<00:03:28.250> I

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
I need to see the character and sized I

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.850 
I need to see the character and sized I
took<00:03:28.670> a<00:03:28.700> look<00:03:28.850> at<00:03:29.000> him<00:03:29.120> okay<00:03:29.360> and<00:03:29.989> then<00:03:30.739> you

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
took a look at him okay and then you

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.470 
took a look at him okay and then you
find<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.160> voice<00:03:31.340> so<00:03:31.550> he<00:03:31.730> sounds<00:03:32.000> like<00:03:32.120> this<00:03:32.269> or

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
find the voice so he sounds like this or

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.509 
find the voice so he sounds like this or
he's<00:03:32.600> got<00:03:32.810> I<00:03:32.989> think<00:03:33.350> he's<00:03:33.860> a<00:03:33.890> little<00:03:34.280> higher

each episode and that we didn't know at
the<00:03:57.050> beginning<00:03:57.320> oh<00:03:57.590> that's<00:03:58.310> what<00:03:58.580> that<00:03:58.760> means

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
the beginning oh that's what that means

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
or whatever there was something the

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.660 
or whatever there was something the
sadness<00:04:11.900> that<00:04:12.320> he<00:04:12.440> had<00:04:13.660> that<00:04:15.430> later<00:04:16.430> on<00:04:16.640> I

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
sadness that he had that later on I

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.640 
sadness that he had that later on I
learned<00:04:16.760> that<00:04:17.450> his<00:04:17.600> wife<00:04:17.840> had<00:04:18.049> died<00:04:18.230> and<00:04:18.470> then

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
learned that his wife had died and then

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.009 
learned that his wife had died and then
the<00:04:18.769> whole<00:04:18.890> search<00:04:19.130> for<00:04:19.160> the<00:04:19.370> locket<00:04:19.850> and

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
the whole search for the locket and

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.350 
the whole search for the locket and
everything<00:04:21.019> that<00:04:21.170> kind<00:04:21.260> of<00:04:21.380> went<00:04:21.530> into<00:04:21.650> that

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
everything that kind of went into that

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.060 
everything that kind of went into that
and<00:04:23.360> then<00:04:24.020> his<00:04:24.170> putting<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.500> flowers<00:04:24.800> out<00:04:24.920> in

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
and then his putting the flowers out in

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.860 
and then his putting the flowers out in
space<00:04:25.280> I<00:04:25.550> mean<00:04:25.700> there's<00:04:25.820> a<00:04:25.850> real<00:04:26.240> change<00:04:26.630> that

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
space I mean there's a real change that

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.940 
space I mean there's a real change that
happens<00:04:27.200> I<00:04:27.320> think<00:04:27.350> for<00:04:27.680> Yuri<00:04:27.890> and<00:04:29.740> and<00:04:30.740> he's

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
happens I think for Yuri and and he's

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.730 
happens I think for Yuri and and he's
he's<00:04:31.310> he's<00:04:31.880> moved<00:04:32.210> I<00:04:32.510> don't<00:04:33.350> want<00:04:33.470> to<00:04:33.530> say<00:04:33.620> he's

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
he's he's moved I don't want to say he's

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.650 
he's he's moved I don't want to say he's
moved<00:04:33.950> on<00:04:34.130> but<00:04:34.400> he's<00:04:34.580> come<00:04:34.790> to<00:04:34.820> terms<00:04:35.120> with<00:04:35.240> his

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
moved on but he's come to terms with his

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.510 
moved on but he's come to terms with his
loss<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:36.640> and<00:04:37.640> therefore<00:04:38.860> has<00:04:39.860> moved<00:04:40.100> on<00:04:40.310> in

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
loss and and therefore has moved on in

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.070 
loss and and therefore has moved on in
in<00:04:40.880> life<00:04:41.120> and<00:04:41.390> I<00:04:41.450> think<00:04:41.630> he's<00:04:41.750> now<00:04:43.960> it's<00:04:44.960> not

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
in life and I think he's now it's not

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.010 
in life and I think he's now it's not
quite<00:04:45.290> so<00:04:45.380> sad<00:04:45.800> is<00:04:46.580> he's<00:04:46.910> got<00:04:47.060> some<00:04:47.450> something

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
quite so sad is he's got some something

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.300 
quite so sad is he's got some something
look<00:04:48.200> forward<00:04:48.530> to<00:04:48.680> perhaps<00:04:48.860> I<00:04:51.100> think<00:04:52.100> it<00:04:52.190> was

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
look forward to perhaps I think it was

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.000 
look forward to perhaps I think it was
it<00:04:52.520> was<00:04:52.640> with<00:04:53.300> the<00:04:53.390> whole<00:04:53.510> flowers<00:04:54.080> and<00:04:54.470> and

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
it was with the whole flowers and and

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.670 
it was with the whole flowers and and
his<00:04:55.160> putting<00:04:55.460> flowers<00:04:55.790> out<00:04:55.940> in<00:04:56.090> space<00:04:56.680> there

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
his putting flowers out in space there

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.960 
his putting flowers out in space there
was<00:04:57.770> a<00:04:57.800> lot<00:04:58.100> of<00:04:59.770> of<00:05:00.770> interesting<00:05:01.340> subtleties<00:05:01.820> I

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
was a lot of of interesting subtleties I

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.270 
was a lot of of interesting subtleties I
guess<00:05:02.120> that<00:05:02.300> we<00:05:02.390> were<00:05:02.510> trying<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.870> go<00:05:03.080> for<00:05:03.280> so

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
guess that we were trying to go for so

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.530 
guess that we were trying to go for so
listening<00:05:05.030> to<00:05:06.700> to<00:05:07.700> the<00:05:07.820> inflection<00:05:08.360> of<00:05:08.390> the

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
listening to to the inflection of the

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.260 
listening to to the inflection of the
emotional<00:05:09.130> life<00:05:10.130> that<00:05:10.460> happens<00:05:10.850> through<00:05:11.150> the

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
emotional life that happens through the

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.409 
emotional life that happens through the
Anna<00:05:11.419> camera<00:05:11.690> Boyd<00:05:11.840> episode<00:05:12.290> it<00:05:12.470> is<00:05:13.360> first<00:05:14.360> a

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
Anna camera Boyd episode it is first a

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:15.940 
Anna camera Boyd episode it is first a
couple<00:05:14.660> of<00:05:14.720> episodes<00:05:14.840> where<00:05:15.229> it<00:05:15.800> really

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
couple of episodes where it really

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.740 
couple of episodes where it really
begins<00:05:16.160> to<00:05:16.310> focus<00:05:16.550> in<00:05:16.820> on<00:05:16.910> Yuri<00:05:17.210> and<00:05:17.479> what's

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
begins to focus in on Yuri and what's

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.400 
begins to focus in on Yuri and what's
going<00:05:18.080> on<00:05:18.520> with<00:05:19.520> his<00:05:19.820> search<00:05:20.540> and<00:05:20.870> finding<00:05:21.290> the

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
going on with his search and finding the

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.590 
going on with his search and finding the
locket<00:05:21.860> it<00:05:22.729> was<00:05:22.850> kind<00:05:23.090> of<00:05:23.120> an<00:05:23.240> amazing<00:05:23.450> thing

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
locket it was kind of an amazing thing

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.460 
locket it was kind of an amazing thing
too<00:05:23.960> he<00:05:24.380> actually<00:05:24.560> finds<00:05:25.070> that<00:05:25.340> out<00:05:25.400> there<00:05:26.470> and

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
too he actually finds that out there and

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.360 
too he actually finds that out there and
putting<00:05:27.740> the<00:05:27.800> flowers<00:05:28.130> out<00:05:30.100> so<00:05:31.100> there's<00:05:31.280> I

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
putting the flowers out so there's I

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.250 
putting the flowers out so there's I
think<00:05:31.550> there's<00:05:31.700> a<00:05:31.790> lot<00:05:32.000> of<00:05:32.200> interesting<00:05:33.200> work

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
think there's a lot of interesting work

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.920 
think there's a lot of interesting work
that<00:05:33.440> was<00:05:33.740> done<00:05:34.580> there<00:05:34.760> and<00:05:34.910> more<00:05:35.450> subtle<00:05:35.780> work

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
that was done there and more subtle work

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.140 
that was done there and more subtle work
than<00:05:36.140> that<00:05:36.470> sometimes<00:05:36.860> we<00:05:37.010> get<00:05:37.100> to<00:05:37.250> do<00:05:37.400> been

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
than that sometimes we get to do been

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.480 
than that sometimes we get to do been
doing<00:05:38.330> this<00:05:40.840> when<00:05:41.840> I<00:05:41.870> was<00:05:41.990> young<00:05:42.229> and<00:05:43.220> I've

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
doing this when I was young and I've

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.100 
doing this when I was young and I've
always<00:05:43.700> loved<00:05:43.850> science<00:05:43.880> fiction<00:05:44.510> but<00:05:44.750> in<00:05:44.990> one

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
always loved science fiction but in one

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.870 
always loved science fiction but in one
of<00:05:45.169> my<00:05:45.229> dreams<00:05:45.410> it<00:05:45.680> was<00:05:45.800> always<00:05:45.979> to<00:05:46.280> to<00:05:46.640> get<00:05:46.790> out

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
of my dreams it was always to to get out

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.490 
of my dreams it was always to to get out
into<00:05:47.030> space<00:05:47.210> don't<00:05:48.020> think<00:05:48.200> that's<00:05:48.350> actually

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
into space don't think that's actually

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.960 
into space don't think that's actually
going<00:05:48.710> to<00:05:48.800> happen<00:05:48.979> so<00:05:49.310> it's<00:05:49.460> fun<00:05:49.669> to<00:05:49.700> actually

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
going to happen so it's fun to actually

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.270 
going to happen so it's fun to actually
you<00:05:50.540> know<00:05:50.600> did<00:05:50.930> imagine<00:05:51.530> it<00:05:51.830> and<00:05:51.919> play<00:05:52.130> with<00:05:52.250> it

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
you know did imagine it and play with it

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.400 
you know did imagine it and play with it
within<00:05:52.940> the<00:05:53.180> aspect<00:05:53.540> of<00:05:53.660> a<00:05:54.080> job<00:05:54.260> like<00:05:54.440> this<00:05:56.410> but

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
within the aspect of a job like this but

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.450 
within the aspect of a job like this but
the<00:05:57.500> point<00:05:57.740> of<00:05:57.800> view<00:05:58.070> of<00:05:59.290> debris<00:06:00.290> in<00:06:00.620> space<00:06:00.740> of

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
the point of view of debris in space of

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.070 
the point of view of debris in space of
which<00:06:02.000> there<00:06:02.300> is<00:06:02.330> quite<00:06:02.660> a<00:06:02.690> bit<00:06:02.870> up<00:06:02.960> there

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
which there is quite a bit up there

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.320 
which there is quite a bit up there
already<00:06:03.350> is<00:06:04.220> not<00:06:04.490> something<00:06:04.790> that<00:06:04.910> I<00:06:05.300> think

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
already is not something that I think

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.060 
already is not something that I think
I've<00:06:05.600> thought<00:06:05.630> about<00:06:06.020> before<00:06:06.169> and<00:06:06.620> all<00:06:06.950> the

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
I've thought about before and all the

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.710 
I've thought about before and all the
stuff<00:06:07.340> that's<00:06:07.520> out<00:06:07.729> there<00:06:07.970> and<00:06:08.180> what<00:06:08.630> could

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
stuff that's out there and what could

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.469 
stuff that's out there and what could
happen<00:06:09.020> if<00:06:09.110> you<00:06:09.200> run<00:06:09.380> into<00:06:09.620> it<00:06:09.740> his<00:06:10.280> I<00:06:10.640> think<00:06:11.450> a

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
happen if you run into it his I think a

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.549 
happen if you run into it his I think a
very<00:06:11.510> creative<00:06:12.050> way<00:06:12.200> of<00:06:12.229> approaching<00:06:12.620> it

00:06:14.549 --> 00:06:14.559 
very creative way of approaching it

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:16.559 
very creative way of approaching it
and<00:06:15.279> it's<00:06:15.489> changed<00:06:15.909> a<00:06:15.939> little<00:06:15.999> bit<00:06:16.209> about<00:06:16.419> what

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:16.569 
and it's changed a little bit about what

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:18.149 
and it's changed a little bit about what
I<00:06:16.599> think<00:06:16.689> about<00:06:16.899> you<00:06:17.379> know<00:06:17.469> that<00:06:17.919> there's<00:06:18.099> a

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:18.159 
I think about you know that there's a

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:19.109 
I think about you know that there's a
lot<00:06:18.279> of<00:06:18.339> stuff<00:06:18.489> out<00:06:18.669> there<00:06:18.789> there's<00:06:18.969> not<00:06:19.059> just

00:06:19.109 --> 00:06:19.119 
lot of stuff out there there's not just

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:22.019 
lot of stuff out there there's not just
asteroids<00:06:19.779> and<00:06:20.189> rocks<00:06:21.189> to<00:06:21.429> run<00:06:21.609> into<00:06:21.849> in

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:22.029 
asteroids and rocks to run into in

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:23.609 
asteroids and rocks to run into in
different<00:06:22.299> planets<00:06:22.659> but<00:06:22.839> there's<00:06:23.199> also<00:06:23.409> the

00:06:23.609 --> 00:06:23.619 
different planets but there's also the

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:26.279 
different planets but there's also the
junk<00:06:23.889> that<00:06:24.009> we've<00:06:24.159> sent<00:06:24.369> up<00:06:24.519> there<00:06:24.759> and<00:06:25.089> it<00:06:25.929> may

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:26.289 
junk that we've sent up there and it may

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:27.809 
junk that we've sent up there and it may
be<00:06:26.349> some<00:06:26.799> day<00:06:26.979> that<00:06:27.009> that's<00:06:27.459> something<00:06:27.699> that

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:27.819 
be some day that that's something that

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.479 
be some day that that's something that
happens<00:06:28.209> we<00:06:28.479> have<00:06:28.559> crews<00:06:29.559> up<00:06:29.799> there<00:06:30.039> trying<00:06:30.399> to

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:30.489 
happens we have crews up there trying to

00:06:30.489 --> 00:06:32.789 
happens we have crews up there trying to
clean<00:06:30.699> it<00:06:30.729> up<00:06:30.969> because<00:06:31.239> it<00:06:31.539> could<00:06:31.799> interrupt

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:32.799 
clean it up because it could interrupt

00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:35.489 
clean it up because it could interrupt
the<00:06:33.129> spaceways<00:06:34.059> that<00:06:34.539> we<00:06:35.019> hopefully<00:06:35.289> will

00:06:35.489 --> 00:06:35.499 
the spaceways that we hopefully will

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:40.919 
the spaceways that we hopefully will
travel<00:06:35.829> someday<00:06:39.479> will<00:06:40.479> it's<00:06:40.599> not<00:06:40.719> just

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:40.929 
travel someday will it's not just

00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:44.159 
travel someday will it's not just
garbage<00:06:41.289> in<00:06:41.439> space<00:06:41.709> it's<00:06:42.239> it<00:06:43.239> is<00:06:43.449> the<00:06:43.719> debris

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:44.169 
garbage in space it's it is the debris

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:45.989 
garbage in space it's it is the debris
that's<00:06:44.409> out<00:06:44.679> there<00:06:44.979> and<00:06:45.219> that<00:06:45.639> we've<00:06:45.789> actually

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:45.999 
that's out there and that we've actually

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:49.019 
that's out there and that we've actually
sent<00:06:46.569> out<00:06:46.659> there<00:06:46.899> that<00:06:47.079> that<00:06:47.669> really<00:06:48.669> there

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:49.029 
sent out there that that really there

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:50.159 
sent out there that that really there
are<00:06:49.179> things<00:06:49.419> up<00:06:49.599> there<00:06:49.629> and<00:06:49.839> something<00:06:50.109> that

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:50.169 
are things up there and something that

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:54.779 
are things up there and something that
we<00:06:50.289> will<00:06:50.409> have<00:06:50.529> to<00:06:50.649> think<00:06:50.769> about<00:06:53.429> but<00:06:54.429> any<00:06:54.579> good

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:54.789 
we will have to think about but any good

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:58.619 
we will have to think about but any good
stories<00:06:55.179> character-driven<00:06:55.749> and<00:06:57.479> science<00:06:58.479> is

00:06:58.619 --> 00:06:58.629 
stories character-driven and science is

00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:59.819 
stories character-driven and science is
wonderful<00:06:58.869> and<00:06:59.289> the<00:06:59.349> science<00:06:59.649> is<00:06:59.769> very

00:06:59.819 --> 00:06:59.829 
wonderful and the science is very

00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:02.309 
wonderful and the science is very
interesting<00:07:00.399> because<00:07:00.549> it<00:07:01.299> is<00:07:01.389> there<00:07:02.019> is<00:07:02.109> a<00:07:02.139> lot

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 
interesting because it is there is a lot

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:04.139 
interesting because it is there is a lot
of<00:07:02.439> science<00:07:02.709> a<00:07:02.799> lot<00:07:03.039> of<00:07:03.219> things<00:07:03.789> that<00:07:03.909> we<00:07:03.999> have

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:04.149 
of science a lot of things that we have

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:06.059 
of science a lot of things that we have
to<00:07:04.299> be<00:07:04.449> very<00:07:05.079> specific<00:07:05.259> about<00:07:05.709> you<00:07:05.949> pay

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:06.069 
to be very specific about you pay

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:09.989 
to be very specific about you pay
attention<00:07:06.159> to<00:07:08.159> but<00:07:09.159> it<00:07:09.399> doesn't<00:07:09.459> really<00:07:09.789> mean

00:07:09.989 --> 00:07:09.999 
attention to but it doesn't really mean

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:12.089 
attention to but it doesn't really mean
anything<00:07:10.029> if<00:07:10.539> there's<00:07:11.289> not<00:07:11.499> a<00:07:11.529> relationship

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:12.099 
anything if there's not a relationship

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:13.739 
anything if there's not a relationship
involved<00:07:12.519> if<00:07:12.759> people<00:07:13.119> don't<00:07:13.269> care<00:07:13.479> about<00:07:13.599> it

00:07:13.739 --> 00:07:13.749 
involved if people don't care about it

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:15.689 
involved if people don't care about it
or<00:07:14.019> care<00:07:14.199> about<00:07:14.229> each<00:07:14.469> other<00:07:14.589> and<00:07:15.549> I<00:07:15.669> think

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:15.699 
or care about each other and I think

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:17.369 
or care about each other and I think
it's<00:07:15.939> as<00:07:16.029> this<00:07:16.329> shows<00:07:16.509> a<00:07:16.539> wonderful<00:07:17.079> marriage

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:17.379 
it's as this shows a wonderful marriage

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:21.089 
it's as this shows a wonderful marriage
of<00:07:17.829> that<00:07:18.549> hard<00:07:18.879> science<00:07:19.360> and<00:07:19.659> of<00:07:20.099> interesting

00:07:21.089 --> 00:07:21.099 
of that hard science and of interesting

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:25.189 
of that hard science and of interesting
scientific<00:07:21.669> questions<00:07:22.110> and<00:07:23.110> real<00:07:24.009> emotional

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 
scientific questions and real emotional

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:27.839 
scientific questions and real emotional
relationships<00:07:26.199> that<00:07:26.349> people<00:07:26.619> have<00:07:26.829> or<00:07:27.249> you

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:27.849 
relationships that people have or you

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:30.299 
relationships that people have or you
know<00:07:27.939> could<00:07:28.179> have<00:07:28.529> stuck<00:07:29.529> out<00:07:29.709> in<00:07:29.739> space<00:07:30.039> and

00:07:30.299 --> 00:07:30.309 
know could have stuck out in space and

00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:33.569 
know could have stuck out in space and
how<00:07:30.759> they<00:07:30.879> deal<00:07:31.299> with<00:07:31.679> their<00:07:32.679> jobs<00:07:32.979> and<00:07:33.309> coming

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:33.579 
how they deal with their jobs and coming

00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:35.609 
how they deal with their jobs and coming
back<00:07:33.729> down<00:07:33.879> to<00:07:33.939> earth<00:07:34.089> and<00:07:34.539> the<00:07:35.289> things<00:07:35.319> that

00:07:35.609 --> 00:07:35.619 
back down to earth and the things that

00:07:35.619 --> 00:07:57.770 
back down to earth and the things that
can<00:07:35.829> happen

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:57.780 

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.979 

looks<00:07:58.780> like<00:07:58.960> it<00:07:59.139> just<00:07:59.440> finished
