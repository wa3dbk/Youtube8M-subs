for<00:00:46.829> 4.3<00:00:47.430> k<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.030> probably<00:00:48.270> snatch

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
for 4.3 k but you can probably snatch

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.860 
for 4.3 k but you can probably snatch
one<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:49.559> around<00:00:49.770> 2.5<00:00:50.340> k<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.940> right<00:00:51.210> myth<00:00:51.480> and

one for around 2.5 k on right myth and

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.959 
one for around 2.5 k on right myth and
all<00:00:52.020> right<00:00:52.230> bring<00:00:52.440> I'm<00:00:52.590> not<00:00:52.800> really<00:00:52.980> sure<00:00:53.100> but

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
all right bring I'm not really sure but

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.220 
all right bring I'm not really sure but
you<00:00:54.120> can<00:00:54.239> also<00:00:54.360> convert<00:00:54.750> them<00:00:54.870> yourself

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
you can also convert them yourself

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.479 
you can also convert them yourself
because<00:00:55.469> those<00:00:55.620> costs<00:00:55.920> aren't<00:00:56.190> really

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
because those costs aren't really

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.790 
because those costs aren't really
expensive<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:57.059> what<00:00:57.270> 1.3<00:00:58.079> k<00:00:58.289> or<00:00:58.410> something

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
expensive like what 1.3 k or something

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.160 
expensive like what 1.3 k or something
so<00:00:59.309> that's<00:00:59.460> perfectly<00:00:59.789> affordable<00:01:00.359> anyway<00:01:00.989> he

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
so that's perfectly affordable anyway he

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.850
