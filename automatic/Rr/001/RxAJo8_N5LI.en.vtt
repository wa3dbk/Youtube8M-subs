00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.930
 hello guys girls here we are one day 

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:12.440
 more and today I bring you an application 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.430
 that found the best application for 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.670
 draw what you want 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.200
 on your good android device we are going to 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.160
 try immediately to see what and 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.160
 see how it is 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.590
 I will leave them in the link of the 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.950
 description as you see they have good 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.950
 resolution 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.960
 here we see how we can go back here 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:43.420
 We can choose the type of brush type 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:45.820
 of thickness of the brush the rubber and varied 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.140
 things to me what else what has most 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.559
 liked 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.829
 here are other options to me what more 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:57.449
 I liked this application is that 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:00.670
 you can put cursed trees that is 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.420
 trunks of trees 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.740
 and then put the leaves of the tree and 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.040
 they seem tree point 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:16.549
 how can you make falling leaves not that 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.549
 no and you can not put flowers 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.369
 flowers and put them upside down they come to you 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.070
 reverse is worth so they are always going to be 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.680
 from left to right 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:32.350
 but it's a damn madness 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.350
 and look at hands 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.479
 with hair we go with young hair 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.490
 a column bridge 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.799
 is that a rainbow is crazy 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.590
 and we can see the thickness of the rainbow 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:55.030
 here we can put the professor of 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.030
 rainbow as we want it 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:04.810
 here we choose the color 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.810
 good the pencils the blur is 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.010
 with this you can create thousands of things 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.050
