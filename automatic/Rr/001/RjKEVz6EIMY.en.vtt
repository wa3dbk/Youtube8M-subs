00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.469 
very they've got different articulation
points<00:01:22.280> for<00:01:22.429> doing<00:01:22.610> a<00:01:22.759> bunch<00:01:22.939> of<00:01:23.030> characters

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
points for doing a bunch of characters

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.139 
points for doing a bunch of characters
their<00:01:23.929> arms<00:01:24.530> can<00:01:24.860> articulate<00:01:25.220> their<00:01:25.640> legs<00:01:25.880> and

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
lot of articulation points so you can

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.410 
lot of articulation points so you can
really<00:01:33.590> pose<00:01:33.799> in<00:01:34.009> just<00:01:34.340> however<00:01:35.090> you<00:01:35.240> want
