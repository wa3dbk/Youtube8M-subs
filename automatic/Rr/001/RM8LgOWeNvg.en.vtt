well<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:40.150> get<00:02:40.330> my<00:02:40.450> point<00:02:40.920> finally<00:02:41.920> I<00:02:42.250> found<00:02:42.640> a

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
well you get my point finally I found a

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.119 
well you get my point finally I found a
solution<00:02:43.030> I've<00:02:43.480> started<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.650> look<00:02:44.769> at<00:02:44.950> each

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
solution I've started to look at each

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.830 
solution I've started to look at each
assignment<00:02:45.730> as<00:02:45.819> a<00:02:45.879> multiple<00:02:46.510> step<00:02:46.780> process

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
assignment as a multiple step process

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.800 
assignment as a multiple step process
and<00:02:47.560> schedule<00:02:48.340> some<00:02:48.549> time<00:02:48.580> for<00:02:49.000> each<00:02:49.150> step<00:02:49.569> I

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
and schedule some time for each step I

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.800 
and schedule some time for each step I
actually<00:02:50.799> feel<00:02:51.220> less<00:02:51.489> stressed<00:02:51.880> because<00:02:52.630> I

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
actually feel less stressed because I

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.229 
actually feel less stressed because I
only<00:02:53.079> need<00:02:53.319> to<00:02:53.440> focus<00:02:53.829> on<00:02:53.980> one<00:02:54.280> step<00:02:54.549> at<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.790> time

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
only need to focus on one step at a time

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.069 
only need to focus on one step at a time
a<00:02:56.310> good<00:02:57.310> rule<00:02:57.519> of<00:02:57.549> thumb<00:02:57.700> is<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.209> cut<00:02:58.599> a<00:02:58.630> large

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
a good rule of thumb is to cut a large

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.420 
a good rule of thumb is to cut a large
