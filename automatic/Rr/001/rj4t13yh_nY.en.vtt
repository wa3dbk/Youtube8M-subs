anything<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.010> look<00:01:11.159> at<00:01:11.400> but<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.729> was<00:01:11.850> all<00:01:12.030> about

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
anything to look at but it was all about

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.830 
anything to look at but it was all about
just<00:01:12.810> getting<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.170> ideas

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
just getting the ideas

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.169 
just getting the ideas
at<00:01:13.899> the<00:01:13.990> time<00:01:14.200> I<00:01:14.500> had<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.369> idea<00:01:15.670> clear<00:01:15.939> in<00:01:16.030> my

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
at the time I had the idea clear in my

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:18.599 
at the time I had the idea clear in my
head<00:01:16.210> already<00:01:16.659> I<00:01:17.229> did<00:01:17.770> a<00:01:17.799> few<00:01:18.039> sketches<00:01:18.280> for

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:18.609 
head already I did a few sketches for

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:20.749 
head already I did a few sketches for
the<00:01:18.670> characters<00:01:19.149> that<00:01:19.719> I<00:01:19.750> would<00:01:19.990> be<00:01:20.109> using

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the characters that I would be using

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.709 
the characters that I would be using
eventually<00:01:21.759> imported<00:01:22.149> them<00:01:22.270> into<00:01:22.420> the

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
eventually imported them into the

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.469 
eventually imported them into the
animation<00:01:23.619> program<00:01:23.979> so<00:01:24.850> they<00:01:25.000> can<00:01:25.149> get<00:01:25.299> my

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
animation program so they can get my

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.959 
animation program so they can get my
color<00:01:26.439> palette<00:01:26.649> down<00:01:26.950> in<00:01:27.219> the<00:01:27.310> program<00:01:27.670> and

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
color palette down in the program and

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:29.700 
color palette down in the program and
just<00:01:28.270> pull<00:01:28.450> colors<00:01:28.840> from<00:01:28.990> there<00:01:29.259> if<00:01:29.409> I<00:01:29.530> ever

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
just pull colors from there if I ever

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.459 
just pull colors from there if I ever
doubted<00:01:30.039> my<00:01:30.280> color<00:01:30.490> scheme<00:01:31.439> eventually<00:01:32.439> I

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
doubted my color scheme eventually I

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:33.809 
doubted my color scheme eventually I
developed<00:01:32.740> a<00:01:33.069> process<00:01:33.520> for<00:01:33.670> making

back<00:01:38.319> and<00:01:38.530> redo<00:01:38.859> things<00:01:39.100> so<00:01:39.850> basically<00:01:40.359> I

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
back and redo things so basically I

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.120 
back and redo things so basically I
started<00:01:40.929> with<00:01:41.109> a<00:01:41.140> rough<00:01:41.380> animation<00:01:41.619> with

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
started with a rough animation with

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.910 
started with a rough animation with
basic<00:01:42.490> form<00:01:42.789> then<00:01:43.479> I<00:01:43.600> refine<00:01:44.020> that<00:01:44.229> form<00:01:44.530> by

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
basic form then I refine that form by

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.109 
basic form then I refine that form by
putting<00:01:45.250> in<00:01:45.340> details<00:01:45.729> of<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:45.939> main

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
putting in details of the main

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.910 
putting in details of the main
characters<00:01:46.659> and<00:01:46.869> then<00:01:46.989> cleaning<00:01:47.619> up<00:01:47.770> the

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
characters and then cleaning up the

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.460 
characters and then cleaning up the
lines<00:01:48.130> after<00:01:48.610> that<00:01:49.149> I<00:01:49.329> copied<00:01:49.840> those<00:01:50.020> cells<00:01:50.289> to

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
lines after that I copied those cells to

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.109 
lines after that I copied those cells to
a<00:01:50.500> new<00:01:50.739> layer<00:01:50.920> so<00:01:50.979> that<00:01:51.340> I<00:01:51.429> can<00:01:51.610> flood<00:01:51.909> fill

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
a new layer so that I can flood fill

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.899 
a new layer so that I can flood fill
them<00:01:52.329> with<00:01:52.360> base<00:01:52.750> colors<00:01:53.229> of<00:01:53.409> the<00:01:53.469> characters

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
them with base colors of the characters

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.190 
them with base colors of the characters
then<00:01:54.909> I'd<00:01:55.060> make<00:01:55.329> another<00:01:55.659> copy<00:01:55.929> of<00:01:56.079> the

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
then I'd make another copy of the

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.870 
then I'd make another copy of the
outline<00:01:56.560> cells<00:01:56.829> and<00:01:57.099> use<00:01:57.250> a<00:01:57.280> semi-transparent

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
outline cells and use a semi-transparent

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.819 
outline cells and use a semi-transparent
tool<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.539> add<00:01:58.659> shading<00:01:59.049> to<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.319> characters

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
tool to add shading to the characters

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.249 
tool to add shading to the characters
then<00:02:00.579> I<00:02:00.909> would<00:02:01.239> just<00:02:01.390> do<00:02:01.509> a<00:02:01.539> background<00:02:01.869> in<00:02:02.170> a

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
then I would just do a background in a

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.469 
then I would just do a background in a
2d<00:02:02.560> paint<00:02:02.829> program<00:02:03.219> and<00:02:03.729> slap<00:02:03.969> it<00:02:04.119> in<00:02:04.209> the<00:02:04.299> back

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
2d paint program and slap it in the back

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.139 
2d paint program and slap it in the back
had<00:02:05.049> some<00:02:05.259> special<00:02:05.590> effects<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.129> presto

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
had some special effects and presto

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.969 
had some special effects and presto
there<00:02:07.959> were<00:02:08.049> a<00:02:08.079> few<00:02:08.170> scenes<00:02:08.500> that<00:02:08.679> needed

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
there were a few scenes that needed

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.919 
there were a few scenes that needed
special<00:02:09.190> attention<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.789> layer<00:02:10.000> ordering<00:02:10.509> -<00:02:10.720> I

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
special attention to layer ordering - I

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.420 
special attention to layer ordering - I
had<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.349> make<00:02:11.500> sure<00:02:11.530> some<00:02:11.950> scene<00:02:12.220> elements

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
had to make sure some scene elements

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.430 
had to make sure some scene elements
were<00:02:12.790> overlapping<00:02:13.269> properly<00:02:14.019> so<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.260> it

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
were overlapping properly so that it

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.140 
were overlapping properly so that it
would<00:02:14.739> convince<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.340> viewer<00:02:15.610> into<00:02:15.879> believing

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
would convince the viewer into believing

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.449 
would convince the viewer into believing
the<00:02:16.329> depth<00:02:16.629> of<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.900> scene<00:02:17.110> sometimes<00:02:17.829> an<00:02:18.190> arm

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
the depth of the scene sometimes an arm

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:18.990 
the depth of the scene sometimes an arm
or<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.730> leg

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
or a leg

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.849 
or a leg
of<00:02:19.299> a<00:02:19.480> character<00:02:19.840> needed<00:02:20.049> to<00:02:20.230> be<00:02:20.410> added

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:20.859 
of a character needed to be added

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.140 
of a character needed to be added
separately<00:02:21.160> because<00:02:21.519> it<00:02:21.730> was<00:02:21.850> underneath

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
separately because it was underneath

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.910 
separately because it was underneath
another<00:02:22.510> character<00:02:23.079> and<00:02:23.319> it<00:02:23.410> ended<00:02:23.590> up<00:02:23.739> not

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
another character and it ended up not

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.490 
another character and it ended up not
looking<00:02:24.100> right<00:02:24.489> and<00:02:24.810> there<00:02:25.810> were<00:02:25.930> also<00:02:26.139> some

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
looking right and there were also some

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.840 
looking right and there were also some
instances<00:02:26.950> where<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.190> background<00:02:27.670> would

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
instances where the background would

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.370 
instances where the background would
have<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.180> interact<00:02:28.450> with<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.870> foreground

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
have to interact with the foreground

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.289 
have to interact with the foreground
which<00:02:29.769> was<00:02:29.980> also<00:02:30.310> another<00:02:30.519> problem<00:02:30.849> that<00:02:31.150> was

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
which was also another problem that was

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.099 
which was also another problem that was
solved<00:02:31.630> through<00:02:31.810> layer<00:02:31.989> ordering<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.900> for

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
solved through layer ordering so for

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:36.599 
solved through layer ordering so for
instance<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:35.709> would<00:02:35.769> layer<00:02:36.040> it<00:02:36.190> from<00:02:36.400> back<00:02:36.579> to

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
instance I would layer it from back to

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.789 
instance I would layer it from back to
front<00:02:36.910> as<00:02:37.239> I<00:02:37.569> started<00:02:38.380> with<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.530> background

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
front as I started with a background

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.770 
front as I started with a background
sketch<00:02:39.340> then<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:39.819> put<00:02:40.060> in<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.239> rushing<00:02:40.569> water

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
sketch then I put in the rushing water

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.349 
sketch then I put in the rushing water
and<00:02:41.319> also<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.739> water<00:02:42.040> from<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.370> pipes<00:02:42.639> then<00:02:43.209> I

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
and also the water from the pipes then I

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.569 
and also the water from the pipes then I
threw<00:02:43.569> in<00:02:43.690> some<00:02:43.720> falling<00:02:44.230> bricks<00:02:44.500> Killer<00:02:45.370> Croc

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
threw in some falling bricks Killer Croc

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.240 
threw in some falling bricks Killer Croc
goes<00:02:45.880> down<00:02:46.120> Bane<00:02:46.900> goes<00:02:47.169> down<00:02:47.380> then<00:02:47.829> killer

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
goes down Bane goes down then killer

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.270 
goes down Bane goes down then killer
Crocs<00:02:48.609> overlay<00:02:49.150> leg<00:02:49.419> over<00:02:49.930> Bane<00:02:50.139> then<00:02:50.859> Robin

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
Crocs overlay leg over Bane then Robin

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.059 
Crocs overlay leg over Bane then Robin
falls<00:02:51.519> more<00:02:52.209> bricks<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.810> then<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.739> final

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
falls more bricks and then the final

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.520 
falls more bricks and then the final
scene<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.840> finally<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:56.049> backgrounds

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
scene and finally the backgrounds

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.110 
scene and finally the backgrounds
themselves<00:02:57.010> took<00:02:57.190> quite<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.430> bit<00:02:57.639> of<00:02:57.700> time<00:02:57.940> to

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
themselves took quite a bit of time to

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.449 
themselves took quite a bit of time to
create<00:02:58.329> I<00:02:58.660> use<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.410> layering<00:02:59.680> technique<00:03:00.190> as<00:03:00.310> I

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
create I use the layering technique as I

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.030 
create I use the layering technique as I
did<00:03:00.639> in<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.790> 2d<00:03:01.090> animation<00:03:01.660> program<00:03:02.019> first<00:03:02.919> I

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
did in the 2d animation program first I

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.559 
did in the 2d animation program first I
sketched<00:03:03.340> out<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.579> basic<00:03:04.120> physical

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
sketched out the basic physical

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:05.610 
sketched out the basic physical
environment<00:03:05.079> of<00:03:05.169> the<00:03:05.230> scene<00:03:05.440> in<00:03:05.560> the

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
environment of the scene in the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.409 
environment of the scene in the
animation<00:03:06.040> program<00:03:06.340> just<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:07.030> get<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.269> rough

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:07.419 
animation program just to get the rough

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:08.940 
animation program just to get the rough
idea<00:03:07.569> the<00:03:07.930> elements<00:03:08.380> that<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.590> character

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
idea the elements that the character

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.580 
idea the elements that the character
will<00:03:09.099> interact<00:03:09.370> with<00:03:09.900> then<00:03:10.900> I<00:03:10.930> would<00:03:11.200> import

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
will interact with then I would import

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.289 
will interact with then I would import
that<00:03:11.709> steel<00:03:12.010> frame<00:03:12.280> into<00:03:12.549> the<00:03:12.579> paint<00:03:12.910> program

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
that steel frame into the paint program

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.659 
that steel frame into the paint program
I'd<00:03:13.870> create<00:03:14.230> another<00:03:14.530> few<00:03:14.829> layers<00:03:15.040> for<00:03:15.459> each

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:15.669 
I'd create another few layers for each

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:17.339 
I'd create another few layers for each
major<00:03:16.090> element<00:03:16.599> in<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.720> background<00:03:17.169> and

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
major element in the background and

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:18.990 
major element in the background and
create<00:03:17.530> basic<00:03:17.980> geometric<00:03:18.190> shapes<00:03:18.549> and<00:03:18.940> these

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
create basic geometric shapes and these

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.330 
create basic geometric shapes and these
base<00:03:19.239> layers<00:03:19.480> after<00:03:19.750> that<00:03:20.349> I<00:03:20.590> created<00:03:20.950> another

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
base layers after that I created another

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.650 
base layers after that I created another
set<00:03:21.579> of<00:03:21.669> layers<00:03:21.879> for<00:03:22.180> adding

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
set of layers for adding

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.260 
set of layers for adding
to<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.020> basic<00:03:23.350> shapes<00:03:23.590> then<00:03:24.580> I<00:03:24.850> created

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
to the basic shapes then I created

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.480 
to the basic shapes then I created
another<00:03:25.750> set<00:03:26.020> of<00:03:26.110> layers<00:03:26.380> for<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.100> detailed

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
another set of layers for the detailed

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.850 
another set of layers for the detailed
shapes<00:03:27.790> for<00:03:28.030> each<00:03:28.240> base<00:03:28.630> shape<00:03:28.930> for<00:03:29.470> Windows

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
shapes for each base shape for Windows

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.920 
shapes for each base shape for Windows
and<00:03:30.040> other<00:03:30.220> geometric<00:03:30.850> structures<00:03:31.300> I<00:03:31.360> create

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
and other geometric structures I create

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.960 
and other geometric structures I create
another<00:03:32.230> layer<00:03:32.500> just<00:03:33.070> as<00:03:33.310> a<00:03:33.340> guide<00:03:33.580> for

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
another layer just as a guide for

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.340 
another layer just as a guide for
creating<00:03:34.090> windows<00:03:34.600> so<00:03:34.750> that<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:34.930> windows

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
creating windows so that the windows

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.220 
creating windows so that the windows
follow<00:03:35.590> proper<00:03:35.980> perspective<00:03:37.050> after<00:03:38.050> all

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
follow proper perspective after all

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.810 
follow proper perspective after all
that's<00:03:38.380> done<00:03:38.740> the<00:03:38.920> final<00:03:39.130> layer<00:03:39.430> is<00:03:39.460> looking

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
that's done the final layer is looking

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.710 
that's done the final layer is looking
for<00:03:40.030> having<00:03:40.330> dramatic<00:03:40.810> lighting<00:03:41.080> in<00:03:41.350> shadows

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
for having dramatic lighting in shadows

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.030 
for having dramatic lighting in shadows
it<00:03:43.720> was<00:03:43.840> hard<00:03:44.110> to<00:03:44.170> stay<00:03:44.290> focused<00:03:44.410> near<00:03:44.920> to<00:03:44.980> the

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
it was hard to stay focused near to the

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.800 
it was hard to stay focused near to the
end<00:03:45.160> of<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.370> project<00:03:45.610> but<00:03:46.210> then<00:03:46.360> it's<00:03:46.540> like<00:03:46.600> I

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
end of the project but then it's like I

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.360 
end of the project but then it's like I
had<00:03:47.020> doubts<00:03:47.350> of<00:03:47.590> whether<00:03:47.860> or<00:03:48.010> not<00:03:48.130> it'd<00:03:48.340> be

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
had doubts of whether or not it'd be

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.090 
had doubts of whether or not it'd be
good<00:03:48.730> whether<00:03:49.300> or<00:03:49.450> not<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.600> should<00:03:49.690> keep<00:03:49.990> going

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
good whether or not I should keep going

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.170 
good whether or not I should keep going
several<00:03:51.100> times<00:03:51.280> I<00:03:51.430> was<00:03:51.550> sidetracked<00:03:51.820> by

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
several times I was sidetracked by

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.060 
several times I was sidetracked by
things<00:03:52.450> during<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.840> projection<00:03:53.320> just<00:03:53.890> like

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
things during the projection just like

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.590 
things during the projection just like
ordinary<00:03:54.310> life<00:03:54.790> stuff<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.300> I<00:03:55.360> was<00:03:55.480> even

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
ordinary life stuff and I was even

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.510 
ordinary life stuff and I was even
tempted<00:03:56.080> to<00:03:56.140> go<00:03:56.260> back<00:03:56.470> to<00:03:56.620> other<00:03:56.710> projects<00:03:57.220> but

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
tempted to go back to other projects but

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.340 
tempted to go back to other projects but
I<00:03:58.330> kept<00:03:58.600> myself<00:03:58.900> going<00:03:59.140> by<00:04:00.780> Billy<00:04:01.780> around<00:04:01.990> me

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
I kept myself going by Billy around me

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.290 
I kept myself going by Billy around me
stuff<00:04:02.680> that<00:04:02.710> family<00:04:03.640> and<00:04:03.730> friends<00:04:03.970> had<00:04:04.060> given

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
to feel my motivation I also kept the

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.020 
to feel my motivation I also kept the
spreadsheet<00:04:08.800> of<00:04:08.830> what<00:04:09.070> scenes<00:04:09.370> had<00:04:09.610> been<00:04:09.790> done

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
spreadsheet of what scenes had been done

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.330

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
and what hadn't been done and I'd fill

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.950

it<00:04:12.490> out<00:04:12.550> as<00:04:12.760> I<00:04:12.850> went<00:04:12.970> along<00:04:13.210> and<00:04:13.390> I<00:04:13.810> had

it out as I went along and I had

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.050 
it out as I went along and I had
followed<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.860> spreadsheet<00:04:15.400> right<00:04:15.580> to<00:04:15.970> the

very end through eight long months of
work<00:04:17.650> if<00:04:17.890> finishing<00:04:18.520> the<00:04:18.609> project<00:04:18.790> wasn't

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
work if finishing the project wasn't

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.970 
work if finishing the project wasn't
enough<00:04:19.450> to<00:04:19.570> convince<00:04:19.750> me<00:04:20.049> I<00:04:20.080> was<00:04:20.140> done<00:04:20.500> filling

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
enough to convince me I was done filling

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.120 
enough to convince me I was done filling
in<00:04:21.100> all<00:04:21.160> those<00:04:21.370> zeros<00:04:21.730> in<00:04:21.820> my<00:04:21.850> spreadsheet<00:04:22.180> was

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
in all those zeros in my spreadsheet was

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.860 
in all those zeros in my spreadsheet was
so<00:04:24.130> that's<00:04:24.460> how<00:04:24.670> I<00:04:24.700> did<00:04:24.940> nightfall<00:04:25.390> and<00:04:25.660> I'm

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
so that's how I did nightfall and I'm

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.870 
so that's how I did nightfall and I'm
glad<00:04:26.110> I<00:04:26.140> completed<00:04:26.650> it<00:04:26.860> and<00:04:27.130> I'm<00:04:27.280> glad<00:04:27.490> I<00:04:27.520> did

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
glad I completed it and I'm glad I did

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.490 
glad I completed it and I'm glad I did
because<00:04:28.300> I<00:04:28.420> think<00:04:28.480> nightfall<00:04:29.080> is<00:04:29.230> one<00:04:29.410> of

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
because I think nightfall is one of

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.110 
because I think nightfall is one of
those<00:04:29.590> Batman<00:04:30.100> stories<00:04:30.490> that<00:04:30.670> everyone

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
those Batman stories that everyone

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.450 
those Batman stories that everyone
should<00:04:31.330> know<00:04:31.360> about<00:04:31.540> I<00:04:32.020> feel<00:04:32.830> that<00:04:33.010> it's<00:04:33.190> just

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
should know about I feel that it's just

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.100 
should know about I feel that it's just
as<00:04:33.550> much<00:04:33.790> a<00:04:33.820> part<00:04:34.120> of<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.300> Batman<00:04:34.660> legend<00:04:35.050> as

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
as much a part of the Batman legend as

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.170 
as much a part of the Batman legend as
the<00:04:35.230> death<00:04:35.440> of<00:04:35.560> his<00:04:35.710> parents<00:04:35.950> it's<00:04:36.820> about<00:04:37.030> to

the death of his parents it's about to
