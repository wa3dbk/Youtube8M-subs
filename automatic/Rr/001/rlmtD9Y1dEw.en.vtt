00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello everyone today we are going to talk about a 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.799
 cube and super super interesting a 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.290
 cube and what I had been waiting for 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.800
 a lot of time and the wait has deserved 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:15.660
 worth it of course where is it here 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.170
 is the 443 there is a cube and of 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.039
 excellent I do not find it practically 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.070
 no problem you see that it turns 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.210
 perfectly let's see here a pattern 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.650
 to give the contrast of the stickers 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.119
 because you already know that cubes from 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.219
 there they are has very soft colors 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.170
 a perfect contrast you see the blue and the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.180
 green you're going to put a little zoom that 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.070
 it's been a while since I zoomed in on the blue 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.960
 and the green ones look perfectly are 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.730
 soft very nice the red and the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.840
 orange also and you see that yellow and 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:49.140
 the white also without problem as a fish 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.210
 where are you there are we are going to leave the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.210
 things as they were I already had 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.190
 others like and from there the 44 by 5 the 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.119
 first cube and from there I had this 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.159
 from here excellent as the first day 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:09.030
 awesome you can also see the colors 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.030
 let's see here 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.270
 the signature there is not that he has taken 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.690
 many dance but the truth every time 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.160
 that takes out one because it's excellent and 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.570
 I had also bought 554 this one from 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.790
 here this one is impressive 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.730
 fact is my favorite are worth 3 2 3 me 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.440
 I am without doubt with 5 54 this is this 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.050
 it's a beast let's leave this is for 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.630
 here is that besides the turn of these 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.000
 layers 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.460
 I love I love this sound one of 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.240
 my first videos by the way the video 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.950
 of the cube and 554 to see I think if 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.810
 you like the ones like today if you like it 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.899
 for example the two by two by three 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.329
 the three times three times two and you do not want 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.729
 move directly to this to 5 5 4 or 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.130
 to 773 from thrive because not so 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.560
 I recommend this the 443 because it is a 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.869
 intermediate point is not too much 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.819
 complicated but it's not too much 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.890
 quick a cube that is solved like that in 30 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.619
 seconds not then I think it has a 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.120
 perfect balance 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.410
 effectively as is being commented has 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.690
 come the time to undo 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.849
 completely the cube and you owe what photo 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.319
 so perfect three cubes family is 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.650
 excellent if the cube but I will set aside 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.269
 this is a little bit 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.420
 first of all I love doing this 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.840
 algorithm which 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.390
 because because it is very powerful trade-off 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.400
 three pieces this is there is three 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.530
 pieces or three blocks of pieces we can 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.599
 exchange blocks and the truth is this 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.430
 this algorithm super useful in coupons 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.660
 I have already said many times you 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.420
 swap three pieces is an algorithm 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.530
 fast and simple and you can practically 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.380
 solve any care with this 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.170
 good algorithm and with some other but 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.690
 but come on, it's very powerful, let's go 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.000
 undo it and you can see that I'm being 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.340
 aggressive with this as eddie there is 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.220
 some problem there is no problem 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.860
 It has a very good turning quality 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.959
 it also has some flexibility 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.450
 let's see him to see us have a 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.069
 extreme corner cutting but you see that 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.650
 if it's a little out of phase 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.569
 well, it adapts, and that's always 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.790
 nice because one never completes 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.430
 perfectly turns not always 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.499
 So you stay like this more or less then 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.900
 you have to have some flexibility 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:24.850
 to continue stretching cube and by the way 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.850
 it does not deform 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.460
 the 443 is not deformed because it is not 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:35.980
 possible, as you can see, the 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:38.140
 445 nor the 55 4 is worth 55 45 54 are always 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.910
 they always have the same shape 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.860
 I do not wish there in the future if you house 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.840
 continue to market we are going to 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.460
 examine it with the zoom and we have 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.440
 undone continue to market 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.890
 cubes des of such extreme quality 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:56.080
 because not a five by five by six or 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:58.810
 maybe a 4x4 for seven the truth is 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.280
 I'll give me would be very happy we can 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.260
 solve this cube and in many ways 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.330
 for example I like to match 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.800
 first the centers you see that these two 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.220
 green are these two blue already 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.600
 are these because it is very simple 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.790
 we do this we would also have this 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.590
 block and then I do the yellow center and 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.350
 the white center is also made 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.970
 you quickly see that I would have them 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.770
 matched would have the centers and then 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.720
 it matched the edges because of some 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.920
 way as in the 4x4 making sure the 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.530
 jce not for example I want to match 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.530
 is with this one because I put it here first 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.860
 I turn this this level so they are already paired 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.199
 He stored it up here 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.789
 and left things as they were and for 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.020
 example these have also formed the 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.150
 matched up here also with the 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.710
 compaÃ±eras and we would have two 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.620
 paired well to leave another one 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.360
 example I do not know to see what we have here 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.840
 for example these things we can 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:58.020
 match I do not put it here first the 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.789
 matched and would have 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.440
 this was also matched if 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:04.379
 Effectively it is already measured would have 4 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.110
 paired here I have two and now 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:09.419
 would put this here would have matched in 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.759
 couple of couple as a couple and then 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.889
 would match the last four that happens 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:15.479
 Nothing simply does not happen 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.310
 would the centers have the edges 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.659
 paired and then you solve it at last 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.490
 and finally like a three by three by two 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:22.680
 with one more level no or be you first 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.900
 you do this level of the medium that does not have 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.250
 no problem because 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.530
 it is simply to make turns of this 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.300
 style and it is already put only as you can see 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.250
 this level has no problem and then what 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.919
 would solve like a three by three by two 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.050
 and it's ok it 's a cube and very 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.659
 interesting and I recommend it without a doubt 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.940
 some because it turns perfectly and is 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:44.310
 entertaining but I'm going to say goodbye here 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.849
 with the typical question and by the way 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:52.190
 size to see here I have a 4x4 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:55.460
 if I remember correctly, you see good 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.480
 He is comfortable in a convoy of hands worth 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:01.070
 it's not too small and too 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:04.000
 big which ones like the 4x4 more for five 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:07.300
 a perfect tower 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.770
 5 by 5 by 4 this I think I 'm still 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.420
 it's still my favorite but I do not know 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.970
 tell this one still because it's new and 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.140
 I do not want to hurt your feelings but 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.580
 I think this still still like me 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.930
 because because it is a beast not to me 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.790
 I've always liked cubes 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.260
 big ones either without going through 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.030
 example if you are already at the level of the peta 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.440
 ming and becomes boring 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.930
 by the way you know they have just announced 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.670
 a 15 by 15 not without if I remember correctly 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.440
 they had announced a 13 for 13 a 15 for 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.730
 15 that I think is something extreme and 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.770
 final is a bit boring but something like that 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.720
 without reaching that extreme for example a 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.000
 554 is perfect 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.100
 well which ones like this more or the 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.800
 novelty 443 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:46.390
 Anyway are three very good I 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:50.010
 I say goodbye here as always a greeting 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:50.010
 and see you in another video
