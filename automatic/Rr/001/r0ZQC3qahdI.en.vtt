ankle<00:02:50.830> articulation<00:02:52.680> now<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.740> ankles<00:02:54.160> are<00:02:54.370> a

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
ankle articulation now the ankles are a

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.340 
ankle articulation now the ankles are a
little<00:02:54.940> weak<00:02:55.150> on<00:02:55.360> this<00:02:55.600> figure<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:56.230> have

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
little weak on this figure so you have

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.600 
little weak on this figure so you have
to<00:02:56.440> be<00:02:56.530> careful<00:02:56.890> when<00:02:56.980> standing<00:02:57.400> him<00:02:57.520> up

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
to be careful when standing him up

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.680 
to be careful when standing him up
imposing<00:02:58.180> them<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.970> only<00:03:01.300> part<00:03:01.570> of<00:03:01.600> the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
imposing them the only part of the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.540 
imposing them the only part of the
figure<00:03:01.810> that's<00:03:02.080> really<00:03:02.590> hindered<00:03:03.040> is<00:03:03.250> the

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
figure that's really hindered is the

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.479 
figure that's really hindered is the
head<00:03:03.760> because<00:03:04.690> of<00:03:04.840> his<00:03:04.959> really<00:03:05.470> large<00:03:05.800> beard

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
head because of his really large beard

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.300 
head because of his really large beard
his<00:03:07.060> head<00:03:07.450> actually<00:03:07.900> does<00:03:08.170> not<00:03:08.320> articulate<00:03:08.920> at

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
his head actually does not articulate at

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.710 
his head actually does not articulate at
all

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.660

also see that the bow features holes on
either<00:05:11.490> end<00:05:11.840> this<00:05:12.840> is<00:05:13.050> so<00:05:13.169> that<00:05:13.319> if<00:05:13.410> you<00:05:13.530> want

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
either end this is so that if you want

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.320 
either end this is so that if you want
to<00:05:13.949> you<00:05:14.130> can<00:05:14.310> actually<00:05:14.699> string<00:05:15.060> your<00:05:15.210> own

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
to you can actually string your own

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.230 
to you can actually string your own
string<00:05:15.660> on<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:16.020> bow<00:05:16.699> toys<00:05:17.699> can't<00:05:18.060> actually

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
string on the bow toys can't actually

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.760 
string on the bow toys can't actually
come<00:05:18.660> with<00:05:18.690> strings<00:05:19.199> on<00:05:19.380> them<00:05:19.560> anymore

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
come with strings on them anymore

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.560 
come with strings on them anymore
because<00:05:19.979> it's<00:05:20.250> a<00:05:20.310> safety<00:05:20.550> hazard<00:05:20.820> if<00:05:21.150> it

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
because it's a safety hazard if it

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.480 
because it's a safety hazard if it
actually<00:05:21.840> had<00:05:21.990> a<00:05:22.020> string<00:05:22.380> band<00:05:23.099> I<00:05:23.220> would<00:05:23.400> have

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
actually had a string band I would have

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.490 
actually had a string band I would have
had<00:05:23.639> to<00:05:23.820> glue<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.360> arrow<00:05:24.570> to<00:05:24.720> the<00:05:24.870> bow<00:05:25.169> so<00:05:25.470> I

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
had to glue the arrow to the bow so I

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.629 
had to glue the arrow to the bow so I
think<00:05:25.590> it's<00:05:25.830> kind<00:05:25.949> of<00:05:26.070> cool<00:05:26.190> that<00:05:26.370> they<00:05:26.460> went

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
think it's kind of cool that they went

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.310 
think it's kind of cool that they went
this<00:05:26.789> route<00:05:27.030> by<00:05:27.270> allowing<00:05:27.720> you<00:05:27.930> to<00:05:28.050> add<00:05:28.169> your

own string now here's the only real
issue<00:05:32.220> with<00:05:32.699> this<00:05:33.020> because<00:05:34.020> of<00:05:34.139> the<00:05:34.289> bulky

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
issue with this because of the bulky

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.050 
issue with this because of the bulky
body<00:05:34.949> on<00:05:35.190> Grune<00:05:35.490> that<00:05:35.669> limits<00:05:35.970> his

body on Grune that limits his
articulation<00:05:36.360> there<00:05:37.349> is<00:05:37.440> no<00:05:37.740> good<00:05:38.039> way<00:05:38.220> to

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
articulation there is no good way to

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.189 
articulation there is no good way to
have<00:05:38.580> him<00:05:38.699> hold<00:05:38.970> this<00:05:39.150> bow<00:05:39.360> and<00:05:39.539> arrow<00:05:39.690> as<00:05:39.960> if

have him hold this bow and arrow as if

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.189 
have him hold this bow and arrow as if
he's<00:05:40.349> firing<00:05:40.680> it<00:05:41.070> in<00:05:41.280> fact<00:05:42.150> there's<00:05:42.659> not<00:05:42.870> a<00:05:42.930> lot

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
he's firing it in fact there's not a lot

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.839 
he's firing it in fact there's not a lot
of<00:05:43.349> good<00:05:43.500> ways<00:05:43.650> to<00:05:43.860> actually<00:05:44.009> pose<00:05:44.490> him<00:05:44.699> with
