00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.429 
smell so I feel like this one is a good
balance<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.329> everything<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:49.110> and

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
balance of everything that I like and

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.359 
balance of everything that I like and
this<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.950> redkin<00:01:50.729> powder<00:01:51.329> fresh<00:01:51.659> one<00:01:52.369> 4:01

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
this is the redkin powder fresh one 4:01

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.719 
this is the redkin powder fresh one 4:01
and<00:01:54.020> it's<00:01:55.020> an<00:01:55.110> aerosol<00:01:55.470> spray<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.979> think<00:01:56.430> most

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
and it's an aerosol spray I think most

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.950 
and it's an aerosol spray I think most
of<00:01:56.880> them<00:01:57.030> are

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
of them are

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.530 
of them are
and<00:01:59.320> yeah<00:02:00.160> it's<00:02:00.490> just<00:02:00.670> it's<00:02:01.090> great<00:02:01.300> there's

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
and yeah it's just it's great there's

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.870 
and yeah it's just it's great there's
like<00:02:01.780> you<00:02:01.900> don't<00:02:02.050> see<00:02:02.380> anything<00:02:02.680> come<00:02:03.250> out<00:02:03.400> and

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
like you don't see anything come out and

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.630 
like you don't see anything come out and
you<00:02:04.660> don't<00:02:04.840> see<00:02:05.050> like<00:02:05.260> a<00:02:05.290> powdery<00:02:05.830> finish<00:02:06.280> to

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
you don't see like a powdery finish to

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.520 
you don't see like a powdery finish to
the<00:02:06.760> hair<00:02:06.940> it<00:02:07.420> just<00:02:07.450> like<00:02:07.870> seems<00:02:08.200> like<00:02:08.380> the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
the hair it just like seems like the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.169 
the hair it just like seems like the
second<00:02:08.800> you<00:02:08.890> spray<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.460> the<00:02:09.580> aerosol<00:02:09.940> sprays

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
second you spray and the aerosol sprays

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.640 
second you spray and the aerosol sprays
really<00:02:10.450> like<00:02:10.750> nice<00:02:11.020> that<00:02:11.260> it<00:02:11.350> feels<00:02:11.500> like<00:02:11.560> it's

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
really like nice that it feels like it's

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.280 
really like nice that it feels like it's
just<00:02:11.860> so<00:02:12.550> much<00:02:12.700> air<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.360> like<00:02:13.510> fresh<00:02:13.780> air<00:02:14.020> that

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
just so much air and like fresh air that

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.560 
just so much air and like fresh air that
it<00:02:14.500> seems<00:02:14.770> like<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.100> just<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:16.060> second<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:16.390> put

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
it seems like it just the second you put

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.910 
it seems like it just the second you put
it<00:02:16.660> on<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:16.900> just<00:02:17.050> seems<00:02:17.200> like<00:02:17.230> it's<00:02:17.470> sucking<00:02:17.680> at

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
it on it just seems like it's sucking at

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.100 
it on it just seems like it's sucking at
the<00:02:17.950> oil<00:02:18.280> that's<00:02:18.580> what<00:02:18.790> it's<00:02:18.940> doing<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:19.270> so<00:02:20.080> I

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
the oil that's what it's doing so so I

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.080 
the oil that's what it's doing so so I
wash<00:02:20.320> my<00:02:20.470> hair<00:02:20.680> every<00:02:20.709> other<00:02:21.130> day<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.640> I

wash my hair every other day and I

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.449 
wash my hair every other day and I
typically<00:02:22.810> use<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.230> on<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.680> second<00:02:24.040> day<00:02:24.160> so

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
typically use it on the second day so

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.520 
typically use it on the second day so
the<00:02:24.580> day<00:02:24.700> that<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:24.880> didn't<00:02:25.209> don't<00:02:25.990> wash<00:02:26.140> my<00:02:26.350> hair

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.680 
gave her and that it gave her so much
volume<00:02:57.580> and<00:02:57.850> I<00:02:57.910> was<00:02:58.030> like<00:02:58.150> that's<00:02:58.360> pretty

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
volume and I was like that's pretty

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.479 
volume and I was like that's pretty
awesome<00:02:59.050> so<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.200> actually<00:02:59.410> started<00:02:59.620> trying

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
awesome so I actually started trying

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.640 
awesome so I actually started trying
that<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.239> actually<00:03:01.510> do<00:03:01.930> love<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.440> myself

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
that and I actually do love it myself

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.009 
that and I actually do love it myself
and<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.310> think<00:03:03.580> instead<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.180> like<00:03:04.450> waiting<00:03:04.720> till

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
and I think instead of like waiting till

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.780 
and I think instead of like waiting till
it<00:03:05.049> gets<00:03:05.230> oily<00:03:05.620> like<00:03:05.769> when<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.070> do<00:03:06.220> that<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:06.580> I

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
it gets oily like when you do that it I

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.460 
it gets oily like when you do that it I
feel<00:03:07.150> like<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.420> just<00:03:07.630> kind<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:07.870> slows<00:03:08.110> down<00:03:08.350> the

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
feel like it just kind of slows down the

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.410 
feel like it just kind of slows down the
process<00:03:08.680> of<00:03:09.100> your<00:03:09.250> hair<00:03:09.400> getting<00:03:09.610> oily<00:03:09.940> so<00:03:10.180> I

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
process of your hair getting oily so I

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.210 
process of your hair getting oily so I
was<00:03:10.900> pretty<00:03:11.049> awesome<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:11.680> then<00:03:11.860> it<00:03:11.950> was<00:03:12.040> weird

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
was pretty awesome and then it was weird

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.289 
was pretty awesome and then it was weird
because<00:03:12.340> that<00:03:12.519> same<00:03:12.730> week<00:03:12.910> but<00:03:13.150> another

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
because that same week but another

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.690 
because that same week but another
client<00:03:13.780> asked<00:03:14.739> about<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:15.040> same<00:03:15.250> thing<00:03:15.459> so<00:03:15.670> I

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
client asked about the same thing so I

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.150 
client asked about the same thing so I
figured<00:03:16.060> I<00:03:16.150> would<00:03:16.299> just<00:03:16.330> do<00:03:16.920> like<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:17.980> mini

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
figured I would just do like a mini
