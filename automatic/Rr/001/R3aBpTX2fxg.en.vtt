a<00:01:48.030> classic<00:01:48.299> piece<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.869> feel<00:01:49.110> like

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
a classic piece that you feel like

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.990 
a classic piece that you feel like
you're<00:01:49.350> going<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.619> wear<00:01:49.770> forever<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.610> it's

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
you're going to wear forever and it's

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.120 
you're going to wear forever and it's
really<00:01:51.180> well-constructed<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:52.290> say<00:01:52.560> go<00:01:52.799> for<00:01:53.100> it

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
really well-constructed I say go for it

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.980 
really well-constructed I say go for it
and<00:01:53.369> if<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:54.329> something<00:01:54.479> that's<00:01:54.600> out<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.869> your

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
and if it's something that's out of your

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.749 
and if it's something that's out of your
budget<00:01:55.229> just<00:01:55.680> watch<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.009> really<00:01:56.520> carefully

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
budget just watch it really carefully

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.940 
budget just watch it really carefully
and<00:01:57.210> hopefully<00:01:57.659> you'll<00:01:58.020> get<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.380> but<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.799> feel

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
and hopefully you'll get it but I feel

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.109 
and hopefully you'll get it but I feel
like<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.189> one<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.460> those<00:01:59.520> things<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.880> if<00:02:00.030> it

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
like it's one of those things that if it

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.730 
like it's one of those things that if it
slips<00:02:00.299> away<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.869> you'll<00:02:00.960> be<00:02:01.079> really<00:02:01.380> upset

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
slips away and you'll be really upset

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.770 
slips away and you'll be really upset
then<00:02:02.009> maybe<00:02:02.430> it's<00:02:02.610> worth<00:02:02.759> splurging<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.479> as

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
then maybe it's worth splurging on as

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.910 
then maybe it's worth splurging on as
for<00:02:04.680> what<00:02:05.100> I'm<00:02:05.369> looking<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:06.719> right<00:02:07.020> now<00:02:07.619> I

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
for what I'm looking for right now I

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.919

a<00:02:10.020> moto<00:02:10.259> jacket<00:02:10.379> or<00:02:10.979> something<00:02:11.099> for<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.550> winter

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
a moto jacket or something for a winter

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.290 
a moto jacket or something for a winter
