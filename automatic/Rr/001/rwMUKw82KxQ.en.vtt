screen you just click edit and then in

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.609 
screen you just click edit and then in
the<00:01:02.820> section<00:01:03.090> here<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.510> says<00:01:03.690> require<00:01:04.110> CBS

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
the section here it says require CBS

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.219 
the section here it says require CBS
code<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.549> will<00:01:05.670> check<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.750> now<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.200> is

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
code you will check it so now it is

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.010 
code you will check it so now it is
required<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.270> then<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.420> will<00:01:09.600> give<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
required and then it will give you the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.340 
required and then it will give you the
CBS<00:01:10.470> code<00:01:10.710> right<00:01:11.430> there<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.299> real<00:01:12.780> simple<00:01:13.170> to

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
CBS code right there so real simple to

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.100 
CBS code right there so real simple to
find<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.640> even<00:01:14.790> change<00:01:15.119> your<00:01:15.420> CBS<00:01:15.750> code

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
find you can even change your CBS code

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.730 
find you can even change your CBS code
so<00:01:16.619> if<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.890> wanted<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:18.290> make<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> number<00:01:19.619> that's

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
so if you wanted to make a number that's

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.770 
so if you wanted to make a number that's
easy<00:01:20.009> for<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.369> remember<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:21.360> can<00:01:21.570> change

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
easy for you to remember you can change

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.780 
easy for you to remember you can change
that<00:01:22.110> code<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:23.070> if<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.210> wanted<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.659> change<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.049> to

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
that code so if I wanted to change it to

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.590 
that code so if I wanted to change it to
one<00:01:26.790> two<00:01:27.090> three<00:01:27.930> four<00:01:28.200> five<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.360> can<00:01:30.360> do<00:01:30.450> that

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
one two three four five I can do that

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.050 
one two three four five I can do that
and<00:01:30.869> I'm<00:01:31.710> sorry<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.979> must<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.220> seven<00:01:32.820> letters

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
and I'm sorry I must have seven letters

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.210 
and I'm sorry I must have seven letters
or<00:01:33.360> seven<00:01:33.630> characters<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.560> I've<00:01:34.799> changed<00:01:35.130> my

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
or seven characters so I've changed my

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.249 
or seven characters so I've changed my
CBS<00:01:35.640> code<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.119> particular<00:01:36.360> key<00:01:36.720> box<00:01:36.900> and

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
CBS code for that particular key box and

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.440 
CBS code for that particular key box and
then<00:01:38.070> if<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.280> don't<00:01:38.430> want<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.759> require<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.240> for

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
then if you don't want to require it for

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.090 
then if you don't want to require it for
realtors<00:01:41.000> uncheck<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> box<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:43.009> you're<00:01:44.009> all

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
realtors uncheck the box and you're all

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.600 
realtors uncheck the box and you're all
set<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.490> if<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.909> never<00:01:45.119> program<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.899> key<00:01:46.049> box

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
set and if you never program the key box

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.830 
set and if you never program the key box
those<00:01:47.610> changes<00:01:48.119> are<00:01:48.210> not<00:01:48.360> going<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.600> take

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
those changes are not going to take

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.859 
those changes are not going to take
effect<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.500> if<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.250> change<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.060> key<00:01:51.299> B<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
effect so if you do change the key B the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.139 
effect so if you do change the key B the
CBS<00:01:52.380> number<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.250> need<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.759> make<00:01:53.909> sure<00:01:53.939> you

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
CBS number you need to make sure you

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.700 
CBS number you need to make sure you
click<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.479> bottom<00:01:54.780> button<00:01:55.170> at<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> bottom<00:01:55.439> of

click the bottom button at the bottom of

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.499 
click the bottom button at the bottom of
the<00:01:55.770> program<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.700> don't<00:01:57.060> want<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.299> change

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
the program so I don't want to change

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.270 
the program so I don't want to change
for<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.750> particular<00:01:58.500> key<00:01:58.649> box<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.070> I'm<00:01:59.159> just

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
for that particular key box so I'm just

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.550 
for that particular key box so I'm just
going<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.490> exit<00:01:59.759> out<00:01:59.909> says<00:02:00.840> changes<00:02:01.290> will<00:02:01.439> be

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
going to exit out says changes will be
