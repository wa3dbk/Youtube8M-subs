what's up guys it's me Jeremy today I

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.830 
what's up guys it's me Jeremy today I
want<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.550> talk<00:00:02.700> about<00:00:02.760> what<00:00:03.179> makes<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.600> late

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
want to talk about what makes a late

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.530 
want to talk about what makes a late
game<00:00:04.110> champion<00:00:04.770> now<00:00:05.700> for<00:00:05.879> each<00:00:05.970> champion<00:00:06.210> all

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
game champion now for each champion all

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.690 
game champion now for each champion all
comes<00:00:06.779> down<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:07.049> two<00:00:07.350> things<00:00:07.379> how<00:00:08.250> your<00:00:08.429> items

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
comes down to two things how your items

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.669 
comes down to two things how your items
scale<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.179> how<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:09.630> scale<00:00:10.110> versus<00:00:10.500> your

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
scale and how you scale versus your

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.770 
scale and how you scale versus your
opponent's<00:00:11.130> items<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.670> champion<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:12.630> is

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
opponent's items a champion that is

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.150 
opponent's items a champion that is
powerful<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.349> late<00:00:13.500> game<00:00:13.679> will<00:00:13.860> scale

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
powerful in the late game will scale

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.180 
powerful in the late game will scale
well<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.610> both<00:00:14.849> categories<00:00:15.949> ideally<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.070> want

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
well in both categories ideally you want

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.920 
well in both categories ideally you want
to<00:00:17.369> have<00:00:17.460> your<00:00:17.550> item<00:00:17.880> scale<00:00:18.150> exponentially

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
to have your item scale exponentially

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.660 
to have your item scale exponentially
upon<00:00:19.199> themselves<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.400> want<00:00:20.580> your
