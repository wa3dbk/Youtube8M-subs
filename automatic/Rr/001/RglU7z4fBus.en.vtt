00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.110
 for how to install a mode on this 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.300
 what exactly is the part 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.910
 so that's all stupid or what do you see 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.420

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.100
 right click on the game on us 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.900

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.860
 of the game gets along with his load 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.730
 when I was there you can see that he 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.110
 there is utility 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.360
 krasniqi beyond there are plenty of small 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.280
 pictures of the new modes full of stuff 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.290
 we do not care so there are discussions 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.329
 also 4 on the screen are not interested 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.559
 we want the modes so problem 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:59.379
 in morals was done on workshop 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.790
 that's how it's good we can see 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.100
 that there are several live modes 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.690
 new me I think that's ok 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.789

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.920
 load clash on the graphic category 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.350
 so I take a mode to remove 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.700
 the fog that I already have a style 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:27.310
