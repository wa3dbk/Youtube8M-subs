00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
now I'm mad for a black and silver paint

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.399 
now I'm mad for a black and silver paint
job<00:02:11.400> as<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.239> can<00:02:12.359> see<00:02:12.719> I've<00:02:12.930> already<00:02:13.170> painted

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
job as you can see I've already painted

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.820 
job as you can see I've already painted
majority<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.099> black

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.170 

I<00:02:16.860> like<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.130> do<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.460> like<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.610> have<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.820> silver

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
I like to do is I like to have a silver

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.050 
I like to do is I like to have a silver
barrel<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:19.530> know<00:02:19.710> this<00:02:20.190> works<00:02:20.460> really<00:02:20.790> well

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
barrel you know this works really well

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.560 
barrel you know this works really well
with<00:02:21.240> our<00:02:21.360> one<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.630> my<00:02:21.720> modified<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.350> now<00:02:23.570> as

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
with our one of my modified this now as

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.020 
with our one of my modified this now as
you<00:02:25.050> can<00:02:25.170> see<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.920> have<00:02:26.400> actually<00:02:26.790> separated

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
you can see I have actually separated

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.140 
you can see I have actually separated
this<00:02:27.660> internal<00:02:28.290> piece<00:02:29.810> from<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.020> outer<00:02:31.200> shell

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
this internal piece from the outer shell

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.400 
this internal piece from the outer shell
fairly<00:02:33.150> easy<00:02:33.270> to<00:02:33.420> do<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.540> pretty<00:02:33.960> much<00:02:34.140> apart

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
fairly easy to do a pretty much apart

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.260 
fairly easy to do a pretty much apart
there<00:02:35.100> was<00:02:35.190> just<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.430> couple<00:02:35.610> of<00:02:35.730> small<00:02:35.850> clips

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
there was just a couple of small clips

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.030 
there was just a couple of small clips
along<00:02:36.960> this<00:02:37.230> bottom<00:02:37.410> edge<00:02:37.710> yeah<00:02:38.750> that<00:02:40.040> that

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
along this bottom edge yeah that that

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.470 
along this bottom edge yeah that that
you<00:02:41.160> just<00:02:41.340> gotta<00:02:41.520> sort<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.820> pride<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.360> push

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
you just gotta sort of pride and push

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.350 
you just gotta sort of pride and push
through<00:02:45.290> now<00:02:46.290> what<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:46.500> have<00:02:46.740> done<00:02:46.970> is<00:02:47.970> on<00:02:48.180> each

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
through now what I have done is on each

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.190 
through now what I have done is on each
side<00:02:48.630> of<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:49.170> have<00:02:49.740> put<00:02:50.040> in<00:02:50.160> these<00:02:51.200> LED

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
side of it I have put in these LED

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.860 
side of it I have put in these LED
strips<00:02:52.880> you<00:02:53.880> know<00:02:53.970> there's<00:02:54.240> four

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
strips you know there's four

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.740 
strips you know there's four
it's<00:02:54.990> MD<00:02:55.440> or<00:02:55.470> super-bright<00:02:56.040> LEDs<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:56.850> run

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
it's MD or super-bright LEDs that run

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.810 
it's MD or super-bright LEDs that run
back<00:02:57.990> and<00:02:58.290> I've<00:02:58.860> just<00:02:58.980> got<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.220> wiring<00:02:59.430> sort

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
back and I've just got the wiring sort

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.940 
back and I've just got the wiring sort
of<00:02:59.880> through<00:03:00.540> there<00:03:00.750> go<00:03:01.440> on<00:03:01.560> back<00:03:01.709> into<00:03:01.890> the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
of through there go on back into the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.010 
of through there go on back into the
main<00:03:02.100> body<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.459> blaster<00:03:02.910> yeah<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:03.930> is

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
main body of the blaster yeah this is

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.430 
main body of the blaster yeah this is
one<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.350> those<00:03:04.440> set<00:03:04.709> up<00:03:04.800> on<00:03:04.920> either<00:03:05.160> side<00:03:09.440> from

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
one of those set up on either side from

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:26.600 
one of those set up on either side from
the<00:03:10.530> outside<00:03:11.070> of<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.250> gun<00:03:21.170> you<00:03:25.459> can't<00:03:26.459> see

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
the outside of the gun you can't see

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:49.930 
the outside of the gun you can't see
them<00:03:43.430> no<00:03:44.430> degrees<00:03:44.810> that<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.790> silver<00:03:47.790> barrel<00:03:48.620> I

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
them no degrees that the silver barrel I

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.979 
them no degrees that the silver barrel I
won't<00:03:50.940> bother<00:03:51.060> putting<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:51.510> in<00:03:51.600> piece<00:03:51.810> on

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
won't bother putting the in piece on

00:03:51.989 --> 00:04:02.060 
won't bother putting the in piece on
just<00:03:58.130> of<00:03:59.130> an<00:03:59.250> effect<00:03:59.720> so<00:04:00.720> as<00:04:01.620> you<00:04:01.769> can<00:04:01.920> already

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
just of an effect so as you can already

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.310 
just of an effect so as you can already
see<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.489> can<00:04:02.640> see<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.910> reflection<00:04:03.510> of<00:04:03.660> those

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
see you can see the reflection of those

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.000 
see you can see the reflection of those
LEDs<00:04:05.070> in<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.610> side<00:04:05.880> of<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.120> barrel<00:04:06.420> now<00:04:07.010> once

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
LEDs in the side of the barrel now once

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.000 
LEDs in the side of the barrel now once
you've<00:04:08.160> got<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:11.120> top<00:04:12.120> piece<00:04:12.390> on<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:13.530> mock

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
you've got the top piece on the mock

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.440 
you've got the top piece on the mock
this<00:04:14.160> up<00:04:14.340> in<00:04:14.519> here<00:04:16.970> but<00:04:17.970> you<00:04:18.060> gotta<00:04:18.180> stop

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
this up in here but you gotta stop

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.880 
this up in here but you gotta stop
plates<00:04:18.630> on<00:04:20.120> basically<00:04:21.120> or<00:04:21.510> do<00:04:21.660> you<00:04:21.750> see<00:04:21.959> you

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
plates on basically or do you see you

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.530 
plates on basically or do you see you
don't<00:04:23.010> see<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.370> LEDs<00:04:23.729> it'll<00:04:23.970> lucy's

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
don't see the LEDs it'll lucy's

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.110 
don't see the LEDs it'll lucy's
that<00:04:25.200> reflection<00:04:25.620> so<00:04:26.400> when<00:04:26.580> those<00:04:26.700> LEDs

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
that reflection so when those LEDs

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.860 
that reflection so when those LEDs
actually<00:04:27.479> fire<00:04:27.780> you<00:04:28.110> get<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.380> reflect

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
actually fire you get the reflect

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.390 
actually fire you get the reflect
beyond<00:04:29.350> seing<00:04:29.560> off<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.800> barrel<00:04:30.070> air<00:04:30.190> through

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
beyond seing off the barrel air through

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.610 
beyond seing off the barrel air through
this<00:04:30.520> through<00:04:30.940> this<00:04:31.030> gap<00:04:31.240> here<00:04:31.570> and<00:04:31.720> it<00:04:32.500> gives

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
this through this gap here and it gives

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.870 
this through this gap here and it gives
you<00:04:32.680> a<00:04:32.740> really<00:04:32.980> good<00:04:33.100> sort<00:04:33.340> of<00:04:33.400> muzzle<00:04:33.550> flash

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
you a really good sort of muzzle flash

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.770 
you a really good sort of muzzle flash
effect<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:36.090> haven't<00:04:37.090> actually<00:04:37.210> had<00:04:37.449> a<00:04:37.510> chance

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
effect I haven't actually had a chance

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.140 
effect I haven't actually had a chance
to<00:04:38.139> hook<00:04:38.919> it<00:04:39.040> up<00:04:39.100> to<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:39.340> firing<00:04:39.639> mechanism<00:04:40.030> of

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
to hook it up to the firing mechanism of

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.610 
to hook it up to the firing mechanism of
the<00:04:40.210> Gunners<00:04:40.389> yet<00:04:40.720> that's<00:04:40.900> something<00:04:41.530> I'm

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
the Gunners yet that's something I'm

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.080 
the Gunners yet that's something I'm
about<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:42.040> do<00:04:43.860> in<00:04:44.860> doing<00:04:45.340> it<00:04:45.490> I<00:04:45.760> sort<00:04:46.030> of

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
about to do in doing it I sort of

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.480 
about to do in doing it I sort of
decided<00:04:46.660> that<00:04:46.960> I<00:04:47.530> also<00:04:47.800> wanted<00:04:48.130> a<00:04:48.220> breech

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
decided that I also wanted a breech

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.930 
decided that I also wanted a breech
flash<00:04:48.870> so<00:04:49.870> that<00:04:49.900> I've<00:04:50.830> left<00:04:51.040> my<00:04:51.250> bridge<00:04:51.699> door

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
flash so that I've left my bridge door

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.129 
flash so that I've left my bridge door
clear<00:04:52.740> so<00:04:54.419> not<00:04:55.419> just<00:04:55.510> the<00:04:55.600> front<00:04:55.780> edge<00:04:55.930> of<00:04:56.020> it

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
clear so not just the front edge of it

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.620 
clear so not just the front edge of it
is<00:04:56.229> black<00:04:56.440> but<00:04:56.790> the<00:04:57.790> main<00:04:57.940> body<00:04:58.120> of<00:04:58.210> this<00:04:58.419> clear

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
is black but the main body of this clear

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.010

and it's in that little gap there just

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.860 
and it's in that little gap there just
perfectly<00:05:15.790> that<00:05:16.060> won't<00:05:16.240> be<00:05:16.389> interfered<00:05:16.810> with

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
perfectly that won't be interfered with
