00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.090 
do stuff like this the little details is
what<00:01:24.570> makes<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.899> difference<00:01:25.020> between<00:01:25.409> just

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
what makes the difference between just

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.850 
what makes the difference between just
like<00:01:26.190> a<00:01:26.220> good<00:01:26.460> Bollywood<00:01:27.030> number<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:28.140> great

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
like a good Bollywood number and a great

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.130 
like a good Bollywood number and a great
number<00:01:29.159> when<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.850> do<00:01:30.030> group<00:01:30.330> dances<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.990> you

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
number when you do group dances that you

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.660 
number when you do group dances that you
associate<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.799> with<00:01:31.830> being<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.280> group<00:01:32.460> effort

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
associate it with being a group effort

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.260 
associate it with being a group effort
so<00:01:33.149> I<00:01:33.420> don't<00:01:34.049> think<00:01:34.490> any<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.640> us<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.909> go<00:01:36.090> in

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
so I don't think any of us can go in

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.910 
so I don't think any of us can go in
with<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.509> mentality<00:01:36.990> if<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.320> need<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.680> shine

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
with the mentality if I need to shine

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.529 
with the mentality if I need to shine
because<00:01:38.369> I'm<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.580> piece<00:01:38.789> but<00:01:39.000> we're<00:01:39.210> two

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
because I'm the piece but we're two

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.499 
because I'm the piece but we're two
three<00:01:40.320> four<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.490> think<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:42.149> just<00:01:42.300> about

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
three four I think it's just about

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.389 
three four I think it's just about
having<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.319> good<00:01:43.470> time<00:01:43.710> making<00:01:44.190> the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
having a good time making the
