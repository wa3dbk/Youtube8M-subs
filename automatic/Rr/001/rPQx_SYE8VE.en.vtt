00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
things in your like inventory but then

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.940 
things in your like inventory but then
when<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:04.930> actually<00:03:05.140> play<00:03:05.530> some<00:03:05.769> this<00:03:05.920> a

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
when you actually play some this a

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.000 
when you actually play some this a
little<00:03:06.220> don't<00:03:06.670> look<00:03:06.819> like<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:08.590> if<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:08.769> drag

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
little don't look like so if you drag

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.559 
little don't look like so if you drag
this<00:03:09.220> in<00:03:09.430> that<00:03:09.610> won't<00:03:09.819> be<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:09.970> problem<00:03:10.030> if

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
this in that won't be a problem if

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.650 
this in that won't be a problem if
you'll<00:03:10.900> be<00:03:11.139> all<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.500> same<00:03:12.239> you'll<00:03:13.239> also<00:03:13.450> want

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
you'll be all the same you'll also want

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.259 
you'll be all the same you'll also want
to<00:03:13.870> drag<00:03:14.109> in<00:03:14.319> this<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.920> think<00:03:15.700> that's<00:03:16.000> part<00:03:16.239> of

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
to drag in this I think that's part of

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.870 
to drag in this I think that's part of
it<00:03:16.389> too<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:17.530> that's<00:03:18.100> what<00:03:18.310> everything<00:03:18.760> will

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
it too so that's what everything will

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.910 
it too so that's what everything will
eventually<00:03:19.329> look<00:03:19.540> like<00:03:19.810> it<00:03:20.380> has<00:03:20.530> a<00:03:20.560> bunch<00:03:20.799> of

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
eventually look like it has a bunch of

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.530 
eventually look like it has a bunch of
items<00:03:21.100> but<00:03:21.579> there's<00:03:21.760> some<00:03:21.940> stuff<00:03:22.209> that's<00:03:22.389> not

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540

you need I hope this helped you if you

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.710 
you need I hope this helped you if you
were<00:05:08.650> nervous<00:05:08.980> about<00:05:09.280> doing<00:05:09.610> this<00:05:09.850> uh<00:05:10.090> if<00:05:10.480> you

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
were nervous about doing this uh if you

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.370 
were nervous about doing this uh if you
update<00:05:10.990> it<00:05:11.230> I<00:05:11.500> think<00:05:12.840> like<00:05:13.840> if<00:05:14.020> you<00:05:14.170> update

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
update it I think like if you update

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.000 
update it I think like if you update
your<00:05:15.870> Minecraft<00:05:16.870> to<00:05:17.200> whatever<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:17.830> next

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
your Minecraft to whatever the next

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.640 
your Minecraft to whatever the next
update<00:05:18.340> is<00:05:18.640> it'll<00:05:19.090> either<00:05:21.900> replace<00:05:22.900> it<00:05:23.230> all<00:05:23.350> or

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
update is it'll either replace it all or

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.190 
update is it'll either replace it all or
it<00:05:24.520> will<00:05:26.160> just<00:05:27.160> stay<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.790> same<00:05:28.120> and<00:05:28.450> just<00:05:28.900> add

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
it will just stay the same and just add

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.810 
it will just stay the same and just add
the<00:05:29.560> updates<00:05:29.980> or<00:05:30.190> whatever<00:05:30.460> there<00:05:30.670> might<00:05:30.790> be

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
the updates or whatever there might be

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.400 
the updates or whatever there might be
something<00:05:31.240> missing<00:05:31.480> but<00:05:31.900> I<00:05:31.930> don't<00:05:32.260> think

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
something missing but I don't think

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.050 
something missing but I don't think
there<00:05:32.590> will<00:05:32.740> be<00:05:32.800> there<00:05:33.520> shouldn't<00:05:33.850> be<00:05:33.880> any

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
there will be there shouldn't be any

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.150 
there will be there shouldn't be any
problem<00:05:34.600> so<00:05:34.960> if<00:05:35.170> you<00:05:35.500> ever<00:05:35.710> have<00:05:35.950> any<00:05:35.980> problems
