 in the control panel will appear a 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.880
 lots of tasks we can do and 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.880
 let's go to network connections 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.790
 here a window will appear and on 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.390
 the left of the little window goes to 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.470
 appear a link to create a connection 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.500
 new 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:46.470
 we are going to click and the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.110
 assistant for new connection that we 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:54.100
 explains a little here what we are going to be able to 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.739
 do with it let's next 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.899
 and he asks us what we want to do 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.760
 then what we want to do is 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.950
 connect to the internet 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.420
 let's leave it as it is 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.420
 and we click on next 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.859
 it's a good question how we said 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.979
 connect to the internet and what we are going to 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:16.460
 choose is to establish a connection 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.460
 manually 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.580
 and we are going to click on next 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:30.650
 now we have to define as we said 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:34.670
 connect to the internet in this case we 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:38.360
 as I already have here a user and a 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.880
 password then what is the most common 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.080
 make 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.590
 Uruguay 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.600
 then we will do connect using 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.430
 a broadband bam connection that 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.760
 You need a username and a 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.760
 password 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.380
 we click on next and name 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.080
 that connection as we come up with one that 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.860
 more comfortable 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.430
 and we give you next 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:13.260
 here we are going to have to specify the 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:16.760
 username in this case before the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.200
 that the Uruguayan company 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.200
 but it's a username 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:36.180
 what is the name of sl 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.180
 and a number that does it before 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:45.060
 and you have to specify the password 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:49.920
 so we put in when the provider 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.920
 he brought us internet 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.739
 in these boxes we leave them marked 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.019
 so that he always uses that name of 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.870
 user and establish the connection as 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.500
 default 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.150
 let's read next and there we finished what 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.489
 The only thing we do is click here 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.799
 to add a shortcut in the 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.799
 desk and ready 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.209

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.129
 connect to internet what we are going to do 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:26.659
