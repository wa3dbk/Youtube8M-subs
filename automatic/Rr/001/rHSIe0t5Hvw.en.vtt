that's the arrangement you'll see in

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.690 
that's the arrangement you'll see in
your<00:01:45.020> tablet<00:01:45.440> sure<00:01:45.800> I'm<00:01:46.130> going<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:46.340> play<00:01:46.490> some

your tablet sure I'm going to play some

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.520 
your tablet sure I'm going to play some
variations<00:01:47.330> on<00:01:47.510> it<00:01:47.540> here<00:01:47.750> shortly<00:01:47.990> but<00:01:48.200> let's

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
variations on it here shortly but let's

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.770 
variations on it here shortly but let's
go<00:01:48.710> through<00:01:48.950> that<00:01:49.070> one<00:01:49.310> pretty<00:01:49.910> much<00:01:50.060> bar<00:01:50.480> by

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
go through that one pretty much bar by

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.110 
go through that one pretty much bar by
bar<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:51.740> you<00:01:51.860> can<00:01:52.010> see<00:01:52.190> some<00:01:52.400> different

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
bar so you can see some different

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.450 
bar so you can see some different
techniques<00:01:53.300> I'm<00:01:53.720> using<00:01:53.960> there<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:55.070> first<00:01:55.250> one

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
techniques I'm using there the first one

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.570 
techniques I'm using there the first one
is<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:56.540> actual<00:01:57.440> finger<00:01:57.770> style<00:01:57.980> pattern<00:01:58.100> that

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
is the actual finger style pattern that

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.190 
is the actual finger style pattern that
I'm<00:01:58.730> using<00:01:58.970> on<00:01:59.180> this<00:01:59.300> which<00:01:59.570> as<00:01:59.810> I<00:02:00.140> said

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
I'm using on this which as I said

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.870 
I'm using on this which as I said
differs<00:02:00.800> from<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.100> piece<00:02:01.280> we<00:02:01.430> covered<00:02:01.730> before

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
differs from the piece we covered before

finger to fan these but you can make
whatever<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:41.060> comfortable<00:02:41.270> for<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:41.930> and

whatever is comfortable for you and

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.410 
whatever is comfortable for you and
we're<00:02:42.800> going<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:43.010> play<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.250> series<00:02:43.790> of<00:02:43.820> triplets

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
we're going to play a series of triplets

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.360 
we're going to play a series of triplets
over<00:02:44.780> that<00:02:44.959> four-four<00:02:45.500> time<00:02:45.739> that<00:02:45.950> sound<00:02:46.160> like

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
over that four-four time that sound like

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.589 
over that four-four time that sound like
this

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.990 

so<00:02:53.599> it's<00:02:53.750> one<00:02:54.170> two<00:02:54.530> three<00:02:54.560> two<00:02:55.310> two<00:02:55.340> three

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
so it's one two three two two three

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.589 
so it's one two three two two three
three<00:02:56.269> two<00:02:56.540> three<00:02:57.079> four<00:02:57.409> two<00:02:57.560> three<00:02:58.599> that's

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
three two three four two three that's

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.780 
three two three four two three that's
sometimes<00:02:59.930> referred<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.500> as<00:03:00.680> six<00:03:01.280> over<00:03:01.579> to

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
sometimes referred to as six over to

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.599 
sometimes referred to as six over to
that<00:03:02.060> particular<00:03:02.629> rhythmic<00:03:03.079> feel<00:03:03.370> so<00:03:04.370> the

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
that particular rhythmic feel so the

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:10.649 
that particular rhythmic feel so the
first<00:03:04.909> couple<00:03:05.390> of<00:03:05.450> bars<00:03:05.689> go<00:03:05.870> like<00:03:06.079> this<00:03:08.170> and

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
first couple of bars go like this and

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.990 
first couple of bars go like this and
you<00:03:11.659> can<00:03:11.870> vary<00:03:12.470> your<00:03:12.620> bass<00:03:12.859> line<00:03:13.159> up<00:03:13.370> by

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
you can vary your bass line up by

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.080 
you can vary your bass line up by
playing<00:03:14.299> not<00:03:14.810> only<00:03:15.049> the<00:03:15.200> open<00:03:15.590> fifth<00:03:15.890> string

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
playing not only the open fifth string

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.839 
playing not only the open fifth string
but<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.780> open<00:03:18.079> sixth<00:03:18.409> string<00:03:18.650> as<00:03:18.829> well<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.280> is<00:03:19.819> a

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
but the open sixth string as well a is a

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.490 
but the open sixth string as well a is a
great<00:03:20.120> key<00:03:20.540> for<00:03:20.810> this<00:03:20.930> kind<00:03:21.170> of<00:03:21.230> playing

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
great key for this kind of playing

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.410 
great key for this kind of playing
because<00:03:21.769> you've<00:03:22.099> got<00:03:22.280> an<00:03:22.400> open<00:03:22.760> string<00:03:23.090> on<00:03:23.299> the

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
because you've got an open string on the

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.140 
because you've got an open string on the
guitar<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:25.450> D<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:27.159> E<00:03:28.159> that<00:03:28.519> correspond<00:03:29.090> to

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
guitar a D and E that correspond to

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.550 
guitar a D and E that correspond to
every<00:03:29.389> chord<00:03:29.659> in<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.840> progression<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:30.470> you

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
every chord in the progression so you

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.170 
every chord in the progression so you
can<00:03:30.680> just<00:03:30.799> sort<00:03:30.980> of<00:03:31.040> bump<00:03:31.609> on<00:03:31.819> them<00:03:31.939> and<00:03:32.060> that's

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
can just sort of bump on them and that's

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.059 
can just sort of bump on them and that's
pretty<00:03:32.329> much<00:03:32.450> what<00:03:32.780> I'm<00:03:32.870> going<00:03:33.049> to<00:03:33.109> do<00:03:35.980> now<00:03:36.980> the

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
pretty much what I'm going to do now the

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.159 
pretty much what I'm going to do now the
