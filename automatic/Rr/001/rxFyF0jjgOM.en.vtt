 Argentina even less with that 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:57.920
 birds and flowers decorating the 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.839
 chevrolet cobalt is the least futuristic 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.369

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.399
 popular sedan that have the engine 

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:09.470
 manufactured from next year

 everybody get to argentina like this 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.280
 but do not expect to find inside 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:15.580
 how many screens does this have 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.580

 [Music] 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.290

 story but we could not find 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.119
 no worthy result of chevrolet in 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.130
 the rally dakar however the brand 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.920
 North American ensures that this concept 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.440
 The Colorado Rally is a tribute to the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.200
 most difficult race in the world to not 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.960
 confused chevrolet does not plan to win the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.159
 dakar, what it does plan is to manufacture 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.320
 from next year 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.670
 the future pick up s10 on the basis of 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.649
 This concept 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.359
 the concept arts often anticipate 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.659
 the lines of the models that are 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:56.479
 come but folk iosis max is a case 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.130
 strange is the advance payment of a car that 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.670
 went on sale in Europe six years ago 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.399
 months 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.079
 the ford big macs and by bringing it to the lounge 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.950
 of buenos aires- this strange one was created 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:08.479
 anachronistic phenomenon is like reading the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.910
 campaign promises of a politician 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.190
 after having voted or searched for data 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.379
 facebook a girl after 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.209
 to have married her from all 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.849
 concepts that are exhibited in the classroom 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.069
 buenos aires- the fiat one cabrio is the 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.709
 unique that was designed and manufactured in 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.360
 Brazil with that particular tendency that 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.120
 have our neighbors confuse the 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.890
 good taste with turning poses a 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.230
 unlikely cabriolet version of 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.569
 new fiat 1 and his chance to be 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.450
 produced are very scarce its only 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.180
 goal meets it perfectly 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.319
 get the attention of the public

 every time reindeer names a new boss 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:52.700
 of design forces him to create a concept 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:54.920
 art that becomes a statement 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.730
 of principles about aesthetic language 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.769
 of his future management the king does not say in 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.439
 the new creation of laurent van den 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.829
 acker and with him is telling us that the 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:10.400
 next reindeer will be very sporty very 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:12.290
 aerodynamic very strange gates and 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.389
 with a rhombus in the trunk of the size of 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.609
 a large mozzarella except rare 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.829
 exceptions he thought he does not have the habit 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.439
 to bring their concept to production 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.799
 so do not expect cars ever see 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:30.169
 on the street is spectacular convertible 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.939
 sr1 a sports car with benefits 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.519
 enough to compete against a 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:36.949
 force or a ferrari of all its 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.260
 structure the only novelty in city to 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:42.140
 the production will be your logo 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.019
 its emblem has the same lion of 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.659
 always but look more closely at 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:51.159
 old feline did a facelift and 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.159
 applied botox on the eyelids 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.950
 and here is our favorite concept of 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.569
 The whole hall of buenos aires is a 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.379
 evolution of a model has been seen in 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:05.660
 2006 but he has a new yearning ramÃ³n him 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.550
 he did a finer painting job and 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.060
 got some sponsors of 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.340
 greater prestige reach the production 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.980
 I assure you that if in a few weeks more 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.660
 your children and nephews are going to burn you 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.690
 head as long as you buy them one 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:29.889
