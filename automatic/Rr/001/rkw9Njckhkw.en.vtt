00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
I was out last night at a comedy show

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.350 
I was out last night at a comedy show
and<00:02:58.350> no<00:02:59.350> one<00:02:59.560> said<00:02:59.980> anything<00:03:00.010> but<00:03:00.910> it<00:03:01.030> was<00:03:01.060> all

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
and no one said anything but it was all

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
and no one said anything but it was all
dudes<00:03:01.750> so<00:03:03.150> which<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:04.299> good<00:03:04.510> but<00:03:04.660> I<00:03:04.690> felt<00:03:05.049> great

dudes so which is good but I felt great
and<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.799> think<00:03:06.070> a<00:03:06.160> lot<00:03:06.340> of<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:06.610> is<00:03:06.730> how<00:03:07.150> it<00:03:07.510> makes

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
and I think a lot of it is how it makes

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
you feel it's kind of like how a woman

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.250 
you feel it's kind of like how a woman
feels<00:03:10.690> feels<00:03:11.620> a<00:03:11.739> certain<00:03:11.920> way<00:03:12.040> in<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.310> dress

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260

clothes<00:03:14.260> don't<00:03:14.680> really<00:03:14.890> matter<00:03:15.100> that<00:03:15.220> much<00:03:15.370> to

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
clothes don't really matter that much to

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.479 
clothes don't really matter that much to
me<00:03:15.820> you<00:03:16.269> know<00:03:16.420> I<00:03:16.750> don't<00:03:17.680> wear<00:03:17.799> makeup<00:03:17.980> but<00:03:18.459> I

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
me you know I don't wear makeup but I

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.560 
me you know I don't wear makeup but I
barely<00:03:20.519> barely<00:03:21.519> lucky<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.180> comb<00:03:22.390> my<00:03:22.540> hair

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570

sometimes<00:03:23.230> but<00:03:23.820> for<00:03:24.820> some<00:03:24.970> reason<00:03:25.209> I<00:03:25.239> just

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
sometimes but for some reason I just

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.270 
sometimes but for some reason I just
think<00:03:25.600> that<00:03:25.750> contacts<00:03:26.320> would<00:03:26.590> do<00:03:26.769> something

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
think that contacts would do something

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.000 
think that contacts would do something
different<00:03:27.700> like<00:03:27.880> it<00:03:28.209> would<00:03:28.299> just<00:03:28.480> give<00:03:28.630> me<00:03:28.780> a

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
different like it would just give me a

00:03:29.010 --> 00:04:28.220 
different like it would just give me a
fun<00:03:30.010> little<00:03:30.280> tweak

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.290
