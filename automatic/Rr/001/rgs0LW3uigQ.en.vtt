00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
okay just a little bit more with this

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.789 
okay just a little bit more with this
guy<00:00:05.240> if<00:00:06.240> you<00:00:06.690> slide<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.080> timeline<00:00:07.560> you<00:00:07.770> can

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
guy if you slide the timeline you can

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.280 
guy if you slide the timeline you can
see<00:00:08.160> that<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.820> person<00:00:09.450> who<00:00:09.570> handed<00:00:09.929> this<00:00:10.050> off

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
see that the person who handed this off

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.910 
see that the person who handed this off
to<00:00:10.500> me<00:00:10.910> as<00:00:11.910> animated<00:00:12.480> it<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.809> little<00:00:12.929> bit<00:00:13.200> so<00:00:13.889> i

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
to me as animated it a little bit so i

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.160 
to me as animated it a little bit so i
just<00:00:14.099> noticed<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.509> thought<00:00:15.929> I

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
just noticed that and so I thought I

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.990 
just noticed that and so I thought I
better<00:00:16.289> try<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.100> fix<00:00:17.310> at<00:00:17.460> least<00:00:17.640> one<00:00:17.820> more

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
better try to fix at least one more

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.870 
better try to fix at least one more
thing<00:00:18.060> here<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:18.930> as<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.199> look<00:00:19.529> at<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> leg<00:00:19.980> you

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
thing here so as I look at the leg you

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.220 
thing here so as I look at the leg you
can<00:00:21.000> see<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.359> upper<00:00:21.660> thigh<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.199> left

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
can see it the upper thigh and the left

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.120 
can see it the upper thigh and the left
leg<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:23.869> folding<00:00:24.869> these<00:00:25.410> things<00:00:25.710> folding

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
leg is folding these things folding

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.769 
leg is folding these things folding
inside<00:00:26.490> out<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> little<00:00:26.970> bit<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.539> I'm<00:00:27.660> going

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
inside out a little bit and so I'm going

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.540 
inside out a little bit and so I'm going
to<00:00:27.810> try<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.019> do<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.439> just<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.039> little<00:00:29.279> correction

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
to try to do is just a little correction

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.690 
to try to do is just a little correction
on<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.029> I'm<00:00:30.750> going<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.960> leave<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.109> up<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.500> this

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
on that I'm going to leave it up in this

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.840 
on that I'm going to leave it up in this
position<00:00:32.700> here<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.890> go<00:00:34.890> into<00:00:35.070> my<00:00:35.340> skin

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
position here and go into my skin

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.729 
position here and go into my skin
modifier<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:37.430> edit<00:00:38.430> my<00:00:38.610> envelopes<00:00:39.120> and

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
modifier and edit my envelopes and

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.840 
modifier and edit my envelopes and
vertices<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:41.160> checked<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:43.219> one<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.640> want

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
vertices is checked and one that I want

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.970 
vertices is checked and one that I want
right<00:00:45.180> now<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.719> for<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> spines<00:00:46.620> what<00:00:46.920> I'm

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
right now is for the spines what I'm

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.650 
right now is for the spines what I'm
going<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.370> let's<00:00:48.149> take<00:00:48.329> some<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.600> these

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
going to do let's take some of these

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.510 
going to do let's take some of these
vertices<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.530> just<00:00:49.710> apply<00:00:49.829> them<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
vertices and just apply them to the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.670 
vertices and just apply them to the
lower<00:00:50.730> spine<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.360> they<00:00:51.570> don't<00:00:51.750> bend<00:00:52.079> quite<00:00:52.440> so

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
lower spine so they don't bend quite so

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.029 
lower spine so they don't bend quite so
much<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.699> comparison<00:00:54.390> with<00:00:54.420> these<00:00:54.750> others<00:00:55.199> see

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
much in comparison with these others see

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.150 
much in comparison with these others see
these<00:00:56.370> are<00:00:56.760> following<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.539> leg<00:00:57.719> too<00:00:57.960> much<00:00:58.170> and

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
these are following the leg too much and

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.849 
these are following the leg too much and
I<00:00:59.550> want<00:00:59.789> more<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.180> blend<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.780> what<00:01:01.559> I'll<00:01:01.680> do

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
I want more of a blend so what I'll do

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.349 
I want more of a blend so what I'll do
is<00:01:01.890> get<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.370> position<00:01:02.460> where<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:02.969> easily

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
is get in a position where I can easily

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.670 
is get in a position where I can easily
grab<00:01:03.539> those<00:01:03.780> vertices<00:01:04.369> get<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.680> first

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
grab those vertices get to the first

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.140 
grab those vertices get to the first
spine<00:01:08.810> bone<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:12.110> I'm<00:01:13.110> going<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.320> use<00:01:13.610> this<00:01:14.610> I

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
spine bone and I'm going to use this I

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.340 
spine bone and I'm going to use this I
think<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.810> one's<00:01:16.020> called<00:01:16.170> fence<00:01:16.530> or<00:01:16.710> polygon

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
think this one's called fence or polygon

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.020 
think this one's called fence or polygon
instead<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.380> window<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:20.189> way<00:01:20.340> i<00:01:20.400> can<00:01:20.460> just

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
instead of window this way i can just

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.630 
instead of window this way i can just
kind<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.299> click<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:22.619> different<00:01:23.369> points<00:01:24.030> and

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.950 

we<00:01:29.640> grab<00:01:29.909> just<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:32.360> section<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> leg

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
we grab just that section of the leg

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.120 
we grab just that section of the leg
mesh<00:01:34.369> and<00:01:35.369> i'll<00:01:35.549> come<00:01:35.759> up<00:01:35.869> here<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.130> absolute

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
mesh and i'll come up here to absolute

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.480 
mesh and i'll come up here to absolute
effect<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.670> say<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.060> i<00:01:39.090> want<00:01:40.009> for<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.100> spine

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
effect and say that i want for the spine

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.330 
effect and say that i want for the spine
bone<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:42.000> effect<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.630> let's<00:01:43.229> say<00:01:43.530> thirty

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
bone to effect this let's say thirty

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.630 
bone to effect this let's say thirty
percent<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.240> i'll<00:01:45.329> put<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.570> in<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.780> point<00:01:46.079> three

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
percent so i'll put it in a point three

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.980 
percent so i'll put it in a point three
you<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.759> see<00:01:47.880> what<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.119> does<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.750> let's

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
you can see what that does and let's

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.420 
you can see what that does and let's
just<00:01:49.229> see<00:01:49.439> how<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.680> animates<00:01:51.079> not<00:01:52.079> too<00:01:52.380> bad<00:01:52.619> so

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
just see how it animates not too bad so

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.980 
just see how it animates not too bad so
it's<00:01:53.549> better<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:53.970> an<00:01:54.119> improvement<00:01:54.420> anyway

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
it's better it's an improvement anyway

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.410 
it's better it's an improvement anyway
and<00:01:55.470> there's<00:01:55.649> some<00:01:55.799> other<00:01:56.000> vertices<00:01:57.000> we<00:01:57.299> need

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
and there's some other vertices we need

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.260 
and there's some other vertices we need
to<00:01:57.509> get<00:01:57.659> on<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.990> inside<00:01:58.710> there<00:01:58.979> but<00:01:59.850> instead

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
to get on the inside there but instead

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.270 
to get on the inside there but instead
of<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.450> let's<00:02:01.170> just<00:02:01.290> deliver<00:02:01.950> more<00:02:02.159> with

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
of that let's just deliver more with

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:11.980 
of that let's just deliver more with
this<00:02:02.430> leg<00:02:03.020> let's<00:02:04.020> grab<00:02:06.860> these<00:02:07.860> vertices

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.190 

and<00:02:12.990> say<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.410> for<00:02:13.590> them<00:02:13.890> we<00:02:14.250> want<00:02:14.660> point<00:02:15.660> 1

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
and say it for them we want point 1

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.870 
and say it for them we want point 1
influence<00:02:16.920> via<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.670> spine<00:02:18.000> bone<00:02:18.240> so<00:02:19.880> common

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
influence via the spine bone so common

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:28.010 
influence via the spine bone so common
1.1<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:24.650> maybe<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:26.190> should<00:02:26.460> be<00:02:26.490> even<00:02:26.820> less<00:02:27.020> you

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
1.1 and maybe it should be even less you

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.020 
1.1 and maybe it should be even less you
know<00:02:28.140> again<00:02:28.500> it's<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.710> judgment<00:02:28.950> call<00:02:29.190> but<00:02:29.790> you

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
know again it's a judgment call but you

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.400 
know again it's a judgment call but you
can<00:02:30.210> see<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.420> we<00:02:30.660> can<00:02:30.690> control<00:02:31.290> these

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
can see that we can control these

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.700 
can see that we can control these
vertices<00:02:31.710> that<00:02:31.920> way<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:33.440> know<00:02:34.440> this

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
vertices that way and you know this

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.930 
vertices that way and you know this
sudden<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.100> takes<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.370> little<00:02:35.460> bit<00:02:35.610> of<00:02:35.670> time<00:02:35.880> but

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
sudden it takes a little bit of time but

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.730 
sudden it takes a little bit of time but
hopefully<00:02:36.450> gives<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.750> some<00:02:36.930> ideas<00:02:37.380> on<00:02:37.470> how<00:02:37.710> to

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
hopefully gives you some ideas on how to

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.850 
hopefully gives you some ideas on how to
use<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.670> weight<00:02:38.940> properties<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:40.170> i<00:02:40.680> think

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
use the weight properties and i think

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.710 
use the weight properties and i think
that<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.040> person<00:02:41.430> who<00:02:41.580> handed<00:02:42.240> this<00:02:42.330> off<00:02:42.570> to

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
that the person who handed this off to

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.260 
that the person who handed this off to
me<00:02:42.900> was<00:02:43.110> using<00:02:43.500> just<00:02:43.830> envelopes<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.240> i

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
me was using just envelopes and so i

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.750 
me was using just envelopes and so i
showed<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.540> in<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.810> last<00:02:45.900> section<00:02:46.700> how<00:02:47.700> you

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
showed you in the last section how you

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.390 
showed you in the last section how you
can<00:02:48.110> come<00:02:49.110> nullify<00:02:49.590> those<00:02:49.800> envelopes<00:02:50.130> and

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
can come nullify those envelopes and

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.430 
can come nullify those envelopes and
just<00:02:50.640> go<00:02:50.790> by<00:02:51.000> vertices<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:52.020> that's<00:02:52.200> another

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
just go by vertices and that's another

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.130 
just go by vertices and that's another
way<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.620> handle<00:02:53.010> this
