00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
more wet but I wanted to wait until I

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.620 
more wet but I wanted to wait until I
crinkled<00:01:57.430> it<00:01:57.520> so<00:01:57.729> that<00:01:57.909> it<00:01:58.060> will<00:01:58.149> blend<00:01:58.450> in

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
crinkled it so that it will blend in
